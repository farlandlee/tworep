a little project I did for a client to create a blazing fast searchable archive of 40+ years of newspaper reporting.  The project is built on the MERN stack.  It uses nodemailer to send contact us emails to the client.

to set up:

1. clone repo into its own directory.
2. cd into the directory
3. run `npm install`
4. cd into server
5. run `node index` to start the server
6. Open a new terminal window and..
7. cd into client
8. run `npm start` to start the client

9. You will need to set `REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY` to a valid recaptcha key in your .env for recaptcha to work.
