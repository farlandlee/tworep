        "ocr_text": "Carter's Campaign Still Being Audited By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — At the midpoint of Jimmy Carter’s term, auditors at the Federal Election Commission are still hard at work checking whether his campaign bookkeeping in 1976 was fair and square. “They are trying to finish the au- dit as quickly as possible, but they can’t set any firm date to get fin- ished,” said Fred Eiland, a commis- sion spokesman. Ronald Eastman, a lawyer who represents the Carter campaign staff, said, “We are as anxious to get it completed as they (the audi- rs) are.” Informed sources said that after prolonged negotiations, the Carter campaign is on the verge of agree- ing to repay about $10,000 to the U.S. Treasury for funds received as matching fund reimbursement dur- ing the 1976 primaries. The commis- sion contends the claimed expenses were not eligible for reimbursement. ey: the auditors had raised questions about $350,000 in undocu- mented expenses, the sources said. But over the last year, the sum has been pared down as the Carter staff found canceled checks, invoices and other documents to explain most of the questioned expenses. _ Much of the money was spent in Palm Beach Post - January 13, 1979 election day get-out-the-vote efforts in Maryland, California and other states. The initial Carter campaign reports listed lump-sum payments to local leaders, including some black ministers in California, with no indi- cation how the funds were spent. Although the Carter primary audit is virtually complete, the commis- sion auditors have a few more issues to resolve on the 1976 Carter general election campaign. One source predicted that within the next two months, the auditors will require the Carter campaign to repay the government an additional $20,000 for items which should not have been claimed as campaign expenses. The Carter campaign is not the only 1976 leftover on the commis- sion’s docket. Files on Morris Udall, Sargent Shriver George Wallace, and Fred Harris are also still open. However, audits on 10 other major presidential candidates, including Gerald Ford, were released last year. The major party candidates, Cart- er and Ford, received $21.8 million from the Treasury in 1976 to finance their general election campaigns. During the primaries, Carter re- ceived more than $3.7 million in government matching funds, the amount set by the volume of small contributions he attracted. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Taiwan Has Ingredients To Build 1 Atomic Bomb By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT JournalConstitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Taiwan, now an international outcast, has enough en- riched uranium left over from the U.S. Atoms for Peace program to build one atomic bomb if it chooses. And Taiwan's Institute of Nuclear Energy Research is operating a Cana- dian research reactor that is capable of generating enough plutonium for one nuclear weapon every six to 12 months. Even though Taiwan says that it has no plans to start a nuclear weapons program, some U.S. officials fear that there are signs of an internal debate in the Taiwanese government over whether to “go nuclear” in a desperate bid to prevent a Chinese invasion. “There are a lot of different noises coming out of Taiwan, and the mix is interesting,” said one U.S. intelligence source. Taiwan's nuclear potential is no sur- prise to the CIA, which declared in September 1974: “Taipei conducts its small nuclear program with a weapons option clearly in mind, and it will be in a position to fabricate a nuclear device after five years or so. Taipei’s role in the world is changing radically and concern over the possibility of com- plete isolation is mounting.” To build nuclear weapons, Taiwan would have to evade the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Ag- ency and break its commitments under See TAIWAN, Page 10-A Taiwan Continued From Page 1-A the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — both of which it said last month it will not do.

The files indicate that an earlier fuel loading of 154 pounds of medium-enriched uranium — containing 20 per- cent U-235 — was exported to the same university in the mid-1960s. The uranium has fueled a one-megawatt research reac- tor that the university bought from General Electric Co. in 1958 for $580,000.

Several hours earlier, the FBI arrested a tempo- rary employee at the General Electric nuclear fuel fabricating plant in Wilmington and charged him with trying to extort $100,000 from the plant manager, The suspect was identified as David L.

Dale Was described as a graduate of the University of Miami who served in the early 1960s in a U.S. Army Special Forces unit, THE STOLEN URANIUM was enriched to only to 2.6 percent — adequate for making fuel rods for nu- clear reactors but far below the enrichment necessary for making bombs. It was only mildly radioactive, On Monday, plant manager R. J. Alkema found an unsigned letter outside his office door. It demanded $100,000 in small bills for the return of two cans of Dayton Daily News - February 2, 1979 uranium, whose serial numbers were listed in the let- ter. The letter was accompanied by a vial of brownish powder that Alkema quickly recognized as a form of uranium processed in the plant, Officials said the letter threatened to mail samples of the uranium to newspaper editors, nuclear critics like Ralph Nader and public officials if the money was not paid by Feb. |. If General Electric still refused to pay, the letter writer threatened to disperse the uranium in one or two large American cities in an attempt to cause panic. No cities were named in the letter, PLANT SUPERVISORS immediately inventoried several thousand cans of uranium in the chemical processing buildings and warehouses but failed to find the two with serial numbers listed in the letter, A check of shipping documents indicated that the two cans had arrived at the plant. Dale was arrested at the plant by FBI agents Thursday afternoon, as the deadline approached, He was charged with extortion — a crime punishable by 20 years in the penitentiary —~ although he was not paid any money, About four hours later, agents found the missing cans of uranium in a ditch by a road, about five miles from the plant. DALE HAD WORKED AT THE plant for two months, reportedly working as a laboratory assistant While on the subcontractor’s payroll, Before that, he arene as a boat captain in Puerto Rico and the erland Antilles in the Caribbean, Joseph Hendrie, chairman of the Nuclear Regula- Commission, said the plant is not required to keep lgw-enriched uranium in vaults because it is incapable being fashioned into a bomb.

        "ocr_text": "Crude Oijil is Dirt Cheap at Well, g the Difference? So Who’s Gettin © The writer recently returned to after two weeks of reporting in the Arabian peninsula. By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washingion Bureau DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia — Here at the edge of the lushest oil fields on earth, it costs about half a penny to produce enough crude oil to make one gallon of gasoline. Halfway around the world in America, one gallon of regular at a full-service station costs about 70 cents a gallon — a 13,900 percent increase. Who gets the 69.5-cent difference? The search for an answer begins here at Dammam Well No. 7, a disappoint- ingly modest structure which looks like a few sewer pipes looping out of the ground. It is the first well that struck oil in Saudi Arabia, back in 1938. Forty-one years later, oil is still flowing out at 1,000 barrels a day. Dammam No: 7 revealed the existence ‘of a 150-foot oil layer about 4,500 feet below the desert. By following the geo- logical trend from this first well, the western oil prospectors ‘moved ‘both in- land and offshore in the Persian Gulf, finding such fabulous pools of easily recoverable oil that the world enjoyed two generations of cheap energy. Once it rises to the surface, Saudi oil is stripped of its dissolved natural gas and then piped 100 miles to a gigantic tank farm at the coastal port of Ras Ta- nura. There it is measured for royalty Payments to the Saudi government and pumped into supertankers. Petromin, the Saudi petroleum mar- keting agency, last month was selling its oil at about $13.38 a barrel. This was about 19 cents a barrel above the official OPEC posted price, but a bargain com- pared to the short-term “spot” prices charged by Libya and some _ other producers. Nearly all this money flows to the Saudi government, either in taxes and royalties, or in the form of earnings Plowed back into future Saudi oil and gas operations. Aramco, the Western consortium which held the original Saudi oil conces- sions, still operates the fields under a management contract. The Saudi govern- ment took over 60 percent ownership of Aramco in 1974. The four original partners — Exxon, Texaco, Mobil and Standard Oil of Cali- fornia — still technically share the re- maining 40 percent. But they apparently get little profit out of the arrangement, beyond the opportunity to buy Saudi oil at world prices. Of the $13.38 a barrel, it costs Aramco only about 25 cents a barrel to lift the oil and pipe it to Ras Tanura. , Aramco’s most important expense is Why One Galion Of Regular Gasoline Cost Foe At The Full-Service aler Markup (Costs Seow Pump Last Month: for maintaining pressure on its oil reser- voirs by forcing large volumes of natural gas and water into nearby geological layers. This pressure keeps the oil flow- ing year after year, without a need for rocker-arm pumps. (In America, where oil doesn’t flow as freely, it may cost several dollars a barrel to produce.) From each barrel’s revenues another slice goes back for drilling new wells to replace those which are gradually de- pleted. Still another portien goes toward development of a $12 billion system of Pipelines and plants to process the several billion cubic feet of natural gas en are now being burned off each y- See COST, Page 3-A Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 11, 1979 \fCost Continued From Page ‘ By far the largest share of the oil revenue ~ more than $10 a barrel ~ goes into expensive government con: Struction projects and social programs for Saudi citizens, Who pay no income taxes, A barrel of oil contains 42 gallons. It is a matter of sim- ple long division to figure out that at $13.38 a barrel, a gal lon of oil costs Exxon about 82 cents at Ras Tanura, And for every extra dollar OPEC adds to the price of a barrel, one gallon of crude oil is 25 cents more expensive, It takes about 35 days to move a supertanker full of crude from Ras Tanura to the Gulf of Mexico, With Iranian production cut off, tankers are cheap to charter, On the London tanker market, the latest quotations are running about $1 a barrel for delivery from the Persian Gulf to the Texas Gulf But some tanker owners are sd desperate that they will make runs for less, In a restaurant in Bahrain re: cently, one German agent for a 300,000-ton —supertanker said he could cover his mini- mum operating costs and “interest for 40 cents a barrel Even at the higher pube lished rates, oil was reaching Exxon refineries in Texas early this month at a cost of en 44 cents a bar- rel, A refinery looks like a Rube Goldberg space station, As oil enters a fractional: ing tower at 700 degrees, the heavier hydrocarbon mole- cules sink toward the bottom and the lighter molecules rise to the top. At various levels of the tower, “fractions” of the oil are condensed out ac- cording to their weight - some to become propane, some gasoline, some jet fue, some heating il After the fractions have been distilled, some of the heavy molecules are chemis cally “cracked” in a catalytic cracking unit. When all the components are separated, gasoline is formed by blend: ing about a dozen napthas, pentanes and other oil frac: tions, (ut of a 42-gallon barrel of Arabian oil, a sophisticated refinery usually makes about 21 gallons of gasoline, ‘The yield also includes about 3 gallons of kerosene, 11 gal: lons of home heating oil and ther distillates and 7 gallons of wax, asphalt and heavy residual fuel oil It costs about 6 cents to re- fine a gallon of regular gaso- line, judging from studies by Oil and Gas Journal, amar y costs about 1 to 1% cents a gallon more, To achieve high octane without using lead additives, the refiners must rerun their product through the catalytic crackers and reforming units — a process which requires much more heat, and thus more fuel, On top of this, a major oil company will spend about a nickel per gallon on market: ing, and another penny on storage, insurance and other assorted costs, In addition, the company Which imported and refined the oil will earn about 3 cents a gallon in profits - about 4 percent of the final cost of the gasoline When all this is added up, it comes to 49 cents a gallon, Yet, the actual wholesale price of gasoline is about 3 cents lower. As of Feb, 26, refineries were selling gaso- line to bulk distributors in the Atlanta area at 45 to 47 cents a gallon, according to trade sources, Refiners of foreign oil can sell gasoline below its real costs because they receive a Scent “entitlement benefit” - under the federal oil price control system, The price a gasoline station owner pays for gasoline — the so-called “tank wagon price” — is about 25 cents higher than the wholesale price at the refinery, The dif: ference is for pipeline trans- portation and profit for dis- tributors. The next big cost is federal, state and local excise taxes — a total of 12.5 cents or higher, depending on the locality. Finally, there is the gas station owner's markup, which may vary considerably, According to Department of Energy figures for 1977, the markup per gallon at a typi: cal full-service gasoline sta- tion was 8.3 cents for regular, 9.6 cents for unleaded and 10.1 cents for premium, At a typical self-service pump, the Energy Depart: ment found markups of 4.3 cents per gallon for regular, 6.5 cents for unleaded and 7.3 cents for premium, Today, the price of a gallon of regular is around 70 cents, By the end of next year, chances are that regular will be at least 85 cents a gallon, and unleaded premium may have hit §1.

        "ocr_text": "200,000 might evacuate By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers WASHINGTON — Federal offi- cials said Saturday it may soon be prudent to evacuate up to 200,000 persons near the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear power plant be- fore attempting to eliminate an in- creasing dangerous gas bubble in- side the reactor. : Joseph Hendrie, chairman of the Nuclear, Regulatory, Commission, told a press conference Saturday that the reactor near Harrisburg “remains in a stable configuration,” but he said that pressure inside the plant’s cooling system — 1,000 pounds — was too high for comfort. “‘It is mot a situation that we would intend to hold for too many days,”’ said Hendrei. ‘We do need to get the gas bubbie out of the reactor pressure vessel.”’ 200,000 might Continued from Page 1-A. wind on the day of the planned reactor rescuewould determine the number of persons to be evacuated, Hendrie said. “It would be pretty unlikely” that residents as far away as Washington would have to be evacuated, he said. Washington is about 100 miles south of the plant. If the gas bubble is safely dissi- pated, most residents would be able to return to their homes in a day or so. However, it appeared that the current evacuation of pregnant women and small children from a five-mile circle around the plant would have to remain in effect for sometime longer, until the plant was fully cooled and depressurized. Bryan Grimes, an NRC radiation ? expert, said that the evacuation zone might include as many as “a couple of hundred thousand people,” depending on the wind direction. LEGALLY, ANY evacuation would have to be ordered by Penn- sylvania governor Richard Thorn- burgh, but in practice Thornburgh would almost certainly have to fol- low the NRC's advice. On Friday night, Thornburgh temporarily dampened fears of a full-scale evacuation and its attendant looting and chaos, saying “no evacuation order is necessary at this time.” In some ways, the situation at Three Mile Island was improving Saturday. Temperatures inside the reactor core were dropping. Some . radioactive gases were still venting intermittently into the atmospheres, but readings around the plant were even lower than in previous days. Also, a chemical analysis by a gov- ernment laboratory in Idaho strongly indicated that none of the damaged fuel rods had so far melted. THE TROUBLE, he said, is that all choices for dissipating the trapped bubble of high-pressure hydrogen, oxygen, xenon and steam carry “uncertain elements” — including at worst, the chance of a melt-down of the 100-ton nuclear reactor core. Federal officials said Saturday night that the gas bubble inside the crippled nuclear reactor is showing signs of becoming potentially explo- sive, complicating decisions on whether to mount risky operations to remove the gas. The NRC said Saturday night that it might be equally risky not to try the operation, because the bubble showed signs of gradually turning into a potentially explosive mixture that could wreck the already dam- aged reactor. \\ One NRC source, who asked not to be identified, said that critical point could be reached within two days. AN EXPLOSION could release radioactive materials into the atmosphere or, at worst, cause the reactor core to melt, releasing even greater radioactivity. An evacuation would be ‘‘a fairly traumatic experience,” Hendrie said. out to be a prudent p several tricky proceedures aimed at ending the crisis. A plan is under consideration to force the bubble from the reactor through pipes to an adjacent build- ing, which is being surrounded by lead bricks. Lead serves as a radio- active shield. However, officials gave no estimate as to when that maneuver might be attempted. SHOULD AN evacuation be neces- sary, Hendrie said, it probably will be ordered in a pie-shaped quadrant extending 10-20 miles downwind Nevertheless, he said, “it may turn from the plant. The direction of the evacuate ‘risk’ area around nuclear plant WHAT CONTINUED to trouble NRC officials was the presence of: the massive bubble of gas trapped at the top of the 37-foot-tall pressur- ized vessel that houses the reactor and its crippled cooling system. Officials said ‘‘a large fraction” of the bubble consists of hydrogen — the gas which caused the explosion of the dirigible Hindenburg in 1938 at Lakehurst, N.J. The hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel shortly after the initial accident when zurconium, the metal used to surround the uranium fuel, reacted chemically -with super-heated water from the cooling system. As the zur- conium oxidized, hydrogen was released. By itself, the hydrogen is not explosive but, according to NRC officials, oxygen is now being gradually added to the mixture. This is occuring as cooling water in the bottom of the reactor vessel is being broken into its components — oxy- gen and hydrogen — as a result of high radiation levels. NRC OFFICIALS said there is fortunately no source of flame or sparks near the gas bubble. Another hopeful factor is that the gas bubble is ‘*wet” with steam. However, as the oxygen content of the mixture rises, NRC officials said they could not rule out the possibility of a spontaneous combus- tion explosion. Edson Case, deputy NRC director for.nuclear reactor regulation, said, “If you have an explosion in the containment vessel, I don’t have to paint a picture for you for what could possibly happen. You could have a core melt-down if you lose the cooling (system for the core).” CASE SAID THE NRC is now weighing the risks and advantages of three possible methods of dealing with the gas bubble: - * Continued very slow cooling by present methods, hoping to “de-gas” the reactor mainly through a one- inch vent line. ® Quickly depressurizing the reac- All three methods aim to transfer the hydrogen from the reactor ves- sel into the much larger contain- ment structure, a 190-foot cylindri- cal tower. designed to withstand all possible nuclear accidents.

The spokesman said the 1977 incidents were reported to the NRC but not publicly announced because they were “non-events.” A SPOKESMAN for Babcock & Wilcox Co., which manufactured both reactors, declined to comment Tuesday. The first indication of similarities between the Davis Besse and Three Mile Island incidents came Sunday in a warning bulletin from the NRC to operators of the seven remaining Babcock & Wilcox power plants. As part of their precautions, plant officials were ordered to review a January 1979 memo by NRC inspec: tor J.S. Creswell. It pointed out a have also been a sticky valve on the pressurizer at Three Mile River. deficiency at Davis Besse in the of “feedwater” while generating at study pointed out that the core “pressurizer” — an auxiliary tank designed to sustain pressures in the reactor cooling system even when the water temperatures change, The Creswell memo said that on November 29, 1977, a power failure near the Davis Besse plant led to a temporary loss of the “feedwater” system — the water loop which drives the turbines. , the level of water in that plant’s pri- mary cooling system also dropped, risking heat-damage to the tops of the uranium fuel rods, The drop was noticed when the water level fell below the pressurizer, “THERE ARE SOME indications that other B&W plants may have problems maintaining pressurizer level indications during transients,” Creswell wrote, He also warned that if a reactor suffered a full loss full power, “the pressurizer may void completely,” When Creswell first raised the point last December, his superiors in the Chicago regional office of NRC ordered Davis Besse — then shut for maintenance — to remain inactive pending a new safety study, The study, completed in only three days, found that if Davis Besse lost its feedwater, there was indeed a possibility that “small voids\" would form throughout the primary reac- tor cooling system. (A “void” is a bubble.) But the study concluded that these voids would not result in the loss of core cooling “because the voids would be dispersed over a large volume.” AND AS AN ultimate failsafe, the would always be protected by an emergency cooling system that was automatically set to spray water on the core whenever the water pres sure dropped. On the basis of this study, officials of the Chicago and Washington of- fices agreed in a conference call last Dec. 23 to permit Davis Besse to re- sume operations, Streeter, who took part in that decision, said Tuesday that there is “a great deal of similarity” beween the hypothetical Davis Besse case - analyzed last December and what actually happened at Three Mile Is- land, At Three Mile Island, the trouble evidently began when a feedwater pump kicked off.

That is one-tenth of a gallon less than a typical vehicle used last year. To meet the extra tenth-of-a- gallon demand by each of the nation’s 120 million cars and 40 million other vehicles, refineries have been forced to draw down on their inventories.

That is only part of the problem. To meet the de-| mand for heating oil next winter, the refineries at the same time have to build up their heating oil invento- ries by 7 million barrels a week until they reach the necessary level of 240 million barrels barrels by Oct. 1. In the last few weeks, heating oil inventories have been increasing, but only by about 2 million barrels a week. If the heating oil inventories don’t begin building faster, the federal Energy Department has indicated it will force the refineries to alter their processing mix so that they turn out more gallons of heating oil from each barrel of crude oil. BY PRESSING SOME buttons in the control room, operators of a modern refinery can easily wring another two gallons of heating oil out of each 42-gal- lon barrel of crude. But in doing so, they. would lower the gasoline yield by about two gallons per barrel. Some gasoline experts say the only way to rebuild the stockpiles of gasoline and heating oil simuitane- ously is to imcrease crude oil “runs” through the refin- eries by 1.5 million barrels a day — half a million barrels more than would be needed just to replenish gasoline stocks. Tank-topping can certainly aggravate the prob- lem. If drivers collectively decide to run their cars at three-quarters full instead of half-full, the refinery inventories will experience a one-time drop equivalent to atwo-day supply. To keep their cars full, drivers will have to make twice as many gas station visits. That is part of the explanation for the gas lines in California. BUT IT IS ALSO becoming clear the West Coast gas shortage was not simply caused by herd psychol- ogy, important as that was. Among the other factors which emerge from industry and government statis- tics: © New car registrations were up by about & per- cent in California last year, compared to about | per- cent nationally. This suggests there were more cars on the read, quite possibly reflecting a population in- crease that has not yet been measured by the Census Bureau.

Another major purchaser of Elk Hills oil is Pacific Refining Co. of Hercules, Cal., which is owned by the Texas-based Coastal States Gas Corp. Unlike most other unsophisti- cated refineries which purchase government oil, this one is medium- sized instead of tiny. Thus it re- ceives no small refiners’ subsidy. Robert Wells, a Coastal States vice president, said heavy “resid” fuel is the plant’s major product. He declined to say how much gasoline or diesel fuel is made in the refin- ery, citing “competitive reasons.” “We buy the oil,” Wells explained. “It’s ours when we get it. There is nothing in the undertaking that re- quires us to tell us what we do with it. We are not pouring anything down the drain. There is.a market for everything that we produce.” Residual fuel oil is by no means a waste product. Low sulphur “resid” is in heavy demand to fuel utility and industrial boilers — particularly in the Northeast, where some has to be imported. But compared to gasoline, diesel oil, jet fuel and other refinery prod- ucts, “resid” is a surplus commodity. The American Petro- leum Institute reported last week that while gasoline and diesel fuel stocks are down, the nation’s “re- sid” supply has actually increased by 4 percent since a year ago.

        "ocr_text": " Journal Washington Bureau CHEYENNE, Wyo, — In the game of buying and selling federal oil leases, Atlanta oil man John H. Clifton is not in the same league as the Wolf broth- ers. But he has done all right. “T think it is the most fantastic sys- tem in the world to encourage energy development,” Clifton said. He runs a filing service in Atlanta for clients hoping to win federal oil leases in the government's monthly lease lotteries. Along with his clients’ cards, Clifton also enters each month under his own . name, Three years ago, he won a acre for it. royalty. In Search for Oil, Lease Shall Be First 1,080-acre tract in Uinta County, Wyo., just north of the Church Buttes gas field. He paid the government §1 an “Tam not a geologist or a pe- troleum engineer, but I know that’s $100-an-acre country,” he said. And he was right. In 1977, he sold the tract to Mountain States Fuel for $100 an acre, plus a 6.25 percent “T wouldn't spend my money to drill anything like this,” he explained. “You would have to go too deep.” As it happened, Mountain States Fuel did drill a well, and it hit. It is . not yet producing, Clifton said, be- cause Mountain States hasn’t obtained its pipeline connection. ' Clifton says his activities cause others to drill wells, even if he doesn’t drill them himself. Clifton said other lease filing serv- ices around the country charge their clients surcharges ranging from $5 to. $40 for filing cards in the monthly government drawings, His surcharge, he said, is “in the middle of that range.” checking with the bureau's area office in Rock Springs, Wyo. Following standard routine as she did for thousands of other leases, she did not refer the decision to Washington, or even her superior, the state Bureau of Land Management director. As was standard in all cases, Mrs, Lane rubber-stamped one potentially significant stipulation on the leases. They would become effective only after the U.S. Geological Survey — a separate branch of the Interior Department — certified that the land was not within the boundaries of a “known geological structure of a producing oil and gas field.” . The land the Wolfs sought was sagebrush-covered hills and arid valleys in southwest Wyoming, near the path the Mormons took to Utah in 1848. The area has naturally occurring oil springs that pioneers on the Overland Trail used for axle rease, : The nearby terrain had been explored for oil as early as 184, but most wells were dry. Even so, some geologists in the Denver office of the U.S. Geological Survey were arguing by 1970 that the area, which was known as the Overthrust Belt, had great oil and gas potential. Other federal geologists were dubious, The optimists in the Geological Survey were bolstered in the spring of 1972 when they heard that Occidental Petroleum had found promising oi) “shows” in a commercially unisuccess- ful well in nearby Pineview, Utah. ; No matter how strong their suspicions about the area's potential, the leasing law was clear: Geological Survey officials could not insist that these tracts go up for competitive bidding unless they could certify that they were within a known produc- ing field. They were not. The land was officially leased to Melvin Wolf on July 1, 1972, and a few weeks later he assigned half interest to Mar- vin. The Wolfs paid the federal government a $10 filing fee for each of the 4 tracts, plus a first-year rental payment, which was then only 50 cents an acre, The total bill came to $50,436. Records on file in the Uinta County, Wyo. courthouse show the Wolfs also acquired drilling leases to several thousand: acres of nearby state-owned lands, including one parcel beneath a state insane asylum. Marvin Wolf said the area was a “rank wildcat play” when he and his brother decided to buy up the leases. He said he acted on his own familiarity with the area as well as the hunch of Robert McDonald, a petroleum geologist then working: for Wolf Energy. __ Wolf considers himself an independent oil producer, but he Said he does not drill wells of his own because it is too expen- sive. “T don’t like to hire engineers because I can’t make as: much money that way,” he said, Instead, Wolf said, his company acquires leases and makes surface geological studies, thus encouraging others to drill. “Without sometimes having a middleman involved, a lot of: things wouldn’t get done,” he said. He said he holds about 450,000 acres of federal oil and pas leases, mostly in Utah and New Mexico, Only about 15,000 acres of his present land inventory is in Wyoming, he said. In the fall of 1972, Chevron's exploration department in Deriver decided that it, too, liked the prospects of southwestern Wyoming. When 4 Chevron land man checked the Bureau of Land Management plat books in Cheyenne, he found the Wolfs had beaten Chevron to the filing office. So Chevron approached Wolf and they struck a deal.

        "ocr_text": "Warning signal went unheeded, By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — At 10 a.m, June 2, a Mexican drilling crew was nearing the bot- om of its planned wildcat well in the Gulf of Campeche when someone noticed a “fluid return failure.” . It was a Warning, Something was happen- ing at the bottom of the 1 Ixtoc well that Was interfering with the flow of the drilling “mud” — any driller’s crucial first line of defense against a blowout. PERMARGO, THE Mexico City drilling contractor, had the next 14 hours to grasp the problem and solve it. Sadly, no one on the semi-submersible drilling platform thought the problem was serious enough to activate the mechanical “blowout pre: venter” on the ocean bottom, Perhaps no one could have known. That, from a variety of Mexican and American sources, is what happened the day before the blowout that has caused the world’s worst oil slick. At one point on July 3, teams of divers guided by a camera-carrying miniature submarine managed to cut off the oil flow. But then, to everyone's surprise, the oil burst out below the blowout preventer valves, The story starts with drilling mud, a heavy brown mixture of clay and diesel cil, As the well bit sinks down through rock layers, this mud is pumped down through the Inner 2sinch steel well tubing and back up the well’s 7-inch outer casing, ASIDE FROM lubricating and cooling, drilling mud provides the weight to hold down the tremendous pressure of an untap- ped oil reservoir, In deep wells where the highest pressures are anticipated, drillers sometimes use mud weighing up to 18 pounds per gallon, It is unclear what interfered with 1 Ixtoc’s mud on June 2, Possibly there was a leak in the pipes. Possibly the drill bit hit a low- pressure pocket, allowing the mud simply to flow out at the bottom of the hole. What happened, in any case, is that the men on the platform tried some routine repairs, And four hours later, the drilling crew reported that the “fluid return failure” had been fixed. Early on Sunday, June 3, 1 Ixtoc blew out with a roar. A mixture of hot oil and gas spewed up through 160 feet of seawater to the surface, Escaping gas then burst into flames when it touched hot pumping equip- ment on the $23 million drilling rig, which Permargo had obtained on a bare-boat char- ter from Sedco of Dallas. PEMEX, THE Mexican national oil company, said the blowout was caused by a loss of drilling mud which occurred while the crew was attempting to remove the inner drill tubing and bit from the hole. The cause of this second loss of drilling mud remains unexplained, See OIL, Page 11. Oil blowout baffles U.S., Mexican drilling experts Continued from Page 1. A well’s second line of defense is the blowout pre- venter, a cylindrical iron monster, often 20 feet tall, consisting of redundant shutoff valves designed to cut the flow of oil at a moment’s notice. One valve is a tough inflatable bag. Another is the “‘blind ram,” two powerful jaws which can crimp the steel well piping like a nutcracker. For 1 Ixtoc, the blowout preventer had been in- stalled in a perfectly normal position, on the seabottom just where the drill bit entered the ocean fioor. But when it was needed, it failed. . “What we don’t understand is why the blowout preventer didn’t work,” says Robert Burke, editor of the trade journal Offshore. ON WEDNESDAY, June 6, the telephone rang in the Houston office of Martech International, a leading submersible technology firm. At midnight of that day, Martech loaded its 500-pound mini-submarine on a Pemex airplane. The submarine and its Martech han- diers flew through the night to Ciudad de! Carmen, Mexico, and by noon the next day it was at the blow- out scene. A Mexican diving contractor had sent human divers down to the ocean floor. But oil was making the water murky and sections of pipe were littered all over like pickup-sticks. So the divers could not find the exact point where the oil was gushing. The submarine, a box-shaped open frame device nicknamed TREC, solved that one. But it was not easy. TREC operates by remote control, using TV cameras and cables, To maneuver TREC to the spot right, eight Martech technicians had to winch the bow of their barge, Able Turtle, right into the edge of the flames from the blowout. AFTER TWO DAYS of nervous searching, TREC’s cameras homed in on the blowout preventer, which was still intact. Its handlers parked the sub against the wellhead at midnight June 9th. Early the next day Mexican divers were able to follow a rope down to make a personal inspection of the oil blowing out of the top of the blowout pre- venter. At one point, TREC got too close to the funnel- shaped black oil spurt and was blasted upward to the ocean's surface. In the meantime, crews on the barges still have the hoses connected to the **kill” and “choke” valves of the blowout preventer. They have managed to cut the flow of 1 Ixtoc slightly by blowing steel marbles and heavy mud down the hoses and into the blowout preventer. The hope is that the marbles will spin around and interfere with the oil flow. Dayton Daily News - August 7, 1979 \f"

        "ocr_text": "The Dome’s dregs Rusty pumps bring up oil that’s higher than OPEC’s JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cex Washingsten Bureau Teapot Dome, Wyo. — With a West Texas twang and a degree in petroleum engineering, Jim Watson sounds like any oil-field boss. Except that Watson is a lieutenant commander in the Navy. and his oil field be- longs to the taxpayers. “We sell our light sweet crude at $27.10 a barrel now,”’ says Watson. *“*‘That doesn’t make a lot of our meighbors happy.” Watson runs the Teapot Dome Naval Petroleum Re- serve, the one place in the country where the govern- ment is selling the public’s oil for higher than OPEC prices. After giving its name to the premier oil scandal of the 1920s, the Teapot Dome reserve was shut down and almost deserted for 50 years. Then, three years ago, Congress decided to spend taxpayers” money to crank up the rusting old wells and to drill new wells too. The objective in reopening this and another naval reserve in Elk Hillis, Calif.,. was not to put the govern- ment in the oil business. All Congress wanted was to increase domestic oil production and generate some revenue to pay for the purchase of imported oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana. In fact, Watson’s operation here amounts to a tiny government oil company in everything but its name. The output from Teapot Dome — only 5.500 barrels a day — is so small that it would satisfy only 2 per cent of the petroleum needs of Florida. But the government has plans to quadruple the production over the next three or four years by investing in an expensive ‘“‘en- hanced recovery” system. To squeeze out those 5,500 barrels, the Department of Energy's naval petroleum office has invested mil- lions more than any private oil company could have justified. In fact, oil men in Casper, Wyo., often de- nounce this operation as a gold-plated boondoggle. Private oil operators usually drill no more than one well for every 40 acres of a producing field. Here the 407 producing wells are lined up like midshipmen, as if their rocker arms were saluting. To pump the field’s shallow oil zone, there is one well for every 10 acres, interspersed with one well for every 20 acres to tap the deeper oil layers. That is not the end of the proposed drilling. As part of its plan to enhance recovery by injecting soapy chemicals into the oil reservoirs, the government in- tends to drill several hundred more shallow wells and cut the spacing to one pumper for every 2.5 acres. There are even more radical plans afoot. Watson also oversees a long-dormant naval oil-shale reserve south of Vernal, Utah. The Department of Energy now believes this 90,000-acre government-owned tract may contain natural gas and conventional oil. To find out, the government does not intend to fol- low its normal practice of leasing the territory to pri- vate oil companies in exchange for a royalty on what- ever oil is found. The plan instead is for the Depart- ment of Energy to contract out the exploratory drilling, starting with a $5.5 million budget for two wells next ear. % Like some other government programs, Teapot Dome has fallen short of expectations. Back in 1977. Watson’s predecessor, Commander Eric Wilson, said the Navy might be producing 20,000 barrels a day at Teapot Dome by 1980. That goal was shaved to about 15,000 by 1983 when it became clear that the reser- voirs here are not quite so prolific as the Navy thought. Finding oil under this 9,500-acre expanse of sage- brush and prickly pears is not much of a challenge. But the flow from each well is miniscule because pressure in the underground reservoirs was allowed to deplete in the 1920s. Many of Watson's wells yield only two or three barrels a day. “We brought in a pretty good producer last week,’” he tells a visitor. “It might make 40 or 50 barrels a day. (In the Gulf of Mexico, a 40-barrel-a-day well is considered too paltry to operate.) Most of the oil from Teapot Dome has a jade-green hue. It is free of sulphur and very light, so it is ideal for making gasoline. Harry Sinclair after his 1929 prison release Scandal tainted Teapot’s crude Cox Mews Service TEAPOT DOME, Wyo. — Back in 1908, they hit the famous Salt Creek gusher just north of here. So much oil slopped out into a catch basin that the backers offered to donate 100,000 barrels to the town of Casper “‘or anyone else who would haul it away.” Seven years later, President Wilson moved to set aside the southern part of the Salt Creek field as a reserve to insure enough oil for the Navy’s new diesel-burning fleet. The section was called Teapot Dome, teapot-shaped rock outcropping nearby. In withdrawing this government-owned range- land from private drillers, Wilson was siding with Theodore Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot and others in the conservation movement who had popularized the notion that the government should hold public- ly-owned resources for future generations. Albert Fall had other ideas. After becoming President Harding’s Interior Secretary in 1921, he got Harding to sign an executive order transferring control of the petroleum reserve from the Navy to the Interior Department. Then in April 1922, Fall leased Teapot Dome to the Mammoth Oil Company, owned by Harry Sin- clair, the founder of Sinclair Oil. Fall said the prop- erty had to be developed promptly to avoid drain- age of the public’s oil by the adjacent privately owned oil fields. Mammoth drilled the first successful Teapot Dome well in late 1922, and within five years it was pumping as much as 28,000 barrels a day from 65 wells. Sinclair’s luck did not hold. In 1927, after a sim- mering congressional inquiry and a court fight, the U.S. Supreme Court voided the leases as fraudulent. The court ordered Teapot Dome returned to the Navy, which soon ordered the pumping to cease. In 1928, a Senate investigating committee found the “smoking gun” of the Teapot Dome scandal. In Fall’s investment portfolio were some Liberty bonds that had once belonged to Sinclair. Fall was tried and found guilty of accepting the bonds as a bribe. He was fined $100,000 and served nine months and 19 days in jail. Sinclair was im- Prisoned for six months for refusing to testify- Fall died in 1944, after contending that Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor had vindicated his leasing policy. During the war the Navy did consider re- storing the old Mammoth wells to production, but decided their contribution to the war effort would not be worth the manpower and money. after a The government runs this field as if it were a cost- Plus defense contract. Watson’s job is to oversee a Tulsa engineering firm, Fenix and Scisson Inc., which operates the field under an annual contract. Watson wears work boots and a sports shirt. but he retains his Navy rank while on loan to the Department of Energy. Eighteen years ago, he left Matador, Tex., and joined the Navy after finishing Texas Tech and discov- ering that the oil companies were overstocked with pe- troleum engineers. His Teapot Dome assignment is the first time the Navy has used his oil background. The government sells the oil through a system of sealed bidding. For this year’s oil from Teapot Dome, the high bid was 60 cents a barrel above the highest posted price for uncontrolled oil from small private “stripper’’ wells. Because of oddities in the complex oil price control system, bidders offer more for a barrel here than California refineries are willing to pay for the output of the government's larger naval oil reserve at Elk Hills, Calif. Since January, the price of Teapot Dome oil has risen from about $16 to $27.10 a barrel. with no end in sight. (Elk Hills light oil now fetches $20.90 a barrel. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is charging about $18 a barrel.) One neighbor with little reason to be happy about this is Amoco, the operator of the Salt Creek oil field just north of Teapot Dome. Aside from the oil industry’s traditional abhorrence of government-owned oil operations, Amoco must transport Teapot Dome oil to Casper in an Amoco pipe- line Much of Amoco’s own oil in the pipeline is regulat- ed as “lower tier” oil,.which means it must be sold for 36 a barrel until prices are decontrolled_ Watson figures it costs the government $2.10 a bar- é We broughtina pretty good producer last week. he telisa visitor. It might make 40 or50 barre!lsa day. Inthe Gulf of Mexico, a 4O-barrel-a-day wellis considered too paltry to operate. y rel in operating costs to produce oil at Teapot Dome. That doesn't count the capital costs of drilling new wells, which should add another several dollars a bar- rel over the remaining life of the field. Last fiscal year, the government lost money at Tea- pot Dome, collecting only $11 million in revenues while spending $24 million on drilling and operating. This year, higher oil prices and the flow from the new wells will give the Treasury a $15 million positive cash flow, or profit. Next year the profit here should swell to $40 million. - ‘Watson keeps on his desk an old metal tag stamped Mammoth Oil Company” that he found in the field. It is a reminder that some of his most productive wells were drilled 50 years ago when Mammoth Oil, an off- shoot of Sinclair Oil, had this field under lease. Not much was heard from Sinclair Oil until this year, when the company outbid its competitors for the right to purchase all the oil from Teapot Dome. “It's Kind of ironic,\"\" says Watson. “After 50 years, we are back to selling to Sinclair.”* This time, when Sinclair is paying the government $27.10 a barrel, Congress is not likely to complain.

These ve trends iepuoth tajee Ag boll bist Oe eae frequently contain between discoveries, unpro- ductive or undrilled federal lands surround these trends, and most of the Chevron leases . . . fall into this category.” A Chevron spokesman subsequently confirmed that last February the company's Denver office sent the Interior Depart- ment a development plan for Painter Reservoir, showing that the field would yield a 245 percent annual rate of return on a cash flow basis, That would be about 15 times greater than the oil industry's overall profit last year. Four months ago, another Chevron executive, Thomas Russell, told Cox Newspapers that the Painter Reservoir field would produce a profit of 28 percent to 45 percent. Last week, the Chevron spokesman said Russell's lower figures were more “realistic” than the one Chevron submitted to the government. The spokesman said the 245 percent profit estimate should be adjusted downward to reflect Chevron’s risk of drilling dry holes in other fields, as well as some impending large invest- ments to build a gas processing plant. Most of the federal land in the Overthrust was unclaimed before American Quasar struck oil in early 1974 on a sheep ranch in Pineview, Utah. That find, disclosed in 1975, set off a rush of leasing of federal, state and private lands for hundreds of miles to the north, Some of this federal land is scattered in a checkerboard eink] among state and private holdings. Elsewhere, the federal tracts are in large national forests. Brokers and oil company land men filed applications for thousands of unclaimed federal tracts, paying the government only a $10 filing fee for each one and an annual rental of 50 cents to $1 an acre, These leases were issued without competi- tive bidding, under the terms of the Mineral Leasing Act. By 1977, nearly all the unclaimed tracts had been leased, effectively blocking latecomers from drilling in the Overthrust. William Lefler, an official of Mesa Petroleum, which has only a minor stake in the Overthrust, said, “It may require many years of waiting for critical leases to expire before a drillable block is assembled.” Today’s 19 leading leaseholders applied for some of the tracts themselves and bought others from brokers or individu- als who had picked up scattered parcels in the government's lease lottery. All these leases run for at least 10 years, A company can get an automatic two-year extension by sinking a drill bit as late as the last day of the lease. A two-year extension also can be obtained by pooling a group of leases into a drilling unit. If oil or gas is found in commercial quantities, the lease is y extended, even if the well is kept off production ‘or several years, Under a standard provision in all federal oil and gas leases, the Interior Department can order lease holders to drill “such wells . . . as the secretary of Interior may reasonably require in order that the leased premises may be properly and timely developed in accordance with good operating practice,” However, no Interior secretary, including incumbent Cecil Andrus, has ever ordered a leaseholder to drill a wildcat well.

        "ocr_text": "Oil bonanza hopes clouded by ice threat By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service PRUDHOE BAY, Alaska — America’s best chance for a huge offshore oil strike is threatened by the discovery that a dangerous ice alley called the “shear zone” can run through the Arctic waters which the government plans to lease. Ice Scientists who made this unex- pected observation in the Beaufort Sea last winter are pressing to limit the lease sale to a 42-foot water depth, in order to minimize the risk of a Mexican-style oil well blowout. Meanwhile, the 3,500 Inupiat Eskimos, worried about preserving their whaling lifestyle, are mobiliz- ing their home rule powers to re- strict drilling to even shallower “waters. BUT IN THE LAST two weeks na- ture has contrived to increase the prizes along with the penalties. In the Canadian side of the Beaufort Sea, 300 miles to the east, Dome Pe- troleum Ltd.'s new Kopanoar M-13 well has revealed one of the largest oil pools in North America, The American Beafort Sea lease sale, tentatively planned for Dec. 11, now looms as one of the decade's highest-stakes tugs between energy needs and environmental risks. “T'd say there is about a 30 percent chance that we will find 10 billion barrels of recoverable oil if we get to explore all these leases,” said the western exploration manager of a Star locates Beaufort Sea SUMMARY — The United States’ best bet for striking oil offshore lies in the Beafort Sea in areas the na- tion plans to lease. But problems are involved, Earlier, experts thought the area to be leased would be covered by six feet of ice during the winter, when drilling was to occur, They planned to put drilling rigs on artificial is- lands which could be lifted away by helicopter if oil spills occurred, Be- cause last winter was warm, an un- safe “shear zone” exists in the area where drilling would take place. major oil company. “In our business, that kind of odds are very attrac: tive.” See ICE, Page 17-A, Ice threat clouds oil bonanza hopes Continued from Page 1-A. A 10-billion barrel find would equal the remaining proven reserves of Texas and Oklahoma. The federal govern- Mment’s estimates, issued before the ag find, are much more conserv- ve, WHILE NO ONE can be sure, there are clues that a prolific geological “trend” may extend from the Canadian discovery westward into the American lease area. Two sources with access to the confi- dential drilling data say the Canadian Well tapped the same sequence of geo- logical layers as a 1977 Exxon explora- tory well on the southeastern edge of the American lease area, The Exxon well, which tested at 1,175 barrels a day, is on Flaxman Island, just off Alaska coast about 55 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. Another test well, drilled by Sohio, indicates that one of the lesser oil layers from Alaska's huge onshore Prudhoe Bay field runs at least part way into the Beaufort Sea lease area. , The proposed Beaufort Sea lease area is a 75-mile long oval that covers the coastal waters just off Prudhoe Bay and eastward to Flaxman Island, The 514,- 000 acre proposed lease area runs about 20 miles into the sea, out to a water depth of about 60 feet. BUT AS THE SALE date approaches, the new information about the ice dan- gers and oil possibilities is causing dis- comfort in federal, state and Eskimo ranks. Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus and Alaska Gov, Jay Hammond, the chief auctioneers, are scheduled to meet on oi 22 to set the final boundaries of the e. The state and federal government are planning to auction the leases jointly, since the inner tracts lie in state waters and the outer tier are federal. The two governments dispute the ownership of some of the tracts, but this has been left to a court to resolve. Until last winter, all the government and industry experts believed that the whole lease area would be covered with six feet of ice during the winter months, when all drilling is to take place, To reach the oil under the deep-water leases, the companies had laid plans to set their drilling rigs on artificial islands made of ice or gravel. If any oil spilis occurred, the frozen mess would be carted away by helicopter before the spring ice breakup. LAST WINTER IT was exceptionally “warm” in the Arctic, with the chill factor seldom dipping below 100 de- grees below zero, For the first time on record, the land- fast ice extended only out to a water depth of 35 to 40 feet, At that point, the tide and current caused the offshore polar icecap to collide with the land-fast ice sheet, building an ice ridge 10 feet in the air and 60 feet below the water level. This collision point is known as the “shear zone” because of the grinding pressures of the ice. In normal winters, the ‘shear zone” is much futher out to 5eA. Civilian scientists Wilford Weeks and Austin Kovaks from the U.S, Army's cold research laboratory made these surprise findings by dropping a weighted line over the edge of the ice. They were studying the lease area under a routine contract from the Na- tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin- istration, which had to submit com- ments on an environmental impact statement. ON MAY 4, THE agency's Arctic chief, Gunter Weller, joined Alaska state scientists in warning Washington of “extreme forces from ice shove and ice gouging” in waters deeper than 33 feet. The agency's Washington office, which is under the Commerce Depart- ment, passed along the comments to the Interior Department without commit- ting itself on the ice hazards. The oceanic agency's final recommendation, which reportedly calls for deleting deep water tracts, is now filtering up toward Andrus through the Bureau of Land Management. The Energy Department, meanwhile, has been urging Interior to proceed with the sale as a step toward increas- ing oi! supplies in the late 1980s, Assistant Interior Secretary Guy Mar- tin sald Andrus has tentatively decided to lease out the whole area, on grounds that last year's ice conditions were “not normal.” Martin said most of the deep tracts can be reached by drilling slanted wells from artificial or natural islands in shallow water. IN THE CANADIAN Beaufort, the ex- ploratory wells are drilled from conventional drill ships. But the north coast of Alaska is closer to the revoly- ing polar ice cap, “No one in his right mind would use a drill ship on our side,” said Roger Herrera, Sohio's Beau- fort Sea exploration expert. Herrera, along with most environ- mental scientists who have studied It, say that wintertime drilling in shallow water is no risker than drilling on land in northern Alaska. “As we get into deeper waters, the situation might change,” Herrera said. Some companies have tested laboratory models of a massive concrete drilling tower that could be floated from tract to tract. No such structure has ever been subjected to the Arctic ice forces, The Eskimos who live on Alaska’s re- mote North Slope are not waiting for Andrus or the oi! companies. In the end, their views may be harder to ignore than those of the ice scientists. IN MId-SEPTEMBER the Eskimo-run North Slope Borough assembly called a public hearing on a coastal management ordinance. Two planes of oil men from Dayton Houston, as well as observers from the state and federal government, found that the Eskimo planners had declared a “geophysical hazard” zone covering water depths beyond 39 feet. The zoning map would also defer all oil drilling for at least five years in waters between 26 and 39 feet. In Barrow, America’s northernmost community, some younger Eskimos complained to a visiting reporter that the decision was a “sellout” to the oil companies, which provide the borough with $80 million a year in property tax revenues, Two Eskimo villages and several whale hunters, with the aid of a feder- ally funded legal services lawyer, will probably file a federal suit aimed at stopping all offshore drilling in the \" American Beafort.

But another senior mem- ber, Rep.

It is now clear that this territo- ry, set aside by President Warren Harding in 1923 because explorers noticed oil seeps, is not a “reserve” at all. It contains only a few proven deposits, all of them scattered and too small to justify pipeline connec- tions The geology still looks favorable for oil. Most of the drilling has con- centrated on the northeast corner of the 23-million acre reserve, which leaves hope for some big discoveries in the future. But there are no large fields which can be opened easily whenever the nation needs cil.

After 10 years of Arctic drilling, starting at Prudhoe Bay, he is a master of that specialty A visiting reporter asked him about a suspicion offered by Sen Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) that the In- terior Department isn’t really trying to find oil in the reserve so it can declare the land a wilderness “There is nobody who wants to find oil more than we do,” said Smith, this time not whispering But neither he nor Husky has chosen this drilling site. That choice made two years ago in Menlo was Calif by a committee of Park, n Oil Drilling Sip on the Alaska Reserve Jupt Before the First Snowfay lp sls Se » the US. government geologists at Geological Survey office One of the program’s top adminis- trators in Washington acknowledged that the rush deadlines of an ac- celerated drilling program have re- sulted in decisions to drill some wells on sites with only limited oil prospects. This official said: “We are faced with trying to run an exploration department of an oil company with three different over- lapping boards of directors, some of them downright antagonistic. I am talking about the Congress, the Of- fice of Management and Budget and the Interior Department. “In the Arctic environment, long- range planning is essential, but what we have seen is (Interior) trying to chop off the funds every year and Congress insisting that we continue We develop the harried philosophy that what we don’t get done this year may never get done.” Geologists find oil traps by bounc- ing sound waves off subterranean rock layers and measuring the seis- mic reflections. In some cases, the exploration strategy committee had to pick drilling targets from piles of seismic maps before the mapping was complete. It was as if surgeons were operating after reading blurry X-rays A report last December by the General Accounting Office gave some of the details on how Tunalik came to be drilled. The early seis- mic surveys showed a sizable drill- ing target, known as a structural closure. On that basis, the Geologi- cal Survey in 1976 budgeted $14 mil- lion for construction of a drilling pad and an all-weather air strip. “Subsequent seismic work reduced the size of the structure by about half and raised questions as to its existence at all,” the GAO report said. By last October, the Geological Survey said the site was “poorly de- fined on a few seismic lines,” but had “some possibility of structure.” As it turned out, Tunalik has so far revealed on 10-foot layer of gas sands. It is too small to be consid- ered a commercial discovery An oil company probably would not have drilled a $47 million well on such skimpy data which means no one would have known whether there was oil right here not not The Geological Survey points out that Congress gave it a double mis- sion: to make an assessment of the resources in the reserve, and to find oil if possible. By drilling the first deep well in this western sector, the survey has contributed to its first goal even if not the second The Tunalik drilling site will be visible from a low-flying plane for 10 to 20 years, the survey's project in spector Skip Braden told a reporter who accompanied him in a survey helicopter \f"

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT . Journsl-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — In May 1977, Lin Patterson, a lawyer for a medium-sized . Dallas oil company, walked out of the of- fice of a minor Interior Department em- ployee with a piece of information the government had never bothered to an- nounce. . It was the first move in a petroleum lease gambit that this summer brought his company the rights to tap perhaps $200 million worth of natural gas from under a mililary base in Arkansas during the next 40 years. Without competitive bidding, the company agreed ta pay the government an annual rental of $1 an acre, plus a royalty of one-eighth if it finds gas — far less than the going rate oil compa- nies pay for leases on private tand just outside the base boundaries. Texas Oi! and Gas Co., which was awarded these drilling rights to 33,000 acres inside Fort Chaffee, may still lose out in the end. Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus initially defended the legality of the leases his department had issued, But three weeks ago, after protests from senators, Andrus ordered them canceled on a procedural technicality and de- clared a moratorium on any leases of military base resources, The next day U.S. Judge Joyce Green lit into Andrus for what she called “a nocturnal attempt to deprive this court of jurisdiction.” Calling his cancellation unconscionable, she put the Interior De- partment on notice that she may order the leases reinstated. Texas Oil and Gas heartily agrees. “We don't want to be adjudicated out of these leases by political pressure,” says Patterson, the company’s associate general counsel. It was his request for a restraining order that Janded the case before Judge Green. Whatever the outcome, the episode has disclosed a pattern of stipshod man- agement of some of the nation’s more desirable petroleum land on the part of Congress and three government agen- cies, It is a story of an unintended loophole, Of multimiltion-dollar rulings made in a few hours on scanty information, of a company allowed to submit its own envi- ronmental reviews and fly government files from one agency to another in order to win quick approvals. There is no suggestion that anyone did anything illegal or unethical.-It is how the system worked. Part of the story emerged at a Senate energy subcommittee hearing two months ago, called at the behest of Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.). He objected that there had been no chance for companies in his state to lease the land through competitive bidding. One witness, an executive of a com- peting gas company, estimated that land inside Fort Chaffee would have brought ‘the government from $150 to $400 an’ acre through competitive bidding. Now, a new fact has emerged in follow-up interviews by Cox Newspapers. It turns out that Texas Oil and Gas filed for the leases about four days after it learned through a conversation with an Interior Department branch chief that the government finally was willing to lease land on military bases, after dee- ades of rejecting such applications. In a marketplace where the govern- ment issues leases for wildcatting tracts on a first-come, first-served basis, that was like getting a week’s headstart in the Oklahoma land rush 90 years aga. “In retrospect, there is no question that our change of policy should have been announced to the public,” says In- via —_caremeeno AIL Fort Chaffee Military Reservation terior Department spokesman Ed Esser- tier. Lawyers in the department said, haw- ever, that there were no rules prohibiting the branch chief from pass- ing along unannounced information in response to questions. Patterson says he first learned from a lawbook that (he rules were due to be changed. Here, as pieced together from inter- views in Arkansas and Washington, and from the hearing and court records, is how the leasing of Fort Chaffee occur- red: See TREASURE, 36A ® In August 76, Congress passed an obscure coal-leas- .ing amendment that was de- signed by its sponsor Rep. Jake Pickle (D-Texas), to allow lignite mining on Camp Swift, Texas. As the amendment was speeding through the House Mining = subcommittee, a Staffer rewrote the language Slightly for “technical rea- sons.” Some, months later the mineral leasing office of In- terior’s Bureau of Land Man- agement decided the chznge was more than technica!: it had effectively removed a 30- year —s congressional ban against oit and gas leasing in- side military bases. Until then, only a few tracts along some base boundaries had becn leased, and then only to prevent “drainage” hy neigh- boring wells. “That just happened with- out really having a lot of re- view by the members,” recalls Tom Laughlin, then a lawyer on the House subcom- mittee staff. “We just made a mistake in drafting.” © On April 24, 1977, Mar- cia Rohn — then $23,000-a- year chief of the minerals branch at the Bureau of Land Management’s regional office in Silver Springs, Md. — was told by a superior in the bu- reau’s Washington office that she should now accept appli- cations for noncompetitive oi) and gas leases on military lands. Tt was the first lime she had heard of the amendment, which had been in effect for nine months. “I felt very embarrassed,” says Ms. Rohn, a 19-year em- ployee of the bureau. “I had advised some people military acquired lands were simply hot available for leasing.” © A few days later, Ms. Rohn says, she telephoned “several” regular visitors to the government’s Silver Springs land office to say that her previous advice on leas- ing military bases had been wrong. One of those she says she t remembers calling was Lin | Patterson of Texas Qil and Gas. ; * Patterson vehemently denies that anyone at Texas Gil and Gas ever got such a phone call. “I think that would have been totally inappropriate,” he says in an interview. Indeed, up to then, he says he had never spoken with Ms. Rohn about leasing military bases, so there would have been no reason for her to call him. : Patterson's explanation is that one of his bosses asked him to research the law ‘to See if there might be some way to obtain military leases. _ One morning he was look- ing through a federal statule book and the light dawned: The coal leasing amendment | Might also lift the ban on oil and gas leasing. Neither Pat- terson nor Ms. Rohn has kept any memos or phone records establishing who called whom first or what they said. __ * On May 5, 1977 — there Ss no dispute about this — Patterson and one of his as- Sociates met Marcia Rohn in her office to talk about leas- ing on military bases. ‘She simply confirmed that she recognizad what we had already noticed in the law ks,\" says Patterson. “If I had known in advance, I would not have bothered to fly to Washington.” Our days later, on May §, Patterson was back in Sil- Ver Springs, This time he brought a sheaf of lease applications, covering not just all of Fort Chaffee but also other military bases in other states. It was the first of several trips, When all of his applications were in, the company had filed for about 350,000 acres of federal land on a dozen bases, including big chunks of Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, and Kendall Air Force Base, Fla. ® In September 1977, Cliff Burgess of Arkansas-Lousiana Gas Co. a competitor of Texas Oil and Gas, set up his own meeting with Ms. Rohn. But he asked the wrong ques- tion. Instead of asking about noncompetitive leases on all military bases, Burgess asked whether a small part of Fort Chaffee could be put up for drainage sale by competitive bidding. “Her comment was that it was tied up by environmental reports,” Burgess recalls. Ms. Rohn, who last year transferred to the Interior Department's coal leasing of- fice, says: “‘] did aot intend to misinform them. I answered their question as best I could.” ein late 1977 or early 1978, Texas Oi] and Gas was notified by the Little Rock of- fice of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the govern- ment had no funds to carry out the required environmen- | tal studies at Fort Chaffce. The corps said its rules at- wed an alternate procedure: ‘he applicant could submit its own, reports for the Penta- on's review. So Texas Oil and Gas hired an environmen- tal consultant in Arkansas. The report was favorable. * In late June, Texas Oil and Gas learned from Jeff Holdren, a  $32,000-a-year Supervisor in the Silver Springs land office, that he had finished all but the final step in processing the appli- cations. What remained was a clearance by the U.S. Geologi- cal Survey. “They came in here and waated to expedite It,” says Holdren, who specializes in- cattle range management. “They said they had a rig ' ready to drill.” Holdren agreed to allow Joe Binford, a Texas Oi! and Gas official, to take the appli- cations out of the bureau files and fly them to the Geologi- cal Survey office in Tulsa. Otherwise they might have been delayed for several weeks, since Holdren’s’ staff was about to move to another office. It turned out only later that the rig wasn't scheduled to drill until at least Septem- ber. “That was a misunder- standing,” says Patterson. «On June 28, Patterson and Binford appeared in the Geological Survey office in ‘Tulsa. They delivered them to Ed Johnson, a $37,800-a-year petroleum geologist whose task was to determine whether the land within Fort Chaffee was included in a “known geological structure” of a producing oil or gas field. This was a critical ques- tion. Under a long line of mineral leasing laws, the In- terior Department can use competitive bidding in leasing its onshore lands only when they are “presumptively productive\" — meaning ‘hey Cecit Andrus InItially defended leases are inside the limits of a producing field. All other lands must be leased without competitive bidding, either through a iot- tery or to the first qualified applicant. (Offshore tracts are governed by more recent laws, which require competi- tive bidding in all cases.) Fort Chaffee — bought by the Army for a training base during World War II and now used for reservist training — is an untapped island in the middle of a 200-mile-long gas basin that straddics the Arkansas-Oklahoma line. Bordering the base on all sides are producing gas wells, atong with a few dry holes. The northern fringe of the base has been leased for several to prevent Sen. Dale Bumpers wanted - bids Johnson made his decision in three hours that afternoon without visiting the buse or obtaining the subsurface scis- mic data that might suggest the shape of the petroleum layers in the region. *QOn June 29, Texas Qil and Gas officials took another airliner back to Washington and brought the applications back to Holdren at the Bu- reau of Land Management. Holdren signed them, as he is authorized to do, without fe checking with the Interior De- partment’s Washington head- quarters. The postscript to all this . has been hard for the Interior Department to write. another division, to revie Johnson's findings about the boundary of the \"known geo logiva? structure.” Girard rererted that the were “correct in a lega sense.” But he also said “Based on regional geology, there is a very high probabil ily that many gas discoveries will be made on the lands in question.” He observed that on the question higher level. An unofficial guess is 100 billion cubic feet of gas, or enough to feed the nation’s| gas needs for two days. This is derived by assuming that half of wells on the 33,000 acres are dry holes, and the other half are productive, with flows equal to the exist- ing wells north of the base. At today’s prices, that much gas would be worth $200 million. Andrus, who has been trying unsuccessfully to get . Congress to change the leas- ing laws, at first wrote Bumpers that there was noth- ing wrong with the Texas Oil and Gas leases. But Nov. 1 he canceled them, saying the Bureau of Land Management = should have waited for implementing regulations under the coal leasing amendment before it Started accepting applica- tions. The bureau had decided two years earlier that the amendment was self-cnforc- ing. It is up to Judge Green to make the next move. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 25, 1979 \f"

        "ocr_text": "By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau FUTURE, U.S.A. — Now that we have endured the “eerie eighties,” it seems that the country's energy situa- tion wasn’t so bad after all. True, it costs $30 to tank up your motorbike, And it’s true also that many of the old liberal school still object to no-knock searches by the Federal Insu- lation Agency. But as we approach the last winter of the 1980s, nobody has run out of wood for the furnace. On the international scene, exports from coal-rich Wyoming are generating enough cash to meet at least the interest payments we owe to the Saudi National Monetary Agency. EVERYONE SAW WHAT was hap- pening to world oil. Back in the summer of 1979, the Central Intelligence Ag- ency published a research report that laid it all out: “Tt is technically feasible for world oil production to continue to grow for about another 10 years. If all oil- producing countries were willing to (a make the large investments needed to maintaih and increase total capacity and (b) allow their reserves to fall to the point at which they had only a 12-year supply, output could go on rising for about a decade — assuming that discov- eries remained at current levels, “If control over production policies were in the hands of the companies or consuming-country governments, such a production profile might be likely. As it is, holders of about 60 percent of the world’s estimated 650 billion barrels of recoverable reserves — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, and the United Arab Emi- rates — have announced production policies that preclude rapid growth in output.” SAUDI ARABIA WAS, of course, the key. At the end of the '70s, the then crown prince granted what amounted to a “national day” present to America: he agreed to lift the ceiling on Saudi oil production from 8,5 million to 9,5 mil- lion barrels a day. It was nice while it lasted, But what the world really needed to sustain eco- nomic growth in the '80s was a gradual buildup of Saudi exports to the level of at least 16 million barrels a day. Given enough drilling, that would have been technically possible. But the royal fami- ly was not about to allow unrestrained oil production, even before the outburst by the Saudi prince at the University of California, Not even the CIA was in favor of all- out pumping, The agency's analyst wrote back in 1979; “It is probably not desirable for mankind to deplete the world’s oi] resources at such a rapid rate,” America’s own oll supply output held up remarkably well. When the domestic price hit $35 a barrel back in 198), oil companies found it was to their interest to squeeze more barrels from marginal fields — just like what happened after the natural gas price was unfrozen in the late '70s, IN TEXAS AND Oklahoma, some operators started “quaternary recov: ery,” which amounted to digging mines in old oil fields to get out the petroleum left behind in the earlier secondary and tertiary recovery efforts, In Alaska, the Prudhoe Bay field is on the decline now, but it has been supple» mented by a pair of new super-giant fields in the former Alaska National Wildlife Range and in the Chukchi Sea between Alaska and Russia, Our supply from American wells entering 1990, is about the same as it was 10 years ago— roughly 10 million barrels of oi! and 20 trillion cubic feet of gas every day. Naturally, we have less to go around, since the country has grown by 25 million people, AS IT TURNED OUT, ingenuity got us through some scary times, Among the milestones; © The merger of Exxon and Chrysler. It was, of course, a shotgun wedding — arranged by Uncle Sam. For years, the government had been trylag to stop ol companies from absorbing other busi nesses. But then someone in the Treas ury Department realized that the auto companies had been serving as tne mar- keting department for the oil industry all along. After Exxler’s successes, Texaco joined Ford to became Texicar. And it wasn't long before Mobil was forced to take over the bankrupt East- ern railroads, “© The bioconversion revolution, It all started in Lamar, Colo,, back in the 1970s, A company named Biogas got the idea of “harvesting” methane from ma- nure at a large cattle feedlot. Biogas found that the manure from 40,000 head of cattle would provide half the fuel for a 50 megawatt power plant. Next came the development of the “energy plantation.” The cash crop was a new bush that grew like kudzu vines and had a rubbery sap. This sap is “cracked” into hydrocarbon fuels and petrochemicals at the new “‘energy cracker” refineries all over the South, BY THE END OF the '80s, the country was deriving almost five percent of its energy from various forms of “biomass conversion.” The enthusiastic support of the farmworkers unions has over come much of the environmental pro- tests over devoting an area the size of California to growing energy crops. * The formation of CO-PEC, In the middle of America’s 1981 coal strike, a New York entrepreneur found that he could buy tankerloads of coal in Austra- lia and sell them in Japan for $100 a ton. That was about five times the going price of coal. But as the entrepre- neur was quick to point out, $100-a-ton coal Was no more expensive than $25-a- barrel Arab oil. Australia’s parliament was 0 out: raged that it sent delegations to Amer- ica, South Africa and Poland, its main competitors for the world’s small coal export market. America agreed some- what reluctantly to go along with the formation of the CO-PEC coal price Oil tight now? Just look 10 years down pike cartel, But few in this country regretted the decision, especially after the world demand for coal took off in reaction to the Persian Gulf oil shocks of the mid- 1980s, * The solar surprise. Back in the 1970s, the editor of the trade journal World Oil predicted that solar power would have as much impact as “a mos- quito bite on an elephant’s fanny,” That has turned out to be wrong for only one reason: the development of the ultra- thin film amorphous semiconductor. IT WAS THE INVENTION of the dec- ade, For years, scientists had known that it was possible to generate elec- tricity in a “photovoltaic cell.” The sun's light could provide the energy to detach a stream of electrons from the atoms of a cell, But the trick was to find a very cheap “one-way” material, known as a semi-conductor, that could channel the electrons in one direction. There were those in the old NASA who used to muse about launching a space satellite crammed with huge arrays of photovoltaics and a transmit. ter to beam electricity back to earth. It might work in the mid-'90s, assuming the administration finishes the long- delayed radiation impact statement, But for now, at the close of 1989, the real gain has been in the all-electric household, powered by the photovoltaic roof. The trick was figuring how to spray the photovoltaic film on the roof thinly enough, since it still costs $10,- 000 a gallon, For the nation that per- fected spray-can technology, that was not an insuperable challenge. And now what started as an expensive curiosity in the Nieman-Marcus catalog is now being sold at Sears. ¢ The nuclear comeback.

But the lurch in oil price in the mid-1980s changed a lot of minds. FOLLOWING THE 1984 election, the new administration offered the first really new approach to nuclear energ policy in 40 years. The idea was to get private industry out of the nuclear busi ness. Instead, the Navy's nucleat submarine office was given the assign ment of operating all nuclear powe plants — along with the responsibilit for taking care of all nuclear wastes. The next big step was the President’ order that all future nuclear plants mus be built on remote government installa tions like Oak Ridge, Tenn., or alon the Savannah River in South Carolina Technically, it wasn't very efficient t¢ transmit all this electricity for hundred: of miles over high-voltage power grid: But politically, ii was very efficient The power was relatively cheap, an the plants were in someone else’s bac yard.

By Joseph Albright enh icin and Charles Holmes s Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — For the past 1,000 years, the Baluchi tribesmen have been among the Middle East’s wandering losers. But thanks to the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, this forgotten minority turns out to occupy a most vital square on the world’s great power chess- board. leds ; No longer are they just a few million separatist- minded Sunni Moslem sheepherders making trouble along the borders of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. Now this Texas-sized homeland of the Baluchi people is the last geographical buffer between the Russian tank positions in western Afghanistan and the world’s oil flow through the Persian Gulf. Consider the prospects for intrigue: A defiant and oppressed minority, eager for arms and money, loyal to no government, split into 500 clans and tribes, beset by dust storms and large-beaked poisonous spiders. Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) last week became the first American official to focus on the Baluchis as a first-rank worry. ‘We have information that the Rus- sians have infiltrated the tribal leadership,” Jackson told reporters. He was talking about the Baluchis who live in the southeastern Iranian province of Baluchi- stan-Seistan. Jackson predicted that within a year the Baluchis of Iran will break away from Ayatollah Khomeini’s cen- tral authority to form an independent Baluchi republic. “The Russians will immediately recognize it and move in,” Jackson forecast. “They'll be within shooting dis- Turn to BALUCHIS, Al2 May Own Key Mideast Turf ‘Losing’ Baluchis ~ be, x + , United Press International Afghag, girl carries infant and loaf of bread to refugee camp 4, Baluchi Hormuz and the oil From Page 1 of 7th century, when they were forced to flee eastward from Syria Three centuries | r, the ther east by the Turks, who supposedly became when Baluchi chieftain Ilmash Remi sent young boys for the Turkish harem, instead of 44 maid ens the Turks had demanded.

In one chance encounter last year, an American reporter met a Baluchi shopkeeper in a bazaar on the Persian Gulf island of Bahrain Within an hour, the Baluchi was appealing to the reporter to arrange secret U.S. government backing for a Baluchi political uprising in Iran.

They occur fre quently at all seasons of the year, sometimes changing the light of midday to an intensity of darkness to which no ordinary night ever approaches Ps Few subsequent travelers have recorded their expe riences in Baluchi territory. As a result, today’s read ers are left with a choice of stereotypes Donald Wilber, in his mid-1960s book “Pakistan,” wrote: “The Baluchis are of medium-to-tall stature and slender, muscular build, with round heads, squarish faces, straight or convex noses and dark eyes and hair. living in arid and inhospitable terrain “They are basically pastoral nomads, though have become farmers, soldiers, policemen and rent col lectors for big landlords. It is said that the Baluchis make good soldiers and policemen but, still close to banditry and nomadism, hate to farm.” Some have described the Baluchis as fierce war riors, sometimes quoting British writer Edward Oli ver’s 1890 dictum: “War is looked upon as the first business of a gentleman, and every Baluchi is a gentle- man.” On the other side, Prof. Ali Tayyeb’s authorita- tive book “Pakistan: A Political Geography” describes the Baluchis as “‘rather docile.”’ Some Baluchi tribesmen still use old muzzle-loading muskets, known as Tupaks. Whatever else happens in the power struggle over Afghanistan, it is a safe bet that the Baluchis will soon be armed with a better class of rifle. Whether their arms supply comes from Russia or Iran or Pakistan or conceivably even the American CIA is likely to be an untraceable mystery many \f"

        "ocr_text": "IRS keeps watchful eye on multinational firms By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Ashland Oil Co. Pleads that there is nothing wrong with claiming a tax deduction for its over- seas payments to a Persian-speaking Ohio man who helped buy Iranian oil during the shah’s reign. So sorry, the Internal Revenue Serv- ice tells Ashland. Please fork over $343,000 in back income taxes. It is a vignette from a pin-striped combat zone: the struggle between the tax lawyers of the U.S.-based multina- tional corporations and the 201 interna- tional auditors of the IRS. ‘ THE IRS IS evidently turning up the pressure, judging from the statistics, higher than the previous year and more than double the figure for the year be- fore that. — . “We have become more sophisticated over the years in dealing with these highly complicated tax returns,” says Assistant IRS Commissioner Singleton Wolfe. And the big-money issues, said Wolfe, very often revolve around the tax treatment of corporate activities overseas, Most of these tax disputes are re- solved without publicity through the appellate channels of the IRS. But some companies, like Ashland, have chosen to appeal their cases to the U.S. Tax Court, a modern glass-and-granite courthouse just off Capitol Hill. Last year the revenue collectors the country’s 900 largest companies with tax deficiency notices totaling That sum is 33 percent $2.78 billion. that within the last year the IRS has accused at least five major companies besides Ashland with using foreign sub- sidiaries to shrink their U.S. corporate tax bills more than the tax code allows. THESE OTHER multinational tax pro- testers include Standard Oil of Indiana, IBM, Litton Industries, Miles Laborato- ries and United States Gypsum. In each case, the companies challenge the findings of the IRS auditors as “arbi- trary and capricious.” Of these, the Ashland case was the only one which involved allegedly questionable overseas payments, More typical were cases where companies al- legedly sold products to their own over- seas subsidiaries at unreasonably low prices. This has the effect of cutting their taxable profits at home while in- flating their income in low-tax coun- tries abroad. \"To do so, they must expose their tax records to outside scrutiny. A search through these Tax Court files shows See IRS, Page 10-A. in 1974 and 1975 Ashland’s subsidiary in Bermuda paid $715,000 to All Patents Ltd., a Bermuda company owned by Columbus, Ohio, business consultant James J. Zand. Nor did the IRS question the legality of the payments. What the auditors did dispute was Ashland’s claim that the payment was tax-deductable just like a restaurant meal, an airline ticket or an advertising commission. “THIS AMOUNT IS disallowed as a deduction because it was paid to allow your, parent (Ashland) to gain admit- tance to oil buying circles in Iran, thereby creating an intangible asset with an indefinite and indeterminable life,” the IRS audit report said. In its plea to the Tax Court, Ashland said its payments to Zand were an “ordinary and necessary business ex- pense,” amounting to 3 cents a barrel on the oil it bought from the National Iranian Oil Company. An Ashland spokesman explained that Ashland hired Zand because “he knew who to see and how to bargain.” Ac- cording to the spokesman, Zand came to the United States from Iran about 30 years ago and decided to stay after his education at Ohio State University. Zand, who now lives in Florida, could not be reached for comment on the pay- ments, which had not previously been disclosed. The IRS similarly refused to let Ash- land deduct the $240,000 which the company said it paid five years ago to a member of the Saudi Arabian royal family, Prince Mishal Bin Abdul Aziz, for help in buying Saudi oil. “THERE IS NOT sufficient evidence to indicate that Prince Mishal per- formed services which would warrant this amount of commission,” said the IRS audit report. Ashland said it paid $240,000 into a company controlled by Prince Mishal in order to terminate “an undated letter agreement” it once had with Prince Mishal. Ashland argued that the prince — re- portedly a half-brother of King Khalid — “claimed he was entitled to compen- sation for services performed on (Ash- land’s) behalf in connection with (Ashland’s) purchase of crude oil from the Saudi Arabian national ojl company, Petromin.” ‘ A more typical case arose when IRS auditors charged Miles Laboratories with jiggering its overseas prices and giving away “technical data” to its overseas affiliates instead of charging royalties for the information. THE IRS DEMANDED $1.9 million in back taxes from the Elkhart, Ind., medi- cal products manufacturer, plus a 5 per- cent civil penalty for “negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regu- lations.” (Of the six companies, Miles was the only one socked with a negli-. gence penalty.) : From a Miles’ attorney came a pained’ rebuttal: “The (IRS) commissioner has: determined profit markups based on; costs, without explanation or justifica-5 tion, in a completely arbitrary and The IRS auditor had found that Miles vas adding only a 5 percent markup vhen it sold diagnostic kits to its own ‘vVerseas subsidiaries. It was allegedly elling the same kits to other buyers 'verseas for a markup that averaged i95 percent above the manufacturing ost. The IRS agent invoked Section 482 of he internal revenue code, which lets he government “allocate” income and leductions among affiliated companies whenever it is “‘necessary to prevent ?vasion of taxes or clearly reflect the ncome.”” ALTHOUGH SECTION 482 does not bring extra tax penalties, it allowed the agent to refigure the company’s taxes assuming it had actually sold to its for- eign subsidiaries using a 500 percent profit markup. The IRS hurled the same tax code sec- tion against Standard Oi! of Indiana. The auditors contended the company’s U.S.-based petrochemical subsidiary furnished $3.5 million worth of “serv- ices, property and expertise” to the company’s chemical-making affiliate in Belgium at less than ‘‘arms length terms.”\" The Litton Industries and U.S. Gyp- sum cases involved even more compli- cated corporate relationships. In the first case, the IRS claims the right to tax $1.7 million in management fees charged by one overseas affiliate to another. Im the second case, the issue Was how to tax no-interest loans to a | subsidiary in Mexico. In still another variation, the IRS questioned the motives of the IBM Corp.'s World Trade subsidiary in buy- ing German currency at New York banks and then reselling the currency through a bank in London. USING THIS roundabout trading method, IBM claimed it was entitled to capital gains rates on the $10 million it made in German currency profits back in 1970 and 1971. But the IRS objected. “‘Based on infor- mation and belief, the sole purpose of the disposition of the (German cur- rency) contracts in London, England. Was a tax avoidance motivation,” said IRS attorney Theodore J. Kletnick. Asked about the case, an IBM spokes- man said the German marks were sold in London in the course of normal busi- mess. “The result of the transactions was the lowering of IBM's tax liability. and this was in accordance with U.S. tax law,’’ the spokesman said. At IRS headquarters, officials said its auditors go through the books of every company with assets exceeding $250 million, focusing in each audit on trans- actions between U.S. and foreign sub- sidiaries. The IRS audits only about 3 percent of individual tax returns. But it audits all the returns filed by the largest companies. IN 1975 — THE latest year for which there are statistics — America’s 1,782 biggest companies had gross sales of $1.4 trillion. After expenses and deduc- tions, they reported net domestic profits of $87 billion. They paid the Treasury $42 billion in corporate income taxes. When all the audits and Tax Court hearings are finished, the government’s final take is likely to be $2 billion to $3 billion more. Or to put it another way, the compa- nies voluntarily paid the government about $9 out of every $10 the IRS audi- tors claim they owed. The IRS says small businessmen and individual taxpayers, who don’t get audited regularly, tend to pay the U.S. ‘Treasury a lesser fraction of what they aliv © Dayton Daily News - February 24, 1980 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Soviets in hot pursuit of rebels near Pakistan-Afghan border JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Russian soldiers chasing rebels in eastern Afghanistan have seized an Afghan town “literally a stone's throw away” from the border with Pakistan, according to American official reports from near the battle. The capture of the town of Barikowt was described by U.S. analysts as part of a bloody Russian search- and-destroy raid to sweep the Moslem rebels out of the Konarha Valley. The Russian spearhead reportedly reached the town early yesterday and called a halt without trying to move across the lightly defended Pakistani border. The Russians, backed by fighter-bombers and heli- copter gunships, have “leveled” dozens of smali Af- ghan villages in their successful drive up the valley, U.S. officials said. The insurgents have apparently fled into the surrounding mountains or across the Pakistani border. “There is of course a chance of a hot pursuit inci- dent or spillover into Pakistan, but it hasn't happened yet,” said one U.S. analyst. Throughout Afghanistan, the rifle-toting rebels are proving no match for Russian helicopter gunships. The Afghans are getting their revenge in ‘other ways, by -murdering lone Russians and sometimes cutting off their ears and noses. Reports through U.S. government channels have described a series of Afghan atrocities directed at the invading Russians. In one incident two weeks ago, the bodies of two Russian women soldiers were found hacked’to small pieces, with a sign warning that “this will happen to all Russians who don't leave Afghani- stan.” In another instance, 52 off-dutv Russians ventured into an Afghan athletic stadium, where they were knifed to death, The U.S. analysts discounted reports from Europe that the Russians might be preparing to withdraw from Afghanistan. Instead, they said the Russians are apparently preparing to add another 25,000 troops to their current complement of 80,000. “We could be seeing a buildup to about 120,000 to 150,000 Soviet troops,”’ said one analyst. The current U.S. estimate is that the Russians are likely to continue their military buildup until at least this fall, after the U.S. elections. Apparently digging in for a long stay, Russian con- struction units have been building three new bridges across a river that divides Russia and Afghanistan. And they have moved up building supplies, apparently to erect permanent barracks around the capital city of Kabul. The Russians were said to be facing much tougher resistance in Kabul and other cities than they had an- ticipated. Underground pamphlets, known as Night Letters, have called for a new and more violent series of shopkeeper strikes in the main cities, according to the U.S. analysts. Despite differing reports from refugees in Pakistan, these analysts said there is “no convincing evidence’ that the Russians have used any nerve gas or other le- thal chemical agents to defeat the rebels. What Rus- sians have used instead is a riot control gas similar to the choking CS tear gas that Americans employed in Vietnam. According to credible reports, Russian planes have dropped canisters of the riot control gas on isolated Af- ghan villages, releasing a bluish-gray vapor. Overall, the Russians were said to be suffering about 400 to 600 killed and wounded a week. mostly in isolated incidents or in fire-fights with defecting units of the Afghan Army. Casualties among Afghans was said to be ‘many times\" higher. Miami News - March 7, 1980 \f"

He said that over the months, a team of about 90 Ameri- can servicemen rehearsed every part of the mission at unspecified bases in the US. According to some sources, these included an anti-terrorist unit from Fort Bragg, N.C., known as the Delta Team. Brown declined to give the names of any units, but said the raiders were chosen from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Ma- rines Brown said Carter decided “about two weeks ago” to authorize the fi- nal preparations to fly the team into Iran. although Brown didn’t mention: it, the president evidently gave the green light about the time Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was visiting Carter in Washington. Late Thursday afternoon, Iranian time, eight Sikorsky Sea Stallion he- licopters, each capable of 55 passengers, took off from the deck of the carrier Nimitz cruising in the Arabian Sea. The helicopters, with a top speed of 170 nautical mph, skimmed across Iran’s deso- late eastern border shortly after dark. At that point in Washington, it was 10:15 a.m. Thursday. Carter’s schedule showed him meeting with Frank Moore, his congressional liai- son officer. The Sea Stallions, designed for mine sweeping, are Among ameri- ca’s more reliable helicopters, even though they were roughly 7-years- old. As insurance against mechani- cal problems, two spare helicopters joined the six needed for the rescue mission. About the time the helicopters lift- ed off from the carrier, six Ameri- can C130 transports were taking off from near Cairo, Egypt. Two were fuel tankers and at least some of the others were fitted to hold troops. While flying north toward Iran, at least one of the C130s stopped to re- fuel on the Persian Gulf island of Bahrain. The plan was for all the planes and their 90 specially trained com- mandos to rendezvous under cover of darkness at a salt desert about 200 nautical miles southeast of Teh- ran. Brown said the spot had been picked out as a possible landing strip on the basis of aerial photography and other methods. He avoided a question on whether an advance par- ty was on the scene to greet the Americans. From Page 1 The first American plane landed ' at the airstrip at about 10 p.m., Iran time, and the busload of Iranians t was captured sometime within the ! next four hours that the Americans , spent on the ground. In Washington, Carter was meet- ' ing with a group of Hispanic-Ameri- * can leaders. Meanwhile, several hundred miles to the east, the plans began to un- ravel soon after the helicopters crossed the Iranian border. r Two of the eight Sea Stallions were struck by unspecified mechani- cal problems during the grueling flight toward the rendezvous. One landed in the desert and limped to the refueling point after its crew > was picked up by another helicopter. . Another Sea Stallion flew back to the Nimitz. On arriving at the rendezvous, a third helicopter suffered what - Brown called “a severe hydraulic malfunction which put it out of com- ,, mission.” Now down to five functioning heli- ? copters, the raid commander or- dered the mission aborted after conferring by radio with superior of- ficers, presumbably flying overhead aboard an Airborne Warning and !

        "ocr_text": "Tax Scottlaws May Be Nailed By Joseph Albright Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The IRS pians to spread a com wane iees dragnet, using Social Security numbers and a commercial credit bureau, for 5,500 people who have allegedly moved without paying their income taxes. The tax agency’s legal staff has ruled that revenue agents have “‘am- ple authority”’ for its latest experi- ment in bill-collecting technology. The IRS said the process is no more intrusive long-accepted practice of sending revenue agents to a delinquent taxpayer’s bank or stockbroker to find a forwarding ad- The FBI, by contrast, says it never uses citizens’ Social Security mumbers as a searching device in criminal investigations — except in spying or other national security . “It is against the Privacy Act for us to use Social Security num- bers criminal investigations,”’ oes FBI spokesman Otis Cox. spokesman Larry Batdorf, pointing to a broad exemption in the ivacy Act for tax collectors, said the tax agency hopes to sign a con- tract this summer to obtain compu- ter address searches. He said the IRS is hoping to enlist either a na- tionwide cr by a one such as Visa, Mastercard or Ameri- can Express. Credit executives, learning of the IRS debtor dragnet from a reporter, said they doubted the government could find any major credit-checking firm willing to bid for the assign- ment. The deadline for bids is June 20, and none is in so far. “We wouldn’t do it because the privacy of our customers is the par- amount consideration,” said an American Express spokesman. “T think we'd be a hell of a lot cleaner if we just didn’t do business with the government,” said Barry Connelly, vice president of Associ- ated Credit Bureaus Inc., the in- dustry’s trade association. Ronald Plesser, the former general counsel of the U.S. Privacy Protection Study Commission, called the IRS plan “a questionable prac- tice from a privacy point of view.” One danger, he said, is that any credit bureau would have to make an electronic notation on the credit records of a consumer whose name and address it has supplied to the Ronald Plesser, the former general counsel of the U.S. Privacy Protection Study Commission, called the IRS plan “a questionable prac- tice from a privacy point of view.” One danger, he said, is that any credit bureau would have to make an electronic notation on the credit pacoe ae of a consumer whose name an IRS address it has supplied to the This flagging of individual files is necessary under the Fair Credit Re- porting Act, which guarantees con- sumers the right to find out who has checked their credit. But the prac- tice carries an obvious risk that a credit bureau employee might tip off banks or stores about those cus- tomers who had been the objects of IRS address checks. IRS spokesman Batdorf said such disclosures by the credit bureau would be illegal and could be pun- ished by criminal penalties. At the Social Security Administra- tion, spokesman Jim Brown said that under the Privacy Act, the agency cannot supply the IRS with any information for tracking down delinquent accounts. But Brown said as far as he knows there is no law against another agency using Social Security numbers as tracers. The IRS disclosed its plan last month though an advertisment invit- ing bids from any businesses that could supply “current address and employer information’ on _ delin- quent taxpayers. Officials said the IRS will supply the winning contractor a computer tape containing the Social Security numbers — but not the names — of 5,500 taxpayers who allegedly have vanished from their communities af- ter receiving final notices of tax de- linquencies. By that stage, each taxpayer should either have used up the time for appeals or signed a statement acknowledging the tax debt. Grant Newman of the IRS collec- tion division said the IRS has _ already filed tax liens with the tax- payer’s hometown county clerk in about two-thirds of these cases. In the remaining cases, he acknowl- edged, the alleged delinquencies are not a matter of public record. If a commercial credit organiza- tion accepts the IRS contract, it will be ex ted to use its computers to match all the Social Security num- bers on the IRS delinquent list with all the Social Security numbers in its own records. There are five national and 1,800 regional credit bureaus which assist department stores, airlines and oth- er businesses in deciding who can be trusted to pay bills and _ write checks. Industry officials said about 125 million names are recorded somewhere in those files, but in many cases the entries do not in- clude the Social Security number. J.R. Starkey, who heads the IRS collection division, approved the pro- ject four months ago as part of an effort to collect the $132,500,000 which is owed by 78,252 missing tax debtors. If the first contract snares enough delinquents, the IRS plans to issue more computer search contracts. “The chief issue is whether this approach is cost-effective, and we want to test that,” said Newman. Officials say the initial search will probably pay for itself as soon as it wrings payments out of the first half-dozen tax skippers. Palm Beach Post - May 4, 1980 \f"

Jordan waited in ambush behind a chain link fence that may have saved his lite One wire was broken in the waist-high fence be- tween the sniper's lair next to an exit ramp from Inter- state 69 and the motel driveway 47 paces distant where Jordan was walking away from a red Pontiac Grand Prix with white vinyl top at 2 a.m. yesterday. Police said the fence was hit by one of the highly ex- plosive bullets fired across the ramp and through the fence at Jordan's back, as he approached room 180 of the Marriott Inn. One bullet hit Jordan in the lower back. Another was imbedded in the driveway next to the oval of dried blood that showed where the 44-year-old civil rights leader bled after he was shot. A witness said Jordan slumped forward, pointed toward the fence, and then said he was going to pass out, and did Apparently, as soon as the projectile entered, “there was an explosive effect like nothing | had ever seen be- fore,” said Dr. Jeff Towles of Parkview Memorial Hos- pital. “It was purely a miracle that it missed the spinal column, and had it exploded a millionth of a second later than it did, there would have been absolutely no chance for survival.” Jordan, president of the National Urban League, un- derwent a 44-hour operation that included removal of a portion of intestine, A hospital spokesman said late vesterday afternoon that Jordan — who suffered no paralysis although his left leg was numb — has asked to talk to several people. The spokesman said: “Offi See JORDAN, 4A JORDAN, toma i eS \" clally, he is still considered critical, but physicans are most encouraged,” Jordan's mother, Mary, flew up from Atlanta on a commercial flight. His wife, Shirley, flew in from New York City and his daughter, Vickee, from Philadelphia aboard a corporate plane that was met by a wheelchair that carried Mrs. Jordan, Who has multiple sclerosis, (rom the aircraft to the ambulance van that conveyed her to the hospital. As reconstructed through police investigations and comments by witnesses, a bizarre story full of unan- swered questions emerged about the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Wednesday night he had left his motel room to speak beneath the heavy metal chandeliers of the adja- cent ballroom in criticism of the blind enthusiasm of the country's apparent move to the right, especially the move toward a balanced budget at the expense of so- cial programs, After attending a post-dinner reception until nearly midnight, he left the motel grounds with Martha Cole- man, a divorced materials manager for International Harvester who has lived in Fort Wayne for about 15 years, \"Nancy Roffe, a former Fort Wayne Urban League staff member who said she successfully nominated Coleman, who is white, for the board, said Jordan and Coleman drove a half hour to Coleman's home, had a cup of coffee, and returned just before 2 a.m. She drove her red car, with the Indiana license plate, MCC, into the driveway about 50 feet from the door to Jordan's room. He left on the passenger side and began walking to the rear of the car. On the driver's side, a narrow strip of grass and a chain link fence separated the driveway from the exit ramp, On the other side of the ramp, police later found two spots with crumpled grass. The first, beneath a sign that reads, Wrong Way, was apparently aban- doned by the rifle-holder, who eventually settled down in a spot where the doors to the ballroom and to Jor. dan's room were both in sight. Shots rang out. The spent cartridge was found near the second patch of trampled weeds, \"1 picked it up with a pair of tweezers,” said Police Detective Terry Buch, About six inches below the top of the fence, a wire was sprung by what police as. sumed was a bullet, “At 2:05 a.m. a lady came into the lobby and told one of our clerks that a gentleman had been shot in the parking lot,” said John Mann, spokesman for the Mar. riott. “I believe she was white and middle-aged,” Hotel security police heard Jordan's words before he became unconscious and was taken to the hospital by an emergency medical team. Mayor Moses described Coleman as very coopera. tive, but police sources indicated that she had been re. luctant to cooperate with them in discovering the whereabouts of one of her friends, a man whom they wished to talk to in connection with the case. “Hopefully, we will cool our violent response to this dastardly deed,” said Robert Williams, president of the Fort Wayne Urban League. Local Protestant and. Jewish clergy announced special all-night vigils to pray , for Jordan's recovery, Catholic Bishop William McManus said that when he spoke to members of Jordan's family, “I noted in none of them was there the slightest indication of vengeance or anger.” After he led the press conference in prayer, Black City Councilman John Nuckols led patients, off-duty nurses and onlookers in “We Shall Overcome,” while reporters — about one-third of the crowd — stood si- lently with heads bowed, Voicing fears that other black leaders present had tried to dampen, Jesse Jackson said, \"We are living in a pressure cooker without a release valve. So What you really have is relief or revolt. That's Miami, you see, And issues like Vernon being shot are triggering mech- anisms.” Miami News - May 30, 1980 \f"

The Pulitzer jury on editorial writing made Dearmore their unanimous first choice. His editorials, the jury said, ‘‘speak to the highest principles, in graceful, literate and often quietly beautiful language. Each subject showed a well-rea- soned approach, un- common insight and sensitivity ...” But the Pulitzer Prize Board overruled the jury and gave the prize to Robert L. Bartley of the Wall Street Journal, the ju- ry’s second choice. Why? : . “Just plain merit,’? says Richard Leonard, editor of the Milwaukee Journal and a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board. ‘‘All the [finalists’] entries were there and we read them and his were the best.”’ ; Another board member offers an- other possible explanation: ‘‘Bartley had been nominated before and lost. I guess the boys [on the board] figured he’d fi- nally earned his shot.” . Bartley had, indeed, been nominat- ed before. He was a finalist in both 1976 and 1978, and he lost both years. “Lose once and your chances of winning next time the board sees your name are pretty damn good,” one Pu- litzer loser-turned-winner told me last year when I was writing a series of ar- ticles on the Pulitzers for the Los An- geles Times.

Board members deny that they are consciously influenced by such factors, and there is no proof that they were so influenced this year. But several board members admit that—in the words of one—‘‘We're only human. If you have three or four entries that are all good, all pretty equal, you might be more likely some time to vote for the guy whose name you’ve seen up there before.”’ ‘That is not the only inequity in the Pulitzer process. Through the years, critics have also charged that: e The New York Times and Washington Post, both with representa- tives on the Pulitzer board, dominate the selection process. 33 years—confirm © The board is reluctant to give more than one prize in one year to any paper except the New York Times. ° The board too often overrules the individual nominating juries, even though each jury spends three days judging one category and the board has only one day to decide all twelve journalism Prizes (plus the five arts prizes). My study of the Pulitzer process dis- closed another prob- lem: on several recent occasions, board mem- bers have voted to give a Pulitzer to a small newspaper, even though they conceded that a larger paper had actually submitted a more deserving en- try. “Editors just have a special place in their hearts for small Ppa- pers,’’ one long-time Pulitzer juror told me. Well, this year, the Pulitzer Prize Board gave no Pulitzers to the New York Times, no Pulitzers to the Washington Post, no Pulitzers to really small news- papers—and three Pulitzers to the Bos- ton Globe. Moreover, the board overruled the journalism juries only twice—as com- pared with four times each of the Past two years. And unlike 1978 and 1979__ and many previous years—when jurors angrily denounced the board for over- ruling them, there was virtually No con- troversy about the board’s decisions this year. “We don’t feel we were overturned or undermined,” says Judith Brown, ed-_ itor of the New Britain (Connecticut) Herald and chairman of the editorial- writing jury. “The Wall Street Journal [entry] was our unanimous second choice.

Foremost among these changes was the strict requirement that juries submit their final nominations to the board in alphabetical order—not in preferential order, as most juries have previously done. Juries were told they could also submit any supplemental comments—— including a preferential ranking——as ad- visory matter, but that the board would not feel bound by these preferences and would not regard its decision as = ruling” the juries.

They overruled only the editorial-writing jury and the national-reporting jury. | . In national reporting, the jury named Joseph P. Albright of the Cox Newspapers as its first choice for a_ se- ries of articles he wrote on energy. The jury’s two other finalists were from the Des Moines Register and the Los Angeles Times. . But the board decided to give the award instead to the St. Petersburg Times for its series on the Church of Scien- tology. That series had been entered in the public service category and was a finalist there. The board agreed with the public service jury, however, that the public service award should go to the Gannett News Service for its series on financial mismanagement of contribu- tions and loans by the Pauline Fathers. So the board moved the St. Peters- burg entry to the national reporting cat- egory and gave it that award. Larry Jinks, editor of the San Jose (California) Mercury-News and chair- man of the national reporting jury, was not as distressed by this decision as many jury chairmen have been in past years. - “There’s some obvious frustration when you devote three days of your time to reading all those entries, and then the board gives the prize to someone else altogether,” he says, “‘but I don’t have Amn Pe aI Tht O O in the quality of entries in their category anyway—a feeling echoed by several board members. “There was a general consensus on the board that the national reporting en- tries were quite a bit weaker than they should be,” says Thomas Winship, edi- tor of the Boston Globe and a member of the Pulitzer board. The acknowledged weakness of the national reporting category this year probably helped defuse any criticism of the board. The board’s decision to pub- licly announce its switch of the St. Pe- tersburg entry also helped, since board decisions have characteristically been kept secret, and that secrecy has invari- ably fueled speculation and dissent. But in response to recent criticism, this year’s awards were the most open in Pulitzer history: for the first time, all finalists were publicly identified. That, too, served to mitigate any criti- cism of the board. Jurors did not work three days for nothing. Their nominees did get some public recognition—not all of them as winners, perhaps, but they at least got the satisfaction of being identified as finalists, near-winners. In past years when board members have been criticized for overruling normi- nating juries, board members themselves argued that it was the juries that should be criticized. Too many jurors lacked the knowledge and sophistication neces- sary to properly evaluate the entries in their categories, board members said. That is why there has never been a year in which the board did not over- rule at least one nominating jury. One year, they overruled seven out of cight— and gave Pulitzers to three people not even listed as finalists by the juries. In fact, the board has ignored all jury nominations in a single category 44 times in 55 years—most recently in 1978 (when the board gave the com- mentary prize to William Safire of the New York Times) and in 1979 (when the board gave the cartooning prize to Her- bert Block of the Washingion Post). These were the decisions that en- raged jurors the most—and engendered the most controversy. Last fall, the board decided the best way to resolve that problem was to get new—and bet- ter—jurors. They started that process this year. More important, two board members participated in the selection of the jury chairmen this year, rather than leave the choice entirely to Richard Ba- ker, the Columbia University professor who serves as secretary to the board and administrator of the prizes. That change, board members say, yielded stronger, more experienced jury chair- men—chairmen who did not let juries nominate poor entries or ignore the board’s demand for an alphabetical list- ing of finalists, as has often happened in the past. ; ““We didn’t have any juries just. giv- ing us one entry this year and saying, Here, take it or leave it,’”? one board member says. . Last year, the cartooning j; i just that—providing only one once and refusing to name anyone else when the board expressed displeasure with that nominee’s work. So the board gave the Pulitzer to someone else. This year, the board gave Pulitzers only to people nominated by the juries—and, generally, to the juries’ first choices (when those choices were expressed). Thus, better jury chairmen super- vising better juries produced better se- lections. Result: the board—operating in a more open environment than ever be- fore, more sensitive to criticism than ever before—made fewer overturns and no outright rejections ... and encoun- tered less criticism. “I wouldn’t say the board’s smug, but we are pretty pleased with ourselves about the way things turned out this year,’? says board member John Hughes, publisher of two small weeklies in Massachusetts and a former Pulitzer Prize-winner himself. Next year, with a new jury list— assembled from recommendations made by all members of the board—the juries should be even stronger and more di- verse. But as Hughes says, “It’s too early to say the new system will always work.” One year virtually free of con- troversy is not exactly a pattern, and neither good juries nor good choices will guarantee freedom from controversy in future years. The Pulitzers have almost always invoked controversy. So long as they retain their prestige—and so long as no one devises an infallible, comput- erized system for choosing winners each year—they will probably be controver- sial in the future, too. After all, despite the changes in- troduced this year—-stronger jury chair- men, new juries, alphabetical listing of finalists, announcements of all finalists, addition of the first black, first women and first non-journalist to the Pulitzer board—some shortcomings in the selec- tion process remain. _ The board, for example, is still dominated by the East and Midwest, and the prizes reflect that. The Dallas Times Herald was the only paper west of the Mississippi to win a Pulitzer this year. In the last 11 years, papers in the eastern half of the United States have won 113 of the 124 Pulitzers awarded. But no system is perfect. No matter what rules the board enacts—and no matter what winners it selects—there will always be criticism. After all, one editor who has harshly criticized the board for giving so many prizes to the New York Times, Washington Posi and other “big, establishment papers” in re- cent years responded to this year’s prizes by saying, ““How can you give out 12 Pulitzer Prizes and not give even one to the New York Times or the Washing- ton Post or the Los Angeles Times? It’s just not possible that in a full year, not one of those papers did a single thing worthy of a Pulitzer.” . Washington Journalism Review - June 1980 (Continued) \f"

Their performance was less dashing, but Much more successful and maybe just as he- roic, as that, of the similarly named Army ‘Delta Team which led the U.S. commando raid to rescue American hostages in Iran. For security reasons, SAC has not identi- fied the five Air Force officers and enlisted time, at least, the United States really wasn't — as one headline writer put it — “one mo- ment from Nuclear War.” Of course Delta Team didn't know that when the first warning came in from NORAD between | and 2.a.m. on June 3. - The team’s Warning System Controller — . a captain or a major ~ received that stagger- message on one of the two TV-like screens g toward America from Russia and from _ Russian submarines off U.S. coasts.

        "ocr_text": "Washington Correspondence Joseph Albright on the fail-safe failure “An Air Force watch officer heard a beep-beep-beep sound from his com- puter terminal. “Instantly, the watch officer saw a message appearing in English on the computer screen warning of multiple launches of Russian missiles. . . . “At the same instant, three identical computer terminals began beeping out the same information in three other underground command posts. “One was at the Strategic Air Com- mand operations center near Omaha, Neb., where a red telephone is waiting to receive an order passed down from the president to launch an American nuclear counter-attack. “At SAC headquarters, the senior command post controller-an Air Force general-sent a telephone order simultan- eously to the 20 SAC bomber planes around the country. The order directed the bomber crews on ‘alert’ duty to rush to their bombers and start the en- gines,...” In the early hours of June 2, 1980, for three horrifying minutes, nuclear war with Russia was a possibility. The “false computer alert that sent U.S. pilots scurrying to their nuclear bombers was canceled when three Air Force generals, casting ‘votes’ through a telephone conference call, decided that the Russians had not launched an attack against the United States,” wrote Joseph Albright, a national reporter in the Cox Washington bureau. Chief of Bureau Andrew J, Glass says: “Less than a week after the NORAD in- cident occurred, Albright wrote the first narrative account of how the Air Force duty officers actually handled the erroneous warning of a Russian missile attack. This story still stands as the most graphic and accurate account of what occurred in those critical three minutes.” In the following months, Albright, - who has been on the Washington scene since 1971, penetrated deeper and deeper into the circumstances sur- rounding the story until he was able to write the first definitive newspaper series ever, entitled ‘The Message Gap,” on defects in America’s nuclear command and control network. While avoiding military jargon and sensationalism, each article exposes yet another potentially dangerous aspect of this vital system. Some examples: July 31, 1980: “Evidence from two months of interviews and document- searching around the country suggests that America’s nuclear missile early warning system is more seriously flawed than the Pentagon has acknowl edged. The Pentagon knows of th flaws but hasn't found funds in its budget to repair them any time soon. (Nevertheless, Albright tells his reader that his extensive inquiries tend to com) firm that the U.S. was “not close t launching an accidental war.”) September 21, 1980: “In their 196 military posture statement, the Joi Chiefs of Staff predicted a ‘widespre loss of connectivity’ (a “message gap”) between the president and his com manders in the opening minutes of # nuclear war. They said this loss would be caused by the powerful electrom netic pulses that can travel hundreds miles from a high-altitude nucle burst, then burn up or upset electron and computer circuits,” September 21, 1980: “.... behind chain-link fence, is one of the two three U.S. Military bases a preside would need during any internatior crisis or hint of a Russian surprise tack. “No leak, no secret document, disgruntled crypto clerk was needed find the spot. . . As a result, the Defem: Department's ‘current space operations| are vulnerable to disruption.’ ‘..,.a high-ranking scientific ad4 viser to (then) Defense Secretary Hare Brown called it ‘unforgiveable’ th such a critical base is ‘within bazook range of a highway.’ “If 1 start listing all the weaknesses, | would see your hair stand on end, but I won't,’ the official said.” September 23, 1980; “In his 1979 State of the Union message, President Carter said that one “relatively invul- nerable\" Poseidon (a submarine equipped with America’s most in- timidating weapon system) carries enough warheads to destroy ‘every large and medium-sized city in the Soviet Union,’ What he failed to add was that once a war starts, he might not be able to send messages to Poseidon submarines.” Following the publication of articles containing the aforementioned quotes, and others in “The Message Gap” series, Albright sent copies of his stories to various national security offi- cials. The response was gratifying. Joseph P. Addabbo, chairperson of the congressional subcommittee on de- fense: “I want to commend you for the extensive research you conducted in writing these articles.” Zbigniew Brzezinski, national secur- ity adviser in the Carter administration: “You have done an extraordinary amount of research into an extremely complex problem... we are very much aware of the problems you raise and others.” Caspar Weinberger, defense secre- tary: “They strike me as very good arti- cles indeed, and after a few appoint- ments are made, | would hope we can get them to the right people.” And that he is doing. A few weeks after his appointment was announced, Weinberger said that improving the country’s command and control system was “a very important part” of his plans. According to Glass, additional steps have been taken to rectify the problems outlined by Albright: e The Air Force has announced plans to upgrade security around the Califor- nia satellite station which controls presidential communications. e Former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, after reading the articles, asked the Pentagon for a report on their accu- racy. The resulting study — parts of which remain classified — confirmed the existence of “deficiencies” and said programs were underway to correct them. e Former President Carter gave ap- proval to a $345 million speed-up in programs to “reduce the vulnerability” of the country's missile warning and communications networks. It is be- lieved to be the first time any president has stated that his communications links to his military commanders might be vulnerable to disruption in a crisis.

        "ocr_text": "46¢ computer chip blamed for false alerts By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — With a Soviet corre: spondent listening, a Pentagon official said Tuesday two false U.S. strategic nu- clear alerts were caused by one faulty electronic chip costing 46 cents. Dr. Gerald Dinneen, the MIT scien- tist who oversees the Pentagon's multi- billion dollar communications system, said at a press conference: “The Defense Department has made’ human judgments an integral element of the overall warning system. We are con- fident we will catch all false alerts, no matter how they are generated.” He said an investigation has concluded “with high confidence” that the chip mis- takenly sent a series of ‘‘” digits, each meaning a Soviet missile had been launched, to the Strategic Air Command in Omaha and the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon, The chip should have transmitted all zeros since the U.S. spy satellites and other missile sensors had detected no problems. Zero js the chip's way of say- ing “all clear,” When this occurred June 3, military duty officers in Omaha quickly obtained direct readings from the sensors and the alert was canceled in three minutes and 12 seconds. A false alert June 6 lasted three minutes, The chip, about the size of a dime, is in the headquarters of the North American Air Defense Command deep in Cheyenne Mountain, near Colorado Springs, Colo, The investigation indicated that the false alarms did not result from poor maintenance, bul that devices such as the faulty chip, which defense officials sald cost 46 cents, simply wear out, A correspondent for Tass, Albert Bobi. kov, pressed Dinneen on whether the De- fense Department or the White House had told Moscow directly about the alert, Bobikov, who is an accredited corre- spondent even though presumed to be a Soviet spy, got no direct reply, He left the briefing fuming.

        "ocr_text": "Fail safe: missions, no American nu- clear bomber has ever passed this point since Hiro- shima and Nagasaki. In fact, no B-52 has taken with nuclear weapons in its bomb bay since Defe: Secretary Robert McNamara canceled further air- borne alert flights in 1968. So it was fitting that Teodor gave the full, by-the-book name to the ‘Pic- Tap” — that point where a bomber must turn back! unless it has received a positive “Go Code” for a nu- clear strike. His listeners were the five other crew members, all professional Air Force, all in their 30s — and one reporter from Cox News Service who had been al- lowed by the Strategic Air Command to fly along to observe SAC’s “Global Shield” exercise. The result was a glimpse in unusual detail of exactly how one element of the nation’s “fail-safe” procedures work. The operating rules for the manned bomber, which would theoretically drop half of America’s megatonnage in a nuclear war, are very similar to those governing the launch of U.S. land and sea-based missiles. NO DOUBT SAC chose to give an outsider access to its inner workings because it hopes to combat any public perception arising out of a recent computer- generated false alert that the United States could tum- ble into war by accident. Dropping a nuclear bomb is not something that can be done by accident, it turns out. It takes 67 steps in the proper sequence by the pilot, the electronic warfare officer, the radar officer and the radar-navi- gator. Even then, the bomb won't detonate unless the crew knows the right five-letter code to arm its nu- clear core. Monday’s flight in ‘““The Black Widow” began at dawn in Texas. It sliced northeastward over Ohio, New York and Maine, droning onward over eastern Canada, then over the north Atlantic. There were ice- bergs below when pilot Maj. Paul Holser, 36, follow- ing the practice course laid out by SAC, banked for a huge U-turn back toward the United States. Russia was still 2,500 miles away. The plane was a B-52D that Boeing delivered to the Air Force in 1955 for $15 million each. Since then, it has flown about 4 million miles of practice nuclear bomb runs in the United States and real sorties to drop high-explosive iron bombs over Vietnam. IF HE CAN sell Washington on the idea, SAC com- mander Gen. Richard Ellis would like to retire the older B-52D model as a nuclear penetrating bomber within the next five years. He would replace the ‘D’ models with a stretched version of the FB-111, once known as the TFX and now assigned to relatively low priority missions in the Tactical Air Command. SAC contends that the ‘D’ model of the B-52 has an outdated electronics system and should be replaced by the stretch FB-111, rather than a revived B-1 Flight gives reporter glimpse of practice nuclear attack tive, but the Carter administration included no funds in its latest budget. The Black Widow was just veering southwest- ward when the radio headset in every flight helmet began squawking out a message from the SAC com- mand post in Omaha: ‘ “Sierra-7-6-2-Juliet-Alpha-2-3-1-8-0-0-charley- clarinet-out.” It was one of the coded messages SAC broadcasts on set frequencies that are weil known to Russian intelligence agencies at least every 15 minutes. Presumably, SAC also has some covert channels for sending the same orders if they really were from the president, but these extra frequencies remain national secrets. THESE 15 WORDS and digits are SAC’s mech- anism for transmitting the ““Go Code\" to any bombers that previously had been ordered to take off and await instructions. “We have certain formats the message has to fit,” explained Maj. Wayne Roberson, the 39-year-old elec- tronic warfare officer, whose job includes transcrib- ing the words @ pad. “We don’t have the slightest idea what is in it until we decode it.” For that task, Roberson and radar officer Lt. Col. Robert Gasson, 38, must remove a code book, known as the “authenticator,” from a double locked duffle bag stowed in the plane’s nose. Then the two men, working on separate decks of the cockpit, must trans- late the code into an intelligible message. (To prevent fakery, SAC changes the “authenticator” documents frequently.) If the president had indeed decided on an Ameri- can retaliatory strike, the message would be terse — something like “execute” a previously planned mis- sion. Well before the B-52 was ever ordered into the air for an airborne alert, its crew would have been briefed on its targets and routes should the need come. THE ORDER TO “execute” is also known as the “Go Code.” Theoretically, the crew could be given the “Go Code” before takeoff, but it can be received any time before the plane reaches its own pre-set ‘‘Pic- Tap,” or turnaround point. At the “Pic-Tap,\"’ the crew is under orders to cir- cle and then return home unless it has received posi- tive instructions to proceed in the form of the “Go Two officers must translate the ““Go Code” before it is valid, and then it must be rechecked by the B-52 commander in the pilot’s seat. But Roberson said: “If we had a real war-type message, we'd all want to double check.” A bomber crew has the right to query SAC head- quarters by radio, if it can, to verify that there has been no misunderstanding. But no call-backs are necessary. “You have to assume that by the time it gets to you, it’s gone through the various headquarters, and it must be valid, because the decoding documents are so exacting for all the pieces to fall into place,” said Roberson. FOR THE PURPOSES of the “‘Global Shield\"’ exer- cise, the crew of the Black Widow knew they had a simulated “Go Code” when they took off. About an hour southeast of the “‘Pic-Tap”™ point, the bomber flew past the second wartime milepost, marked on the maps as “Hypothetical Hour Control Line.” That means it is, in wartime, an hour from Rus- sian defenses and it is time to drop to low altitudes to avoid radar detection. At the “HHCL” it is also time to begin pre-arming the four 1.2 megaton nuclear bombs that The Black Widow would ferry to Russia. On Monday, its bomb bays carried nothing, but back at Carswell and the 19 other U.S. SAC bomber bases there are roughty 100 other B-52s like it on “ground alert,’\"’ meaning they are loaded with bombs and ready to take off. Radar-Navigator Teodor, seated in a windowless compartment below the pilot's deck, was the key man in getting the simulated B-28 hydrogen bombs ready. OPERATING FROM a yellow printed checklist headed “Bomb Run (Nuclear),\"’ Teodor began flipping toggle switches and turning dial handles as his seat Partner, radar officer Gasson, confirmed each step on bomber, since the refurbished plane could be procured the intercom. One of these steps required the electron- ics warfare officer, sitting at least a dozen feet from either the pilot or the radar-navigator, to pull and stow a lock handle that keeps the bombs in place even if the release mechanism is actuated. Two further safety devices, installed in the B-52 at different times to satisfy succeeding administrations’ needs for an absolute ‘Fail Safe,\" worked to prevent Teodor and Gasson from arming the weapons by themselves. One is a set of three toggie switches inside a clear plastic cover just behind the pilot’s seat. For a bomb to be armed, the pilot must break a wire seal. open the cover and flip the three switches before Teodor can prepare the bomb to explode. The second, added about five years ago, is a panel to Teodor’s left, about the size of a cigar box cover, with five buttons that can be flicked to select different letters. It is known as a coded switch in the arming circuit. Unless Teodor has been told the right code, he can’t cause a nuclear detonation, even if the plane it- seif has been given a fuily authenticated “Go Code” for its nuclear strike. IT IS WITHIN the power of the radar-navigator, the radar officer and the electronic warfare officer, acting in concert, to open the bomb bay doors and let an unarmed nuclear weapon drop out. That could cause a small high-explosive blast and the scattering of some plutonium, but no nuclear reaction. The Black Widow had dipped to 600 feet above the pine-covered hills and lakes of northern Maine when it came time for the practice bornb run. By then, Teodor had ploughed through most of his 67-item checklist — including such steps as turning a dial to “Bomb Function” and pulling an overhead handle to release a bomb lock. Bumping along above the treetops at 330 nautical miles an hour, the crew tries to plop each hypothetical bomb within a few feet of a hypothetical target. They do it by a 30-year-old radar bombing system that can- not pick out targets effectively in hilly terrain while the pilot uses another obsolescent terrain avoidance radar scope to avoid crashing. The checklist ends with no time for philosophical qualms or moral agonizing. First, an orange light il- luminates on the pilot's instrument panel. “Bomb Latches Not Closed and Locked,\" it reads. THEN, A FEW seconds later, a second orange but- ton goes on: ““Bomb Doors Not Latched.”’ Then, a third: *‘Bomb Doors Opened.” The voice of the radar-navigator issues over the intercom: ‘‘10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1....\" Now the fourth button lights: “Bomb Released.” And at the same instant, from the radar-navigator on the intercom, “Bombs Away.” (The crew drops one bomb at a time, but the checklist requires ‘“‘Bombs Away” to be said separately each time.) Teodor said it is possible for him to abort a bomb drop as late as one second before ‘Bombs Away\" sim- ply by changing a dial switch out of the “‘Bomb Func- tion” position. He has another black button, about the size of a roll of 50-cent pieces and connected to a black cord, that will manually release a bomb rather than allow his radar set to place it. Asked whether, deep down, the crew of The Black Widow could carry out a nuclear assignment, Teodor said: “We'd give it our best shot.’’ Then he added: “There is no doubt in my mind that if we get an ‘execution,’ it’s going to be the real thing. I am real confident that there is no computer going to send us to war.”’ Dayton Daily News June 29, 1980 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Carter Gets 7-11 Minutes Warning By Joseph Albright Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — If there is ever a Russian surprise nuclear attack on the capital, the president would have only seven to 11 minutes of warning before the first submarine-launched warhead blots out down- town Washington, according to official estimates. This cataclysmic “what if” is not new. A few civil- ian and military leaders have known about it, and tried to plan around it, ever since the Russian Navy began deploying missile-firing submarines off the East Coast in the 1960s. Until recently, officials have been unwilling to dis- cuss the spectre of single-digit warning times. One rea- son has been a reluctance to alarm the public with a “worst-case” scenario which even military analysts re- gard as remote: a “bolt from the blue” attack designed to kill the president and all his 16 congressionally au- thorized civilian successors. But in late 1978 a two-star Air Force general assigned to nuclear war preparations gave an inkling of the problem, but no details. He said in a tape-recorded interview with Cox Newspapers that he had “considerable confidence” about the ability of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) to receive and execute a nuclear strike order from the ‘president even after a massive Soviet attack. Then he. departed from the standard line to describe what he acknowledged was a “far-fetched’’ prospect: “The greatest weakness is the national command authority himself in Washington,” he said. “He must order the execution of nuclear forces, I can conceive of a submarine-launched ballistic missile attack on Washington, designed to decapitate the United States by cutting the communication modes, where there might be considerable confusion about who was in charge and who had the authority to authorize the ex- penditure of nuclear weapons.” The quotation was not published at the time be- cause no substantiating details could be elicited from other sources. The general, who remains on active Turn to ATTACK, Al0 Attack — duty, declines to be quoted by name, On Wednesday, he would only say the government has since taken some unpublicized steps to address his earlier concerns. But in the aftermath of last month’s phony nuclear alerts touched off by a faulty computer part, other government sources have agreed to talk further about the “death of a government” scenario, offering infor- mation the Russians are already presumed to know, Even so, sources said the White House directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to prepare fresh options some months ago examining pos- sible new steps aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the Executive Branch to a nuclear sneak attack. The report is due on President Carter's desk later this month, One item said to be under consideration is a rule that at least one official eligible to succeed the president must always stay away during a State of the Union address, an inauguration, a party convention or similar assemblage. Another option is a law to allow state governors to appoint congressmen in an emergen- cy. . In addition to managing the aftermath of floods and volcano eruptions, FEMA is already charged with keep- ing track continuously of the whereabouts of the congressional leaders and cabinet members who might ultimately become president. During this year's State of the Union address, a PEMA status board in the Pentagon reportedly showed one cabinet member away from Washington, An admin- istration source said, however, that this was only a “happy coincidence.” At least twice a week the Joint Chiefs of Staff are briefed by Navy intelligence on the latest estimated po- sitions of Russian Delta-class subs that are stationed on a rotating basis in the Atlantic and Pacific.

In the Atlantic, at least two Soviet Delta subma- rines usually cruise in well-defined tracks east of Ber- muda, rotating on tours of about 60 days each, military sources said, The Navy's Atlantic fleet headquarters at Norfolk, Va., has a high-priority assignment of continu- ously tracking each missile-firing sub with floating “sunobuoys” and other anti-submarine gadgetry. A nuclear-powered Delta typically carries 16 SNN6 “Sawfly” liquid-fueled missiles, which are roughly com- parable to the early U.S. Polaris missiles. Although not considered highly accurate, each SNN6 missile packs either a singleshot 1.5 megaton city-buster warhead or three smaller warheads, all capable of exploding with the force of several Hiroshimas, About twice a year, the pattern changes and the submarines draw in closer to the Maryland-Virginia shore, ostensibly for preplanned exercises lasting sever- al days. That is when the president’s theoretical warn: _ ing time, as calculated by the Defense Intelligence Agency, dips to seven minutes. In a practice drill in 1977, President Carter “es- caped’ from Washington in roughly 10 minutes by tak- ing off from Andrews Air Force Base, Md,, in the con- verted Boeing 747 that is always on alert to serve as his wartime command post. A Marine helicopter, normally based at Andrews, must fly a 16-mile round-trip to pick up the president and fly him to Andrews, Under the law, the president alone has the authority to order the use of nuclear weapons, a power inherent in his role as commander-in-chief, Under the Constitution, the vice president automati- cally succeeds to the highest office incase the president is either permanently or temporarily unable to discharge his duties, Beyond that, the original drafters simply left it to Congress to provide by law “what offi- cer” shall act if both top offices are vacant, In 1947 the present line of succession was estab- lished when President Truman and a Republican Con- gress devised the Presidential Succession Act under which the speaker of the House becomes third in line. In the absence of the speaker, the president pro tem- pore of the Senate was empowered to act as president, The act declared that if all four top officers were unable to serve, authority would then devolve in turn on Cabinet members in order of the seniority of that Cabi- net department, Not Jong ago, some members of the House Armed Services Committee reportedly asked SAC what plans exist for launching an American counterstrike if there were no civillan commander-in-chief. They were told that officials of the Executive Branch would assemble any surviving congressmen so they could elect a new Speaker of the House to succeed to the presidency. A military source added: “Provisions do exist to get the successor and brief him about the strategic situ: ation ... If you suddenly became president, there would be a guy right behind the guy who told you that you are president saying, ‘OK, Mr. President, here is your problem,’ ” Beyond the possibility of quickly choosing an acting president, several congressional officials have the im- pression that Carter has already approved a secret con- tingency plan under which the crew of SAC’s “Looking Glass” airborne command post may be authorized, un- der highly limited circumstances, to order a nuclear counterstrike on its own SAC keeps a continuous rotation of “Looking Glass” planes airborne over the central United States, always with a general in command.

As Ford aides told it, the former president said “‘no thanks” and left after five minutes of polite talk. “He had a gut feeling it was not a workable thing to do,” said one Ford aide who took part in a virtually non- stop meeting all day Wednesday on how to divide the responsibilities in an administration led by a president and a former president. “It was just intuitive with him that it just wouldn't work.” Another longtime Ford ‘associate said: “The sticking - turned out to be our hope that Henry Kissinger could have a role, paid or unpaid.” From the Reagan entourage arose a different version: That Ford advis- ers, including Kissinger, made a se- Ties of unreasonable “demands” Wednesday evening in a 70th floor meeting with Reagan’s campaign manager and chief of staff. By this account, the Ford side’s “demands” would have required Reagan to sign away to his old rival a big chunk of presidential decision- making responsibilities. “He (Reagan) was furious,” said one Republican who has worked for Reagan through years of ups and downs. “He barely kept from boiling over.’ By a touch of irony, Reagan was only trying to make an innocuous gesture toward party unity when he let himself become involved 36 hours earlier in a last-hour effort to add Ford to his ticket. The idea was first laid on the table here Tuesday morning when six Re- publican leaders, including Sen. John Tower of Texas, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Rep. Robert Michel of Illinois, paid a visit to the 69th floor of the Detroit Plaza Hotel. “T told him it would be a nice thing to offer the nomination to President Ford,” Michel said later, “I said I thought Ford would be most appre- ciative, and it would be a nice, unify- ing thing for the party.” At the time no one in the room thought Ford was really available. Ford had, after all, told television in- terviewers as recently as Sunday that he would under no circums- tances consider running as vice president, As a pro, Michel knew that the constitution prevents presidential electors from casting their ballots for both a president and vice presi- dent from their home states, With Ford and Reagan both claiming California as their legal residences, this was an obvious sticking point — if the ticket was serious, : “We probably should have talked about it — but we did not,” said Michel. In fact, the most surprising development at the meeting was the near-unanimous sense among the advisers that George Bush would do See GOP, Al3 At 9 p.m. Teeetiy, ceived eer cus cluded Govs. J Jim ‘ot Ohio, Ford. ‘It was Reagan’s thought, and he tried to make it work,” Clements said after the collapse of the Rea- gan-Ford negotiations.

They (Reagan, his wife and staff) think Bush is weak.” By then; at least one intermediary that the vice presidential slot was available if he would signify he was ready. _ By 5 p.m. Wednesday the Reagan “side clearly believed Ford would take the job when it was formally of- fered. ‘‘It’s up to two people — Ger- ald-Ford and Ronald Reagan,” said Reaganh’s spokesman, Lyn Nofziger. Asked about Bush’s chances, Nof- ziger waved his hand off into the dis- tance ,and said, ‘‘He’s still out By then, the talks had escalated to. the highest echelon. Ford and Rea- gan met privately for about 15 minutes. Whatever was said was en- enough for a final round ’ of negotiations to be arranged on the 70th floor later in the evening.

Ford began by saying his opposition to ac- cepting the job remained. But then, under deft questioning, Ford opened = and said that, perhaps, under cer- ied conditions, he might be be willing after all. While the electronic groundswell for Ford was surging from network to network, a reporter saw a waiter carrying an ice bucket into a meet- ing room on the 70th floor. A few minutes later, about 8 p.m., Kissin- ger was seen entering the meeting room. With him were the two highest Reagan advisors, chief of § Ed Meese and campaign manager Wil- liam Casey, as well as former Ford White House aides Robert Barrett, Greenspan and John Marsh. In retrospect, this seems to have been the critical meeting at which the two sides were unable to agree on the precise definition of Ford’s up- graded role as vice President. Reagan watched the Montana del- egation put him over the top for the nomination at 11:14 p.m. Cameramen allowed into the suite to witness this long-awaited event saw nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, the only observation anyone brought back to the Reagan press room was that the nominee had several dishes of jelly beans around his room. But as soon as the photographers left, things began to happen. At about 11:30 p.m. the Secret Service was suddenly asked by a Reagan aide to assign protective details to three possible candidates: Bush, Michigan Rep. Guy Vander Jagt and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. This was presumably done as soon as Reagan or his top | staff concluded that the Ford nego- tiations were breaking down for good. At 11:37 p.m. Reagan placed the now traditional call to Bush, the man he had tentatively nixed earlier in the week. Bush accepted immedi- ately, and two of the three Secret Service details were withdrawn. On the floor of the convention, GOP party chairman Bill Brock said he understood Ford had ‘very strong, even compelling personal reasons” for the job. Austin American-Statesman - July 17, 1980 \f"

        "ocr_text": "How Warning System Gets Data By Joseph Albright Cox News Service t -WASHINGTON — Here is how America’s early warning system against Russian missile attacks is supposed to get its information: Intelligence: Using every technique of surveillance from agents to satellites, civilian and mil- itary intelligence agencies strive to pick up “strategic precursors” hours or days in advance of an attack. Low-level spy satellites regularly photograph Russian missile fileds and submarine bases. The Navy operates an enormous network of acoustic hydrophone arrays on ocean floors to track missile-firing subma- rines. The National Security Agency tries to intercept satellite and other communications. Among the closely watched indicators is whether the guidance gyroscopes of Soviet land- based missiles are “cranked up” and whether key Russian political and military leaders have left Mos- cow. “Defense Support Program” Satellites. This curiously named system is designed to sound the first alarm after an actual launch, It con- sists of three satellites parked in stationary orbit 22,000 miles up — — one over the missile fields of central Russia, the other two over the nor- mal haunts of Soviet missile-firing submarines in the Atlantic and the Pacific, They carry sensors to cap- ture the invisible infrared rays emanated at the speed of light by the hot rocket engine of an ascend- ing missile. The satellites automati- cally beam warning signals to two ground stations, one at Woomera, Australia, and the other 8 miles east of Denver, Colo. Reports then are relayed over telephone circuits to the NORAD command post 1 to 2 minutes after blastoff. The satellite reports say that a missile has been launched, but not where it is head- ing. Ballistic Missile Early Warn- ing System. Three giant radar sta- tions — at Clear, Alaska, Thule, Greenalnd, and Fylingdales Moor, England — are expected to supply confirming alerts a few minutes later if there is an over-the-pole bar- rage from Russia. At each station is a search radar the size of a football field turned sidewise. Once a missile cuts through its radar beam, a rotat- ing 84-foot tracking radar takes over. A computer figures a likely impact point and transmits the in- formation to NORAD. PAVE PAWS. At Cape Cod, Mass., a concrete cube more than 100 feet high contains a new kind of radar apparatus that can detect submarine-launched missiles in a 240-degree arc along the Atlantic Coast. Known as a phased-array ra- dar, PAVE PAWS uses electronical- ly steered beams which can change their point of focus in milliseconds. The old rotating radar dish has been eliminated. A West Coast PAVE PAWS is now undergoing final tests in central California, To cover the Gulf of Mexico and other waters to the south, America relies on another phased array radar at Eglin Air Force Base as well as several old conventional radars that are due to be phased out. Cobra Dane. This radar station on Shemy Island, Alaska, is used mainly to collect intelligence on the tracks of Russian test missile launches, Its backup duty is to relay missile warnings to NORAD. Safeguard. Ten years ago, when Congress scrapped the Safeguard anti-ballistic missile system, it de- cided to retain its 12-story-high “pe- rimeter acquisition” radar near Con- crete, N.D. Unlike the ballistic mis- sile early warning system, it can track and predict the probable tar- gets of Russian multiple-warhead missiles. It also gives NORAD a means of confirming submarine- launched missiles from Hudson Bay and other northern waters. Its range is limited to 1,800 miles. Nudets Detectors. VELA satel- lites carry special light-detectors, known as bhangmeters, to record the double-flash that is peculiar to a nuclear detonation. A signal from a VELA would be final confirmation that America was under attack. Palm Beach Post - August 3, 1980 \f"

Morris and Joseph Albright Constitution Convention Bureau _NEW YORK — The Democratic Na- government use federal revenues to fund abortions for poor women. The abortion issue was adopted on a vote of 2,005.2 to 956.3, while the one to deny campaign funds to ERA foes won on a voice vote. Georgia's delegation voted 29-27 in favor of the abortion plank, with seven delegates not voting. The planks stand in stark contrast to Republican positions on women’s rights and promise to ignite a fiery debate among Democrats who fear the actions go too far and will hand the election to the GOP. Republicans at their convention in De- troit last month dropped their previous endorsement of ERA but did not flatly oppose it. The y is opposed to government-f abortions. Carol Wold, a Minnesota delegate and an abortion foe, said, “Many Americans will turn away from pro-abortion poli- tics.

The Democratic National Committee has rarely succeeded in rais- ing enough money to do more than make small investments in the presidential race and a few congressional contests.

        "ocr_text": "‘Stealth’: Cor Nee Ser WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Harold Brown tossed a curve ball at both Ronald Reagan and the Soviet Union Friday by announcing that the United States has made a “major breakthrough” in designing new kinds of airplanes that would be almost invisible to current Rus- sian radars, “We have demonstrated to our satisfaction that the tech- nology works,” Brown told a televised news conference. “This achievement will be a formidable instrument of peace, He said the Defense Department would decide by next March 15 whether to ask Congress for funds to begin build- ing a new generation of manned bombers using the so- called “stealth” technology. “This alters the military balance significantly,” Brown told the news conference. For the time being, Brown and his aides refused to say how much money was being sport on “stealth” or how the technique works, He declined to comment on reports that two prototype “stealth” planes have crashed during tests. “Regrettably, there have been several leaks about the stealth program in the last few days in the press and tele- vision news coverage,” Brown said. He was “gratified,” he said, that none of the most sensitive information about the characteristics of the Li had been disclosed.. ~ A reporter asked whether his official announcement of the “stealth” program was designed to counteract Rea- Major military breakthrough may break Soviet air defense gan’s recent charges that the Carter administration has shown weakness in the face of a Russian military buildup. Brown denied any such political motivations. But then, without mentioning Reagan by name, he said; “I think it’s a serious matter when individuals claim the United States is very weak and claim that the Soviet Union greatly sur- passes us in all categories, I think that undermines our security by emboldening our various adversaries and dis- \\spiriting our allies,” At Reagan's campaign headquarters, aides said Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, and Reagan defense advisor William Van Cleave would hold a press conference Saturday morn- ing to respond to Brown’s charge. As for the Soviet Union, Brown said the “stealth” pro- pa posed no threat of an American first-strike since any ombers using the new technology would not be com- pletely invisible to radar, Therefore, he said, the advent of “stealth” bombers would not endanger any Carter adminis- ee to win arms control agreements with the So- et Union. The Soviet Defense Ministry has spent more than $100 billion on radar installations to defend against America's current-generation B-52 bombers and the forthcoming American cruise missiles, Earlier this year, the Pentagon disclosed that Russia is developing new radar planes with a “look-down” capabil- ity for detecting low-flying B-52s. Even these latest Rus- sian “look-down” radars couldn't successfully intercept a “stealth” bomber, Brown maintained. Although Brown billed the “stealth” program as ultra- sensitive, its outlines were disclosed 18 months ago by an Air Force spokesman who was elaborating on an unclassi- fied arms-control impact statement sent to Congress by the administration. Based on that information, the Cox News Service re- ported in March 1979 that the Pentagon intended to spend million within two years to design a new bomber “that would be nearly invisible to Soviet radar defenses,” The story said designers hoped, among other things, to reduce the heat emitted from the new plane by mounting its jet en- gines inside the fuselage or wings. The Air Force already has one plane specifically de- signed to avoid Russian radar. It is the SR-71 spy P ane, built in the early 1960s partly in reaction to the Russian success in shooting down Francis Gary Powers’ U-2. Air Force officials said the profile of the SR-71 on a radar scope — known as its “radar cross-section” — is about 100 times smaller than that of a B-52, Past experience regent that a full-scale Pentagon pro- am to procure “stealth” bombers would cost at least $20 illion over a decade, Assuming Congress decided to pro- ceed next year, the first production-model bombers would begin replacing B-52s in about 1990.

It is the mechanism by which “Looking Glass” could launch any or all of the 1,000 Minuteman missiles. The plane has no mechanism for launching the 54 Titan missiles, one of which blew up in its silo in Arkansas last week. As a fail-safe procedure, ALCS can launch a Minuteman only under these circumstances: 1. The regular Minuteman launch crew in its ca’ be- neath the prairie is somehow cut off from communications with the missile silo (whether by enemy attack or a farmer cutting a cable), or 2. The launch crew on the ground permits the ALCS signal to have access to its circuitry. On board “Looking Glass,” four officers, including the a would have to act in concert to send out an ALCS order.

While it's something that may be do-able, it’s not a rational thing for the-Russians to do be- cause the subs are not their only problem.” The fragility of these links has a side ef- fect that hasn't been previously disclosed: At least some and probably all of today’s missile- firing submarines lack the kind of electronic fail-safe mechanism that keeps the Minuteman land-based missiles in the president's personal grasp. Each of the Minuteman launch-control centers, which are mostly scattered in the Dakotas, is now equipped with what the Air Force calls a “positive enable” system. A spokesman for the Strategic Air Command said this new eats oe has controlled all 1,000 Minutemen les since July 1977. It apparently also would keep the missiles from being launched by officers in SAC’s air- sph command post, the “Looking Glass” plane. “Positive enable” evidently works like the system used by some banks that allow their customers to pay bills over the telephone after dialing a “secret code” into the bank’s com- puter. In a Minuteman capsule, it guarantees that at least under a peacetime state of alert, no one can withdraw a missile without the president’s code. That code would arrive only as part of a presidential “emergency action messa be a , yy ane and a complicated firing sequence that oe eae cae dely separa ; yiLERA Hl Wien ‘Deal of the Navy age ocedune are classified.

One senator who has looked into nuclear release procedures, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said more fail-safes would be possible and desirable if the president had more reliable means of communicating with submarines fol- lowing a Russian attack. “T don’t think there is any doubt about the fact that you could have more fail-safes, with- eee on what there is now,” Nunn “8.

But both versions of the doomsday plane have an abundance of new, silicon-chip communications equipment, which is especially sensitive to burnout from electrical pulses. . The older “Looking Glass” planes rely more on vacuum-tube radios, which are more rugged. The Air Force decided not to press a case for any extra money to accelerate the refitting of the earlier models until the first E-4B was done. In 1977, the White House was cool to pone any money on doomsday planes. The first “hardened” E-4B was delivered to the Air Force in January, three years behind the original schedule.

Buchsbaum, who doubles as chief of military communications at the Bell Laboratories and member of the elite Defense Science Board. The consensus is that ingenuity can even ease the migraine that pains the Air Force Strategic Air Command most — the two or three Russian submarines which ly patrol close enough to the East to hit Washington with 1.5 megaton warheads between 7 and 11 minutes after firing.

Other “choke points” needing attention: the two satellite receiving stations that serve as the “downlink” for signals from U.S. missile warning satellites, one outside Denver and another in Woomera, Australia; a California site where an undersea cable from the Australia station comes on land; and the PA VE and PAWS submarine missile early warning sites in California Massachusetts. y (2) The Doomsday Truck Improve the standby scheme for insuring that the presi- diun'ay aoapatie sinh 1a (ar lage] tne of tereteine obrdives nuclear attack. | ; ‘ One way: Supplement today’s doomsday plane at Andrews Air Force Base by outfitting two dozen 18-wheelers as presi- dential command posts.

        "ocr_text": "Defense Satellite Control Center 7 Is Located In Earthquake Area By Joseph Albright — Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON hursday named a northern California site as the critical control point for U.S. military communications satellites and acknowledged that it is vulnerable to dis- ruption by earthquakes and hostile acts. The base’s name and location, which were consciously omitted from The Atlanta Constitution’s series on the Pentagon “Message Gap” this week, is the Satellite Test Center at Sunnyvale, Calif., the Air Force said. Responding to questions submitted by a reporter two weeks ago, the Air Force said it “has recognized the potential im- pacts associated with an extended outage’ at Sunnyvale as well as the need for in- creased satellite control capability.” In a three-page written answer, the Air Force said plans are under way to build a second satellite control base in Colorado Springs, Colo., beginning next year. The new site, to be known as the Consolidated Space Operations Center, will begin operations in 1985 under cur- rent plans, the Air Force said. As for Sunnyvale, the Air Force state- ment said: “The general fact that the Satellite Test Center is vulnerable to dis- ruption is not classified. Specifics involv- ing the degree of vulnerability and the impacts on particular satellites or mis- sions are protected at whatever classi- fication is appropriate.” The site’s half-dozen towering, dish- like antennae are about 50 yards off the heavily traveled Bayshore Freeway link- ing San Francisco and San Jose. The site has another apparent draw- back: It is on the edge of the San An- dreas fault. “ uakes were not considered in siting the control center for the original satellite program, but rather the close availability of contractor and communi- cations support,” the Air Force state- ment explained. It added: “Concern over the earthquake threat has increased with the growing workload of the Satellite Test Center.” The base occupies a corner of a sprawling Lockheed Missiles & Space Division plant in Sunnyvale. The , Force has used this corner since early 1960s, the Air Force said. The Air Force also released statement drafted last December™! reply to questions on why the Air F needed another satellite control base, {p Colorado. : In that statement, which ap i was never released, the Air Force “Establishment of the (Colorado will eliminate total dependence on critical control element of the Sa Controi Facility and will reduce || overall vulnerability of the De of Defense spacecraft control \"or neste possible natural catastrophe or ac The Air Force statement did not « any steps to offset Sunnyvale’s yu ability until the backup site is buill 1985.

        "ocr_text": "ennessee plant misstatec amount of uranium released By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — An investiga- tion into the loss of 48 pounds of bomb-grade uranium at a Tennessee nuclear fuel factory concluded Fri- day that the material was not stolen but dumped into a river, vented up a smokestack and allowed to seep into plant floors. At a meeting of the Nuclear Regu- latory Commission, staff investiga- tors reported that the Nuclear Fuel Services Inc. plant at Erwin, Tenn., had consistently understated its dis- charges of uranium into the atmos- phere and the nearby Nolichucky River. The plant, which is a chemical fac- tory and not a nuclear reactor, is the one site in the country which makes nuclear fuel for Navy submarines. Three leaks of uranium feedstock up a smokestack during a period of labor unrest in 1979 accounted for half of the missing uranium, accord- ing to the report by the NRC’s At- lanta-based regional inspection and enforcement office.

        "ocr_text": "Experience may strengthen some Hostages could face readjustment trauma WASHINGTON — The ordeal of the 52 American hostages will not end when they leave Iran. Their captivity has left marks on their minds and bodies that will change some of them, one for the rest of their ves, That, at least, is the prospect based on interviews with some experts on the ef- fects of terrorism, as well as on medical studies on the more than 125,000 Americans who have survived prisoner- of-war camps since World War II. Dr, Rona Fields, a Washington psy- chiatrist who is an expert on the effects of prolonged stress on victims of terror- ism, said; “I don’t think any one of them will be unaffected.” Rick Spate, an official of the Michi- gan Mental Health Department, said he expects the hostages to be on an “emotional high” for only a brief period after their release. ONCE THEIR status as celebritries begins to wear off, “many of them will plunge into rather deep depression that will last a few weeks to a couple of years,” Spate said. During that emotional slump, Spate said, some are likely to experience ulcers, heart palpitations, family break- ups, sexual difficulties and a higher than normal rate of auto accidents, “Some individuals, in an attempt to cope with a fairly sizable amount of anxiety, may resort to drugs, alcohol and tobacco,” Spate said. For the Americans in Iran, the most hopeful piece of evidence is a study released in August on 57 former Navy fliers who spent as long as six years in prison camps during the Vietnam War. Milton Richlin, who carried out the study for the Navy's Center for POW The stress of captivity affects some hostages long after release Studies in San Diego, Calif., told a re- porter: “Five years after their release, we found no essential differences in any medical or psychological category be- tween these POWs and a control group.” RICHLIN SAID it is unclear why these 57 suffered fewer consequences than typical POWS in other wars. “One possibility is that since we are dealing with pilots who are very su- perior individuals to start with, they may have been more able to cope,” Ri chlin said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem, where he is vacationing. He said the Navy has ordered those involved in POW studies to decline any detailed comments on the hostages’ health prospects. In general, he said, there are “strong similarities” in psychological terms between the ordeal of the hostages and that of wartime prisoners. Julius Segal of the National Institutes of Mental Health, a member the State Department's medical team to inter- view the hostages upon their release, said Saturday that he expects “a very broad range of responses” among the 52 Americans in Iran, “EVERY PAST episode has shown in- stances of extraordinary resiliency, courage and the capacity to cope,” Segal said. “On the other end of the . Dayton Daily News - range, there is the possibility that some people may suffer depression or anxi- ety, and these effects may well turn out to be transient.” Segal was co-author of a 1976 profes- sional article that reported “a stagger- ing range of physical disabilities and symptoms” among some past survivors of prolonged captivity. He listed, among others, tuberculosis, heart disturbances, arteriosclerosis, digestive disorders, disappearance of the menstrual period, chronic rheuma- tism, lesions of the central nervous sys- tem and premature aging. The paper reported: “An American POW returned from Korea was a third more likely to commit suicide ... than his non-POW counterpart, He was al- most twice as likely to die in an acci- dent, and over three times as likely to be murdered.\" | THE STUDY found similar increases in mortality rates among German, Japa- nese and Canadian POWs, A March 1980 Veterans Administration study found that 43.6 percent of all former POWs since World War II are receiving service-connected disability payments, Among all Ameri- can war veterans, fewer than 10 percent have service-related disabilities, The VA study identified “anxiety neurosis” as the most prevalent disabil- ity among former POWs. Also known as “post-traumatic stress neurosis,” this mental condition is characterized by Insomnia, survivor guilt, memory lapses and “startle” reaction, It was described as similar to the so-called ‘‘K-Z syn- drome” reported by some survivors of Nazi concentration camps, One finding in all the studies of past survivors is that damage varies widely among individuals who have undergone the same ordeal. SPATE SAID he expects roughly one- third of the 52 Americans in Tehran will emerge “relatively untouched” from their experience, He said another one-third may actually be strengthened emotionally, finding some new meaning in life as a result. The remaining third will suffer psychological problems of varying intensity, he estimated, People who are mature, stoic in out- touched by prolonged captivity, to \"wi pean ve tend to be peal V> concerned about the feelings and _ lor of other people tend to be relatively more affected, October 25, 1980 \f"

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Ronald Rea- gan charged Saturday that President Carter “wasn't intelligent enough” to continue the economic policies he inherited from Gerald Ford. ~ ph, Sharpening his rhetoric in the final days, the Republican challenger also accused Carter of misleading the public about cuts he made in _ the five-year defense plan issued by Ford in his last days in office. “He continues to deceive us and tell us that we are stronger than ever before,” Rea- gan told 3,000 partisans in Ford’s old home- town. I Continuing on the theme of defense, Rea- gan declared: “Where strength, Mr. Carter left weakness. Does any- one honestly believe that if President Ford were in office, the Soviet Union would have moved into Afghanistan?” In Battle Creek, another stop in a day of hedge-hopping through Michigan and Ohio, ‘ Reagan repeated his attack on Carter's intelli- gence, this time saying Carter “didn’t have the smarts enough” to carry out Ford’s economic programs. Ford, who introduced Reagan at the out- door rally in Grand Rapids, accused Carter of “screwing up” the economy over the last four years. Gerald Ford left: ns attacks on Carter Holding up a small piece of green and white paper that he called a “Carter dollar,” Ford said, “it makes me sad” when he sees the high interest rates and inflation harming young people. _ Ford said. that.since 1976 — when his campaign ran ads stating, “Gov. Reagan couldn’t start a war, President Reagan could” — he had gotten to know Reagan better and has greater respect for him: “Ronald Reagan is a thoughtful, deliber- ate, responsible person,” Ford said. \"The fornier president assured the audi- ence in his old congressional district that when tough decisions come to the Oval Office, Rea- gan “will counsel with wise people and will deliberate . . . in a responsible way.” __. Calling for a large vote Tuesday, Reagan said, “The inability. of Mr. Carter to handle the job — his total inability to fill Gerald Ford’s shoes — is the reason why he does not deserve four more years of being president of the United States.” ‘Reagan also planned stops in the Democrat-prone territory of Saginaw and War- ren, Mich., where auto layoffs have driven unemployment to post-depression peaks.

Before the voters even went to the polls, the Secret Service established a wooden sawhorse barrier at the en- trance to San Onofre drive, where the Reagans live in a California- style ranchhouse that rests on the side of a foothill overlooking Santa Monica Bay. It was shirtsleeve weather, with more than a hint of smog in the air, when Reagan, in a red-and-white checkered shirt, came out to vote. As Ronald and Nancy Reagan walked down their black walkway, pool reporters went through the elec- tion day ritual of asking the candi- date how he felt. Reagan, noting two crosses marked in tape on the walk- way by helpful television crews, told reporters, “‘I can’t answer till I get on my mark.”’ When the cameras were turned on, Reagan said, “‘We feel fine and it’s good to be home. It’s really nice to be home.” : A Secret Service limousine car- ried Reagan along curving, hilly ‘streets lined with olive trees, palms and jacaranda tc Reagan’s polling place. It was in the home of stock- broker Robert Gulick, a retired Ma- rine Corps officer. Two of Reagan’s neighbors, Law- rence Welk and Dodger play-by-play announcer Vin Scully, had voted by the time Reagan arrived at 10 a.m. But another voter in the 1,376th pre- cinct, Sylvester ‘‘Rocky”’ Stallone, hadn’t showed up yet. The Reagans entered through a crush of cameras and were besieged with autograph requests from poll workers. At the request of pho- tographers, Reagan held up his bal- lot. A reporter asked Reagan whom he had voted for and he replied, “Nancy.” Austin American-Statesman November 5, 1980 Two Reagan children are also reg- istered in the Was but neither appeared. Son Ro: P.

Upwind from the industrial plants, cluster-zoned houses are starting to go up in a resi- dential community that is | bail’s seaport. These supposed to accommodate 370,000 residents by 1999. The community will be di- vided into eight districts, each with a 200-bed hospital and each surrounding an inter- change of a freeway leading about five miles to the indus- trial area. The city plan also calls for 300 schools, 138 mosques and a rest stop for Moslem pilgrims. Although the temperature often reaches 120 degrees in the summer, it was a pleasant 75 when a reporter toured the site a few days ago. With white beach-quality sand and a blue Arabian Gulf in the distance, the setting was agreeable enough for Z.I. Sawares, a Bechtel employee conducting the tour, to re- mark: “It reminds you of Sau- salito (California).” — The first of the eight plan- ned hospitals is already in operation.

In addition to overseeing development of the entire complex — for which the Saudi government will pay $80 billion by 1999 — Bechtel is also directly responsible for a $9 billion-plus contract for houses, roads, sewers, utilities and the rest of the infrastruc- ture for Jubail.

        "ocr_text": "Israel Cautiously Awaits Reagan Mideast Policy By Joseph Albright Cox News Service JERUSALEM — The night Ronald Reagan was elected, Knesset mem- ber Ehudd Olmert was returning from maneuvers with his Israeli Army unit. He remembers the bus vibrating with soldiers’ cheers when the driver tuned in the election news. Olmert, like a good many impor- tant Israelis, is feeling different vi- brations now, With Israel approach- ing a national election next year and with inflation hitting 138 percent annually, there is a sense that Israel Shamir Golan Annexation Plan Dropped Post Wire Services JERUSALEM — The Israeli govern- ment yesterday blocked an effort in parliament to annex the occupied Golan Heights of Syria, apparently fearing international rebuke and heightened Mideast tension. Prime Minister Menachem Begin’s Cabinet voted 11-2 to oppose the an- nexation bill when it comes up Wednesday in the Knesset, or parlia- ment. But government spokesmen said other legislation will be explored that would tighten Israel’s grip on the Golan without actually annexing it. Israel captured the area from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and has ad- ministered it as occupied territory ever since, The right-wing Tehiya Party spon- soring the bill said it would raise the issue as planned and would also present a no-confidence . motion against the government for what it called its “cowardice and stupidity.” Both actions are expected to be de- feated since the Labor Party, the largest opposition group, and other left-of-center factions also oppose an- nexation. Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir reportedly warned the government to expect angry international reaction if it supported the annexation bill. The United States has publicly told Israel that by annexing the 450- square-mile area on its northeastern border, it might violate international Turn to MIDEAST, Al0 is perilously dependent on Reagan’s benevolence. “At first people were very happy about Carter’s failure,” he said. “I personally don’t think it is as simple as that. I can very well see Reagan saying, ‘OK, we would like to stop the Russians, but in order to be tough against Russia, we have to be in very good relations with the Saudis and the Egyptians.’” For some Israelis, one test of Reagan’s intentions will be how the new administration responds to the next request from Saudi Arabia to sell arms, That indicator likely will be available early on. The Saudis have asked Washington for acces- sories to extend the striking range of the F15 fighters which they are ob- taining under a 1978 sale approved by the Carter administration. The first of 60 F15s are due to be turned over to Saudi pilots next Sep- tember. Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan has said he expects the planes to be fully equipped — meaning accompanied by long-range fuel tanks, external bomb racks and aerial refueling tankers, Former Israeli Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Mordechai Gur, a leading figure in the Labor Party, said “Once the Saudis will have a certain amount of weapons of a certain quality, we shall have to consider them a con- frontation country. If you ask me, it won't add to the health of the Middle East, to the health of the United States, for the Saudis to become a confrontation country to Israel.” Reagan took hard-line, pro-Israeli positions in the campaign, calling the Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion a “band of thugs” and cham- pioning Israel as “a major strategic asset to America.” But in a country that regards it- self as a beleaguered island in a sea of hostile Arabs, apprehension con- tinues over American sensitivity to Turn to ISRAEL, Al0 oil pressure, “You squeeze Israel, you weaken it, and to weaken an ally in this situ- ation is self-defeating,” said Dan Pattir, Prime Minister Menachem Begin’s press spokesman. Olmert, a member of the Knesset committee on the security budget, said the level of American foreign aid will be the “single most impor- tant factor that the government of Israel will be sensitive about.” “That's the leverage the U.S. has on us in a way, since if the US, gives us less in foreign aid, we will have to take it from ourselves. We will have to make the pressures from within sharper and more acute ... I think they know it and we know it.” America’s $2.2 billion package of grants and loans underwrites about 30 percent of Israel's military budget and 8 percent of its civilian budget. Israel's finance minister, Yigael Hurvitz, is in what the Jerusalem Post calls “possibly t ever faced by a finance minister in the country’s history.” Inflation has tripled since Begin became prime minister in 1977. Like almost everything, the price of milk went up 25 percent in October and another 15 percent in December. An indexing system pushes wages up at the same time, but not as rapidly as prices. On the eve of an election year, Hurvitz has been trying to push through the cabinet an anti-inflation budget calling for belt tightening in defense and social spending as well as a form of wage-price controls. Hurvitz has been accused by Likud associates of hurting poor people and causing unemployment. The opposition Labor Party wants a nationwide vote next spring. One published opinion poll showed Labor leading Begin’s Likud Party 54-23 percent, with nearly half the respon- dents undecided. Begin, who narrow- ly escaped a no-confidence vote in the Knesset last month, clearly hopes nothing will happen to force elections before next November. Begin has come under criticism for having sacrificed Israel’s securi- ty by turning back the Sinai to Egypt. Among Arab mayors on the West Bank, there is no sign of will- ingness to participate in the local self-government scheme envisioned in the Camp David agreements. A Labor victory would signal an effort by Israeli negotiators to con- vince Arab parties to acquiesce in the formation of a Jordanian-Pales- tinian state with its military forces and its capital east of the Jordan River. The idea dovetails with Reagan’s campaign statement that there should be no more Israeli withdrawals or changes in the se- curity position on the West Bank “until Jordan and other neighbors make peace.” Under the Labor proposal, Israel would keep its line of strategic set- tlements along the mountains of the West Bank. But those parts of the West Bank which Israel does not need for defensible borders would join the Kingdom of Jordan in the new Jordanian-Palestinian state “The big change,” said Chaim Herzog, Israel’s former ambassador to the United Nations, “is that we are, for the first time, accepting the formula that says we will talk to any Palestinians who dissassociate themselves from the obnoxious ele- ments of the Palestine covenant and from terrorism.” The Palestine cov- enant calls for the destruction of the “Zionist state.” On the face of it, the Labor Par- ty’s proposed solution does not come close to satisfying even the moderates among Palestinian Arabs living under Israeli occupation on the West Bank. Their minimum ob- jective is the return of the old city of Jerusalem and all other Arab ter- ritories captured by Israel in the 1967 war. “We are better off now, with world opinion gradually coming over to our side, than to accept a nego- tiated settlement on half of the West Bank,” said Zafer al Masri, the act- ing mayor of the West Bank city of Nablus.

        "ocr_text": "Unrest Quiets House of Saud ‘Widens Control By Joseph Albright Cox News Service RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — The Saudi ruling dynasty, shaken a year ago with violent demonstrations by Shiite Moslems in the Eastern Pro- vince and the takeover of the Sacred Mosque in Mecca, apparently has re- gained its equilibrium. That is the prevailing assessment in Riyadh by Saudis and expatriate observers, including some of each who are not admirers of the monar- chy. They say that barring some ex- ternal event, such as a war, the House of Saud is likely to rule over the Arabian Peninsula through the mid-1980s and perhaps longer. From King Khalid, the current monarch, a line of succession runs through his more than 23 surviving brothers, all sons of the warrior leader King Ibn Saud who completed the conquest of the peninsula early in this century. A junior generation of princes, many of them educated in the West, are in key positions in the Army, the ministries and in private business. “In Iran, the Shah was only one man, but Saudi Arabia has a well- rooted dynasty which has controlled a good part of the Arabian Peninsula for 200 years,’’ said Mideast intel- ligence man. Most Saudi watchers on the scene dispute the assumption in the overseas press that Saudi Arabia is “potentially one of the most unsta- ble’’ countries in the world, as Busi- ness Week magazine phrased it re- cently. Last year’s incipient pro-Khomeini protest movement by Shiite Mos- lems in the oil-producing region of Eastern Saudi Arabia appears to have been defused for the time be- ing. The Shiites, who compose only about 5 percent of the Saudi popula- tion, traditionally have suffered slights at the hands of desert-dwell- ing Sunni tribes that have blood ties to the royal family. The Saudi rulers can scarcely ig- nore the Shiites if they want to keep their oil flowing. The industrious Shiites hold roughly 40 to 60 percent of the manual jobs in the oilfields. Some of the main oil pipelines to the coast run on the edge of Qatif, the biggest Shiite community. Khalid did much to ease Shiite re- sentment last month when he unex- pectedly decided to grant a petition from elders of Qatif for the release of about 150 young Shiite demonstra- tors. They had been in jail since last year’s bloody incident at the Qatif oasis in which about 10 Shiite dem- onstrators and one Saudi national guardsman were shot to death. The violence ignited when a visit- Iranian Shiite leader was de- tained by Saudi authorities, alleged- ly for calling on local Shiites to show allegiance to the Ayatollah Khomeini. His arrest led to street protests on Ashura, the day of atone- ment on which Shiites traditionally flagellate themselves. The shooting reportedly broke out when a truckload of Saudi national guardsmen met Shiites carrying pro- Khomeini placards in the street. In the confusion, one national guards- man is thought to have been shot ac- cidentally. y contrast, passed quietly. Among Shiite businessmen in the Eastern Province, word spread that the Shiite elders had assured Khalid there would be no trouble this year if he freed the demonstrators. And in the meantime, Saudi national guardsmen in Qatif have undergone training in riot-control tactics. A few days after releasing the de- monstrators King Khalid and his brother, Crown Prince Fahd, flew to the Eastern Region for a 10-day roy- al visit. Touring from town to town, the king’s entourage announce sewer, irrigation and housing de- velopments at every stop. Although they skipped Qatif, the official Saudi Gazette noted a few days later that the Ministry of Agri- culture was establishing a project there to grow 240 tons of vegetables a year. A rush sewer project also has been authorized. On the western edge of Saudi Ara- bia, meanwhile, this year’s annual pilgrimage to Mecea by 1 million Moslems also passed without  in- cident. There was no recurrence of the episode last year when perhaps 350 fundamentalist fanatics burst into the Sacred Mosque that encloses the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest site. They de- manded, among other things, that all Shiites be banned from worship- ing at the Kaaba. For two weeks they holed up in the mosque’s labyrinth until they were finally routed. Their leader, who proclaimed himself the Mahdi, or messiah, was killed in the fight- ing and 63 of his followers were later executed. The calm in Mecca this year has tended to strengthen the vew that the appearance of the _ self-pro- claimed Mahdi was a purely reli- gious happening that marked the start of the 1400th year of Islamj; rather than an attempted coup against the royal family. Islamic historians noted the appearance of another Mahdi a century earlier. In some high Saudi circles, it is Said that the greatest ‘“‘threat’’ to the stability of Saudi Arabia’s mon- archy comes not from some obscure sect in the desert but from continu- ing American pressure for high oil production. this year’s Ashura Saudi Arabia now spends an aston- ishing amount of money, much of it wisely, but with instances of blatant waste. Everyone seems to know a story about a lavish housing project that remains vacant for several years or a young prince winning a $60 million contract from a ministry in which his father has influence. The country is building three of the largest airports in the world, streets lined with marble ministries, mosques, air bases, industiral cities, housing projects, universities and palaces by the dozen. Even so, Saudi Arabia cannot come close to spending all it earns. By informal estimates, government spending inside Saudi Arabia will run about $80 billion this year, while oil revenues will exceed $100 billion. The surplus is being’ invested abroad, but at the risk of inflation and devaluation. “The problem is that we will prob- ably always have no less than 25 percent more income than we need to spend inside Saudi Arabia,” said planning minister Nazer. As a consequence, mamy educated Saudis would like to see Prince Fahd cut oil production to keep some in the ground for future Saudi genera- tions. Fahd has given no sign that he will do so.
