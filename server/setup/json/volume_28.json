        "ocr_text": "Russians pound rebels Hostages’ fates unknown as Chechens fiercely resist By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Near Pervomayskaya, Russia — A _ Kremlin-sanc- tioned military thrust to free some 100 hostages from their Chechen rebel captors in southern Russia bogged down Monday into a bloody standoff that dragged into the night. Nine hostages were freed, but the fates of the rest were unknown as night fell. Dozens of rebels and two Russian sol- diers were killed. Every five minutes or so, flares from Russian helicopter gunships lit up the cold night sky over the hapless village as artillery boomed. The rebels, estimated to number between 150 and 250, put up fierce resistance with small arms and rocket-pro- pelled grenades and knocked out several Russian armored personnel carriers. Gen. Mikhail Barsukov, who was in charge of the Rus- sian operation, said the attack was launched because rebels had started killing hostages Sunday. The rebels denied the charge. “We want the terrorists punished and wiped out from the Chechen land,’”’ Russian President Boris Yeltsin said. “If necessary, we are pre- pared to conduct military ac- tion by night,” a Russian mili- tary spokesman said. The Interior Ministry in Moscow said 60 rebels were killed, 15 seriously wounded and an unspecified number of others captured. Two Russian servicemen were killed and at least 16 wounded, ministry duty officer Anatoly Zinevich said. All day long, TV viewers nationwide saw broadcasts of Russian artillery and helicop- ter gunships raining rockets on Pervomayskaya, where the guerrillas were holed up in basements, schools and a mosque. By nightfall much of the village, nestled a few miles from the Chechen border, had been set afire and Yeltsin’s elite anti-terrorist comman- dos claimed to have captured “a significant portion” of the village. But the Chechen guer- rillas claimed to hold the cen- ter of town, along with dozens of “human shields.”’’ Launched on the eve of the opening of the new parliament in Moscow, the delay-plagued rescue mission underscored Yeltsin’s growing political iso- lation. Even Yeltsin’s de facto vice president, loyal Prime Minister Victor Chernomyr- din, made clear that he wanted no part in the military opera- tion to roust the surrounded Chechen hostage-takers from their positions in the hitherto peaceful Muslim province of Dagestan, which abuts war- torn Chechnya. “Why did they let the col- umn from Budyonnovsk go?’’ asked Kamal Aliyev, who wait- ed in a van on the outskirts of the village, where his brother was being held by the rebels. He referred to a similar, bloody hostage-taking last summer in the Russian city of Budyonnovsk. In that case Russian authorities let the Chechen gunmen leave with hostages and return home. The hostages later were released. Yeltsin said Pervomays- kaya was attacked only after Russian officers intercepted a radio message from Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev or- dering the execution of hostages. But this was disputed by the chief Chechen hostage- taker, Salman Raduyev, who is Dudayev’s son-in-law. In a ra- dio message played in the Che- chen capital, Grozny, Raduyev said, ‘“‘Not a single hostage was killed [Sunday] or today, and we have no intention of killing them.”’ Shortly after dawn, Barsu- kov made one final contact with guerrillas inside Pervo- mayskaya, giving them 10 minutes to walk out waving white flags or face attack.

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT - Outside Pervomayskaya, P Russia — Chechen rebels hold- ing scores of hostages resisted a fierce Russian onslaught for a second day Tuesday as fellow rebel gunmen seized 30 more hostages in Chechnya and com- mandeered a Turkish ferryboat with 165 people on board. Sporadic rocket and artillery attacks rained into the remote village of Pervomayskaya in an attempt to free the hostages, but the military apparently was re- luctant to wage a more fierce as- sault that would threaten the lives of innocent civilians. Up to six Russian soldiers have been killed in the two-day onslaught, including Col. Andrei Krestyaninov, commander of an elite rapid-reaction force leading the attack, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 40 troops were wounded. About 100 Chechen rebels have been killed, news agencies said. — While the standoff continued in the desolate rural patch of Da- gestan, a mostly Muslim republic in southern Russia, Chechen gunmen made good a threat to at- tack Russians outside their na- tive region by seizing a ferryboat bound for Russia from Turkey with 120 passengers and a crew of 45. The gunmen told Turkish television they would blow up the boat in Istanbul’s Bosporus 0 6 %e on 0 e VO C BD Photos by Associated Pre Two rescued female hostages cling to each other as they pass through a group of Russian soldiers Tuesday after being taken from Chechen rebels in heaving fighting in Pervomayskaya: shipping lanes, unless Russia al- lowed the rebels in Pervomays- kaya to go free. “If the Russians do not free our 250 friends in the northern Caucasus, we are going to blow the ship up in Istanbul’s Bospo- rus,’’ the gunmen ’s leader, iden- tifyving himself only as Moham- med, told private Kanal-D tele- vision. About a half dozen gunmen seized the ship in the Turkish port of Trabzon and threatened to kill the Russians on board if the ship was not allowed to leave the port. It subsequently set sail for an undisclosed location. In Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, gunmen reportedly seized 30 workers at an electrical power plant. Alexander Zdano- vich of the Federal Security Ser- vice said the workers were driv- en away in buSes. Negotiators from the Interna- tional Red Cross and a Muslim association said the Chechens demanded to exchange their Russian hostages for the Che- chens under siege in Pervomays- kaya or for a large, unspecified sum of cash, according to Rus- Sian radio reports. The widening Chechen crisis posed a serious threat to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his chances for re-election in June if he decides to run for a-second term. Yeltsin’s approval ratings have plummeted since he sent Russian forces into Chechnya 13 months ago to put down an inde- pendence movement in the largely Muslim republic 1,000 miles south of Moscow. Wide public opposition to the war, which has cost at least 20,000 lives, is partly to blame for Yelt- sin’s declining popular standing.

He is the only bright young man of the Nikita Khrushchev 1960s who clawed his way upward into Gorbachev's 1980s Communist Party Politburo and then dis- played the talent, loyalty and flexibility to wield power in Yeltsin's post-Soviet regime of the 1990s, For the last five years, Primakov has run Yelt- sin’s external spying agency, somehow avoiding blame when his super agent Aldrich Ames was unmasked in 1994 as a mole in the CIA. And now, at 66, Primakov has become the only senior spy boss since the 1917 Russian Revolution to jump from the shadows and become Moscow's foreign minister, Judging from the words of his official spokes- man over the last month, Primakov will tell Chris- topher that Washington's pet project of expanding NATO is “totally unacceptable,” on grounds it would let the West station short-range nuclear rockets on Russia's borders, He also will want to rearrange the architec- ture of the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations so he can exert just as much influence as Washington in brokering the details of a Golan Heights set: tlement, “Russia could obviously play a greater role acting as a co-chairman of the peace conference,” said Primakov, who has studied Arabic and spent most of his career specializing in Middle East intrigue, Based on what Primakov said as chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency, he also is likely to tell Christopher that Russia must push its sales of armaments abroad s0 it does not become marginalized as a “raw materials appendage” in the world economy. y He can be expected to assert that Russia has every right to spread its influence anew through- Out former Soviet territory such as Georgia, Be- larus and Ukraine, Born in Kiev and raised in Georgia's capital, Thilisi, Primakov graduated at the height of the Cold War in 1953 from Moscow's prestigious In- stitute for Oriental Studies, whose top graduates often were recruited as future KGB spies, During anti-Western Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser’s heyday in the 1960s, Primakov was posted as a “foreign correspondent” in Cairo for the Communist newspaper Pravda, That al- most surely means he was a Soviet intelligence operative, at least part time, Under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, Prima- kov fell from favor after Nasser’s successor, An- war Sadat, expelled Soviet advisers from Egypt and turned Egypt westward, But in 1982, think: tank scholar Primekov resurfaced by publishing a book on world politics that caught the attention of rising Politburo member Gorbachev, When Gorbachev came to power in 1985, he plucked Primakov for a prestigious post as Krem- lin foreign policy adviser and director of the Insti tute of World Economy and International Rela tions. One of Primakov's co-workers at the insti tute, he has said, was his “close comrade” Don Maclean, the infamous British defector and spy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 9, 1996 \f"

Secretary of State Warren Chris- topher eased Moscow’s horror about the eastward expansion of NATO: on Saturday by privately assuring Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov that it won’t happen this year.

Yet after six hours of get- acquainted talks in a Finnish guest house beside an ice-bound bay, the only tangible agreement was that Russia and the United States will undertake to “‘manage their dis- agreements” and avoid confront- ing each other with ‘‘surprises.” Gone were the syrupy words of ‘‘achieving full partnership” that used to be heard at high-level U.S.-Russian meetings through the early 1990s, when Primakov’s liberal predecessor, Andrei Ko- zyrev, was foreign minister. , “‘We have differences and ap- parently there will. be differ- ences,” said Primakov, 66. “But all this must be done without going into confrontation.” Both foreign ministers said the most prominent “difference” in- Palm Beach Post volves NATO plans to expand the membership of the military alli- ance to include former Soviet bloc members.

Using the mildest language on NATO that any Russian official Has employed for months, Primakov told the international press that NATO expansion would be “unde- sirable.”” But he ducked a question on whether Russia might redeploy tactical missiles to counteract NA- TO’s move.

Although there are other strong candidates, including ultranationalist Viadimir Zhirinovsky, many commentators believe the election will come down to a straight showdown between Yeltsin and Zyuganov.

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Russian Communists provoked a tempest from the Black Sea to the Baltic on Fri- day when they led parliament to demand restora- tion of the old Soviet Union. “Scandalous,” retorted Russian President Bo- ris Yeltsin. “Not Ukraine, not any of the other of the former Soviet republics will come back to the Soviet Union under the red flag.” Leaders of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine reacted immediately and negatively to the overwhelming 250-98 vote by the Russian State Duma. Their fear is that the specter of the past raised by the Duma well may portend future policy in Moscow if the Communist Party retains its cur- rent lead in campaigning for the June 16 presi- dential election.

The vote raised the question of what happens if Russian authorities eventually decide that the 15 post-Soviet states are really not sovereign nations. It was the first muscle-flexing by the Commu- nists since they led last December’s parliamenta- ry elections and captured a third of the seats in the State Duma. Now, restoring the Soviet Union is a priority plank in Zyuganov’s campaign, as is abolishing the office of the Russian presidency to return to rule by a system of soviets, or councils. Yeltsin charged that the action rammed through the Duma by Communists linked with ul- tranationalists was an effort “to disrupt the presi- dential elections.” The lower house of parliament actually adopt- ed two measures.

In Saratov and neighbor- ing Volgograd provinces, Com- munists won more than 28 per- cent of the vote in December’s parliamentary election, com- pared to 15.2 percent and 14.2 percent two years earlier. ‘But a reservoir of often gtidging support for Yeltsin, coupled with antipathy many feel toward another bout of Commu- nist domination, still might be compounded by skillful politick- ing into victory for the 65-year- old Russian president.

But this is a joke. It won’t happen.” It certainly wouldn’t be easy, especially in Saratov province, where 45 percent of the people don’t even earn the official sub- sistence wage of $52 a month. » Chernishkin’s factory, which designs and manufactures heli- copter and airplane navigation equipment, is one of scores in Russia’s old industrial power- house now enfeebled by disas- trous economic conditions.

This city, 450 miles southeast of Mos- cow, is in Russia’s economically depressed heartland, where 45 percent of people earn less oa $52. a month. Besides suffering a _ steep drop in orders, factories cannot pry from the government full payment for what they produced last year. Chernishkin’s factory got paid 70 percent to 80 percent of what the government owed. Late wages and underem- ployment have snowballed not only across factories but also throughout public and private workplaces. Chernishkin said Yeltsin has no realistic economic rescue plan but might be a more accept- able candidate if he unites with other democrats who do. So far, democratic groups remain split. Acknowledging that clearing wage arrears is crucial to his success, Yeltsin promised when announcing his candidacy last month that he somehow would cure the backlog and resume full wage payments by March 1. It hasn’t happened. “If we had elections today, we could certainly say Yeltsin wouldn’t get to the runoff,” ad- mitted Alkhan Kulyev, a local Atlanta Journal-Constitution leader of the pro-Western party Democratic Choice of Russia. “Still, he has three months, and if he is active enough, he will able to score some points.” Yeltsin has gotten some help from the International Monetary Fund, which is giving Russia $10.2 billion in credits spread over three years. It should pro- duce nearly $1 billion by the June election, although not all of it will be available for paying off the $2.5 billion in back wages. Finance officials have indi- cated they will try to stop the growth in arrears — starting to pay full salaries again by April — then worry about the debt to workers later. “It’s necessary to make peo- ple feel that things are changing for the better,” said Kulyev, whose party probably will back Yeltsin. ‘““How to do that in con- crete terms? Of course, to pay salaries on time. Of course, to cut down unemployment. Of course, it’s necessary to find a way to solve the Chechen crisis.” - March 17, 1996 \f"

        "ocr_text": "ANALYSIS — U.S. know-how: led allies, foes to nuclear club: By Joseph Albri And Mares Rated STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Over the past half century, 5 the biggest nuclear proliferator in the world has been the United States. The historical record is unmistakable. Most other members of the world “‘nu- clear club” can trace their first nuclear bombs to American atomic research or American fissionable materials: @ Britain learned how to enrich uranium, Before the collapse of communism, the ' Soviet Union was also far from blameless. In fact, a case can be made that the sta- ble old Soviet Union was a far more egre- gious nuclear proliferator than the unstable new Russia. For instance, China was able to explode its first atomic bomb in 1964 thanks largely to Moscow’s decisions in the mid-1950s to help China build up a nuclear research base. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev con- nived at Chinese nuclear ambitions, con- cludes Stanford University historian David Holloway, a scholar on Russian atomic weapons. In 1955 Moscow agreed to supply China an experimental nuclear reactor, a cyclo- tron and fissionable material. By 1960 the secret Soviet atomic research city Dubna was turning out hundreds of Chinese atom- ic physicists. Libya also got an early lift into the nu- clear age, courtesy of the cautious, stolid Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. In 1980, the Soviet Union sent 11.5 kilograms of bomb- | grade uranium to Libya for a research reac- ) tor it was building for Libyan leader Col. how to make plutonium and how to design # an implosion bomb through a joint U.S.- British research project that started in 1943. President Franklin Roosevelt ap- } J proved the project as a concession to Prime’ Minister Winston Churchill at the 1943 | Quebec Conference, over objections of the U.S. military. @ The Soviet Union stole precise engi- neering details of the American atomic Muammar al-Qaddafi. Against this background, the meltdown | of the Soviet empire in the 1990s has pro- duced astonishingly little nuclear fallout — at least so far. The worst known incident in the last five years is that one night in November 1993 a Russian naval officer carried highly en- riched uranium fuel out of a shipyard in | Murmansk. bomb in 1945 by infiltrating multiple spies | including Klaus Fuchs and David Greeng- ¢ lass in the Manhattan Project. Fuchs and Greenglass had Communist ties that went undetected by wartime security procedures which now look slovenly at best. @ France had access to crucial techniques of isolating uranium and plutonium from French emigre scientist Bertrand Goldsch- midt. Before returning to work in the French atomic agency in 1946, Goldsch- midt worked throughout the war at the top- secret Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and at an Anglo-Canadian-French atomic energy project at Chalk River, Canada. @ Israel in the mid-1950s hired a dissident U.S. atomic physicist, David Bohm, to work at the Technion in Haifa, which was then | one of the key installations of the covert fs* raeli bomb project. In another episode, the CIA has concluded, Israeli sympathizers smuggled 206 pounds of bomb-grade urani- um in the 1960s from an American naval nuclear fuel factory in Apollo, Pa. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 28, 1996 Russian police found 10 pounds of the bomb-grade treasure hidden in the officer's garage. But that evidently didn’t plug the Murmansk leaks. Early in 1995, six more pounds of uranium fuel turned up 1,500 miles away in Czechoslovakia. Its atomic | properties turned out to be virtually identi- cal with the Murmansk uranium. More Murmansks are always possible. This sprawling, mafia-ridden, chaotic, bud- get-strapped country has to try and guard about 30,000 nuclear warheads and tons of plutonium and bomb-grade uranium for which there is no inventory. If that weren’t enough, Russia is also struggling to suppress a grim rebellion in secessionist Chechnya, whose leaders have threatened to attack nuclear installations. Yet Russia sometimes doesn’t even have enough rubles to pay the salaries of the cus- todians of the warheads the Chechens may be tempted to seize.

        "ocr_text": " Election sparks Yeltsin offer of mediator with Chechens By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Facing voter hostility to the war in Chechnya, President Boris Yeltsin finally de- tailed a pre-election plan Sunday to halt most mil- itary action immediately and find an intermedi- ary to negotiate with the secessionist republic’s leader. It was the first time Yeltsin declared his will- ingness to negotiate with the elusive Chechen na- tionalist, Dzhokhar Dudayev. The Russian presi- dent listed several potential intermediaries who have offered to serve as go-betweens, including an unnamed “‘Arab sheikh” and the emigre Soviet dissident Yuri Orlov, now living in the United States. Yeltsin’s nationwide television address, which served as a lead-in to a free-flowing interview with three Russian TV anchors, represented his most flexible approach yet to the conflict. Change of position It was a sharp change from his position out- lined in his annual message to the nation five weeks ago, when Yeltsin ruled out talks with Du- dayev saying, ‘We are not going to make a deal with bandits.” Yeltsin has admitted that the continuing battle in Chechnya is his biggest hurdle to winning re- election in June. On Sunday night the television news magazine “Itogi,” run by Independent Tele- vision, broadcast new nationwide poll results showing 57 percent of the Russians questioned fa- vored talks between the two sides, while only 28 percent opposed them. Yeltsin said he was stopping ‘‘all military op- erations” by federal troops in Chechnya as of midnight Sunday, would present to parliament the issue of amnesty for rebel fighters, and would set in motion elections for a new legislature in the republic. But he also promised that soldiers will contin- ue to combat “terrorist actions” by the Chechen militants, raising questions over how much com- bat actually will be curtailed. Moscow considers all fighting by the Chechens “terrorist” action. “A stage-by-stage withdrawal of federal forces from tranquil areas of Chechnya is begin- ning,” Yeltsin said, referring to about two-thirds of Chechen territory where local leaders have agreed not to harbor rebel fighters. An estimated 30,000 Chechens and Russian soldiers have died since Russian forces rolled into the Caucasus Mountains republic on Dec. 11, 1994, three years after Dudayev declared inde. pendence from Russia. Moscow largely had ig- nored the declaration until then. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 1, 1996 Ascciated Press ale r Yeltsin has admitted that the _ - continuing battle in Chechnya is. his biggest hurdle to winning re- election in June. Yeltsin did not tone down his animosity toward Dudayev on Sunday, saying the former So- viet general had sheltered a nest of criminals in Chechnya, was willing to foment a third world war, would resort to use of chemical weapons and generally had ‘‘terrorized’” the people of Chechnya. But in promising to restart talks that broke down last December, Yeltsin suggested Dudayev could play a role in subsequent Chechen elections. “The most important condition that we cannot overlook, that we cannot agree to, is the indepen-. dence of Chechnya,” Yeltsin said. That is the con- dition Dudayev’s forces have refused to abandon, just as they have shown no interest in ending their fight. Yeltsin also tried to spread the responsibility for achieving a peaceful settlement, announcing creation of anew commission with members from | the executive branch and both chambers of par-. liament to tackle the job. Last week Yeltsin’s Communist Party oppo- nent for the presidency, Gennady Zyuganov, pro- posed his own plan for settling the Chechen con- flict. It was not much different from Yeltsin’s plan, calling for a temporary cease-fire coupled with political negotiations. \f"

        "ocr_text": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Russians scoff, still may keep Yeltsin By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Sherbinka, Russia — Dis- gruntled voters whose divided loyalties among pro-democratic parties allowed Communist and nationalist candidates to lead the past two elections in this Moscow suburb are grudgingly coalesc- ing around President Boris Yelt- sin’s re-election bid. “Even those who support perestroika and reforms are crit- ical of Yeltsin, but they don’t have much of a choice,” said Mayor Vladislav Tkatchko. He said many voters in Sherbinka, which has mirrored national trends, remain undecided but are realizing that if moderates fracture their vote again in June, the Communists could retake control of the Kremlin. President Clinton may nudge a few more reluctant Russians toward Yeltsin’s camp this week- end while meeting with the Rus- sian president in in talks that promise to be long on warm and fuzzy platitudes and short on rancor. Whatever the spinoff of the visit, Clinton will find Russia’s election increasingly defined as a two-man contest between Yelt- sin and Gennady Zyuganov, a Communist. In this bedroom community cal sentiment more. closely tracks that of heartland Russia than it does the loose and liberal capital, Moscow, where Yeltsin is most popular. In Sherbinka, bitterness over the Yeltsin gov- ernment’s economic changes re- mains widespread. As in the provinces, residents suffer from failing factories that don’t pay local taxes and are be- hind on salaries. One administra- tor said the town pulls in only half the taxes it is due. In December’s parliamenta- ry elections, such dissatisfaction gave the Communist Party a plu- * rality, with nearly 20 percent of the vote, similar to its nationwide lead at 22 percent. Another one- fourth of the voters in Sherbinka supported other leftist or nation- alist parties. é The majority voted against the Communists and national- ists, but, in a pattern mirrored across the country, their support was divided among the dozen or more centrist parties on the ballot. With the presidential cam- paign in full swing, voters who disdain a return to Communist power feel they have no place to go except Yeltsin’s camp. “I’m for changes in the coun- try, but I don’t know who will carry them out. I will vote for freedom and democracy, but for whom, I don’t know,” said Lud- milla Kulakova, an elementary school principal. “I don’t think Yeltsin will keep his promises. But we want changes in Russia. I don’t know who can do it if not Yeltsin. I don’t see any alter- native.’’ Interviews at the street mar- ket, the town hall and the school in this town of 26,000 produced one voter who clearly had decid- ed to vote for someone other than Zyuganov or Yeltsin: a young tax policeman who supports ultrana- tionalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky because he promises to restore order. | Several undecided voters were leaning toward Yeltsin even though they said they haven’t written off liberal econo- mist Grigory Yavlinsky. Julia Vorobyov, a 20-year-old housewife and mother of a tod- dler, first said she would vote for Yeltsin or Yavlinsky. But then she added, ‘“‘Since Yeltsin started {reforms], we should let him finish.”’ Zyuganov’s supporters also were easy to find. They included pensioners — conjuring up mem- ories of the glory days of Soviet communsim — and workers an- gry over late pay and reduced public services. Eleanor Protasova, 57, based her opposition to Yeltsin on the issue that may be most critical for him: the civil war in Chech- nya: It continues to churn out body bags despite a new Yeltsin peace plan, which has proved in- effective. “I cry every night before the television set when I see our boys in Chechnya,”’ said Protasova, an English teacher. ‘‘We teach them here and they kill them there. Our schoolboys. So I’m going to vote for Zyuganov despite his shortcomings.”’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 19, 1996 \f"

By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE OREKHOVO ZUYEVO, Russia — Calling America “our bloody adversary,” ultranationalist presidential hopeful Vladimir Zhirinovsky powered into his final campaign dash Friday hop- ing anti-Western tirades will carry him straight into the Kremlin. Far behind in all polls, Zhirinovksy is hoping to dupli- cate his stunning feat in the last two Russian parliamentary elec- tions of tripling his ratings in the final week of the campaign. As before, he is counting on his gift for insult and innuendo to attract the 18 percent undecided voters heading into the June 16 vote. President Boris Yeltsin is the front-runner, according to the polls, followed by Communist Gennady Zyuganov. A second round will be held in July if no candidate receives a majority. “Harvard is a branch of the CIA,” Zhirinovsky told a cam- paign rally at this textile city 60 miles east of Moscow. “It is where the American special ser- vices teach people to destroy other countries that are adver- saries of the United States.” The West ‘will be happy with any candidate but me,” he said. “The United States of America is preparing war against us and will be on the Russian borders in the autumn.” Only one Russian leader in this century, Josef Stalin, has been tough enough to stand up to Westerners hungering for Rus- sian natural resources, Zhirinovsky said. “Stalin made mistakes, but he was a tough leader,” he said of the Soviet dictator who ruled from 1926 to 1953. To achieve a last-minute surge, Zhirinovsky has been increasing the volume on his attacks on President Clinton. “Clinton is worse than Hitler,” Zhirinovsky told a news conference a few days ago, complaining about an alleged U.S. plan to “dismember” Russia.

Things have quieted since those early Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 9, 1996 > Time to choose: Old or days. Yeltsin slowed the process, getting a handle on the plummeting ruble and beginning to tame inflation that had been multiplying at 20 percent a month. But services that used to be free are still too expensive or nonexistent, such as the day care centers and vacations that big government-run factories used to offer. Pensioners will never replace the savings gobbled up by inflation. And prices are still dizzyingly high. Under such conditions, Zyuganov’s promises have resonated among many voters who say they would willingly trade the freedoms of democracy for the certainties of the Communist era. At the Karl Marx cooperative, Molo- duyev said he could afford less than 100 tons of fertilizer this year compared with the 2,000 tons he used to get under agrar- ian subsidies. Fuel is prohibitively ex- pensive. Tractor prices are out of sight. Besides subsidizing basic supplies. their products than they sold for at stores. Now the farmers must compete. Things simply aren’t working at the rickety Karl Marx farm. On a recent vis- it, the bakery wasn’t baking. Meat proc- essing had stopped because the grinder edad broken, and the walk-in cooler didn’t cool. Production is down 30 percent from where it stood five years ago. The aver- age salary is 260,000 rubles ($52) a month, about half the national average. To Moloduyev, 44, Yeltsin’s recent decree allowing the sale of farmland is heretical. Everyone at his farm has his own quarter-acre or so for growing pota- toes, enough private property for any- one, he said. “People believe in the collective, even more deeply than before,”’ he said. “At our meetings, people often say, ‘God forbid that We fall apart. We must stay together by all means to survive these hard times.’ We think it is temporarv. We think our top rulers will bring order in our country.”’ Under agrarian reform, Karl Marx kolkhoz was given to its farmers in the form of shares. They chose to hold it col- lectively, and their joint stock company works just like the old collective. But not everyone has stuck to the old ways. About 18 percent of the farms are “reorganized,” where people used shares to buy real property at auction, said Sergei Bezrukov, head of the prov- ince’s reform program. new Ne EL ae in He 8 en ee PAST & BATE Akay cashew ies ! The owners may work cooperatively, but each is responsible for his own prop- erty. And individuals may sell their land. At the reorganized farm Niva, about 20 miles east of Karl Marx, Evgeny Mik- heyev said his group of 67 owners want- ed complete control. Their farm grows all the forage their animals eat, slaugh- ters and processes meat into 14 different products, then sells directly to stores. Niva’s profits last year were 1.76 bil- lion rubles or nearly $375,000. In Bezru- Kov’s district the 20 farms grouped col- lectively made a profit of only 500 mil- lion rubles or about $100,000. Niva kept the district in the black. *\"Now people have videos and audios, and housing construction is going pretty well,”’ said Mikheyev, 47. Any owner who wants to sell his piece of the farm could get about $20,000. Mikheyev thinks a Communist re- gime wouldn’t stay in power “long enough to stretch their hands to the vil- lage’’ and undo the changes at his Partic- ular 4,500 acres. “But in general, for the country, itis very important because as soon as they come to power, even if they do not change anything, panic will begin any- way,” he said. ‘‘The ruble will fall in- stantly. Investments will be stopped.”’ Nadir Hafizov of EkOil agrees. He ’ has a lot to lose if the Communists come back and control profits, renationalize companies and take back privatized property. Alexei Molo- duyev, director of the Karl Marx farm coopera- tive in Kishino, wants the gov- ernment to put a lid on prices and restore subsidies to farmers be- fore his ailing meat and dairy farm falls apart.

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — For most Mus- covites, the day after the Soviet Union collapsed was just another day. Traffic jammed.

DODSON / Staff Vladimir Galitsin on Jan. 1, 1992. That was the day Yeltsin — president of an independent Russia for less than a week — freed prices as part of radical economic reforms aimed at ending shortages and implant- ing capitalism. The cost of meat, sugar, but- ter, baby food, salt and other staples tripled overnight. But within a month, goods began re- turning to shelves. Yeltsin had demanded ex- traordinary powers from the Soviet parliament in November 1991, promising to lift people’s year. No “Yeltsin hired Tgor’Gaidar, a 35- . year-old Western-oriented economist, as his economic oh}: ] \fRUSSIA AT A CROSSROADS czar. Gaidar and his crew of vi- sionaries, including Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs and Swedish reformer Anders As- lund, set out “as if they wanted to tear apart with their bare hands the entire decrepit sys- tem,” Yeltsin wrote afterward. Gaidar’s “shock therapy” broke economic bottlenecks, but at tremendous social cost. Defense factories began clos- ing. Average people saw their savings vanish through infla- tion. Rampant criminality re- placed the rule of law. Yeltsin backed away from radical reform in the second half of 1992, leaving the Rus- sian economy a half-Commu- nist, half-capitalist hybrid that handicaps it to this day. = WHITE HOUSE SIEGE The burp-burp of urban warfare dragged on for two days. Finally, in the late after- noon of Oct. 4, 1993, a tank fired a 125mm coup de grace into the 13th floor of the Russian White House, as the parliament build ing is known. That silenced the last main rebel outpost and end ed a two-day insurrection by Communists, fascists and othe rebels. Yeltsin came within a milli- meter of being overthrown. A 2:30 a.m. that day, he was dri’ en to the Defense Ministry an appealed to the generals to shoot. The generals lowered their heads in embarrassment Yeltsin recounted, and “the lawful government hung by a thread.” Even his defense minister, Pavel Grachev, hesitated. Sensing vacillation, Yeltsin barked, “I’ll send you a written order,” and brusquely strode out. Confronted with an un- equivocal order, the military re- luctantly kept Yeltsin in power — and may have saved the country from civil war. = WAR IN CHECHNYA In fall 1994, Yeltsin secretly authorized the Federal Coun- terintelligence Service (FSK) to assassinate or overthrow Dzhokhar Dudayev, the sepa- ratist leader of Chechnya who in 1991 had declared the repub- lic’s independence from Russia. But on Nov. 26, the FSK opera- tion collapsed. Now the Kremlin had to de- cide whether to escalate into an overt military attack or to talk peace. The FSK — a branch of the ex-KGB secret police — was for escalation. So was Defense Minister Grachev. Yeltsin did not raise serious questions about whether the plan would work. And so hastily prepared Russian armored col- umns rolled into Chechnya on Dec. 11, 1994. With no support from the air force, the tanks bogged down and the Chechens rallied. So began the most embar- rassing, most brutal and most | politically ruinous chapter in | Yeltsin’s presidency. Seventeen months and 30,000 lives later, | Yeltsin negotiated a cease-fire on May 27, a month after a Rus- sian rocket finally killed Dudayev. = MONEY FLOWS Russia was facing a govern- ment liquidity crisis in late Jan- uary 1996. Complaints were en- demic about state factories withholding wages, sometimes for as long as six months. With Yeltsin’s poll ratings stuck at 6 percent, his re-election chances seemed hopeless. Then on Jan. 25, Yeltsin made a pledge: “From March 1, I will establish my personal control over the timely payment of wages, scholarships and pen- sions throughout Russia,” he said, “There will be no delays.” ¢ No one knew what secret money pot Yeltsin had in mind. Five days later, President Clin- ton announced America’s en- dorsement for a three-year $9 billion loan on highly favorable terms from the International Monetary Fund. On Feb. 22, the IMF ap- proved the loan on even sweeter terms than Clinton endorsed, increasing the loan to $10.2 bil- lion while also releasing anoth- er $1 billion payment under an earlier IMF loan. In the best news of all for Yeltsin, IMF managing director Michel . Camdessus said Russia could use the money to pay off back wages.

Communists would return to Lenin’s mixed economy By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Paim Beach Post Staff Writer MOSCOW — Today’s Rus- sian Communist Party harbors a nos ic vision of the future: to jump Russia backward seven decades to a brief giddy period when Lenin deliberately let capitalists get rich.

His platform looks toward a Russia where small capitalism thrives alongside a beefed-up state sector that manages “our natural treasures.’’ He says government will subsidize sci- ence, education and the mili- tary-industrial complex while fighting unemployment with tax breaks. Zyuganov insists that there will be no “confiscation” of property, no closing of churches and no forcible at- tempts to regain lost Soviet republics. He would nationalize the vodka industry, turning it into a centrally controlled cash cow\\ for social spending. Private banks will continue to exist, Zyuganov promises. In fact, they would get state pro- tection from the hazards of competing with foreign banks.

His platform says Russia’s present crisis resembles Amer- ica’s_ Great Depression, and cites the model of Franklin D. Roosevelt who pulled out of chaos by increased spending. He also holds out China as a model of how to revive an econ- omy by disciplined reforms, not “shock therapy.” He _ rarely mentions Marx, Engels or Le- nin. Zyuganov says Russia will revive in three stages. Stage One (1996-1997) will be an emergency effort to stabilize production, while Stage Two (1998-2003) looks forward to industrial growth. Only in Stage Three (2004-2010) does the program take on faintly Marxist overtones and envision the ad- vance toward socialism.

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS . Moscow — Communist Party presi- dential candidate Gennady Zyuganov, a bull of a man who worked indefatigably in past campaigns, plodded homeward Fri- day with an inexplicably quiet finish to the most important race of his life. As 20 million “undecideds” all over Russia were making up their minds about whether to return the Communists to pow- er in Sunday’s election, Zyuganov can- celed his only announced public appear- ance of the day and was absent from the hurly-burly of the campaign hustings for the fifth day in a row. On Friday night, the two big state- owned Russian TV networks each opened their evening news with 6/2 minutes on President Boris Yeltsin’s vigorous final campaign rally in his home base Yekater- inberg. Campaigning is not allowed today. This was followed on both networks by much shorter slices of air time for most of the other nine candidates in Sunday’s first- round balloting. Even Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president who has been running eighth in most polls, got 25 seconds. The only contestant who went unmen- tioned on Friday night’s state news broad- casts was the 51-year-old Zyuganov, who is shown in every poll as the one candidate with a chance of unseating the 65-year-old Yeltsin. Zyuganov’s invisibility wasn’t just the result of the enveloping grasp of Kremlin news management, which has skewed cov- erage in Yeltsin’s favor. Zyuganov made no public appearance that would have giv- en the TV networks the broadcast footage they needed. Zyuganov did give an interview to CNN that was broadcast in the United States and spoke with local television in St. Pe- tersburg, Russia’s second-largest city. Zyuganov sounded confident of victory and rebutted allegations that he planned to reverse Russia’s democratic reforms. “‘We are for freedom of speech — it will be guaranteed by law. Freedom of political activity — it will by guaranteed by law,”’ he told St. Petersburg television. OLEG NIKISHIN / Associ Security sweep: Police search men for weapons during a raid in Moscow as part of an effort to combat potential violence surrounding upcoming elections. A new poll released Friday suggested that a victory by Yeltsin in Sunday’s first round was. not that certain. Pollster Nuz- gar Betaneli put Zyuganov ahead with 35.6 percent, compared to 32.7 percent for Yeltsin. Although the lead is questionable given the 3 percent margin of error, other polls in recent weeks have put Yeltsin in the front, many by 10 percentage points or more. A runoff election is likely in July since neither of the front-runners is expected to win an outright majority. Yeltsin concluded a campaign that has seen him erase a once-huge lead by Zyu- ganov in the polls at a sun-drenched rally and rock concert in Yekaterinburg, the city where he was Communist Party chief from 1976 to 1985. “Over five years we have suffered a lot of blows. But we also learned a great deal. Now we must not give way,” he told the crowd. Surveys have shown that an over- whelming majority of the undecided vot- ers are angry at Yeltsin’s pro-market re- forms, but worried that a return to com- munism might be worse. By a 2-1 majority the undecideds are women, and most of them get their news from television, which added to the significance of Zyuganov’s lack of coverage on state TV. Why Zyuganov chose to remain in vir- tual seclusion in Moscow was unknown. Based on Zyuganov’s own fragmentary Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 15, comments on Thursday, the most likely ex- planation is that he was sure of makjng it into a second round of voting and was sav- ing his best shots for the expected three-' week presidential runoff campaign be- tween him and Yeltsin. “We are confidently going to the elec- tion and one can say we have already won,” Zyuganov told a press conference that was one of his few public events all week. “Two-thirds of Russians support our ideals.’ To win on a second round, Zyuganov needs the endorsements of minor candi- dates facing first-round elimination. On Monday he held a lengthy meeting with ul- tranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirin- ovsky, who has lately been casting himself as a centrist. Two leaders of the Communist Party’ s Moscow party secretariat appeared. at the House of Journalists and spoke of the par- ty’s plans to conduct a parallel vote.count. “Unfortunately, there is too much’ evi- dence to show that plans are afoot to rig the elections,” said Alexander Kuvayey, first secretary of the Moscow City Party Com- mittee. The Communists, who have 500,000 members spread thinly across the country, plan to deploy an average of two poll- watchers in each of the 93,000 polling sta- tions. Each will be instructed to exercise a poll-watcher’s' legal right to demand a signed copy of the official precinct results. gh} To \f"

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel COX NEWS SERVICE MOSCOW — Russians began fateful balloting today to decide whether to entrust the Kremlin for the rest of the century to their mercurial reformist President Boris Yeltsin or to the revamped Communist Party. ““A choice between anger and fear,’ headlined the Moscow Times on election eve, capsuling the frustration millions feel in choosing what is widely per- ceived as the lesser of two evils. Reveling in the latest come- back in his dramatic up-and- down career, the ebullient Yeltsin went so far as to predict he will lock up the needed 50 per- cent majority in today’s opening round of presidential balloting. But a far more likely scenario is that Yeltsin will emerge from the first round with a less- than-decisive lead over his main rival, Communist Party candi- date Gennady Zyuganov, in the 10-candidate field. Both the Yeltsin and Communist camps tid ASSOCIATED PRESS Yeltsin presents an award to Col. Gen. Alexander Starovoytov at an election-eve ceremony in the Kremlin on Saturday. are expected to claim widespread vote fraud. Today’s balloting offers a dis- tinct choice to the roughly 106 million eligible voters who reside in Russia. Yeltsin is committed to pursu- ing a capitalist democracy, but many see his reforms as having unfairly impoverished millions while enriching a few. Zyuganov, while invoking memories of Soviet-era economic security, has promised to retaina mixed economy in Russia and not to confiscate any property now considered “private.’’ How- ever, he has talked about reas- sessing property that may have been “illegally” turned over from the public sector to private hands. The party also is clear that the state must control major sectors of the economy including energy, transportation and defense industries. “IT voted for Yeltsin, and I'll tell you why,” said Sergey Bocharni- kov, a 49-year-old longshoreman who cast his ballot Sunday in the Far East port of Vladivostok. **All the country is in ruin, and as such it landed into his hands. He’s got to drag Russia out of the quagmire. And let him drag if he has strength enough.” But his neighbor Irina Shid- lovskaya, 49, said, “Zyuganov — all my hopes are for him. I live badly. I was laid off, and I can only reminisce how good it was before, when everything was for free.”’ Dayton Daily News - June 16, 1996 \f"

Russian presidential race. grabs early lead in Russian vote STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscowy — President Boris Yeltsin held a narrow lead in his re-election bid early today and appeared poised to shake up the government to buoy his chances of beating his Com- munist challenger in next month’s runoff. In Sunday’s first free demo- cratic presidential election since Russia became independent in 1991, Yeltsin gained a lead of 35 percent to 32 percent over Com- munist Gennady Zyuganov with S8 percent of the votes counted. From the suburbs of St. Pe- tersburg to Sakhalin Island 10 time zones to the east, the Com- munists lagged behind their po- tent performance in iast Decem- ber’s parliamentary elections. But Yeltsin was far short of the absolute majority he needed to win without a runoff. Sharply divided voters sent Yeltsin into a head-on clash with Zyuganov, whose powerful grass-roots organization kept him in a tight race despite Yelt- sin’s iron grip on TV coverage. The runoff, pitting continued democratic reforms against a re- turn to Communist rule, must take place within a month, most likely on July 7 or July 14. “We don’t want to repeat what we have had. We want de- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 17, 1996 mocracy to develop,’ said Galina Burlakova, SS, a retired science researcher in Moscow who voted for Yeltsin. ‘‘We want our chil- dren to live in a free country.”’ But millions of other Rus- sians, unnerved by the inflation, crime and seemingly never-end- ing change washing over their mation, opted for the Communist Promise to restore more control and more benefits for the masses, with lower profits accru- ing to the few. The biggest surprise of the election was a third place show- ing by retired Gen. Alexander Lebed, a moderate nationalist whose strong stand on law and order reaped 15 percent of the vote. His unexpected success put Lebed in a pivotal position, and he gave indications that he might throw his support to Yeltsin. Even before the election Sun- day, speculation was widespread that Yeltsin might dump his most. unpopular Cabinet members to draw more support from voters. One of the most disdained is Defense Minister Pavel Gra- chev, who has led the exhausting and unsuccessful war against re- bels in the breakaway Chechen republic. As a leading career army officer, Lebed is well quali- fied to fill that job. \f"

An 18-year-old psychology student, Bo- kova knew what she wanted. It wasn't to fol- low the lead of her parents, who were old- line reformist intellectuals. Her rebellion took the form of voting for that implausible favorite of the younger generation: the hip- hopping hunk of the campaign trail, Presi- dent Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. “He's handsome,”’ Bokova said. “I trust *° Bokova’s decision was one of a million y blows the Russian Communist Party id to absorb Sunday: a younger generation that thinks the Communists are boring.

In last December’s parliamentary elec- tion, the retired truck driver was so angry ith “‘chaos” in Russia that he voted for ul- tranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. € Now, six months later, Bochanov decid- . ed to ditch Zhirinovsky because he “talks to0 much and does too little.” But he is still ery. . -. What Russia needs, Bochanov said Sun- day, is a new leader who can “bring order in’ the country and deal with the racketeers.” Zyuganov has been casting himself as just 6uch a leader, but Bochanov voted instead for a fresh face. He voted for retired Gen. Alexander Lebed, the tough-talking nation- cr who struck him as unfettered by the ast. When Sherbinka tabulated its ballots for the parliamentary election last December, ‘Gennady Zyuganov’s Communists topped the 41 parties with 20 percent of the votes. This summer, the Communists needed to build on that core support in hundreds of ckluster towns like Sherbinka all across ‘Russia. In Sherbinka, at least, interviews with 100 voters outside a polling place indicated that the Communists received no more than the 20 percent of the vote they captured in December. While the Communists held roughly MICHAEL YASSUKOVICH / Associated Press Two Moscow women weigh their choices before voting Sunday in a race that could decide whether Russia will continue its economic reforms. steady, Lebed shot up from less than 5 per- cent in Sherbinka, perhaps exceeding 15 percent, according to voter interviews. “He will be our president in the year 2000,” said designer Igor Durno, 59, who voted for him to offer “‘moral support.” Yeltsin may have gained even more than Lebed. Last December, the Yeltsin-backed governmental party of Prime Minister Vic- tor Chernomyrdin could manage only a 9.6 percent showing in Sherbinka. But with Yeltsin himself on the ballot, slightly more than half of those surveyed said they had voted for Yeltsin. “It is not that I am for him as a person, but because of the changes that started un- der him,” said Natasha Karamazina, 32, who works as a manager in a dairy foods plant. Lidya Ignatova, a 52-year-old massage therapist, said, ‘“Yeltsin has been in power only a little while; we have to give him more time. The time of the Communists is over.”’ From a demographic viewpoint, Igna- tova had focused on the nub of the dilemma confronting the Communist Party: It has a loyal core of 20 million to 25 million voters across Russia, most of them in their 50s, 60s and 70s. Victor Afanasiev, 6S, a retired professor _ of veterinary medicine, is typical of Sher- binka’s hard-core believers who grew up under communism and will vote Communist for the rest of their lives. “Yeltsin is committing genocide when he destroys our scientific institutions,” de- clared Afanasiev, bemoaning the collapse of a government research institution where he used to be a section head. It’s tough being a Communist in Yelt- sin’s Russia, said Nina Budanova, a 46-year old kindergarten cook. ‘‘His propaganda is very strong. He has everything in his hands.”’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 17, 1996 \f"

        "ocr_text": "RUSSIAN ELECTIONS ‘Yeltsin turns to Lebed to boost runoff chances aueed ttarcin Maccet STAFF Scrambling to build on his narrow first-round lead in MRussia’s presidential election, President Boris Yeltsin signaled his willingness Monday to share Kremlin power with a former army general who placed a strong third in the voting. Yeltsin met with retired Gen. Alexander Lebed, the “law and order’”’ nationalist whose 10 mil- lion first-round votes will be vital if Yeltsin is to defeat Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in the election’s second round. Word spread through Rus- Sia’s security bureaucracy that Yeltsin was preparing to name Lebed to a new post of first depu- ty premier with oversight over the so-called ‘‘power ministries’”’ — the army, the former KGB and the interior ministry, which con- trols the nation’s police forces. Alexander Shokhin, the pro- Yeltsin vice chairman of the low- er house of parliament, said Lebed was likely to be offered a post “‘specially created for him.’’ Lebed said he would meet again with Yeltsin today to dis- cuss an unspecified ‘‘post’’ that would allow him to carry for- ward his ‘‘struggle against orga- nized crime.’’ : He again ruled out any deal with the Communists, who also seek his backing. ““We have gone past commu- nism and have left this shore for- ever,’”’ Lebed said. With vote counting from Sun- day’s first round virtually com- pleted, Yeltsin led Zyuganov by 34.8 percent to 32.1. Lebed had 14.7 percent. A second round is mecessary because no candidate received a majority. Alexander Ivanchenko, depu- _ ty head of the election commis- sion, said the runoff was tenta- tively set for Sunday, June 30. But the Yeltsin camp took steps Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 18, 1996 Monday aimed at having a mid- week vote. Roughly 70 percent of the 106 million eligible voters cast bal- lots Sunday, which was consid- . ered a disappointingly low turn- out for a presidential race. The Yeltsin camp believes a turnout approaching 80 percent is essential in the second round to overcome Zyuganov’s dedicat- ed core of 20 to 25 million Com- munist voters, plus extra anti- Yeltsin voters who backed ultra- nationalist Viadimir Zhirinovsky. Russian news agencies re- ported that Yeltsin, in hopes of maximizing chances for a heavy turnout, asked the Communist- controlled parliament to pass quick legislation to fix the runoff on July 3, a Wednesday. Under current regulations, elections must be scheduled ona Sunday, but the Yeltsin forces are afraid many of their potential supporters will not bother to re- turn from a weekend at their da- chas, or country cottages, to vote. Lebed also figured in the plans of the Communists. Agrari- an Party chairman Mikhail Lap- shin, a longtime parliamentary ally of the Communist bloc, told reporters he would recommend to Zyuganov that Lebed be of- fered the post of prime minister in a Zyuganov-led Kremlin. Asked about the idea at a news conference, Zyuganov said, “‘As to the post of prime minister, we have not offered it to anyone. But we will conduct thorough consultations with Lebed on all questions connected with the second round.”’ Behind the sudden focus on Lebed was a perception that the second round could still be won by either candidate. Yeltsin led Zyuganov nation- wide by only about 1.5 million votes out of the approximately 74 million votes cast. \f"

Alexander Lebed after Yeltsin attracted him to the presidential re-election team by making him one of the most powerful men in Russia. ‘‘Those who want to ease tension must rush to meet the dangers, if necessary, witha sword in the hands.’”’ As secretary of the powerful National Security Council and as the president’s national security adviser, Lebed will have broad, though not yet completely defined, authority over national security policy. Yeltsin’s lightning move to forge a political coalition with Lebed will boost his chances for re-election in the runoff against Communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov that is to be held within the next three weeks. Lebed had been courted by both sides after his law-and-order campaign propelled him toa sur- prisingly strong third-place fin- ish in Sunday’s first round.

Lebed received 14.7 percent in the field of 10 candidates. Standing at the white-haired president’s side, Lebed said he was joining Yeltsin out of his conviction that the president’s reformist direction was prefera- ble to the ‘‘old one”’ of the Com- munists — even though Yeltsin’s ‘plans were being implemented badly. “There are two ideas in the country,’’ Lebed said, ‘‘the old one which is outdated and which costs a lot of blood and countless tragedies, and the new one, which unfortunately is being per- formed poorly. But it is the new one. And the future belongs to it. Iam choosing the new one.”’ Lebed did not directly appeal to his 11 million voters to support Yeltsin in the runoff election. He said he is ‘‘deeply con- vinced”’ that no less than 80 per- cent of them ‘‘will follow me.”’ “There will be freedom and there will be order in the country,”’ Lebed said. Most surprising was Lebed’s comment that he had aborted an effort Monday by five top mili- tary figures to persuade Grachev to put the Russian army on red alert in a murky plot to exert pressure on Yeltsin. Although details of the purported plot were vague, it appeared the Grachev associates were maneuvering to avert Lebed’s appointment. Dayton Daily News - June 19, 1996 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Yeltsin purges three top aides accused of plotting against him BY MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service MOSCOW — President Boris Yeltsin completed a decisive purge of Kremlin hard-liners Thursday by firing three top as- sociates accused of plotting to abort the July 3 presidential run- off election. In sacking his longtime ally and closest personal friend, chief of presidential security Alexander Korzhakov, and two other aides, Mr. Yeltsin sided with a reformist team that he had earlier put into eclipse. The firings concluded a night- long duel for power that started with the ambiguous police deten- tion of two Yeltsin campaign workers Wednesday evening. They were released in the middle of the night after the intervention of retired Gen. Alex- ander Lebed, the national securi- ty adviser Mr. Yeltsin appointed Tuesday with a wide brief to restore order to Russia. “Any revolt will be sup- pressed, and in an extremely tough way,” Gen. Lebed said. “Those who want to plunge the country into the depths of bloody chaos do not deserve pity.” While the shake-up was sure to gain votes for Mr. Yeltsin in the presidential runoff from dem- ocrats who have doubted his re- form credentials, he may have jeopardized support from the more traditional power brokers of big factories and the military and security establishment who might be tempted to jump to the side of Communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov. Mr. Zyuganov, struggling to regain the offensive after Sun- day’s first round of the elections in which he placed second to Mr. Yeltsin, said the firings repre- sented a ‘‘decapitation”’ of Rus- sia’s law enforcement organs. “It seems that Mr. Yeltsin and his team felt that they did not % have real chances of winning the | - election and decided, under the cover of screams about coup d’e- tats, to indulge in creeping palace coups,” Mr. Zyuganov said in a news conference. Anatoly Chubais, a co-director of the Yeltsin campaign from the reformist camp, said Gen. Lebed’s ‘‘tough and firm stand” proved the new alliance between the general and president — competitors in the first round of balloting — can overcome ‘‘the most difficult and dangerous pow- er crises at any levels.” Mr. Chubais said the events marked ‘‘the final stage of a long and arduous struggle, the strug- gle between that part of Yeltsin’s administration which worked to ensure Yeltsin’s victory in a dem- ocratic election and that part of Yeltsin’s administration which preferred to use force.” Fired were Mr. Korzhakov, who started as Mr. Yeltsin’s bodyguard in 1985 and ultimately became his closest confidant and chief of security; Mikhail Barsu- kov, a Korzhakov protege who came to head the Federal Securi- ty Service, the successor of the internal branches of the KGB; and Oleg Soskovets, the first dep- uty prime minister who hailed from the military industrial com- plex and had been a consistent drag on economic reform. Following Tuesday’s dismissal of Defense Minister Pavel Grach- ev, the sackings completed a purge of hard-line associates that liberals claim led Mr. Yeltsin to- ward his disastrous military inter- vention in Chechnya 18 months ago and had pushed him to aban- don Russia’s shaky course toward democracy. Mr. Yeltsin, looking drawn and stressed in announcing the dis- missals, said it was time to bring “fresh people’ to his team. The Associated Press President Boris Yeltsin introduces Gen. Alexander Lebed, standing, to the Security Council he will head. Earlier Thursday, Mr. Yeltsin dismissed three aides for meddling in his re-election bid. ‘They took too much and gave back too little,” he said. Mr. Yeltsin on Wednesday canceled plans to attend next week’s Group of Seven economic summit in France, citing the tough election campaign. The two Yeltsin campaign aides detained Wednesday night had been stopped at the order of Mr. Korzhakov and Mr. Barsukov after they tried to leave the Rus- sian White House, the seat of government, with a box contain- ing half a million dollars, Russian TV reported. Mr. Zyuganov's Communist al- ly Gennady Seleznyov, the speak- er of the State Duma lower house of parliament, said Mr. Korzhak- ov and Mr. Barsukov were later sacked ‘‘for infringing on what was sacred — covert financing of the president’s election campaign when huge amounts of money are Cincinnati Enquirer - paid‘ out from a government building.” But Mr. Chubais said the mon- ey was ‘‘a plant’’ and the deten- tion of the two aides ‘‘a provoca- tion” that was merely the first step in a plan by the Korzhakov crew to undermine the reformist wing of Mr. Yeltsin’s entourage. “With each passing day and hour their hopes for the use of force in the Russian election were ebbing away,” Mr. Chubais said of the three fired men, whom he charged wanted the election canceled and the Kremlin kept in Mr. Yeltsin’s hands by force. Late in the day, the Central Elections Commission set July 3 for the runoff election, not waiting for today’s expected par- liamentary debate on when to schedule the second round. June 21, 1996 \f"

        "ocr_text": "‘Crown prince’ sets Russia on new course By | fomreh 2 ee, es eo oscow — Nine days ago came the first clue to a convulsive Kremlin power struggle that would baffle the world. The plot is still evolving, but it is clear that Russia has turned onto a new political bearing. To clinch a vic- tory in the July 3 runoff election, President Boris Yeltsin has designat- ed a virtual crown prince of Russia, the crusty nationalist Gen. Alexander Lebed. Before Lebed agreed to become Kremlin national security adviser, he obtained Yeltsin’s blessing to set the country on a different course: more draconian on “law and order,” more dovish on the war in Chechnya, and probably more muscular in dealings with the outside world. Emerging from his airplane in Ekaterinberg on June 14, the 65- year-old Yeltsin ruminated to Rus- sian reporters about who should suc- ceed him in the next presidential election in the year 2000. “There is a need to prepare a fu- ture president whom people know, who has authority and who is loved by all Russians — that is very impor- ° tant,” he said. “I know such a person, and in his position I would withdraw my candidacy. In that case, for sure, he would be elected president next time around.” Yeltsin meant Lebed, a 46-year- old retired Afghan war veteran who surged late in the campaign by satu- rating television with his distinctive basso voice in catchy ads. Clad in civ- vies, Lebed stood in a field of grain and promised to make Russia “proud, wealthy and beautiful.” Yeltsin had already sized up Lebed at a private meeting in early June. On Monday of last week, Yelt- sin met with the general again, as soon as Yeltsin realized that he had won only a narrow 3-percent plurali- ty in the first round against Commu- nist Gennady Zyuganov, with Lebed running a strong third. Probably as the price of bringing Lebed aboard, Yeltsin simultaneous- ly dismissed his loyal defense minis- ter, Pavel Grachev, a longtime Lebed rival in the ranks whom Lebed had called a “prostitute.” The next shocker came four hours later, when Lebed told a press confer- ence that five senior generals close to Grachev had tried to organize a “GKChP-III’? — Russian shorthand for a rerun of the failed 1991 coup against then-Soviet President Mik- hail Gorbachev. The alleged coup attempt was only a “going-away party” for Gra- chev, replied the five generals, who had gathered from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. that day in Grachev’s antechamber. Lebed may or may not have nipped a real plot in the bud. But the conclusion was obvious to the Com- munist-dominated State Duma lower house: Here was a tough operator in the Kremlin, with access to precise intelligence. Grachev's antechamber must have been bugged, complained the Communist speaker of the State Duma, Gennady Seleznyov — and maybe “the conversations of each of AL ESANCER OE ZEMLIANICHENKO / Associated Press At the War ‘Memorial in Brest, Belarus, Boris Yeltsin (center) kicks off his runoff campaign Saturday to remain Russia’s president. us are bugged.” Yeltsin’s indirect acknowledge- ment Tuesday that he views Lebed as his likely successor threw gasoline on a dormant turf war within the ranks of Yeltsin’s campaign headquarters. At a meeting of Yeltsin’s cam- paign staff that day, Yeltsin’s hard- line Kremlin security chief and sometime drinking partner, Gen. Al- exander Korzhazkov, took on the “liberals” on the campaign staff. The two leading liberals, Sergei Filatov and Anatoly Chubais, were outraged when Korzhakov told those at the meeting that they must stop giving TV interviews, on the grounds that “they do not make a Bose im- pression on the people.” The liberals’ anger turned to alarm Wednesday when they learned of a botched contract killing Tuesday night aimed at Boris Fyodorov, who had reportedly been a fund-raiser for the Yeltsin campaign with ties to the liberal faction. The same day the campaign staff was disquieted by the midnight shooting and stabbing of Fyodorov, Yeltsin developed a case of sudden worries about his chances of winning the runoff election. At midday, he called off his long-planned trip to the G-7 summit in France, which would have projected him for three days on every Russian network as a statesman. “T do not rule out that Yeltsin sensed something, sensed the danger coming from within his inner circle,” Chubais would later explain. The atmosphere got edgier. At 5 p.m. Wednesday, a few hours after Yeltsin canceled the trip, a police guard stopped two campaign workerd'. in the Chubais-led liberal faction aq: they left the Russian White Hou the offices of Prime Minister Vices Chernomyrdin. Police on the scene were quosige by the ITAR-Tass news agency Ss saying that Yeltsin campaigners Sér- gei Lisovsky and Arkady Yevstafyev were carrying an office copier box filled with foreign banknotes. Lisovsky and Yevstafyev were . grilled for 11 hours by officers of the . presidential police who wanted de- tails about Chubais’ role in the cam- paign, Lisovsky later explainé¢. Korzhakov’s agents seem to hate made one blunder: They apparently. neglected to confiscate their cellular telephones. By midnight, Tass and the TV networks were alerted. Lebed — who by now had thrown in with Chubais against Korzhakov — rushed to the police station around 2 or 3 a.m. and demanded their rel Now it was Yeltsin’s time %o choose: Would he back his new rity adviser Lebed — on whom ifs ; election chances hinged — or defend Korzhakov, his longtime friend and protector, who had no political cone stituency? Looking shaken and barely articu- late, Yeltsin came before the cameras around midday Thursday with answer. Not only was he firing Korzhakov, but also two of his highly placed 4l- lies: First Deputy Premier Oleg Sas- kovets and Mikhail Barsukov, an in- law of Korzhakov who headed Federal Security Service, a successor agency of the KGB.

Besides imported smoked salmon and in-house turkey kabobs — skew- ered, marinated and ready to cook — the discerning shopper can find Ger: man rowing machines, queen-size beds and components for an Italian designer kitchen, The Proletarsky district of Mos- cow, which since the collapse of Sovi- et communism in 1991 has evolved from a dreary working-class region, has a major stake in capitalism. It is the heart of Boris Yeltsin country, and the president will need its support July 3 when he faces Com- munist Gennady Zyuganov in the presidential runoff. The gastronome that three years ago carried a slaughterhouse stench now offers the absolute ultimate in Russian chic. “A lot of people can afford these things,” said Valentin Zakharov, the man behind the store’s new look, sweeping a gesture past Italian reli- gious art, baroque end tables and stair-stepper machines. “In fact, there was a stream of buyers before the election, because people were worried their money will be taken away.” Not everyone went on a last-min- ute buying spree as a hedge against a Communist resurgence before the first round of the presidential vote last Sunday, but a great many were worried the red flag would fly again over Russia. They are typical of people living in Russia’s largest urban centers, the people who were crucial in getting Yeltsin a slender plurality in the first round and will be just as critical if he hopes to win the runoff. Urbanites suffer the same prob- lems of inflation, underemployment and instability as their brothers in the countryside, They are more affected by crime. But the average Muscovite dogs have a higher salary than most Rug- sians, earning $214 a month com- pared with the national average of $155. In the rural backwater of Voro- nezh province, where the Commy~ nists won 46 percent of the vote, thes average monthly salary is $91.45, The impact of living in a freer country, with its dizzying array of un. fettered newspapers, magazines and, arts has been little felt in rural Rus; sia.

        "ocr_text": " RUNOFF ELECTION IN RUSSIA Communist appeals to moderates By Marcla Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — In an unlikely bid to gain support in next week's presidential runoff, Communist Gen- nady Zyuganov promised Monday that if he wins he will build a coalition government giving his party a minority role. With polls showing President Boris Yeltsin in the lead, Zyuganov made a desperate appeal to moderate voters by outlining a government with one-third of its officials from other political parties and another third from the ranks of Yeltsin's gov- ernment. “The situation in the country is forming in such a way that Russia is confronted with great difficul- ties. Not a single political force is dominant,” Zyu- ganov told reporters. Zyuganov has kept an extremely low profile since his second-place finish in the first round of presidential balloting June 16, raising speculation that aru he cannot defeat Yeltsin in the July 3 runoff. Zyuganov’s statement Monday did nothing to Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 25, 1996 dispel such sentiment. It was a tacit acknowledg- ment that the Communists and the national patriot ic coalition they head do not have sufficient public support to govern Russia on their own. In fact, it.’ may have been directed at planting an idea with Yeltsin as much as at winning over voters, . Yeltsin has dominated the news since the first: round by making a succession of personnel shifts in the Kremlin designed to broaden his support. dyv- ganov has not campaigned, and his staff said he has no plans to appear outside of Moscow. $ In the first round, Zyuganov received 32 per- cent of the vote to Yeltsin’s 35 percent in a 10-mag race. Opinion polls released Sunday show Yeltsin’ moving further into the lead, with one putting the. spread at 53 percent to 34 percent and a second giv ing Yeltsin 47 percent to 27 percent for nant “T think that Zyuganov really fears very muc possible defeat at the polls. He has every to fear,” said reformer Grigory Yavlinsky, the fourth place finisher in the June 16 election whose Yab-, loko movement came out strongly against the Cons munists and held out the possibility of mtr Yeltsin. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Lebed criticizes outsider influence By Marcia KuNSsTEL AND JOSEPH ALBRIGHT American-Statesman Intemational Staff MOSCOW — The nationalist fervor of Alexander Lebed reared up Thursday when the Kremlin's new national security czar waxed indignant at the intrusion of West- ern culture and foreign religions, which he called “a direct threat to Russia’s security.” Lebed, the retired general whom President Boris Yeltsin has positioned to wield broad power if he is re-elected in a runoff Wednesday, gave a glimpse of how he will spend his energies if he re- mains in this new role: fighting crime and outsiders. “We have the established, tradi- tional religions — Russian Ortho- doxy, Islam, Buddhism,” he said. “As to all these Mormons, Aum Supreme Truth (a Japanese ter- rorist cult blamed for last year’s fatal gassing of the Tokyo sub- way), all this is mold and scum that is artificially brought into our country with the purpose of per- verting, corrupting and breaking up our state. The state must rise to the defense of its citizens and out- law all these foul sects.” Inexplicably, Judaism was not on his list of “traditional” reli- gions in a country with the world’s third-largest Jewish popu- lation. Nor was it clear why he sin- gled out Mormons, who have set up six missions and gained 3,700 converts in Russia since the Sovi- et breakup of 1991. “They are Russian. They love their country,” Mormon Church spokesman Clayton Newell said in a telephone interview from Salt Lake City. “They are faithful to the Gospel and don’t see that as compromising.” In the past five years, the arrival in Russia of dozens of crusading religions, some sects and others more broadly based, has brought a backlash from leaders of the Or- thodox faith and political efforts to legally restrict their activities. During a meeting in which he answered audience questions for an hour, Lebed, 46, played to the Russia-first sentiments of his lis- teners in other ways, too. The invasion of Western culture has put on every television chan- nel “either some sexual trash or violence or a soap opera,” he said. And dealing with this cultural ex- pansion into Russia must be “one of the cornerstones” of Russian national security policy. “We are the most intelligent country in the world,” he said. “Seventy-four percent of all inven- tions in the world have their ori- gins in Russia. They were either bought or stolen from us, we ei- ther lost or boozed them away.” At the same time, Lebed showed other populist credentials and in- dicated his reach as national secu- rity adviser will be long, going beyond his first priority of crime and corruption. He talked about new regulations to rein in finan- cial scams like the pyramid deals that sucked up millions of dollars belonging to innocent Russians. But he also referred to his plans for restoring to Russians the sav- ings they lost when inflation zoomed, not by returning them cash but by giving them land or even washing machines. Lebed’s real authority will be tested only after the runoff and may be held in check by other aides in a second Yeltsin adminis- tration. Lebed espoused, as well, some more orthodox democratic views when he extolled Russia’s relative- ly free press as “one of our very few-achievements.” He also called threats to reincor- porate neighboring nations “crazy and provocative,” and said rela- tions in fields of defense and econ- omy should respect each country’s continued sovereignty.

Yeltsin has canceled recent campaign appearances, pleading laryngitis, but his past heart trouble has sparked speculation that his health problems are more serious. This could lose the 6S-year-old president votes if Russians think him unfit to gov- ern another four years. Another handicap for Yeltsin is that he hasn’t won over some young people, such as Irina Kha- zina, a fashionably dressed 26- year-old hospital nurse who was waiting at the same stop. “My family lived well under the old regime,” she said. “I am going to vote for the Commu- ‘nists, and so are many of my friends.” Nationwide, opinion polls show that a majority of Russians intend to vote for Yeltsin. Yeltsin’s problem is that he has to motivate a large share of his potential voters to turn out on election day. If the turnout is 60 percent or lower, the Commu- nists might just squeak to victory because their voters are more passionate and disciplined. Ludmilla Glushukova, who turned up at the same trolley stop, is a prototype of the soft Yeltsin supporter who has the pollsters perplexed. She voted the first time for third-running candidate Alexander Lebed and has for now switched to Yeltsin for a pragmatic reason: She wants to go with the winner. “There is no choice. We have to vote with Yeltsin, even though I don’t like many of the things he did,”’ said Glushukova, 49, who used to be the director of a now- defunct neighborhood House of Culture. The latest nationwide ‘‘prog- nosis” — issued Friday by the polling firm Public Opinion on the basis of three tracking polls in the last three weeks — was that Yeltsin will beat Zyuganov 50 percent to 46 percent.

        "ocr_text": "As election nears, rumors vex Yeltsin Some say Russian president seriously ill By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News SERVICE Moscow, Russia (Monday) — As rumors bubbled that he may be seri- ously ill, President Boris Yeltsin can- celed a scheduled appearance Sun- day at a Moscow outdoor festival and remained in seclusion, reported- ly at his country dacha. Early today, he looked pale but composed as he was shown on state television in an ornate reception room giving what was described as an interview with the Interfax news agency within the past few days. In contrast to most Yeltsin inter- views on Russian TV, this one did not broadcast his voice, although the Pictures showed his lips moving. It was not clear whether the video was taken during the interview or at some other time. “Every day, I have been working with my campaign headquarters, holding consultations with allies, ne- gotiating the composition and struc- ture of the future government,”’ the transcript quoted Yeltsin as saying. With the runoff election set for Wednesday and his lead in pre-elect- ion polls slipping in recent days, the 65-year-old Yeltsin has not an- nounced any campaign plans for today — the last day campaigning is permitted under Russian election rules. Kremlin aides have reportedly been drafting a speech Yeltsin could deliver today if his health permits. In contrast to his robust and resil- ient campaign style leading up to the June 16 first round of voting, Yeltsin looked puffy-faced and exhausted a week ago in his last campaign trip, to the Polish border. He has virtually disappeared from TV networks. Thursday, Yeltsin canceled cam- paign trips planned for the weekend to the military-oriented Tula region south of Moscow and to the reform- ist capital Nizhn Novgorod. In- Health uncertain stead, a Kremlin spokesman ex- plained, Yeltsin would remain in Moscow and attend an outdoor party organized by Moskovsky Komsomo- lets, the pro-Yeltsin Moscow news- paper with the biggest circulation in the country. But Sunday, Yeltsin was not among the hundreds of guests who showed up at the festival. A bank of TV crews was on hand to film the president, so footage of the newspa- per’s birthday party was shown on nationwide TV news without refer- ence to Yeltsin. Two days earlier, Yeltsin also can- celed a speech to some 3,500 farmers gathered to hear him in the Kremlin. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyr- din, filling in at the last minute, said Yeltsin had lost his voice. Presidential aide Viktor Ilyushin, who was at Yeltsin’s side during his two serious bouts of heart illness last July and October, said on Friday Yeltsin was ‘‘working two or three hours a day at the Kremlin and then gathering his strength at his country residence.’ The revival of the ‘“‘health issue” has been a stroke of luck for Commu- nist candidate Gennady Zyuganov, 52, who has run a lethargic cam- paign after trailing Yeltsin by three percentage points in the first round. “If we’re just talking about laryn- gZitis, then there would be no reason to cancel meetings with officials,”’ Zyuganov told a news conference. With Yeltsin grounded and health rumors multiplying, his campaign chances rested more than ever on his continuing dominance of the state- controlled television channels, from news coverage to entertainment fea- tures to slick campaign TV spots. i Sunday on the No. 2 state channel included a youth- oriented music show with a segment featuring clips of Yeltsin’s campaign rock concerts. Happy people of all ages swayed to the music, rock stars urged people to vote for Yeltsin, and a voice-over appealed to viewers to vote in Wednesday’s election. Yeltsin ads dominate the airwaves because the Communists have re- frained from buying commercials to supplement the state-supplied 10 minutes a day of free time.

As Muscovites were going to | bed Tuesday, polling stations were | already opening eight time zones away in the Russian far east. On the first sunny day in two weeks in Vladivostok, the largest _ city on Russia's Pacific coast, about 70 people cast ballots in the | first hour polls were open at _ school number 62, eager to vote and get to their country dachas since today was a national holiday. “I don’t want the Communists to be in power. I don’t want to stand | in the lines,” said Viktor Pishulin, | a 47-year-old electrician who voted for Zyuganov in the first round on June 16, but said that was just to make a statement, “to push the democrats and tell them they aren’t totally OK.” Valery Grichayenko was solidly | for Zyuganov. “I’m distressed for my motherland. They are robbing it,” said the metal worker, 49. “I used to be able to go out at night | freely, openly, and I didn’t have to be afraid. Now in my own apart- ' ment I'm afraid to open the door in the daytime.” Analysts said turnout would be a crucial factor. A rate of 60 per- , cent or more would favor Yeltsin ' and a lower figure would keep the round was nearly 70 percent, when Yeltsin finished 3 percentage points ahead of Zyuganov in a 10-man race. The pro-Yeltsin national televi- sion broadcast appeals Tuesday night for voters to turn out at the ’ polling stations. The election boiled down to a referendum on the reforms begun by Yeltsin five years ago when he rose to power as Russia's first democratic leader following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Zyuganov and the revived Com- munist Party say they will rein- state many of the economic methods of the Soviet era, a pro- gram that appealed to nostalgic elderly voters and many others who have suffered during the tran- sition to a market economy. Oppo- nents have warned the Communists may attempt to erase Russians’ newly won personal freedoms as well. Despite the high stakes, the runoff election campaign was curi- ously undramatic. It whimpered to a close this week, mixing an addi- tional element of uncertainty to the outcome of today’s vote. Yeltsin, his health so fragile that he could not meet voters for the last 10 days of the campaign, disappeared for four days to recu- perate from what aides claimed was a bad cold. He finally resur- faced for a stilted television ap- peal Monday night, the last legal day of campaigning. Yeltsin’s health, a volatile issue after heart ailments sent him for protracted hospital stays twice last year, was not the only wild card in the election mix. On Tuesday, national security adviser Alexander Lebed, the re- tired general Yeltsin gave a pow- erful position after his third place finish June 16, raised questions about his commitment to Yeltsin’s democratic agenda. “I do not consider myself a full democrat, I am a semi-democrat,” Lebed said at a news conference. “If we attempt to create a parlia- mentary republic, nothing will come out of it.” In recent days Lebed also spoke of wanting to restrict foreign visas and to limit the rights of religions non-traditional to Russia. Nationalists and Russians long- ing for the order Lebed promises — at potentially high cost to free- doms — might be attracted to vote for Yeltsin. But democrats unhappy over Yeltsin's waffling economic reform could beconte sufficiently alarmed at Lebed’s tough stance to stay home today or mark the ballot column against both candidates.

We don’t want to live like a herd.” Yeltsin took 35 percent of the vote to Zyu- ganov’s 32 percent in the 10-man first round of the election June 16. In Wednesday’s runoff, he attracted the lion’s share of supporters of the third-, fourth- and fifth-place finishers who were eliminated in the first round. Yeltsin, who was forced to abort his last week of campaigning because of still unex- © plained health problems, had enough steam left to win a second four-year term. It was the first time in 1,000 years that a fully sovereign Russia has directly elected its leader. But uncertainty over the state of Yeltsin’s health intensified Wednesday when the presi- dent canceled plans for his traditional splashy appearance at a mobbed Moscow polling sta- tion, reportedly because of heart pain from an- gina. Without explanation, he settled instead for solitary voting at a nearly deserted polling place near his country dacha. Russian TV broadcast footage of Yeltsin vot- ing in the carefully controlled setting. Though his gait was uncertain, it was the first time in a week that TV had shown him walking. When he spoke about the need for all citizens to vote, he smiled and his words were lucid and unslurred. Yeltsin, 65, was hospitalized twice last year for heart troubles. The re-election capped a remarkable come- back for Yeltsin from eight months ago, when his popularity ratings had plummeted to 6 percent. Among the first crop of East European anti- Communist leaders who emerged in the late 1980s, Yeltsin so far is the only one to survive the angst and backbiting of voters over the pain of economic reform. Even once-popular Polish leader Lech Walesa was swept to defeat by a re- formed leftist party last year. \f"

Let me live the next 40 years without Communists,” said Alex- ander Moravyov, 45, who is owner and president of a construction company. “For the first time I have started to work for myself.” On the other side stood Maolen Akparnbekov, 70, a retired mili- tary serviceman originally from Kazakhstan who lives in the faded rfactory town of Podolsk about 20 miles south of Moscow. = “Today’s Communists stand for “real democracy, not for the democ- pracy of thieves,” said Akparnbe- “‘kov, a longtime member of the *Communist Party. “What kind of democracy is this, when 80 per- ‘cent of the people have nothing?” © Of 20 people who talked about why they voted as they did at poll- ing stations 2081 and 2082 in Po- dolsk, few even discussed the candidates themselves. “We're convinced the economy must be run by capitalists,” said Valery Osipov, a 40-year-old de- sign engineer at a government fac- tory. “The communists can only redistribute what has been creat- ed, but they cannot create any- thing by themselves.” For voters questioned in Mos- cow and Podolsk, election issues boiled down to one thing when they cast their ballots: what is the better route to the future? One man summarized the choice as he left the Podolsk poll- ing station. He kept walking, but pointed to his wife and responded to a journalist’s query: “She voted for the Communists and I’m for the capitalists.” Sveta Rubneva, a 33-year-old doctoral student at Moscow State University, said she cherished her relatively new right to vote, but didn’t like either of the choices. “As Russians, this is our chance. I wish other people real- ized how influential they can be today,” she said. She checked the third box on her ballot: the one marked none of the above.

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE | MOSCOW — After making the | most momentous collective deci- sion in their history, Russians settled down and went back to life Thursday as though nothing much had changed. Brokers resumed futures trad- ing on the Russian Exchange, where they nudged government securities up an unremarkable 100 points in a sign of stability. The elderly and handicapped lined up for free flour and oil at Moscow’s main synagogue. Ad hoc newsstands outside the old’ - Lenin Museum spread their array of political broadsheets and scandal tabs on the sidewalk. And President Boris Yeltsin went back to work in his Krem- lin office. ‘All those activities would have been threatened if the electorate had made the other choice on election day Wednesday and brought the Communist Party back to power. Rather than create change, Russians blocked it. “Yesterday we defended our right to choose. No one will take that right away from us ever more,” Yeltsin said in a short television address Thursday, after preliminary results showed him Communist chal- lenger Gennady Z Ov 53.7 percent to 40.4 in the presidential race. Yeltsin told Prime Minister Viktor Chernom S a new cabinet, thus keeping his chief functionary and snuffing speculation of a total administra tion overhaul. Russians may not have voted to continue exactly the same rou tine that has unfolded under rs years of Yeltsin rule. But the outpouring of sentiment — a sur prisingly strong wave that swept westward from the Sea of Japan to the military enclave of Kalin- ingrad on the Baltic Sea — told the world they want to continue down the course toward free poli tics and economics, despite its pain and frustration. They emphatically said no to communism. And soon Thursday they went back to what has become normal life. “If Zyuganov had won, the sit- uation here could have reached the point of panic,’’ said Alex- ander Orlov, chief analyst at the Russian Exchange. “‘People would have tried to roll up the market and to take money out of operations.”’ A few dozen blocks away at Moscow’s main synagogue, eld- erly Jews leaving with a sack of flour and canister of oil were sat- isfied with the election outcome, even though they expressed no great fondness for Yeltsin. He is better than the Communists who repressed Russia’s Jews for so many decades, they said. Because he won, people like 70- year-old Irina Shuval came to pick up the aid for elderly and invalids, rather than embark on a strenuous flight out of Russia. “T had some papers ready, in any event,”’ said Shuval, who was prepared to flee to Germany where she has relatives, if the Communists had returned to power. When she got up at 3 a.m. to see the election results on tele- vision, Shuval knew she did not have to put her backup plan in motion. Another sign of what did not change was the political flashpoint just outside the Krem- lin walls, the former Lenin Muse- um. . “There will be strikes. There will be a lot of unrest. Factories are idle,’”’ said Larisa Mikayenko- va, 55, an unemployed psycholo- gist who was a poll-watcher for the Communist Party. “There will be a big enidaiee = she predicted for Yeltsin’s second term in office. ‘“The whole people is in opposition.”’ Had the Communists won Wednesday, the crowds there Thursday surely would have been larger than the handful of people who earnestly debated the fate of their nation. What soon might have been missing, however, are the news vendors there who hawk an eclectic mix of ideology and pulp, the kind of exotic reading forbid- den under Communist domina- tion. One recent addition to Rus- sian life that held its place Thursday was the annual Fourth of July celebration hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce for Americans living here, not the kind of event one ever associ- ated with former Communist Dayton Daily News - July 5, 1996 \f"

By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News SERVICE Moscow, Russia — President Boris Yeltsin beat communism in but don’t look for a fairy tale ending any time soon, are at the Krem- NEWS lin gates, and the is whether Yeltsin physically will be able to fight them back for the next “If something serious happens to the head of state, this would plunge Migranyan, a member of the presi- dential advisory council. “Thus the most serious, immediate factor of na- tional security,” Russia’s recent presidential election, Wolves already ANALYSIS biggest question four years, Russia into turmoil,” said Andranik health of the president becomes the The bugbears Yeltsin faces: politi- cal infighting, economic instability and his own bad health, all of which are insidiously interwoven. The president cannot serve a third term, and the prospect that heart disease may prevent him even from completing his second already has provoked jockeying for position on the second tier of power. Retired Gen. Alexander Lebed, the nationalist Yeltsin brought into his government to save his campaign just before the runoff, is raring to move from trouble-shooter to chief architect of the new administration. “Fresh Blood” “Fresh blood is flooding to power,” Lebed told a Russian inter- viewer after the election. “I am an example of such fresh blood,” Initially talking in democratic terms about fighting crime and re- forming the military, Lebed made in- creasingly strident proposals with such goals as limiting religious evan- gelism and foreign visitors. He said Russia needs a vice presidency, im- plying that he should fill the post. Some think Yeltsin owes his victo- ry to Lebed, who took third place in the first election June 16. After the president appointed him national se- curity adviser, Lebed played a deci- sive role by throwing his weight and many of his 11 million votes to Yelt- sin in Wednesday's runoff. But the Kremlin's old blood is not a8 waiting to be transfused. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyr- din dismissed the possibility of a vice presidency, adding that he had no plans to share any of his powers. Chernomyrdin Favored Yeltsin already gave hints he is tipping the balance toward Cherno- myrdin, quickly asking the prime minister to stay in the job and head his new government. The official Itar-Tass News Agency reported he even handed Chernomyrdin a piece of the turf initially assigned to Lebed: coordination of law enforce- ment. In the week before balloting, Lebed eclipsed the prime minister on state-controlled television. It was a message to his voters that keeping Yeltsin as president would be almost as good as putting their favorite gen- eral in the office. Since Yeltsin won, Lebed scarcely has been seen. It forecast a struggle between Chernomyrdin and Lebed that could translate into a battle between the military industrial complex — back- ing the retired general — and the raw materials industry, which would support the prime minister who used to head the rich natural conglomerate, That is exactly the kind of trouble potential foreign investors do not want to see in Russia, not if they plan to put money here. “Markets like stability and clari- ty,” said Mare Holtzman, president of MeesPierson EurAmerica, an in- vestment bank that operates in the former East Bloc countries, “People are going to be waiting to see who are the players.” Holtzman, who initially declared Lebed a plus to Yeltsin, expressed doubts late last week about the gen- eral's goals. Perhaps “a tempered Lebed” would work out, as long as a leader like Chernomyrdin stays in charge of the new team, he sug- gested. Carrying out Yeltsin's expensive campaign promises, from higher teacher salaries to propping up fail- ing factories, would balloon the na- tion's deficit by an estimated $6 bil- lion. In many cases, the president signed pre-election decrees putting into effect his promises, Yeltsin, however, can afford to take unpopular steps since he will not be up for re-election. BLAME IT ON THE MOON The inside scoop on the Russian election? Boris Yeltsin's victory was due toa full moon — and Bill Clinton's meddling. At least, that's how Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky sees it. The first and second rounds of the election “came during a full moon, when people easily fall under a spell and vote like zombies,\" said Zhirinovsky, who is known for his frequently outrageous statements. The U.S. president also helped mesmerize the Russians, he insisted, “Clinton decided who would be the Russian president,” Zhirinovsky said. The Western world needs our natural resources. By the year 2000, Russia will become a colony.” | Des Moines Register - July 6, 1996 \f"

The fire began late Friday night as 50 Orthodox Jews were assembled at a wooden syna- gogue and Jewish studies center for weekly Sabbath services. A caretaker burst into the services to say the building was on fire, and all the worshipers escaped without injury. Before flames consumed the building, volunteers managed to carry the Torah scrolls to safety. But hundreds of other books — among them an 1874 edition of the Pentateuch, the five books of Moses, that had been published in Warsaw — were ruined by fire and water damage. Stunned worshipers worked all day Sunday sorting the charred books into piles. Near the front door of the study center, or yeshiva, stood a heap of ruined books 3 feet high that were being readied for buri- al according to Jewish law in a Moscow Jewish cemetery. Hundreds of other books, with edges slightly singed, were arrayed on the grass to dry. “This was the first yeshiva that opened in Moscow after glasnost,” said David Epstein, a former teacher at Atlanta's He- brew Academy who was among the worshipers. He referred to the political opening begun by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s. “Anybody who had Jewish books brought them here, so they were collected from all over the Soviet Union,” he said. Epstein, who now lives in Je- rusalem, was at the now-de- stroyed Mekor Haim Judaic Studies Center to lead a three- month course in Jewish studies for representatives of scattered Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 15, 1996 Jewish communities across Rus- sia and Ukraine that are trying to regain strength after the fall of communism. The fire came at a tense mo- ment in Moscow, after a pair of unsolved terrorist bombings late last week destroyed two trolley cars and injured 33 people. How- ever, both Jewish officials on the scene and Moscow firefighters found no evidence of foul play. “This is not a case of arson,” said Haim Feigenbaum, the ad- ministrative director of the ye- shiva in the outlying Kuntsevo district. He quoted Moscow fire officials as‘blaming the fire on bad wiring, and said Jewish com- munity memberssifting through the debris have found no gaso- line cans or other paraphernalia suggestive of arson. “Activities are not going to stop,” Epstein said. “There's a loss of books and a loss of place.

The president is tired; he is really very tired, and he just needs a good, proper holiday.” In an apparent effort iv counteract the notion that he is. too ill to govern, Yeltsin’s press office said the president spent the day Monday working on staff changes and announced he had named liberal, pro-Western campaign aide Anatoly Chubais as his new chief of staff. The move set up a potential’ rivalry between Chubais and Yeltsin’s aggressive new nation- ps meeting with Gore al security adviser, Alexander Lebed. Ten days ago Chubais, 41, publicly criticized Lebed’s de- mand that he be given sweeping economic powers, saying, “It would be a very serious error if the Russian Security Council be- gan to assume any serious eco- nomic functions.” Yeltsin has not been seen in ng _ roe 26, just before his July 3, re-election victory , over Comeecuist on tae ganov.

He postponed a session with Gore on Monday, raising seri- ous concerns about the presi- dent’s health. “I think he’s relaxing and getting some needed rest,’’ Gore said after seeing Yeltsin at the Barvikha_ sanatorium, where the president unexpect- edly began a “vacation” Sun- day. ‘“‘But to me he looks good after a 4S-minute meeting.

        "ocr_text": "Boa Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Not far from the Kremlin lives the last of Vladi- mir Lenin’s close relatives, a faithful niece on a $65-a-month pension who is girding herself to deflect yet another assault on his revolutionary resting place. Three times in the past seven years, retired chemistry profes- sor Olga Ulyanova has emerged from her obscure life to spear- head letter-writing campaigns against the removal of her un- cle’s body from Lenin’s Tomb. Each time, her stinging prose has helped convince authorities not to move the patriarch of com- munism from his refrigerated glass box below the cobblestones of Red Square. Now, after the defeat of Com- munist Party candidate Gennady Zyuganov in the July 3 presiden- tial election, the 74-year-old Ulyanova is again on the alert for renewed agitation to close the Lenin mausoleum. “If this comes up again, I will, of course, begin to fight once more,” said Ulyanova. “Once people are buried, it is wrong to move them under any cir- cumstances.” Since Zyuganov’s. defeat, there has been no resumption of the calls by anti-Communists in 1989, 1991 and 1993 to rebury the embalmed body of Lenin in a family plot in St. Petersburg. “History is history,” said Ulyanova, who lives in a spacious apartment one subway stop from Red Square. “When Napoleon died, there were some people who hated him and some people who loved him. Nevertheless, his body was brought to Paris and buried. The same thing with Le- nin. Lenin is history — the histo- ry of the creation of the socialist state.” From out of a locked drawer, she pulls her most prized posses- sion: a 1922 photograph of the Ulyanov family, showing Olga at the age of S months, looking like a scowling princess in her moth- er’s arms.

Olga was 2 when Lenin died of a stroke in 1924. It was at the behest of the Communist Party, not the Ulyanov family, that Le- nin was mummified three months later and put on display near the Kremlin as the center- piece of Stalin’s secular religion. Although Lenin’s widow, Na- dezhda Krupskaya, is said by his- torians to have visited Lenin’s embalmed body only infrequent- ly because she found the tomb emotionally upsetting, Ulyanova says she still stands in line to pay a visit to the mausoleum several times a year. As Stalin was consolidating power in the late 1920s, the new Soviet leader allowed Lenin’s brother Dmitri Ulyanov and his family to remain in their Krem- lin apartment. Dmitri’s daughter, Olga, grew up inside the Kremlin walls as a childhood acquaintance of Stalin’s children Svetlana and Vassily. She remembers a seem- ingly placid time in the Kremlin in the early 1930s, when Stalin used to walk through the grounds unaccompanied by bodyguards. Despite growing up as a guest of Stalin, Ulyanova blames him for having poisoned the minds of many Russians toward the mem- ory of her uncle. She credits Sta- lin with turning Russia into an industrialized nation but adds, “He took very cruel measures against his political opponents, which weren’t needed.”’ Ulyanova lived in the Krem- lin until 1949, when she left to pursue her own 45-year career, ending as an assistant professor at Moscow State University. In contrast to the far-flung Romanov dynasty, which contin- ues to proliferate even though most members were massacred by Bolsheviks in 1918, $ Ulyanov family tree has died out. Its only sureivies branch consists of Olga UlySay ova, her daughter and grand. daughter. Lenin never had any cr dren, either by Krupskaya or his longtime companion in exile; Inessa Armand. Four of Lenin’s five siblings also died childles$, including Lenin’s brother Alc ander, who was hanged in 1 for plotting to assassinate Czat Alexander ITI. Lenin’s brother Dmitri, whi served as Lenin’s go-between at several key stages of under- ground plotting before the 1917 revolution, kept the family name intact after the Bolshevik tri- umph by raising two children, a boy and a girl. : Of Dmitri’s two children, only Olga Ulyanova is still alive. Since the 1940s, she has been married to Alexei Maltsev, a retired phys: icist at the university. Lenin’s niece and her hus: band have one child, a divorced daughter, Nadezhda, 40, who works as a senior specialist at the Kremlin’s Armory Museum, Moscow’s most important collec- tion of czarist history. Olga also has one granddaughter, now an 18-year-old student in Paris. Ulyanova, a lifelong Commu- nist, has chosen to keep the Ulyanov family name instead of her husband’s. She says she still ‘hopes for the day when Commu nists and other Russian patriots unite to reverse the defeat the Communists suffered in the July 3 presidential election.

' ‘Just months before’ the Games, which were to be a Com- maunist showcase, the United States led a massive boycott to protest Soviet military interven- tion in Afghanistan. It was a tac- tical maneuver that provoked re- e - fe tafiation four years later, when inédst East Bloc teams boycotted the Los Angeles Games. ~ “It was a tragedy for many of ws,” says Alexander Buka- sheyev, a Soviet track coach. “Of course, it would have been more peeningful to win in a competi- with Americans and Japa- athletes and others who d the Moscow Olympics. * “I can tell you that from 1977 ta 1980, the whole country was working for the Olympics,” he says. Indeed, the buildup includ- ed overhauling 13 sports facili- ties and construction of 12 new ones.

But when much of the world didn’t show, the luster of new fa- cilities was lost. A generation of the world’s athletes would have to wait 12 years, from 1976 to 1988, for a full Olympic forum to prove their skills. For many it was simply too long. Bukasheyev still mourns the career of runner Viktor Markin, who took a gold medal in the 400 meters in 1980. “I can tell you just one thing. If we had participated in the Los Angeles Olympics, my Viktor wouldn’t have quit in 1984,” Bu- kasheyev says. “This is my big regret. He was my student for 10 years. And he quit when he was in very good shape. And not just him. Many of our athletes quit af- ter 1984.” Still, neither politics nor time diminishes the thrill of victory. “The Olympic gold made a victory absolutely, emotionally unequaled,” Bukasheyev says. His focus now, 16 years after coaching Markin to his triumph and 12 years after being denied the chance ‘to repeat it, is on bringing a 400-meter relay team to Atlanta. Finally, his team will compete in an Olympics on American soil. \f"

        "ocr_text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Russian President Boris Yeltsin (right) meets with his chief of staff, Anatoly Chubais, on Wednesday when it was decided that rid sonnel s pions eege rece will be held inside instead of outdoors. Yeltsin’s health believed cause of change in inaugural ceremony By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — His face drawn and inert, President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday canceled his cher- ished plan to link himself to a 500- year continuum of Russian czarist history by holding his inauguration on a historic Kremlin square sur- rounded by three onion-domed ca- thedrals. Despite official Kremlin deni- als, the Russian president’s fragile health is suspected as the reason. This week, workmen have put up an outdoor inauguration stand at the foot of the grand Red Stair- case of the Granovitaya Palace, from which four centuries of Ro- manov emperors descended on their way to weddings and corona- tions. It is also the staircase from which the French emperor Napo- leon watched Moscow burning in 1812, the only time the Russian capital was captured. But on Wednesday Yeltsin is- sued an edict moving the Friday ceremony indoors to a less de- manding — and less symbolic — locale inside a Kremlin govern- ment building. A spokesman said the ceremony was moved indoors because Friday is forecast as a rainy day and because an indoor inauguration would be $1.7 million cheaper. To follow the same path the Romanovs walked down the Red Staircase, Yeltsin would have had to descend 50 stone stairs to reach the inaugural platform. The out- door ritual would have been the first major state ceremony at the Kremlin’s Cathedral Square since the 1917 Russian Revolution. On M- nay the Kremlin began to downplay the outdoor ceremo- ny, however. It announced that Yeltsin will take part in only about 25 minutes of what had earlier been described as an hourlong inaugural in Cathedral Square. Then on Tuesday came a re- port from the Interfax news agen- cy quoting unnamed Kremlin sources as saying the whole cere- mony might be moved inside to the 19th century Kremlin Palace, where visiting foreign leaders have been received throughout and since the communist period. “This is absolutely not con- nected with the condition of the president’s health,’’ Interfax quoted an unnamed Kremlin source as saying. On Wednesday, the Moscow Times reported that Yeltsin plans to speak for only two or three minutes after he takes his oath of office Friday. The paper quoted unnamed aides as saying Yeltsin is Palm Beach Post - August 8 , 1996 very tired and plans to go back on vacation for two months after the inauguration. Since late in June, a week before his July 3 reelection, Yelt- sin hasn’t made a public appear- ance and there have been uncon- firmed reports that he suffered a recurrence of heart pains. He returned to the Kremlin from the Barvikha state sanatori- um outside Moscow only on Tues- day, to be greeted with news that Chechen rebels had made a sur- prise raid on the Chechen capital Grozny, killing dozens of Russian troops and seizing several key downtown buildings. The Red Staircase, a ceremo- nial pathway designed by Italian architects in 1487, is affixed to the outside of the Granovitaya Palace and is in plain sight of a VIP viewing stand set up in front of the inaugural platform. In an indication of his staffs nervousness about showing Yelt- sin’s sometimes halting gait, the Kremlin had set up a platform for TV cameras at an angle from which it would have been impossi- ble to photograph him descending the staircase. w Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel are correspondents in Cox Newspapers’ Moscow bureau. \f"

        "ocr_text": "By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — President Boris Yeltsin’s cameo appearance at his inauguration Friday raised more questions about the 65- year-old leader’s health, even as a new crisis in Chechnya clouded the opening of his second term in Office. At the same time Yeltsin was woodenly pledging to defend “the security and unity of the Russian Federation,’ Chechen rebels were blasting their way into Grozny, the capital of their secessionist mountain republic, after a four-day offensive. It was an inauspicious omen over the inauguration of the first president of an independent Rus- sia chosen in a free and demo- cratic election. Yeltsin initially won election in 1991, when Rus- sia was merely a republic in the Soviet Union that broke apart lat- er that year. Yeltsin made no speech and uttered not a single word other than his 45-second oath of office during the televised ceremony, a strikingly low-key event for the historic occasion. Plans for an elegant ritual on the Kremlin square where czars celebrated their coronations were suddenly scaled back this week to Friday’s indoor event, in which Yeltsin participated for only 16 minutes. Russians already were won- dering if Yeltsin’s new four-year term will begin a retrogression to the Soviet days of murky leader- ship under elderly fading figure- heads, when few knew who was in control and no one admitted responsibility.

Stalin in the early 1950s. Then beginning in the 1970s a series of old and ailing leaders spent long periods as little more than props: Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andro- pov, Konstantin Chernenko. “The question of who is gov- erning the country in Yeltsin’s name is no longer an idle one,” said Sergei Baburin, the leader of a nationalist opposition group and member of Parliament. He compared Yeltsin’s lengthy san- atorium respites to Lenin’s long months of illness at a dacha south of Moscow. Pavel Voshanov, a former Yeltsin spokesman, wrote in a news column this week of fears that Yeltsin will become ‘‘a pure- ly ceremonial figure with a shad- owy collective rule” by his aides and advisers. Plans for Yeltsin to begin a vacation this weekend, which may last two months, did not help his image. After suffering two heart episodes that laid him up Atlanta Journal-Constitution for months last year, Yeltsin re- bounded into a spirited re-elec- tion campaign this spring. Thena week before the July 3 runoff election the president canceled his scheduled events and has not appeared openly in public since. He has rested at the Barvikha government sanatorium north of Moscow, with a close aide, Georgy Satarov, describing him as being “in wonderful intellec- tual and psychological form,” but suffering from woolgatat weariness.’ Yeltsin made an appearance at a reception after the inaugura- tion where he offered a toast be- fore invited guests. His voice there and when taking the oath was firm, but his enunciation was not crisp. “We want and will secure prosperity and order in every city, in every village so that ey- ery Russian home is made pros- perous, that the power will serve the people, and everyone can say with pride about oneself: I am.a citizen of Russia,” said Yeltsin, who stood tall as he toasted and looked less stiff than during the ceremony. Yeltsin designated Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to stay in the post and form a new government, but the State Duma, lower chamber of Parliament, is grumbling about approving the appointment in special session today.

Charges flew that a military coup was in the making, as warplanes began an intensive new assault to retake Grozny, the capital of the secessionist republic overrun by rebel forces in recent weeks. ! Who authorized the offensive was in question, as Defense Minister Igor Rodionov said the local com- mander acted without orders. “The situation is favorable for a new GKChP [State Committee for Emergency Situations]. We are on the brink of military dictatorship,” said Sergei Yushenkov, who spoke at a press conference democratic members of parliament. He referred to the emergency committee that tried to assume power in the August 1991 abortive coup, undertaken while Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was on vacation. Despite the excited charges, the streets in Moscow were calm and there was no ao of troop movements or other efforts to take power by force. An array of democratic leaders demanded that the offensive against Grozny be halted and peace talks resumed in an effort to end 20 months of fighting in Chechnya. Streams of refugees were reported leaving Grozny throughout the day, after the local commander of Russian troops said a full-scale assault would begin today. Reports from the republic’s capital said fierce bombing attacks already pierced the city yesterday. The crisis reared into the normally tranquil, Russian summer amidst persisting reports that Yeltsin’s heart problems have taken a serious new turn. € . e Yeltsin was expected back in his Kremlin office today, according to the independent news agency Interfax, which said that after just two days he was Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - August 22, 1996 leaving his quiet lakeside vacation at Valdai, 270 miles north of St. Petersburg. After initially saying Yeltsin would spend two weeks or more there, his press office explained he had merely gone on an inspection visit to decide if he wished to vacation there. Assuming Yeltsin does return, he must gear up to combat renewed stories of his deteriorating health as much me to take charge of a government spinning out of control. The 65-year-old president has scarcely been seen in cic for the last two months. The aggressive Echo oscow radio station reported Tuesday that Yeltsin had been treated recently in a special cardiological center, and this week Time magazine said he needs heart surgery abroad. The Kremlin has denied these reports. Yeltsin's Aug. 9 inauguration was the president’s last, brief public appearance, when he walked stiffly and in some instances slurred his speech. ‘ Besides the health rumors, Yeltsin must contend with disarray within his own camp of followers. The crux of conflict is between retired Gen. Alexan- der Lebed, the head of Yeltsin’s National Security Council, and other officials who fear Lebed is gaining a strong position to become the next president of Russia. At present his clearest antagonists are Interior Minis- try officials trying to maintain power both in Moscow and in Chechnya. Lebed, acting under a wide brief from Yeltsin to end the Chechen war, flew to the capital Grozny yesterday to confer with both rebel leaders and Russian military officers looking increasingly like rogue elements. Last week, the outspoken Lebed accused Interior Ministry leaders of having a vested interest in continu- ing the war, which he repeatedly has said can be ended only by a negotiated settlement. He called for the firin of the interior minister, but Yeltsin reportedly refused. \f"

The comment came just eight days. after Yeltsin made Lebed his personal repre- sentative in the republic, which has been fighting for inde- pendence. In a strange juxtaposition on evening TV news, reports from Chechnya told of brisk progress in Lebed’s second day of cease- fire talks in the rebel-controlled town of Novye Atagi,' 12 miles south of the Chechen capital, Grozny. Yeltsin, looking frail and speaking slowly in a television appearance, said there is no truth to press reports that he plans a trip to Switzerland for medical treatment related to a heart condition. ‘‘If I now go ona break, on a rest period, it will be ‘on the territory of Russia,’’ he said. Lebed got no support from Yeltsin in his demands for more control over military decisions in Chechnya. Yeltsin also did not explicitly back Lebed’s chief rival, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, a gen- eral who last week lambasted Lebed as a man with a “‘maniacal desire for power and insufficient knowledge of Chechnya’s problems.’’ That comment came the same day Lebed publicly described Kulikov as having a ‘‘Napoleonic complex’’ and gave Yeltsin an ul- timatum: “Only one of us can re- main in this system, either Lebed or Kulikov.”’ Returning to the Kremlin for his most active workday since late June, Yeltsin used his one- minute TV interview, broadcast on all government-run TV net- works, to e it clear that Associated: Press A frail-looking President Boris Yeltsin was in Moscow o ‘Thursday for his first workday since June.

Now he has power, but unfortunately so far the results of his work for Chechnya are not evident.”’ The Interfax news agency re- ported that Lebed had signed the latest in a series of cease-fires in the 20-month-old war over whether Russia’s oil-rich prov- ince of Chechnya should become independent. Lebed’s agreement with Chechen rebel Chief of Staff Aslan Maskhadov calls for end- ing military activity at noon to- day. -, As described to reporters, thé truce will be the most compre hensive yet; it bans ‘‘special oy erations’”’ by the Russian milita as well as “terrorist acts” by Chechens. oe After the signing, Lebed to journalists he was aware of the risks of cease-fire violations.

        "ocr_text": " Popov stabbed on Moscow street over watermelon By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE Moscow — Russian Olympic swim- ming champion Alexander Popov was in acondition of “medium seriousness” af- ter a stabbing incident Saturday night provoked by an argument with vendors over a watermelon. Popov, 24, was transferred to the Central Clinical Hospital after undergo- ing surgery at Moscow City Hospital No. 31, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. Central Clinical is the same hospital where President Boris Yeltsin was treated last year after two episodes of heart trouble. Itar-Tass quoted Interior Ministry sources as saying Popov, who defended A filales his 50- and 100-meter freestyle titles at the 1996 Olympics, had a “brain injury and piercing wounds in the abdomen.” Gennady Alyoshin, president of the Russian Swimming Federation, said the knife pierced his stomach, grazing his lungs and a kidney. Popov regained consciousness soon after the emergency surgery. “First of all, I want to thank the doc- tors who did the operation. There’s no need to worry. I’m going to be walking soon — and swimming,” he told NTV tele- vision from his hospital bed. According to reports, he was smiling, but looked weak and had a bandage around his head. Alexander Popov | is considering Austra- | lian citizenship be- cause “I’m safer there than | am back in Russia,” Popov was making a rare visit to Russia and is considering Australian citizenship. He said at the Olympics that one reason he lives and trains in Austra- lia is “I’m safer there than I am back in Russia. If I would have a good sponsor- ship, then I’m probably sure I’d be hav- ing problems with, like, how to keep my money and myself alive because of ma- fia and many idiots.” He also told Moscow’s Sport Express newspaper: “I’m striving very hard to re- turn to Russia from Australia, but the longer I stay here, the more I suffer from boorishness, lawlessness and dirt.” Popov had been attending a friend’s birthday party in southwest Moscow and was accompanying a male friend and two women guests to a bus stop when the attack occurred, police said. One of the women “either deliber- ately or accidentally” damaged a water- melon ata street vendor's stand near the bus stop, saying it was rotten, Itar-Tass said. The owners of the fruit stand, whom the news agency identified as “of Caucasian extraction,” turned up and provoked a fight. Many of Moscow’s street vendors come from the southern Caucasus re- gion and for years have been the targets of racism from the Russian population. This has been exacerbated by the con- flict in Chechnya. A deputy investigator of Moscow’s interior ministry said one suspect has been detained and a police sketch of the alleged knife-wielder will be shown on all Russian TV channels. In 1992, Russian diver Dmitry Sau- ‘tin was stabbed repeatedly in a rabbery attempt by gang members on the street. He recovered and competed in the 1992 and 96 Games.

        "ocr_text": " Three leaders in power struggle A Kremlin political strategist has the inside track against two higher-profile public officials. MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service . MOSCOW — He stays under a shad- ow’s edge, as befits a Kremlin eee but presidential aide Anatoly Chubais has become Russia’s leading r bro- ker while President Boris Yeltsin is sick on the sidelines. With Yeltsin scheduled for heart surgery after two months mostly off the job, and with the Kremlin roiled by in- ternal conflict, Chubais, the Kremlin chief of staff, increasingly is calling the shots in Russia. “The fact is that Yeltsin is not in charge,” said Sergei Baburin, deputy speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. With Yeltsin’s capacity to rule in doubt, “the most influential person to- day is certainly Chubais,” said Baburin, a critic of the privatization policies Chubais has long championed. One of Chubais’ advantages is that he acts in league with Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, a political tito. phyte who only recently emerged as a Kremlin force. A second is that in a gov- ernment run largely by presidential fiat, Chubais now signs off on all of Yeltsin's _ decrees before they can be issued. Dumped by Yeltsin last January, Chubais was brought back to the Krem- lin this spring to revamp the president's faltering reelection campaign. He now hangs on to the commanding spot in an uneasy troika of power harnessing Chubais and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin with National Security Secretary Alexander Lebed. The three are absorbed in a bare- knuckled Kremlin power struggle — the most public in Russia's history — which has Russians wondering who is actually running their country. There has been no visible threat of a coup. The fight is over who will legally succeed Yeltsin, 65, and Chubais may have gained the upper hand by the fact that, at the moment, he is not.an active candidate. The principals the blunt retired general, and Cher- nomyrdin, 58, the former Soviet appa- ratchik with whom Chubais is allied for now. The mix will change if Yeltsin dies or becomes too incapacitated to serve. Chubais, 40, reached preeminence by getting Yeltsin reelected this summer. Yeltsin had exiled from the Kremlin the Western-oriented economist who mas- terminded Russia's privatization pro- gram after it came under merciless fire to succeed Yeltsin bs et CHERNOMYRDIN from opposing presidential candidates. But Chubais was the only person bold enough to tell Yeltsin he was danger- ously behind in the race, and then con- vinced him it was possible to win only by sticking with free-market policies rather than returning to the Communist solutions he had started to embrace. Chubais carried with him the leading proponents of private capital in Russia, the men who got rich because commu- nism gave way to capitalism. Chubais has installed himself in the Kremlin office next to the president's, and the key lever he controls is the is- suance of the “ukaz,” or presidential di- rective. In Russia, presidential preroga- tive is vastly stronger than either leg- islative or judicial power, and these di- rectives determine the course of gov- ernment. For now, Chubais is aligned with Cherno in in an effort to stunt the onition by winateg lo percent of | position inning rcento the wane it the first round of the presi: dential election in June. He threw his support to Yeltsin in the runoff in ex- change for the promise of a top job. Chubais and Chernomyrdin tried to scuttle Lebed’s image as a plain-talking man of action by handing him the war in Chechnya to resolve. To widespread amazement, Lebed not only put a stop to the offensive. He also sat dew with separatist leaders, knocked out a cease-fire agreement in the 21-month-old war, and then se- cured a draft peace agreement that calls for a final decision on Chechnya to be made in elections five years from now.

        "ocr_text": " Russian cardiac center seeing hard times By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT _ Moscow — President Boris Yeltsin plans his heart bypass surgery in a faded Communist- era showplace that somehow re- tains world-class surgeons even though it is too starved for cash to cut the grass. Clumps of weeds have taken root and grown knee-high through cracks in the granite front stairs outside the Cardiac Research Center on the western edge of Moscow. . Inside the marble-walled cor- ridors there are abandoned nurs- ing stations, unused offices and only a scattering of patients. - “Moscow cardiology institute battles for its life,” the Ameri- can-based Science magazine headlined four months ago. Its anguished report said Russia’s main cardiology center “finds it- self on the critical list” because of a precipitous drop in Russia’s science budget after the fall of communism. The Science story focused on a decline in cardiological re- search caused by the exodus of at least 150 of the center’s heart re- search scientists to better-pay- ing jobs abroad. Instead of 20 heart research labs a decade ago, the center was down to six fully functioning labs, the report said. Since then there have been signs that the center’s budget pinch has spread from the re- search labs to the clinical branch where Yeltsin’ expects to be treated later this month. To save on electricity and other operat- ie costs, services to patients are ing curtailed. On’ Thursday evening, the night Yeltsin teld the nation he was coming to the center for heart surgery, only 150 of the 410 surgical beds were occupied. “We have so few patients now MISHA JAPARIDZE / Associated Press The Cardiac Research Center outside of Moscow has been financially strapped since the fall of communism. because the Ministry of Health hasn’t given the center enough money for food for the patients,” Dr. Georgi Sarkizian explained. “They have also decided to allow patients to have visits from their families four times a week. You know why? Because the fam- ilies bring food,” said Sarkizian, a physician who was in the hospi- tal recuperating from his own heart ailment. Yet, Sarkizian and others at the center said that medical stan- dards remain high in the two op- erating suites. “We have all the necessary equipment — ultrasound, com- puters, everything,” said Sarki- zian. “It was all bought a long time ago, in the time of the U.S.S.R. Now they don’t buy any new equipment.” One of the institute’s senior cardiologists, Alexander Myas- nikov, told the Interfax news agency that if Yeltsin comes for surgery, the operation will be carried out in a branch chaired by surgeon Renat Akchugian. Akchugian is Russia’s leading expert on bypass surgery and trained for two years in Houston under American cardiology pio- neer Dr. Michael De Bakey. Myasnikov confirmed that the heart operation that awaits Yeltsin in late September is a “shunt” procedure, known in the West as a bypass. He said that a “shunt” typically takes five to seven hours. Myasnikov said that after a shunt operation, a typical patient moves to intensive care for five to seven days of continual moni- toring, then moves to a hospital ward for another two weeks. When the cardiology center opened in 1982, it was the crown jewel of Soviet academic medi- cine. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 7, 1996 \f"

After four years as a partycrat, Chernomyr- din jumped again to become deputy minister of the gas industry. His main assignment was in Siberia, where he opened a string of giant gas fields and laid a huge 56-inch pipeline for transporting super- chilled gas across permafrost. Early in 1985, a government shuffle led to Chernomyrdin’ Ss pro- motion as minister of the gas indus- try. The Chernobyl nuclear acci- dent in 1986 made the Soviet Union all the more dependent on its gas industry, and Chernomyrdin and several aides he had brought from Orenburg stimulated five years of explosive growth in natural gas as nuclear reactors were being de- layed and oil production was dropping. But then pollution scandals sur- rounded Chernomyrdin’s gas min- istry in 1989, threatening to end his golden career just as the Soviet Un- ion was crumbling.

In June 1989, a liquefied natu- ral gas explosion near Ufa de- stroyed a key pipeline and cut the nation’s liquefied gas supply by 25 percent overnight. Gorbachev’s flashy young reformers blamed the old-style Soviet technocrat Cherno- myrdin. Throughout the summer of 1989, reports in Western trade journals said Chernomyrdin had been fired or had retired because of “ill health.”’ But once again, Cher- nomyrdin seized an opportunity. With the government desperate for hard currency, in July 1989 he won approval to split off the gas ministry from the government and turn it into a state gas cokyeration called Gazprom. Just 18 months before the Sovi- et Union disappeared, Chernomyr- din exchanged his Soviet minister’s post for a new title: chairman of the board of Gazprom. Suddenly he was running a corporation with one-third of the world’s gas re- serves, more than 300,000 employ- ees and more dollar earnings than Orenburg, Russia ] any other Russian company. Gazprom’s influence multiplied as everything in Russia collapsed around it. Chernomyrdin quit the Com- munist Party in 1991 and bounced back into the Russian government in May 1992. First he became depu- ty fuel and energy minister, then six months later was Yeltsin’s com- ‘promise choice as prime minister. He had to resign as chairman of Gazprom but continued to exert control through his old colleague from Orenburg, Rem Vyakhirev, whom he appointed as his replace- ment to run Gazprom. Vyakhirev carried off a contro- versial and highly secretive “priva- tization” of Gazprom in the spring of 1993. Chernomyrdin later insist- ed he owns no Gazprom shares. Whether or not Chernomyrdin benefited personally from the Gaz- - prom privatization, the 1,200 resi- dents of his home village of Chyorny Otrog did. On April 20, 1993, within weeks of the privatiza- tion, ‘he signed a pledge to elders saying that funds woult! found to reconstruct the old R sian Orthodox church ruined i ing sef Stalin’s time. Chernomyrdin delivered. In . 1995, crews of marbie cutters, plas- terers, icon writers and other work- ers descended on the village. The Tass news agency said the money was provided by Gazprom and a private company called the Inter- national Economic Corp., headed by Russian oil trader Vitaly Kiril- lov. The town’s priest said the church may have cost $2 million. Chernomyrdin returned to Chyorny Otrog on Sept. 6 to watch the church’s consecration by Patri- arch Aleksy, head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Tass said a plaque to be affixed to the wall will note that the church was built “through the efforts of the Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin.” - September 15, 1996 (Continued) \f"

Yeltsin has problems with other organs that may compli- cate the surgery, it was revealed Friday. Dr. Sergei Mironov, the Kremlin’s chief physician, gave few details except to say the Rus- sian president has no major liver or kidney troubles. But he seemed to confirm that Yeltsin’s health is worse than previously acknowledged and that surgeons are concerned about how to keep other problems at bay during a planned heart bypass. Akchurin told ABC News Fri- day that the president had suf- fered a heart attack this summer while campaigning for re-elec- tion. Akchurin did not remember the date, but said it was at the end of June or the beginning of July — in between the two rounds of presidential voting. Akchurin, who heads the sur- gery department at Moscow’s Russian Cardiology Center, is considered a specialist in heart bypass operations of the kind Yeltsin is facing as early as next Thursday. Among his roster of success- ful bypass patients is Prime Min- ister Victor Chernomyrdin, who will be acting president during Yeltsin’s surgery. Akchurin is a graduate of the Moscow Medical Academy and worked first in Moscow’s Pe- trovsky microsurgery center be- fore transferring to the cardiolo- gy center when it opened in 1984.

        "ocr_text": "Communists gain in rural Russia By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Krasnodar, Russia — With Russian President Boris Yeltsin laid up with heart trouble, the Communist Party is moving toward footholds of power in provinces such as this fertile southern breadbasket, which well may elect a Communist gov- ernor next month, The autumn markets are brimming with meat and vegeta- bles in Krasnodar province, less than 100 miles east of Russia’s Black Sea resorts. Yet despite the seeming abundance, even some voters who supported Yelt- sin over a Communist challenger in the summer presidential elec- tion are leaning toward a local Communist leader who promises to bring back jobs and bring down prices. “Tt is important who is the governor,” said Anatoly Stoyaro- sev, 55, a meat loader at the mar- ketplace. “It affects our daily struggle, our trade, our future,” _ Stoyarosev, who voted for Yeltsin, said he likes the Commu- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 22, 1996 nist candidate, Nikolai Kondra- tenko, for governor in the Octo- ber election. “He is the best one. He represents the working peo- ple,” Stoyarosev said. The Communist Party an- chors a coalition of Communist and nationalist groups and is ex- ceptionally strong in the prov- ince of nearly 4.8 million people. But it has supporters in much of rural Russia, Forecasters who wrote off the Communists after they lost the presidency predict that the party could win 10 of the 52 regions with gubernatorial elections this fall and winter. The positions being decided are similar to U.S. governor: ships, except the victors hold dual roles. They not only lead provincial administrations but also become members of the up- per house of the Russian parlia- ment, which in some ways paral: lels the U.S. Senate. The Communist-led bloc stumbled in the first gubernato- rial election this month in Sara- tov province, when a popular democratic candidate won a big victory in what had been consid- ered a close race. The next test comes today in Amur province in Russia’s Far East, where voters gave a 53 percent majority to Communist Gennady Zyuganov and only 41 percent to Yeltsin in the July presidential runoff. Yevgeny Raschepkin, head of the Communist Party organiza- tion in Krasnodar, explained that his bloc’s strategy is taking over provincial governments in the “red belts” — heavily industrial- ized regions that have fallen on hard times, Krasnodar province, which voted 52-44 percent in fa- vor of Zyuganov, is one of them. “Tf we win at least in some of these regions then these so- called red belts may grow into a real physical force instead of ab- Sstract areas where a majority of the population prefer one or an- other political idea,” Raschepkin said. “They will set up coopera- tion and horizontal ties among themselves and be able to con- duct their own policy, different from the policy of the center — in the economy, in social programs and other spheres,” \f"

DeBakey’s comments followed a brief talk at Sheremetyevo Airport with a greeting party of top Russian heart experts, including Dr. Renat Akchurin, DeBakey’s former student who last week was designated Yeltsin’s chief surgeon. DeBakey, who pioneered heart surgery tech- niques at Baylor University in Texas, addressed far blander remarks to waiting American jour- nalists. “I am always optimistic,’”’ he said as he left for a government guest house in Moscow’s Lenin Hills neighborhood. “I can tell you noth- ing about his health until I get the information.” DeBakey’s role in the case grew over the weekend after Akchurin voiced doubts about whether Yeltsin is healthy enough to withstand a “most serious operation.” In television interviews Akchurin disclosed that Yeltsin suffered a heart attack in June while , campaigning for the July 3 presidential election. He said it was a relatively mild incident called a “‘stenocardia” due to lack of blood to the heart caused by too much standing. Akchurin said it could take ‘six or eight weeks” of tests and observation before Yeltsin is ready for the expected coronary bypass opera- tion, and even then an operation might be inad- visable. Akchurin also made it clear that he val- ues DeBakey’s judgment higher than that of any other foreign specialist. “In the whole world there exists the so-called method of ‘second-opinion,’ when another high- ly qualified specialist is invited and asked for his opinion,” Akchurin explained in a Russian TV interview late Sunday. “I think that Dr. Michael Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 24, 1996 DeBakey will serve as an arbiter.” Akchurin, who studied at DeBakcy’s ]Tous- ton clinic for six months in 1984, said DeBakcy will take part in a closed meeting of Russian doc- tors Wednesday to weigh the clinical evidence from tests that were to be administered to the hospitalized president Monday and today. One test will involve the injection of a radio- active tracer isotope into Yeltsin’s veins. The purpose, Akchurin explained, is ‘‘to determine the boundaries, the extent of damage to the myo- cardium.”’ The myocardium is the middle mus- cular layer of the heart wall, and Akchurin’s re- mark suggested that Yeltsin’s surgical team still doesn’t know for sure the scale of Yeltsin’s heart disease. Yeltsin’s illness officially was described last year as myocardial ischemia. Patients with this form of heart disease are commonly given the radioactive tracer thallium 201 to document whether the myocardium has suffered perma- nent scarring or “reversible’”’ ischemia, accord- ing to Merck’s Manual of Diagnosis and Ther- apy. Another test, Akchurin said, will be an ultra- sound heart mapping procedure known as echo- cardiography. The purpose, Akchurin said, was to help “determine the function of the heart, its contractive function, the function of the ventri- cles and valves.” + Faced with the unwelcome prospect of a postponed operation, the Kremlin retreated be- hind a wall of ‘‘no comments”’ Monday. The only significant announcement was that Yeltsin will go forward with his traditional weekly meeting with Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin to- day, with an agenda chocked with weighty is- sues, from the “situation in Chechnya” to “the social-economic condition in the country.”’ The meeting will take place in the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, where Yeltsin has been hospitalized since Sept. 13. Communist opposition politicians were quick to assert that the president was in no con- dition to lead Russia. And the pressure was sure to increase when Parliament resumes sessions Oct. 1 after its summer break. Communist Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of the state Duma, the lower house of Parliament, called on Yeltsin to resign voluntarily if doctors tell him he must restrict his physical activities in lieu of an operation. ‘Russia doesn’t have the kind of situation that allows [the president] to reduce his work intensity,” Seleznyov said. Communist Party Chairman Gennady Zyu- ganov said Yeltsin’s action in concealing his June heart attack from voters ‘“‘amounts to falsi- fication’”’ and renders the elections “unfair.” \f"

He spoke about Russia’s future in the wake of President Bo- ris Yeltsin’s heart troubles. Here are excerpts: Q: What do you expect, as- suming President Yeltsin under- goes surgery? At It doesn’t matter what Olshansky happens to the president in your country. Johnson took over when Kennedy was assassinated. Ford took over after Nixon re- signed. Your system was not de- stroyed. But in Russia, our system is young and weak, and everything is focused on one per- son. To get sick or to die is enough for the whole system to fall apart. The risk is very high. Q: But you do have constitu: tional provisions for a suc- cession, A: So what? The constitution means nothing. There must be - an agreement between the elites to support the constitution and agreement of the population to live under the system. We do not have an agreement of the elites at the moment. Q: If Prime Minister-Viktor Chernomyrdin becomes acting president, won't the elites have to deal with him? A: No. No. There are at least five people who are pretender's to the presidency, Let’s start with the Communist Party chairman Gennady Zyuganov. Don’t forget the results of the July presiden- tial elections when he won 40 million votes, So Zyuganov is No. 1, and we can do nothing about it. Then Premier Cherno- myrdin, and also the secretary of the National Security Council Al- ‘exander Lebed and Moscow May- or Yuri Luzhkov. We also have Yegor Stroyev, leader of the up- per house of parliament. Q: What about the risks of an unconstitutional takeover after Yeltsin’s operation? A: Anything is possible. Why? Because the law doesn’t ' clearly spell out what “acting . president” means. Q: Then you rule out the pos- sibility that Yeltsin will come back and regain control? A! In any event it will be temporary. If he returns, he'll stay in power half a year, a year. Q: You seem pessimistic. A: No. I'ma realist, I re- turned to Russia from serving in Afghanistan in the beginning of '87, during the time of (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev’s “perestroika” (restructuring). There was a very popular expres: sion: Who is the optimist under the conditions of perestroika? This was a person who studies law on cooperatives, for coopera- tives were very popular then, And who is a pessimist under perestroika? It is a person who studies English. But perestroika also gave birth to a third type of thinking: the realist. What does a realist study? He learns the workings of a Kalashnikov (as- sault rifle).

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow Julia Sherba-} , kova, a 47-year-old grandmother who lives in Moscow, is typical o many Russians: She doesn’t mind that the Kremlin has cov- ered up the seriousness of Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin’s heart con- dition. What little information the Kremlin and Yeltsin’s doctors have given out is “more than enough,” she said. “It was not common here before, such open ness. We are not used to it. It i considered an interference in someone’s private life.”’ To many outside Russia, it seems strange, even scandalous, that the Kremlin didn’t tell the public when Yeltsin suffered a serious bout of cardiac distress 10 days before the climactic July 3 presidential runoff vote. Aides said he was suffering from a cold and exhaustion. But what unsettles many Rus- Sians is hearing anything at all about Yeltsin’s heart troubles. “What I worry about is the chaos which may begin because of his health condition — new elections and a new round of hus- tling,’”’ said Sergei Fedotov, 41, an economist. Doctors say Yeltsin, 65, who is in a Moscow hospital, needs a coronary bypass operation. He was hospitalized twice last year, and doctors said he suffered from myocardial isch- emia, a condition in which con- stricted arteries hamper the flow of oxygen to the heart. In announcing Sept. 5 that he would need surgery, Yeltsin said he was making his condition known because he wanted to build a “society of truth.” Yet, the Kremlin and Russian media quickly fell into their old secre- tive habits. Covering up a Russian lead- er’s health troubles is nothing new. Since the 1917 Communist revolution, six of Russia’s nine leaders became invalids in the Kremlin: Vladimir Lenin, Jcsef Stalin, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Cher- nenko and Yeltsin. Of the six, only Yeltsin and Lenin tolerated publicity about their illnesses. When Yeltsin’s chief surgeon, Dr. Renat Akchurin, in a televi- sion interview over the weekend broke the silence over Yeltsin’s latest bout of heart trouble, most Russian media reacted by play- Associated Press Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin (left) offers a bou- -quet to Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a Moscow hospital 3 where Yeltsin is being treated for a heart ailment. ing down the story or ignoring it. “Probably unwittingly, Ak- churin started one new spiral of speculations,” complained col- umnist Tatyana Malkina in the typically aggressive Sevodnya (Today) newspaper. “The West- ern papers are competing to make up various terrible stories about Yeltsin’s health.”’ Even Yevgeny Kisilov, the freewheeling anchorman from the NTV independent television network who landed Akchurin’s TV interview, has not publicly Atlanta Journal- Constitution September 25, 1996 > Boris Yeltsin’s health problems appear to be wider-ranging than his heart disease. His surgeon says Yeltsin’s health may be too fragile for questioned why the Kremlin cov- ered up Yeltsin’s condition be- fore the runoff. Igor Gaidar, the former prime minister and pro-Western liberal politician, told supporters he wasn’t bothered that voters had been misled when they voted for Yeltsin over Communist lead- er Gennady Zyuganov. “Voters were choosing not personalities but a course,” Gaidar said. Akchurin said he thinks Yelt- sin’s third attack probably oc- curred when he was campaign- ing in his home town, Yekaterin- burg.

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Despite new tests showing blockages in both of Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin’s coronary arter- ies, a team of Russian and American surgeons ruled Wednesday that his heart bypass.operation should be de- layed for another six to 10 weeks be- cause of the president’s weak health. The doctors’ verdict raises the specter that Russia’s brittle democ- racy is entering a period of in- creased political instability, finan- cial turmoil and capital flight. “Naturally, in this condition of uncertainty, all kinds of political games are possible, and they do not herald anything good,” said Alexan- der Golz, political analyst for the Russian Defense Ministry newspa- per Red Star. The first litmus test is expected next Tuesday, when the Communist- dominated State Duma, the lower house of parliament, returns from a lengthy recess. The Duma is likely to take up a proposal by the Communist Party to create a medical investigat- ing commission to inquire whether Yeltsin is capable of continuing to function as president. _ A medical commission would be the first legal step in a parliamenta- ry bid to force Yeltsin’s resignation short of voting impeachment. Hard- liners in parliament already have called on Yeltsin — who was re- elected to a second five-year term in July — to step down. *, One medical risk factor barring an immediate operation is that Yelt- sin’s hemoglobin level has declined for unknown reasons since he suf- fered a heart seizure about two months ago, just before the July 3 presidential runoff election. This was disclosed at a Kremlin- arranged briefing by American con- sulting cardiologist Dr. Michael De- Associated Press Second opinion: Dr. Michael DeBakey (with Yeltsin in Moscow) said ‘“‘there is no reason why the president shouldn’t be restored to full normal activity” after surgery: ‘“‘He’s medically alert as he can be.” Bakey of Houston, who said the drop in red blood cells may have resulted from intestinal bleeding induced by extra doses of aspirin Yeltsin has taken to counteract his heart mal- adies. Though DeBakey joined a battery of Kremlin-appointed Russian doc- tors in assuring the public that the 65-year-old Yeltsin has a very high chance of surviving an anticipated triple or quadruple bypass opera- tion, there was immediate specula- tion that the surgery would never take place. “They will postpone it the next time too,’”’ predicted Sergei Markov, a political analyst at the Moscow of- fice of the American-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They will postpone it until they are ready to go for new elections.”’ DeBakey, the 88-year-old Texas cardiologist who performed the world’s first coronary artery bypass surgery in 1964, said Yeltsin needed at least six weeks of ‘‘cardiac reha- bilitation to improve his condition and get him in better shape for the operation.” i Delivering a second opinion that agreed with that of his Russian col- leagues, DeBakey said ‘‘there is no reason why the president shouldn’t be restored to full normal activity’’ once the bypass can be performed. Though the Russian doctors and DeBakey portrayed the six- to 10- week delay as standard medieal practice, at least one top European cardiologist found it puzzling. Dr. Hans Borst, an eminent Ger- man heart surgeon interviewed at a medical symposium in Moscow, said, “I cannot understand why they would wait for six weeks or more. When somebody has bad heart dis- ease, at least in the West, patients are operated on immediately.”’ DeBakey, the only foreign spe- cialist who took part in Wednesday’s two-hour meeting on Yeltsin’s heart problems, did not explain the pre- cise medical reason for the delay. DeBakey said the heart itself does not seem to have suffered per- manent damage, but should be re- stored once the requisite flow of oxy- genated blood is assured. : Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 26, 1996 \f"

        "ocr_text": "AAs president ails, Russia getting sicker By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Like President Boris Yeltsin, thousands of Russian workers are not going to their jobs these days. They are not ill, however. They are par- ticipants in strikes paralyzing large por- tions of eastern Russia. A work stoppage by 10,000 power plant employees is but one of many headaches facing the Kremlin as Yeltsin prepares for heart surgery six to 10 weeks from now and a two-month recu- peration that may keep him sidelined into the new year. There is an energy crisis that is leav- ing hundreds of thousands of people in the Russian Far East without electricity for 10 to 12 hours a day. There is a po- tential new flare-up of the war in Chech- nya. And the huge Russian army is threatening mutiny unless it is paid. “It’s a hard autumn, from the point of view of the economy, which has been promised for a long time,’’ said Leonid Sedov, an analyst at the Russian Center for Public Opinion and Market Re- search. “Of course, the illness of the president complicates the resolution of such problems.” Although he is to remain hospital- ized in Moscow, Yeltsin, 65, can sign pa- pers and talk to his chief aides in the runup to surgery. But a patient in his state will have to be shielded from any kind of pressure that would increase his ‘heart rate or his blood pressure. That means he can hardly be im- mersed in the most complex problems of his country. Soldiers selling their guns for food Kremlin security chief Alexander Lebed charged in an interview pub- lished Wednesday that the cash-starved government’s failure to pay soldiers’ wages could soon spark military upris- ings. ‘‘An armed mutiny may take place this autumn,”’ Lebed said in a comment that, although perhaps an exaggeration, served to underscore the enormous challenges facing Russia. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 26, 1996 An estimated $4 billion in back pay is owed to army employees and contrac- tors. Young conscripts reportedly are being forced to beg for food and soldiers are selling their guns for money to live. Other problems include the govern- ment’s failure to get life-sustaining fuel and food to 11 million residents of the soon-to-be-icebound north and skittish- ness in the stock market due to uncer- tainty over Yeltsin’s health. Not that Yeltsin ever had a wand to wave away difficulties. But the elected president carries moral authority among a proud nation accustomed to strong, centralized rule from the Kremlin. Yeltsin the politician sorely missed The energy crisis in the Far East is the kind of problem that even in normal times comes under the purview of - Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin and his government. But Chernomyr- din, who has assumed many presiden- tial responsibilities during Yeltsin’s ill- ness, is stretched thin. Yeltsin also is a consummate politi- cal juggler, ordinarily keeping in bal- ance the competing political interests that exist in his own team. He maintains some hold even from his sickbed, but Kremlin intrigue and plays for power and influence are growing with the president hospitalized. Lebed, the ambitious 46-year-old former general, is the wildest card in the deck. : In the interview published in Ve- chernaya Moskva (Evening Moscow) on Wednesday, Lebed criticized the U.S. bombing of Iraq and warned Washing- ton against ever employing the same tactic against Russia. “If such [a development] occurs, I would give back as good as I got imme- diately. In full,” he said. ‘‘We have noth- ing to lose. We have no pain barrier. Even if our heads are hit against as- phalt. And they have something to lose. So just think, gentlemen.”’ That is not the kind of talk President Clinton would expect to hear if Yeltsin were really in charge. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Security chief warns of power vacuum in Russia By Marcia KuNSTEL AND JOSEPH ALBRIGHT American-Statesman Intemational Staff - MOSCOW — Russian security chief Alexander Lebed, launching a burst of political jockeying by Kremlin presidential hopefuls, warned Thursday that Russia was “slipping into the abyss” because of a power vacuum created by President Boris Yeltsin's illness. “We are at a dangerous limit, a very dangerous limit,” Lebed told a news conference at which he painted a dire picture of instabil- ity in Russia. “If one-sixth of the world starts to crumble and ex- plode, everybody will be buried under the rubble.” The ex-gen- eral’s warn- ings coincided with predic- tions that it was open sea- son on the presidency in the wake of Wednesday’s decision to de- lay heart by- pass surgery on Yeltsin for six to 10 weeks. “New presidential campaign is about to begin,” the Political Cal- endar news service said in the headline of one dispatch. Prime Minister Viktor Cherno- myrdin — who is Lebed’s chief ri- val should Yeltsin fail to complete his five-year second term — called on his Cabinet to avoid political gamesmanship during Yeltsin’s prolonged hospitalization. “If members of the government start playing any kind of game there, in the State Duma (lower house of parliament), [ warn them that whoever they are, whatever their rank, they will not work here,” the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. Doctors said Wednesday that Yeltsin, 65, was fit enough to have a triple or quadruple heart bypass operation but advised delaying the procedure for at least six weeks to improve the chances of success. Heart surgery pioneer Dr. Mi- chael DeBakey of Houston, who is consulting on Yeltsin's case, said Yeltsin is generally healthy and works three to four hours a day. He said that after meeting with Yeltsin he concluded that many previous fears about Yeltsin’s health were unfounded. “IT was very pleasantly sur- prised considering that I had heard these rumors, too, and had even seen some pictures that sug- gested he was weary and hag- gard,” DeBakey told ABC News. “He looked fine. ... His mental at- titude was good. He was quite alert, very pleasant and his gener- al condition looked very satis- factory.” Dr. Sergei Mironov, head of medicine in the Kremlin, said Yeltsin will be capable of taking back the “nuclear button” — the codes that control Russia’s nucle- ar weapons arsenal — a day after the operation. Even so, the surgery is expected to keep Yeltsin out of the Kremlin at least until late December, and the announcement of this long power vacuum was enough to draw several claimants for the space. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who lost a bid for Yelt- ~ Sin’s job in June's preliminary presidential balloting, called on Yeltsin to resign. Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, another defeated presidential hopeful, did the same on Thursday. Austin American-Statesman - September 27, 1996 \f"

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — In the museum honoring the valor of the Red Army, Maj. Alexei Mogila paused from viewing past glories to articulate the discouraging and potentially dangerous dete- rioration of the current Russian military. “When we come to this muse- um, we are proud that we had these heroic deeds, this glorious history,” Mogila said. “But these traditions do not exist anymore. The current army is humiliated.” Pay is late, equipment is fall- ing apart and conditions are so bleak that soldiers at bases in the far north face starvation if de- layed supplies don’t get to them soon. There is talk of mutiny and strikes. At the Armed Forces Muse- um, it would be hard to guess the plight by looking at Mogila and his eight classmates from the General Staff Political Academy. Scrubbed and impeccably uni- formed, they conscientiously fol- lowed their guide past war mem- orabilia and panoramic paintings of triumphant Soviet troops. Talking to Mogila, it was even harder to guess how he kept up either the appearance or the spirit dictated by the tradition of a once great army. “We were paid last time in June,” said Mogila, who arrived in Moscow two months ago with his wife and two children, ages 4 and 18 months, for three years of ‘Study at the academy. “Our fam- ily is living in a dormitory. We have a room about 20 square me- ters [70 square feet], the four of us.” They use a communal bath and kitchen. At the age of 32, this man who chose to devote his life to defend- ing his country relies on his par- ents for the support his govern- ment does not give. Suddenly the state of the mili- tary has become news in Russia. The army newspaper Red Star no longer is a lonely voice alerting Russians to scandalous condi- tions in the military. National Security Adviser Al- exander Lebed recently warned that mutiny is not out of the ques: tion, and Defense Minister Igor Rodionov said that continued deprivations “may lead to ex- tremely undesirable and uncon- trollable processes.” A new Defense Council creat- ed by President Boris Yeltsin to tackle the financial crisis and re- store the military's combat readiness met for the first time Friday, approving unspecified manpower cuts aimed at mod- ernizing the armed forces. Yeltsin this week reportedly fired six generals who oppose his plan to slash the size of the mili- tary from six divisions, a cut that would reduce the number of men and women in uniform from 1.5 million by 300,000. Yeltsin wants to end conscription and create a smaller, professional force with higher standards and better equipment by 2000. Rodionov, appointed by Yelt- sin in July to improve army effi- ciency, has said reducing the force size and upgrading weap- ons and other equipment will cost $2.2 billion.

By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — The Kremlin ac- wledged Wednesday that Rugsian President Boris Yeltsin has not made a quick and com- pléte recovery from the puzzling deficiency of red blood cells that last month forced the delay of his heart bypass op- eration. But it said the surgery will be done in mid-November. “Signs of ane- mia had not been concealed from the very beginning of the presi- dent’s preoperative preparations but were the main concern of Yeltsin’s physicians,” the head of thé Kremlin medical and diag- nostic center, Dr. Sergei Mir- onov, told the Interfax news Z agency. “Now this y problem is being gradually settled, and there are no problems with blood supply which would rule out heart = sur- gery.” Therefore, Mironov added, “there is no rea- son to say Boris Yeltsin is beyond having an operation.” \", Yeltsin’s shortage of hemoglo- bin was first disclosed Sept. 25 by American consulting surgeon Mi- chael DeBakey, who said at the time that Yeltsin’s decline in red bl cells may have resulted fi intestinal bleeding induced byextra doses of aspirin taken to anteract heart maladies. Mironov’s remarks, coupled more alarmist comments fi unnamed sources broadcast t week by Moscow’s radio Eeho Moskvi, suggested that Y@itsin’s anemia may be associat- ed, with something more serious n overuse of aspirin. But Mir- oO maintained that the anemia be sufficiently controlled that Ye@itsin’s expected triple-bypass o tion can proceed in mid-No- vember as planned. * Mironov said Dr. Renat Ak- churin, who has been designated astchief surgeon for Yeltsin’s op- eration, is now at DeBakey’s clin- ic Houston with two Russian assistants to discuss Yeltsin’s op- eration and “‘Russian-U.S. coop- ers ion in heart surgery.” As Mironov was assuring the Russian public that the operation will proceed on schedule, Rus- sia’s state-controlled and inde- pendent television channels were reporting on new political moves among Yeltsin’s increas- ingly vociferous ministers. Interior Minister Anatoly Ku- likov accused National Security Adviser Alexander Lebed of at- tempting to organize ‘‘a mutiny” in the armed forces. Kulikov, one of the architects of the war in Chechnya, accused Lebed, a retired army general, of attempting to organize a special “Russian legion” of up to 50,000 special troops to discredit or even “liquidate” opponents of the Russian central government. Kukikov accused Lebed of negotiating an “unconstitution- al” end to the Chechen war last summer in order to improve his chances to succeed Yeltsin. The interior minister told a press conference that Chechen rebels had promised Lebed a force of 1,500 fighters to help him seize power in Moscow and that Lebed was also backed by “criminal structures.” Associated Press Boris Yeltsin (left) greets Belarus President Alexander Lu- kashenko on Wednesday near Moscow. But visiting U.S. De- fense Secretary William Perry is not on Yeltsin’s schedule. Lebed responded with an acerbic promise to file a defama- tion suit against Kulikov, de- manding one ruble — equivalent to one-sixtieth of a U.S. cent — in damages. “T don’t need his money re- ceived from bribes,” Lebed said. “TI will win this ruble, and it will be valuable as a keepsake.” Lebed acknowledged that he had dispatched documents to the defense and interior ministries, calling for the formation of a spe- cial unit of 3,500 elite troops “in order that the state should have forces.” He denied that this con- stituted an attempted mutiny. Yeltsin’s spokesman said the president was “highly con- cerned” and demanded an expla- nation from Kulikov and Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. As bitterness among Yeltsin’s underlings intensified, U.S. De- fense Secretary William Pe arrived in Moscow for three days of talks aimed at encouraging a dubious Russian Parliament to go forward with ratification of the 1993 START II nuclear arms control treaty with the United States. It is a mark of Yeltsin’s di- minished physical capacities that a meeting with Yeltsin is not on Perry’s schedule and that the Russian press has not even spec- ulated about a possible Yeltsin- Perry meeting to calm the con- tentious nuclear arms issue. Russian television did report that Yeltsin managed a 20-min- ute meeting Wednesday with Al- exander Lukashenko, the visiting president of neighboring Be- larus. Lukashenko reported later that he had been asked by Yeltsin to temporarily take on “‘a part of his own work” aimed at increas- ing cooperation between Russia and Belarus.

Many suspect Yeltsin, 65, is too ill to serve out the rest of a term that lasts until 2000. Lebed said he would not launch his presidential campaign while Yeltsin is alive. “Today he’s an elderly and ill person,” Lebed said. “It’s not for me to kick the one who is down.” Lebed lost the support of nearly all of Moscow’s power barons when he forced the Russian mili- tary commanders into a hum- bling Chechnya peace settlement sense and will and courage to prevent the start of this bloody carnage.” Lebed was ousted 24 hours after his chief political foe, Inte- rior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, accused him of organizing mili- tary units to take over the Krem- lin by force. Though Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called the accusation unsubstan- tiated, he sealed Lebed’s fate Wednesday by siding with Kulikov and accusing Lebed of “Bonapartism.”’ Lebed’s departure could end temporarily the bitter Kremlin infighting that has gone on since Yeltsin suffered a heart attack last summer. But with Yeltsin sidelined from full-time duty until at least early next year, the government is likely to remain dent. | Their relations have deteri rated since, even though Yeltsin grudgingly accepted Lebed’s Aug} 31 deal to end the Chechen fight- ing on terms that the Chechen Kulikov, a leading proponent 4 continuing the Chechen war, has been the point man for afierce counterattack on Lebed that has the behind-the-scenes support of: three of Moscow's main power- wielders: Chernomyrdin, presi- “ dential chief of staff Anatoly Chu- bais and Moscow Mayor Yuri °” Luzhkov. On Oct. 2, Kulikov launched the assault by charging in parlia- ment that Lebed was guilty of “treason” for having “capitulated” to the Chechen sep- aratists. Two days later, Cherno- myrdin took advantage of | Yeltsin’s illness to exclude Lebed | from a top-level meeting on army reform — one field Yeltsin had weak and beset by internal bick- ering. Lebed, who won 14.7 percent of the vote in the June presidential election, has seen his popularity two months ago. He predicted that his firing would lead to a resumption of the separatist war in the southern republic. Casting himself as a spurned peacemaker, he called on “Russian mothers”’ to prevent further fighting. In his trade- mark bass voice he told report- ers: “The backbone of the war has been broken.

        "ocr_text": "After Lebed, Russia returns to everyday crises of finances By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Anp Marcia KUNSTEL Amencan-Statesman Intemational Staff MOSCOW — Russia forgot its one-day Lebed crisis Friday and returned to the daily dismal real- ities, among them the prospect that the main international air- port may stop functioning because it cannot pay for weather forecasts. The nation’s Main Meteorology and Environment Center an- nounced that it would stop provid- ing weather forecasts to Moscow's Sheremetyevo-2 Airport by Nov. 1 because the airport owes the weather agency 5 billion rubles ($1 million). The meteorological center has received no pay for its weather forecasts since May, a spokesman for the Russian Meteorological Committee said. The forecasters’ announcement may just be a bluff, but it was evi- dence of the underlying financial crisis that continues to haunt the bedridden President Boris Yeltsin even after he ditched his upstart National Security Adviser Alex- ander Lebed on Thursday, Government-inspired fears that Lebed was on the verge of starting a Kremlin coup quickly dissipated Friday. The firing of Lebed won unanimous support from the nor- mally prickly Communist and ul- tranationalist blocs in parliament. Only one small faction, the maver- ick democratic Yabloko bloc, spoke up for Lebed. State television showed in- creased security at roadblocks around Moscow, but this was at least in part an illusion. Motorists could travel from one end of the city to the other without seeing signs of increased police presence. Lebed contributed to the placid atmosphere when he emerged from his apartment on Friday morning and told a TV crew, “Iam thinking about my political direc- tions. Of course, it will be a demo- cratic one.” When asked his intentions, Lebed joked that he was planning to see a play Friday night about Czar Ivan the Terrible “so I can study how to govern.” Although the sense of crisis over the Lebed firing subsided Fri- day, the country got no rest from its persistent financial crisis, Lost in the hubbub over Lebed’s dismissal Thursday was the dis- closure by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Livshits that Russia may have to resort to mas- sive borrowing. October tax col-’ lections are even worse than in? September, when federal tax re-_ ceipts were only 45 percent of planned collections, Livshitz said. “We have never been closer to. the point at which we either gath- er revenues or we have to think about changing course,” Livshits told a the Cabinet on Thursday. “We can't release anything but the - most vital money.” Austin American-Statesman - October 19, 1996 \f"

Viktor Shvets, they simultaneously pushed shiny black buttons. _ The empty SS-19 missile silo on the hill- side gushed dirty smoke. In what may be one ‘of his last acts as a U.S. senator, Nunn had just helped activate the demolition charge that made a Soviet missile launcher extinct. _ “T am thankful that I have stayed long enough in the Senate to watch the weapons of mass destruction being torn apart,” Nunn said after he and Lugar finished peering into the still-smoking silo. “To have played a role in dismantling weapons of mass destruction is one of the great high points in my career in the Senate. Without a doubt I would have to put this on the top of the things I have been able to accomplish.” Ukraine invited Nunn, who is retiring from Congress, and Lugar to preside over the dynamiting of Silo 28 on a misty, gray morn- ing Wednesday because they wrote the laws that authorized up to $1.8 billion in U.S. funds to help Ukrairie and other former Sovi- et republics pay for nuclear disarmament. Because Soviet rockets required four launching officers, U.S. Ambassador Wil- liam Miller and the governor of Ukraine’s ru- ral Khmelnitskiy region were drafted to turn the two remaining keys simultaneously with Nunn and Lugar. Later, as the American party drove toward the missile field’s underground launch control module a few miles away, Nunn glanced out the window of his van and saw a funeral procession in a tiny village. “T thought about that Ukrainian who had just died,” he said, “and I also thought about what would happen in this area of Ukraine if the Soviets had fired their missiles. “There would have been no funerals for those Americans because they would have been all incinerated. And there would have been no funeral for those people here be- cause we would have retaliated and de- stroyed everything around.” The Nunn-Lugar delegation and a bus- load of journalists then became the first Westerners ever to observe the hoisting of a once highly secret launch control capsule from its blast-protected, 133-foot-deep silo. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Vo- lodymyr Mikhtiuk said the Ukrainian mili- tary will try to sell the cylindrical steel cap- sule in which launch officers stood watch, us- ing the proceeds to build housing for displaced officers. The control silo will be demolished. “That one capsule right here would have control of the whole missile field,” said Nunn. “They [Soviet commanders] could have fired every missile in the field, over 60 of them with some 300-400 warheads.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 24, 1996 \f"

        "ocr_text": " olatile bomb mix gets bun oe helps fund iberian storage of plutonium / Joseph Albright \"AFF CORRESPONDENT oscow — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has set up shop in a closed atomic base in Siberia to help build a $300 million bunker for Russia to store 12,500 disman- tled nuclear warheads. Paid for under a U.S. con- gressional program and with matching funds from the Russian budget, the plutonium fortress is designed to protect the world’s largest concentration of bomb in- gredients from theft or capture, ven in an extreme contingency uch as prolonged civil war. The bunker is among the largest and potentially most far- reaching projects to be funded so far under a $1.8 billion program that Sens. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) pushed through Congress five years ago to finance disarmament in the former Soviet Union. : Like the Fulbright scholar- hips that were created by the te Sen. William Fulbright (D- Ark.), the Nunn-Lugar project has become the most tangible legacy of Nunn’s 24-year Senate career. Nonetheless, the retiring sen- ator drew only mild satisfaction when he and Lugar took a four- day tour last week of sites devel- Oped under the program that bears their name, and learned that construction of the long-de- layed plutonium warehouse is due to begin soon. “T think we have made a lot of —— in a technical sense,” unn said, “but when you see that there are people i in the Rus- gian army in charge of nuclear weapons who haven’t been paid in three months, it is hard to tell whether the overall dangers have diminished. A demoralized military in the nuclear weapons sphere is the worst thing you can have.” Building the plutonium bun- ker’s outer walls is scheduled to start this month under a Penta- ‘on contract, which was awarded the San Francisco-based Bech- tel Corp., the senators were told during a Moscow briefing. U.S. engineers oversee Within the last few months, up to 10 Bechtel engineers have joined a small party of overseers from U.S. Army Corps of Engi- neers at the site inside Russia’s top-secret Mayak plutonium works near Chelyabinsk in west- ern Siberia. The bunker, whose under- ground vaults will cover the size of a football field, will be equipped by Bechtel with a sup- posedly fail-proof cooling system designed to prevent an ecologi- cally catastrophic plutonium fire through the 21st century and beyond. ' More than 60 tons of bomb- grade Russian plutonium will be stored. Because of it’s radiologi- cal impurities, the plutonium will continue to generate enough heat to cause a spontaneous con- flagration for many decades, should a major failure occur with the refrigeration unit and its multiple backup cooling systems. Though the bunker will take at least 3 years to build, a brief- ing document said the Pentagon already has delivered 6,000 con- tainers to Mayak for storage of plutonium components from dis- mantled Russian warheads. ' Every month, Mayak re- ceives 840 of the safety vessels, Which look like stainless steel beer kegs. ’ The vessels, manufactured the Scientific Ecology Group of Carlsbad, N.M., are designed to prevent accidental nuclear chain reactions by keeping each stored plutonium component physically isolated from other pieces of plutonium. Paying for the past Over the last four years, the Russian Ministry of Atomic En- ergy periodically has asked the United States to finance the Mayak plutonium bunker, con- tending that it has been forced to slow down the dismantlement of old nuclear warheads because . Russia has no safe place to store plutonium. However, the Pentagon re- fused to fund the construction until the Russian atomic minis- try agreed last spring to allow Bechtel and the Corps of Engi- neers to station supervisors on site to oversee the Russian work crews and audit the books. Russia would like to build a similar bunker — costing at least $300 million — at a site near Tomsk in Siberia, but the Penta- gon has not formally been asked to join in financing the con- struction. Russia eventually plans to dismantle about 24,000 “excess” nuclear bombs and missile war- heads, a Pentagon briefing docu- ment said. Only about half of that recov- ered plutonium could be stored in the Mayak bunker, with the rest intended for the second fa- cility in Tomsk. Russia has about 6,000 more operational nuclear warheads for its active force of land-based intercontinental ballistic missile rockets, bombers and missile- launching submarines. Among the projects now un- der consideration by Nunn-Lu- gar planners in the Pentagon, is a ‘plan to help the Russian military general staff consolidate its ac- tive warheads in about 30 nucle- ar weapons sites, each of which would have improved sensors to protect against terrorism. The briefing documents contained no cost estimates. Aside from plutonium bun- kers, the largest expenditures of the Nunn-Lugar project have been a $396 million project to de- stroy nuclear missile silos in the Ukraine, and a $231 million pro- ject in Russia to assist in chop- ping = decommissioned Soviet Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 27, 1996 \f"

According to Reich, the Na- zis’ mass killings of Jews began after Germany invaded the Sovi- et Union on June 22, 1941. In the weeks after that invasion, more Jews were killed by German mo- bile killing squads than had per- ished in the preceding 21 months of warfare, he said. The Germans killed thou- sands in Ukraine and other parts of the former Soviet Union, but they determined that shooting or burying alive people in open pits was not the best way to eliminate large numbers of people, Reich said. Then the process of gassing people in death camps began. Carl Modig, the Waskington- based museum’s project director for the former Soviet Union, said it still is not known exactly what secrets are contained in the doc- uments. He helped cull the ar- chives of the Federal Security Service, the domestic arm of the former KGB, to select the papers the museum wanted copied. “It really helps show what the Soviet Union knew and when they knew it during the course of the war about the Holocaust,’’ Modig said. ‘‘Some of the mass killings occurred very early on, and therefore the Russians knew about them very early on, but it was kept a secret and passed up the chain of intelligence com- mand to Moscow.”’ The Holocaust Museum dele- gation said the Russian security agency initially was dismayed when confronted with the request to share the information in the old KGB archives. After negotiations brokered by outgoing U.S. Ambas- sador Thomas Pickering, Russian officials finally agreed, without demanding any payment. \f"

The team of Chubais and Yeltsin's 37-year-old daughter is widely viewed as constructing the strategy that has consolidat- ed power and reduced bickering. On Friday, the popular daily Moskovsy Komsomolets said Dyachenko has become “the keeper of the door of the sick president” and is intimately in- volved in making key appoint- ments and policy. A mathematics teacher who came to her father’s aid during the low point of his presidential campaign, she aligned with Chubais and since her father’s re-election has con- tinued to stay in the thick of Kremlin intrigue. Yeltsin’s appointment last week of businessman Boris Ber- ezovsky to be a deputy secretary on the National Security Council did seed new political storm clouds. Attributed to Chubais and Dyachenko, the appointment is criticized as giving a political ally access to information and power that will give him unfair advantage in the financial world. If the appointment survives, it could either confirm the worst fears of the opposition or prove to be a brilliant maneuver. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Few clues emerge | to killer of American in Moscow is slim comfort to other foreign businessmen. By Joseph Albright : aad Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Russian police Monday invoked ‘‘Plan Sirena,”’ a massive drag- net, to find the contract killers who gunned down American businessman Paul Tatum. But they had nothing to show for their efforts except the Kalash- nikov assault rifle that killed him. Tatum, 39, a hotel investor from Okla- homa City said to be deeply in debt, was riddled with 11 bullets Sunday night _ about 200 yards from the luxury Radis- son-Slavyanskay Hotel where he lived. Although foreign businessmen are commonly pressured for bribes and oc- casionally blackmailed by prostitutes, they have been relatively immune from violence. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Peter Charow said Tatum is believed to be the first Ameri- can businessman killed in Moscow in at least three years. : “This incident sends a chill down the spine of anyone trying to do business here,”’ Charow said. The flamboyant, hard-driving Ta- tum headed the American Business Center, a firm that has been involved in a three-year financial struggle for con- trol of the Radisson-Slavyanskaya. The largest and glitziest American- run hotel in Russia, it has served as Presi- dent Clinton’s quarters during presiden- tial visits, but it also is known as a hang- out for members of criminal gangs. Last year, Tatum’s partners, who in- clude the Moscow city government, had him physically evicted from his hotel of- fices. Tatum responded by holding press conferences decrying corruption and warning that he would be mur- dered. He began wearing a bulletproof vest to Chamber of Commerce meetings and reportedly hired a squad of 19 bodyguards. Tatum had devised a succession of high-risk schemes to raise money to fi- nance the hotel, including the recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 5, 1996 sale of so-called “Freedom Bonds,” which promised a return of 100 percent to investors in six months. Tatum was accompanied Sunday night by two bodyguards, who were re- ported to have escaped with “light shock.”” Moscow Deputy Prosecutor Se- velod Matemyanov said, ‘In this situa- tion, they were unable to help him.” The attack occurred just after dark Sunday as Tatum and his bodyguards walked down the stairs of an underpass near the Kievsky train station. As Tatum reached the bottom of the steps, an un- known killer leaned over a railing and fired a burst of at least 11 rounds into Tatum’s torso, witnesses told police. Tatum died within half an hour with- out reaching a hospital. Near the overpass, police found a Kalashnikov, three bullets and five spent cartridges. The assault rifle was wrapped in a plastic bag, evidently to guard against fingerprints. Several hours after the shooting, a 34-year-old Moscow businessman who manages the “‘Rosinvest’”’ joint venture was brought to a hospital with a wound in the knee. The Russian businessman said he was passing through the same Kievsky station underpass when he re- ceived a “splinter.” “Plan Sirena”’ is a dragnet operation devised by Moscow authorities to find clues in highly publicized cases of slain merchants, bankers and others with ce- lebrity status. So far, it has shown little success. There has never been a suc- cessful prosecution in a Moscow Mafia- type killing. Police estimated there were 216 con- tract killings in Moscow last year, with victims mostly Russian businessmen, bankers and gangsters. Other victims of contract hits in the last few years have included Felix Solo- vyov, 62, a Russian freelance photogra- pher killed with a silencer-equipped pistol; Oleg Slabynko, producer of the popular Russian television chat show “Moment of Truth;” and reporter Dmitry Kholodov of the Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, who was killed by a briefcase bomb in 1994 while investigating corruption in the armed forces. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Russia’s health linked to Yeltsin’s Su over: As president's recovery hangs in balance, a troubled nation hopes for stability. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Russian surgeons suc- cessfully sewed up President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday after an unexpected- ly intricate heart bypass operation and then ordered he remain attached overnight to a machine to keep him breathing. If Yeltsin pulls through the critical first 24 hours after his surgery, it means that Russia probably is back on a path toward political stability, which has been absent for three years. However, from limited medical data released by the Kremlin, it re- mained unclear whether Yeltsin, 65, is free of potentially fatal complica- tions such as strokes, liver failure and internal bleeding. Doctors scheduled a meeting this morning at the hospital to assess Yeltsin’s vital signs follow- ing his seven-hour operation. “They told us the operation went normally,” said Yeltsin’s wife Naina, her'voice breaking. “We’re worried of course, very much. We don’t know how it will be later, but we hope ev- erything will be all right.” Nearly five hours after surgery, Yeltsin woke from anesthesia and opened his eyes, presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky re- ported Tuesday night. _, The press secretary did not clarify whether Yeltsin had showed a capaci- ty to respond to doctors’ questions, as healthy bypass patients frequently do when emerging from sedation. All Yastrzhembsky said was that doctors administered drugs to reduce Yelt- sin’s discomfort from the breathing tube that remains down his throat. American consulting cardiologist Dr,-Michael DeBakey, who observed the operation on a monitor outside the opérating room, predicted full re- covery. “On the basis of the results of the ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO / Associated Press American heart expert Dr. Michael DeBakey (right) speaks to Moscow Cardiological Center Director Yevgeny Chazov Tuesday. At left is Dr. Renat Akchurin, who performed the operation on Boris Yeltsin. “| would predict the president to be able to return to his office and perform his duties in perfectly normal fashion,” said DeBakey. operation, I would predict the presi- dent to be able to return to his office and perform his duties in perfectly normal fashion,” said DeBakey, the 88-year-old dean of heart surgeons who performed the world’s first by- pass in 1964. The full powers of the Russian presidency, including the “nuclear button,” remained in the hands of Yeltsin’s loyal prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin's order trans- ferring powers to Chernomyrdin, is- sued just minutes before the surgery, did not evoke any political tur- bulence. One of Chernomyrdin’s first acts was to report the operation’s success- ful conclusion in telephone conversa- tions with President Clinton and the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Chief surgeon Dr. Renat Akchurin said his repairs to Yeltsin’s plaque- choked coronary arteries required “many more” than the anticipated three or four bypass grafts. Akchurin implied that he and his 12-member Russian team installed as many as six new vein sections to route blood around the damaged arteries. “The main thing is that we revas- cularized the miocard [attached new veins to the heart muscle],” Akchurin said. “The formal number of bypasses is not in itself important.” The 50-year-old microsurgeon, who trained in Houston under DeBa- key, said Yeltsin will remain until to- day on an artificial breathing ma- chine, known as a ventilator. “All surgeons in the world are afraid to stop this artificial ventilation prematurely in order to try to prevent negative consequences of the opera- tion,” Akchurin said. “‘But the patient is stable now.” Reached by telephone in Cleve- land, cardiologist Dr. Randall Star- ling of the Cleveland Clinic said that if a patient is kept on a ventilator longer than a day or two, it generally means the patient is encountering something “out of the ordinary.” “Granted, some people who have a bypass operation at 7 a.m. at the Cleveland Clinic are off the ventilator and up talking to you by 7 p.m. — that is not uncommon at all,” said Starling. “But if a patient is on the ventilator 12 to 24 hours, that does not necessarily portend a bad prognosis.” Among ordinary Russians, some were cynical that even successful sur- gery and a rebounded Yeltsin would relieve the burdens of life in this still unsettled nation. Others hoped that a rejuvenated president can pull Russia out of its troubled times. Yelena Potapova, 43, is one of the pessimistic Russians who believes things won’t improve, regardless of the outcome of Yeltsin’s surgery. “People will not get salaries the way they do not get them now. All this is because there is no order in the banking sector,” said the chief ac- countant at the state trading compa- ny. “I wish him good health, but noth- ing will change for the better.” Sergei Tovma, a 37-year-old mili- tary officer, is optimistic enough to express faith that when Yeltsin recov- ers, ‘There will be more stability in Russia, and Russia needs stabilitw” Before entering the operating room, Yeltsin issued a poignant mes- sage to the Russian people, a missive clearly meant as a farewell should the complicated heart surgery not prove successful. “You must know that all that I did, am doing and will do — all this is for the sake of Russia, for the sake of making your lives worthy and well- provided for. It is particularly impor- tant to me to let you know this today,” he said. But the brash and burly president, who spurred the breakup of the Soviet Union and presided over the tumultu- ous Russian conversion from commu- nism to democracy and capitalism, also displayed his old confidence. “TJ do not intend to stay long in the hospital. I believe that I will soon be working as before — putting all my strength in my work,” he said. He also thanked Russians for their cards and telegrams with good wishes.

        "ocr_text": "Yeltsin shows he’s back in charge Finger on the button: One day after heart surgery, Russian takes back nuclear briefcase, meets prime minister. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — President Boris Yeltsin took back control of Rus- sia’s nuclear arsenal, met Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin and a squad of doctors, and agi- tated to be transferred to a dif- ferent hospital Wednesday, all within 24 hours of a coronary quintuple bypass. _ “Boris Yeltsin is already act- ing like the president,” said Chernomyrdin, who was sum- moned to a 15-minute 8 a.m. meeting with Yeltsin at the Car- diological Research Center. Yeltsin immediately took back into his possession the black briefcase containing the computer system for launching nuclear warheads. He signed a decree reclaiming all presiden- tial powers at 6 a.m., having ced- ed authority to Chernomyrdin only 23 hours earlier, just before he went into the operating room. His chief surgeon, Renat Ak- churin, had estimated that Yelt- sin would not reclaim the presi- dential mantle for a minimum of two days. Yeltsin also managed to send President Clinton a message of congratulations on his re-elec- tion to the White House. A Krem- lin spokesman said Yeltsin told Clinton he hoped relations would continue in the spirit of partner- ship and cooperation. Complications still could de- velop for the 65-year-old presi- dent, who underwent a seven- hour surgery in which five clogged arteries were bypassed with vein grafts. But he survived the first critical postoperative day with no signs of trouble and was taken off an artificial respi- rator Wednesday morning. Yeltsin “is rapidly recuperat- ing after the operation, astonish- ing doctors by his power and vig- or,” said presidential press sec- retary Sergei Yastrzhembsky. Yeltsin wants to get out of the heart center, said the press aide. Moving out of the heart institute may present the image of rapid progress to the Russian public, which has divided views on whether Yeltsin will be able to make a full recovery and start addressing the legion of troubles that have persisted over his 14 months of on-and-off illness. Yeltsin’s wife told Russian television that her husband was experiencing some pain but was in much better shape when she visited him Wednesday. “I found him to be completely different from yesterday.

He speaks perfectly free- ly,” Naina Yeltsin said. ‘‘We are happy about his condition. ... Today, one wants to smile.” American cardiological pio- neer Dr. Michael DeBakey, who performed the world’s first coro- nary bypass surgery in 1964 and has consulted on Yeltsin’s case, confirmed that the president was showing no signs of the bleeding, pneumonia or renal dysfunction that can beset heart patients. “T got the impression he was quite alert and really was feeling good. He expressed that both in his smile and his statements and his gratitude,” DeBakey said ina CNN interview. “T would say within a matter of six weeks to two months he can go back to pretty much doing al- most as much as he wants.” DeBakey said the president, an ardent tennis fan, could be back on the courts in as little as three or four months. DeBakey, whom the Russian media has tagged “the patri- arch” of heart surgery, praised the technical skill and perfor- mance of the Russian surgical team headed by Akchurin, one of his former students. Chernomyrdin, who himself underwent bypass surgery sev- eral years ago, said he could hardly believe that Yeltsin was ready to talk with him Wednes- day morning. His main interest was in information about the na- tionwide one-day labor strike and series of protests that coin- cided with his surgery Tuesday, Chernomyrdin said. Demonstrations also are ex- pected today, the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 7, 1996 \f"

        "ocr_text": "13 killed in cemetery explosion The blast, believed to be linked to Russian mobs, occurred during a memorial service. By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — There was blood in the treetops of a Moscow ceme- tery Sunday after unknown assas- sins detonated a remote-control bomb as 100 leading members of the crime-ridden Afghan War In- valids Fund gathered to memorial- ize their leader murdered two years ago. At least 13 people were killed and another 16 were wounded in the most savage outbreak of Mos- cow mob violence on record. NTV Independent Television called it an “unprecedented”’ terrorist act. The explosion was the latest outburst in a three-year struggle for control of billions of rubles in tax-free liquor and cigarette prof- its earned by the invalids’ fund through government exemptions. The blast was triggered during a graveside memorial service for Lt. Col. Mikhail Likhodey, chair- man of the Afghan War Invalid Fund, whose killing two years ago has been blamed on rivalry for control of the fund’s bank ac- counts. Likhodey’s widow, Yelena, who was acting financial director of the fund, was among those killed during the explosion. Likho- dey’s successor as chairman of the While a victim's body lay nearby, Moscow police officers and forensic experts discuss the blast. Afghan fund was killed and Likho- dey’s father was gravely injured. Until Likhodey died in a bomb blast outside his apartment in 1994, he had been struggling for the leadership of the fund with another Afghan veteran, para- trooper Col. Valery Radchikov. A year later, Radchikov was shot six times and nearly killed in what his supporters claimed was a ven- geance attack. Following Sunday’s explosion, survivor Alexander Boiko said he had just downed two glasses of vodka in memory of his friend Likhodey when a blast knocked him unconscious. When he came to, “I was surrounded by dead bodies,” said Boiko, who had face and head wounds. The bomb exploded under a table that had been set next to Likhodey’s grave in Kotlyakovs- koye Cemetery where his friends were drinking vodka toasts in the Russian village tradition of cele- brating death anniversaries. “This was probably linked to a settling of old scores,” said Col. Stanislav Zhorin of the Federal Security Service, who estimated that the bomb had the force of up to 6 pounds of TNT. Body parts were blown some 70 yards. Police later found a wire and a control box apparently used to trigger the blast. The Afghan War Invalid Fund was founded in 1991 to serve 14,000 amputees and other seri- ously wounded veterans of the 10-year Soviet war in Afghanistan. The fund split into rival factions in 1993 when Radchikov, then the leader, was accused by regional branches of squandering money. This latest and bloodiest of dozens of unsolved Moscow mob killings came on the Day of the Militia, a nationwide holiday dedi- cated to Russia’s beleaguered po- lice. “This is a challenge which can- not go unheeded,” said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who directed Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov to bring the as- sassins to justice. Kulikov later appeared on a television news show promising unspecified new measures to “ensure calm to the people of the capital.” Palm Beach Post - November 11, 1996 \f"

        "ocr_text": " ‘U.S. surgeon’s modesty steals hearts in Russia By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — The anchorman of Russia’s premier Saturday night news magazine, known for his deep voice and tough talk, intro- duced a rare foreign guest with an even rarer admission: ‘‘Doing an interview with Dr. DeBakey is like doing an interview with God.” Sergei Dorenko didn’t com- pletely abandon his probing news- hound style in the ensuing inter- view, but it was clear he is among the Russians with a soft spot for Dr. Michael DeBakey, the pio- neering American’ cardiologist who left Sunday after consulting at President Boris Yeltsin’s quintu- ple bypass surgery last week. DeBakey popped onto the scene at a time when Russians increasingly resent American in- fluence in their lives — from the violent grade-D movies that fill television screens to the nich in- vestors many fear are reaping Russia’s prime resources at dis- count rates. And it is a time of rising national pride, with Rus- sians boasting anew that their long-lived culture, brilliant scien- tists and studious kids don’t have much to gain from the West. It is a tricky time to be a foreigner at the president’s bed- side. ‘ DeBakey, expected to return to Houston in time for a press conference today at his Baylor College of Medicine office, found the right combination of skill and modesty to gain acceptance as a true American friend. The 88-year-old surgeon who Palm Beach Post - November 11, 1996 conducted the world’s first heart bypass operation in 1964 may not be an object of universal fawning here. Yeltsin’s cocky press secre- tary Sergei Yastrzhembsky, for example, took pains to explain that DeBakey would not be in the operating room during the cutting and sewing, which was at odds with what DeBakey said he ex- pected to happen. Yastrzhembsky also pointedly took note that the foreigner didn’t enter the heart clinic until several hours after the surgery began, and that the “equipment” DeBakey brought as backup was not used. At least now the Cardiological Research Center has its own heart pump, which keeps blood circulat- ing for a patient whose heart does not return to normal functioning after surgery. DeBakey left the one he brought, which doctors here estimate cost about $50,000. DeBakey in fact stayed outside the operating room and watched on a closed-circuit monitor, which he acknowledged with no com- plaint in the Dorenko television interview. First Lady Naina Yeltsin was pictured on the front page of the daily Sevodnya (Today) on Sunday presenting DeBakey her thanks and a bushy bouquet of flowers. The official Itar-Tass news agency routinely referred to him as ‘“‘the patriarch” of heart surgeons. \f"

Disabled vets’ group under fire after Moscow cemetery bombing By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Mioscow — Russian Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin on Monday condemned the gangland-style bombing that killed 13 mourners at a memorial for the head of an Afghan War disabled veterans’ charity, while stunned survivors denied that widescale corruption in their organization led to the attack. “We insist on knowing where the huge amounts of money ear- marked for invalids has gone. How was this money spent? Who benefited by it?’ said Andrei Chepurnoi, a regional chairman of the disabled veterans’ fund from the southern city of Oren- burg who survived the blast. “This is what leads some quarters to regard us as bandits, very dangerous bandits, because some day this information will become public and people will learn what we are being killed for,’’ Chepurnoi said at an emo- tional news conference held by veterans of Russia’s war in Af- ghanistan. The veterans’ hasty, voluble defense of their operations, com- ing the day after the gruesome Moscow cemetery bombing, left Russians once again trying to un- snarl a thicket of alleged crimi- nals and victims. Investigators said Sunday’s attack was linked to a longstand- ing feud between two rival branches of the 5-year-old fund, a charity set up to help disabled victims of the Afghan conflict. But it was unclear whether it was the result of an internal power struggle or efforts by an outside gang to take control of the fund and its assets. In a statement released by his press office, Yeltsin expressed his condolences to the relatives and friends of those who were killed. *“*I have ordered the legal au- thorities to carry out a thorough investigation of all the details of this bloody crime,’’ said Yeltsin, who underwent quintuple coro- mary bypass surgery six days ago and is recuperating in a Moscow hospital. Members of the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, ob- served a minute of silence to hon- or the dead. The explosion, at a memorial service for Mikhail Likhodey, the former national head of the vet- erans’ fund who was killed in an- other bombing two years ago, was the most outrageous exam- Ple to date of the criminal thug- gery that is roiling post-Soviet Russia. The dead included Likho- dey’s widow and his successor. A mass funeral is scheduled ina Moscow church Thursday. The veterans’ fund is the kind of organization that has been vul- nerable to both internal corrup- tion and external threats from crime groups hoping to skim un- regulated money in Russia since the collapse of centralized Com- munist control. Police special forces squads confiscated the fund’s records Monday and sealed off some of- fices. The independent Interfax news agency quoted Interior Ministry sources as describing the bombing as part of ‘‘a war be- tween Afghan war veterans’’ and an effort to demolish the fund’s current leadership. The organization was the re- cipient of government largess in the form of tax and import ex- emptions, which allowed it to im- port alcohol, food and other con- sumables at costs far below those paid by private commercial com- panies. Commercial revenue shrank, however, after Yeltsin heeded demands for more government revenue and ended exemptions for the Afghan veterans and oth- er ‘‘charitable’’ groups. Then he mandated that the Finance Min- istry expand payments to the vet- erans’ fund from its increased tax revenues. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 12, 1996 \f"

STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Looking more ro- ; bust than he has in five months, President Boris Yeltsin donned a black fur hat Wednesday and took a stroll in chilly Moscow to show Russians he is recovering after heart surgery. . “They took out the stitches this morning,” Yeltsin tuld a waiting Russian TV crew. “Now it is necessary to train myself, by means of greater physical loads, greater emotional loads, in order , to begin, begin, begin to restore my full power.” The videotape showed Yelt- sin, 65, walking a dozen steps un- der his own power, then talking + lucidly while he was standing on his feet, and finally sitting down without having to be*supported. It was Yeltsin’s first public ap- pearance since before he under- went quintuple heart bypass sur- gery 15 days ago. His ruddy complexion and firmer speech suggested Yeltsin has survived his surgery without major complications. He de- clared himself “in fighting mood.” . . “My heart already does not hurt.

The tem- perature was in the low 40s and Yeltsin wore a knee-length win- ter coat and a Scotch plaid scarf. The three-minute interview was the first time Yeltsin has been seen speaking in full sen- tences since Sept. 5, the day he sat on a couch at the Barvikha health resort outside Moscow and told the Russian people he was planning to undergo heart. surgery. A comparison of his appear- ance Wednesday with a tape of his Sept. 5 interview showed that: his speech has become less halt- ing and his words less slurred. He generally looked younger and healthier. “You can’t say I am complete- ly on my feet and am standing strong. But all the same,” Yeltsin said, “the doctors did their work. “Certainly some time is need- ed for rehabilitation, which is un- derstandable, after this kind of a heavy, complicated operation. I will probably be at Barvikha for some time. And then to work.” Yeltsin spoke at length with Alexander Lukashenko, presi- dent of Belarus, on Wednesday _ but was rebuffed in efforts to me- diate the intensifying dispute be- tween Lukashenko and his coun- try’s Parliament. Yeltsin proposed talks involv- ing Russian leaders and Seymon Sharetsky, who is speaker of the Belarus Parliament and Luka- shenko’s main adversary. Russian Prime Minister Vic- tor Chernomyrdin was ready to attend the talks in Smolensk, a Russian city on the Belarus bor- der. However, Lukashenko’s aides said he was “very busy” and couldn’t come. Lukashenko indicated he might meet with Chernomyrdin this week. Financial Times contributed to this ‘article.

By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Khankhala, Russia — The last Russian troops began pulling out of the secessionist Chechen Republic on Sunday, leaving Muslim rebel fighters to control a devastated land and a bitter, defiant population after nearly two years of war. “‘Already it is our victory. But for us it is also a tragedy. There were so many victims,”’’ said Che- chen fighter Ruslan Arsumakov, 30, who was part of a joint Rus- Sian-Chechen patrol guarding a convoy of transport trucks leav- ing the Khankhala Russian mili- tary base outside Grozny, the Chechen capital. Like other Chechens, both fighters and civilians, Arsuma- kKov expressed wariness about Russia’s ultimate intentions toward his mountain enclave of tenacious people intent on inde- pendence. “We don’t have any confi- dence that they won’t come back. We expect to go on fighting,’’ he said. Russian President Boris Yelt- sin’s decision to withdraw the last two Russian combat bri- gades from Chechnya was wel- comed by Chechens not joyfully but as a logical conclusion of the vicious fighting that began with an attack by Russian forces Dec. 11, 1994. Yeltsin’s decision has caused consternation in some parts of the Russian military and among some opposition politicians, who claim it will lead to indepen- dence for Chechnya and encour- age a further splintering of Rus- Sia as other ethnic republics at- tempt to follow suit. “*I think it’s a tragedy to give up the city. It’s Russian land, and we spilled our blood for it,’’ said a Russian officer supervising the departure of the 20Sth Motorized Brigade who identified himself as Major Ivanov, a 25-year army veteran. ‘‘This was built by Rus- Sians, not by the Chechens. This is a dirty political deal to give this up.’’ Russian soldiers who stopped to talk were unanimously re- lieved to be getting out, but none was willing to give his name and risk the ire of officers. “‘We want to go home as fast I’m alive but I’m said one young as possible. very nervous,”’ soldier. Troops atop armored person- nel carriers accompanying the Sunday morning convoy were armed with Kalashnikov rifles and on the alert. Some officers have expressed fear of possible attack as they draw down the re- maining 15,000 Russian troops in Chechnya. Perimeters were heavily guarded at the Khank- hala base and at the Northern Airport outside Grozny, most Russian forces are Marc vee trated. The Russians are scheduled to complete their withdrawal by Jan. 27, the date Chechnya is supposed to elect a president and parliament. A temporary peace Pact signed last week by Che- chen and Russian officials set the elections, but it does not ac- knowledge that the republic has any different status than other ethnic republics of Russia that elect legislatures and adminis- trations. An earlier agreement calls for the final status of Chech- nya to be decided in 2001. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 2, 1996 \f"

It turns out that his life is a sad story with a strangely happy twist. Like much that remains of his native province of Chechnya, Baidarov has emerged neither destroyed nor subjugated after two years of btoody warfare. In a neighborhood that looks like a newsreel of Berlin immediately after World War II, Baidarov lives in a flat with ie water, gas for heating and electric- that works all but four hours a day. He n has hooked up a stereo and videocas- sétte player. _, Baidarov's heating pipes don’t work. He Hasn't much money and he doesn’t have a j8b.

Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 8, Associated Press Signs of life: Residents buy food at a kiosk in front of a damaged apartment. The two-year war left between 18,000 and 80,000 people dead, yet Russia has even less control here than when President Boris Yeltsin authorized the use of force. Baidarov, 37, lives in a brick apartment block on Lenin Street, the boulevard that took the cruelest pounding as Russian tanks, rocket launchers and bombers drove to dislodge Chechen fighters from the pres- idential palace a mile downtown. Baidarov’s wife was pregnant then. So after a month of bombardment, he loaded his wife and possessions into the car and drove into exile in the neighboring prov- ince of Ingushetia. It was the last he expect- — ed to see of his apartment. Two months later, the fighting died down after the Russians captured the presi- dential palace. Baidarov and his wife made their way back across the battle lines and set out to rebuild their life. The 12-story buildings all around them had taken heavy hits from tank shelling, and even in their building a missile had landed in the apartment across the hall. Their apartment was intact, but Rus- sian soldiers had turned it into a latrine be- fore moving on to another neighborhood. “We cleaned it up the best we could,” said Baidarov, a medical assistant. ‘“‘We had to carry water a long distance.” The Baidarovs found some doors and windows and replaced what was broken. They also reclaimed their refrigerator, which they had hidden in a village before they fled. Later, a Chechen municipal re- pair brigade came to their door and helped them finish the repairs. It wasn’t just the resourcefulness of the Chechens that explains how 150,000 people continue to live with some semblance of a tolerable life in a capital that looks totally devastated. As it turned out, the infrastructure that the Russians installed in Grozny over the last four decades has also proved unexpect- edly resilient. With the help of the International Red Cross, the Grozny water system has been switched back on and now provides drink- ing water to most of the city. Because Grozny is an oil-producing and refining center, the Russian authorities laid hundreds of miles of natural gas piping in the capital and throughout dozens of out- lying towns and villages. Many of the gas pipes run on top of the ground and caught fire in the early months of fighting. But because they were accessi- ble, the pipes were also easy to repair. Grozny’s voluminous gas supply has made it possible to restart one of the city’s main electrical plants. It also is the source of the cooking and heating gas that keeps several hundred thousand people in the city and major towns from misery. One thing that doesn’t work is the city’s sewer system. Most of the 275 miles of main sewer lines are plugged with sedi- ments and the main treatment plant is idle because the high-voltage electric lines are down. The main sewage basins are close to overflowing. “Fortunately, the coming of winter re- duces the threat of an epidemic,” said Fery Aalame, the Swiss head of a 300-strong In- ternational Red Cross mission that is the only sizable relief agency helping the Che- chens. By the time warm weather returns, Aalame hopes tohave the sewer plant oper- ating. gh} To \f"
