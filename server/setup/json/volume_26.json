Throughout Monday, state television quoted presidential aides saying that Yeltsin was prepar- ing to address the nation, probably within hours, on the amnesty that was granted last week by the new parliament’s lower house, Then came a prime-time announcement that , Yeltsin would not appear after all, stimulating a new burst of guesswork about why Yeltsin seem- ingly has been immobilized or inaccessible. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 1, 1994 “Even Yeltsin’s closest supporters seemed stunned by his failure to confront the slight in person. “The president should not slack the reins of power,” warned Mikhail Poltoranin, a leader of Yeltsin's Russia’s Choice party. “Otherwise the chariot of Russian statehood will overturn.” Yeltsin on Monday dispatched into retirement Nikolai Golushko, head of the KGB successor agen- cy called the Federal Counterintelligence Service. Kremlin leaks to official news agencies blamed Golushko for choosing to obey an order from the Russian prosecutor general, rather than the Krem- lin, and open the gates of the top-security Lefortovo Prison, which his agency controls, The release followed three months of steel- jawed defiance by Golushko of an order that con- trol of the prison could not be inherited from the KGB. Yeltsin had decreed that Lefortovo would henceforth be run by the Interior Ministry, whose leaders Yeltsin apparently trusted more. Last week, a spokesman for Golushko's FCS sounded openly contemptuous. “The guard is ours,” the spokesman was quoted as telling The Moscow Times, adding that Lefortovo is a “special place, ... we cannot just leave it.” The hindrance posed by the FCS apparatus is a measure of the recent erosion of Yeltsin's political authority. The former KGB agencies were on his side during his struggle to dissolve parliament last fall. \f"

By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT tar City, Russia — Starting with a five-mile jog across a snowy plain, U.S. astronaut Norman Thagard began a yearlong countdown to blastoff toward a Russian space station. The physician and former Marine fight- er pilot from Jacksonville, Fla., began training that will lead to his Russian rocket launch next year and propel him to a three- month journey aboard Russia’s long-term orbiting space station. “Fortunately, three months is not terri- bly long,” said Thagard, SO, when asked how he will deal with the combined psycho- logical stresses of loneliness and weight- lessness. ‘‘Besides, I was a Marine once, and you can do anything for a while.” At the Yuri Gagarin cosmonaut training center, Thagard and backup astronaut Bonnie Dunbar of Sunnyside, Wash., start- ed learning Russian cosmonauts’ tech- niques for combating boredom. “In the first couple of sessions, we... concentrated on techniques for relaxation and relieving stress — breathing tech- niques and that sort of thing,’”’ Thagard said. ‘In our program, we don’t need to do these things, . . . [but] their flights are of longer duration.” They are living inside the high-walled Star City cosmonaut training complex 20 miles northwest of Moscow, an idyllic cam- pus-like cocoon that somehow has enough money to avoid the shabbiness permeating the rest of Russia. Throughout the next year, Thagard and Dunbar will swim, lift weights, study Rus- sian and train with their Russian crew- mates on the routines of living aboard the sprawling Russian Mir space station. Dwarfing the U.S. space shuttle, it is about the size of two railroad cars and has been orbiting Earth since 1986. Upon Thagard’s launch up to Mir in March 1995S, Dunbar will fly back to Hous- ton. There she will train with a U.S. shuttle crew that will fly up, dock with the Russian station and eventually return Thagard to Earth. During the brief Mir-shuttle linkup in June 1995S, Dunbar will use the shuttle’s medical equipment to take measurements verre WP CP athee ny ae 4 indicating any bone loss and balance prob- lems incurred by Thagard and his Russian crewmates. Thagard, a veteran of four U.S. space- flights, was NASA’s logical first pick to be the first American to fly aboard a Russian spacecraft. Since he first flew in space in 1983, Tha- gard’s main expertise has been observing how humans survive the physiological stresses of weightlessness. Aboard the Mir, his job will be to observe — and be ob- served — during the ordeal of prolonged spaceflight. Thagard already has survived one of the most unpleasant rides in the history of U.S. space exploration: the 1985 flight aboard a Challenger when the rat cages flew open and the astronauts had to con- tend with clouds of rodent droppings that floated into their eyes, ears and noses. “We made it work,” Thagard said after that ordeal was over, evidencing an upbeat spirit that he may need on his Mir mission. In 1986, he had the trauma of seeing fel- low astronauts killed in the Challenger ex- plosion. Before that, he recalled, he scarce- ly worried about his physical safety. But on his next flight, in 1989, he recalled wonder- ing on the launch pad, ‘‘What am I doing here?” Aboard the Russian space station, he will wear Russian space gear, eat Russian “space borscht” and converse with his Russian cosmonaut crewmates in Russian. At the suggestion of Russian flight ex- . perts, Thagard will take along U.S. space rations to supplement the Russian cosmo- nauts’ diet. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - “T’ve actually enjoyed the Russian food,” Thagard said. ‘‘I don’t have any problems with it. But as you know, when you’ve been away for a long time, you start to long for some things that are familiar, ene am sure that will be the case here as we! td If his 90-day Mir flight goes as planned, Thagard will land with the record as the. American who has flown longest in space. He would edge out three U.S. astro- nauts who flew 84 days in a U.S. spacecraft, but he wouldn’t come close to the world. record of 366 days in space set in 1988 by Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov, 41, and Musa Masarov, 47. Thagard’s flight is envisioned by. SNASA and the Russian Space Agency as the start of an era of ethereal internationaligm, cul- minating in the construction of an interna- tional space station, and perhaps ultimate- ly in a cooperative mission to Mars. Under a U.S.-Russian agreement, nine other U.S. astronauts will fly long-duration flights aboard Mir in the mid-1990s. If the program stays on track, another U.S. astro- naut would eclipse Thagard’s record with- in a year or two. Thagard started flying in his early 20s as a Marine. From 1969 to 1970, he flew 163 missions as a Phantom pilot from a base in Chu Lai, Vietnam. After leaving the Marines in 1971 as a captain, he entered the University of Texas Southern Medical School and finished medical training in 1977. During his internship the following year, his wife — the former Rex Kirby — Johnson of Atlanta — heard that NASA wanted a mission specialist and submitted his application. Thagard was accepted as an astronaut in 1978. He says one of the toughest aspects of participating in the Russian project is his extended absence from his wife and three sons — first during his five-month stint last year at the U.S. Defense Department’s in- tensive language school in Monterey, Calif., and now during his cosmonaut train- ing in Russia.

For the second time in three days, the Kremlin con- fronted tenacious speculation that Yeltsin’s two-week work, ing vacation at Sochi, a resort on the Black Sea, is a cover for an illmess or a sign of political weakness. Also Monday, acting Pros- ecutor General Aleksei Ilyu- shenko said he has opened an investigation into a report Published by the Common Newspaper that “a group of state figures ... intended to attempt to remove Boris ¥en sin from power.’’ If he finds no basis of fact in the news article, Ilyushenko said, he will consider libel proceedings. The speculation began shortly after Yeltsin left Mos- cow on March 14 for a previ- ously unannounced trip. When he departed, he admit- ted to being a bit weak from two bouts of flu. The opposition lost m0 time.

Zhirinovsky’s party was not among them, but Alexan- der Rutskoi, the deposed vice president who led an anti- Yeltsin insurrection in Octo- ber, did join the group. Yeltsin was hospitalized in 1987 and 1990 for heart prob: lems, but many recent, uncon- firmed reports have suggested that he’suffers from liver dis- ease from heavy drinking. = Among the gossip buzzing on the diplomatic circuit its that Japanese security men smelled alcohol on Yeltsin’s breath while the Russian pres- ident was in Tokyo last Oc- tober.

        "ocr_text": " Chernobyl radiation seeping down toward vital water reservoir: By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Chernobyl, Ukraine Nearly eight years after the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, Ukrainian scientists have found that strontium-90 is leaching into ground water and may reach Ukraine’s most important water reservoir within a few years. The radioactive isotope is carried into the earth by rain and snow that penetrates the con- crete-and-steel sarcophagus built in late 1986 to entomb the exploded Chernobyl Unit 4 nu- clear reactor. Because of gaping cracks in the shell’s roof, about 820,000 gallons have infiltrated the reac- tor building, according to new es- timates by the Ukrainian state committee for nuclear and radia- tion safety. That is almost enough to fill two Olympic-size swimming pools. Once inside, the rainwater mixes with a 4-foot-thick layer of lava-like meltdown residue in the reactor’s basement level. The water becomes intensely radio- active as it dissolves strontium, plutonium and other radioactive materials, known as radionu- clides. Then it soaks into the ground, because the sarcopha- gus has no sealed foundation. Strontium-90, which comes from the fallout of a nuclear ex- plosion, is dangerous because it can be assimilated into biological processes and be deposited in the bones of humans and animals. If ingested by humans, strontium- 90 readily attaches itself to the bones, damaging the bone mar- row and often inducing cancer. At a scientific conference in Chernobyl! last week, Ukrainian Institute of Geology researchers disclosed that they measured un- expectedly high levels of stron- tium-90 last year in test wells on the periphery of the reactor site. Within one to nine years, “substantial” concentrations of strontium will begin infiltrating into the Pripyat River, located only one mile away, predicted team leader Professor Vadim Goudzenko. About 40 miles downstream, the Pripyat empties into the Kiev Reservoir, a critical national re- source supplying fresh water for the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. Goudzenko said Kiev water protection engineers “will need to be ready to meet this threat” in as little as two years. He described strontium-90 as the major short-term worry, since dissolved strontium has been found to migrate through the ground faster than other Chernobyl radionuclides. Goudzenko said the rainwa- ter is also leaching significant quantities of plutonium into the ground beneath the plant. But because plutonium’s rate of mi- gration is slower, he estimated that it will take 30 to 50 years for it to seep into the Kiev Reservoir. Other researchers sketched out a different worry. Nuclear physicists from Moscow’s Kur- chatov Institute said there is some chance that more leaking rainwater could initiate a sponta- neous nuclear chain reaction in- side the sarcophagus, involving unburned uranium fuel and plu- tonium byproducts. Panelists said that, despite remote radiation sensors im- planted inside the sarcophagus, nobody knows precisely where the roughly 135 tons of entombed uranium fuel and 900 pounds of plutonium-239 is resting inside the building. They estimated that such an event would have the force of 300 tons of TNT, far smaller than a nuclear blast. Most conference speakers supported Ukraine’s proposed $2.4 billion project to reseal the destroyed reactor inside a mas- sive new building called “Shelter 2” designed to last centuries.

Belarussian nuclear experts Valery Beskaravainy and Nata- lya Gorbacheva agreed. They es- timated that such a spontaneous chain reaction would likely cause a “blowout,” spreading radioac- tive dust from the sarcophagus more than 60 miles downwind.

        "ocr_text": "Life goes on, despite danger from radiation By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT hernobyl, Ukraine — é Birds soar through cracks in the roof of the entombed reactor and roost in the seduc- tive heat that still issues from the meltdown residue. Outside in the pine forests, radioactive wild pigs root for ra- dioactive berries in soil laced with strontium-90. And in condemned villages 15 miles away, elderly Ukrainian farmers produce their own milk and potatoes. Occasionally they add to their diet by hunting the radioactive pigs. Eight years after the world’s only full-scale nuclear reactor meltdown, life around Chernobyl is regenerating itself — for bet- ter or for worse. Out of stubbornness or the | need to support their families, about 800 Ukrainians live in and another 6,000 commute to work in one of the worst radiation zones on Earth. And the Ukraini- an government is too broke to worry much about them. ‘“‘We have gotten used to liv- ing here with radiation,” says Olga Sapura, who runs a small farm 15 miles from the meltdown site. “It would be too hard for me to live in a new place.” Safety test gone wrong At 1:22 a.m. April 26, 1986, a Soviet reactor crew carelessly turned off the safety systems of the Unit 4 reactor at Chernobyl to perform an unauthorized safe- ty test. Within 36 seconds, the reac- tor surged out of control and a steam explosion pierced the roof. Deprived of coolant, 150 tons of uranium fuel melted into lava that oozed into the basement. A second, hydrogen explo- sion ignited blocks of graphite, CHERNOBYL Villages around reactor come bac rocketing a hot plume of r radioac- tive particles a mile into the sky. For three weeks, the fire spread out of control, sprinkling iodine- 131 and other nuclides as far as Scandinavia, Italy and Britain. Within an 18-mile radius of the reactor, Geiger counters found extraordinarily high-level ‘“‘gamma fields’? where the fire’s Iya plume had brushed the ground. Authorities evacuated 170,000 people, put up barbed wire and declared the area a permanent “exclusion zone.” For months, rotating crews of “liquidators”? — mostly Soviet army draftees bulldozed atomic detritus into 700 unlined and often unmarked nuclear waste pits throughout the zone. Then the liquidators buried the bulldozers. After a few years, the “‘gam- ma fields” became less intensely Dlga Sapura, who has a radioactive cow, lives as an “illegal” radioactive through natural ra- dioactive decay. Farm families return to land Then, more than a year ago, Ukrainian authorities made an unannounced decision. They would stop discouraging elderly farm families who were deter- mined to live in their condemned villages. Sapura is among an estimated 800 ‘illegals’? who have moved back because they felt cramped in their shoddy evacuation apart- ments elsewhere in Ukraine. “The climate did not svit me,”’ the S6-year-old farmer says. “I would have died if I stayed there. That’s why I decid- ed to return. If I were healthier, I would have lived there.”’ Now a government truck brings groceries to her village twice a week. She lights her cot- tage with government-supplied electricity. The only restriction is that no children or young wom- en are allowed back. Her neighbor, Lesya Ilyi- chenko, 69, says, ‘“‘When we came back, the militiamen and the am- bulance came to persuade us to leave. Then they threatened to kill us. It lasted for three years, and then they just gave up and let us stay. “When we were evacuated eight years ago,” she continued, “we had to turn in all our live- stock: our cattle, our cow, our pigs and sheep. After we came back, they gave us back our cow and let us have a pasture and a barn.”’ Every summer, a technician drives up to her cottage and takes samples of the radioactiv- ity in her barnyard. The last test showed that her potatoes con- tained 500 times the normal “background”’ level while her eggs showed SO times normal. “They told us that these tests showed everything is all right,” Ilyichenko said. ‘‘And we are not afraid of anything. We were born _and raised here.”’ Like 150,000 chest X-rays Artur Korneev is one of 6,000 people who work in the zone, most of them on shifts of two weeks on, two weeks off. Like many workers, Korneev got started as a “liquidator” eight summers ago.

        "ocr_text": "Much crime in Russia’s 2nd city By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel © 1994 Cox News Service MOSCOW - The U.S. consulate in St, Pe- tersburg has issued a hair-raising warning about crime in Russia’s second city only months before Ted Turner's Goodwill Games will bring in 5,000 athletes and international guests. In a 12-page situation report, the consul- ate said it “discourages” solo traveling on grounds that “‘in the last year the crime and safety situation in St. Petersburg has deterio- rated significantly.” It also warned Americans against arriving on a “shoestring” budget, saying, ‘Chances are your visit here could develop into your worst nightmare.” “Criminal acts, often taking place in day- light hours or inhabited apartments, are marked with greater audacity,” the report says. “The criminals are better armed than ever, often highly informed about the victims they select, and more arrogant than ever against the badly outnumbered and belea- guered forces,” It said employees of the American con- sulate have themselves been victimized in ‘15 significant incidents in the last six months.” In one case last summer, an American then working as a consular employee “was badly beaten by four policemen.” In another case a consulate employee ‘was mugged and bitten by a group of street urchins in a highly populated area, where no one came to his aid during the attack.” It says St. Petersburg traffic policemen “are notorious for using their powers to stop motorists to extract fines for real or imagined violations.” The consulate has verified that police- men sometimes use “threats of blood alcohol tests with dirty needles to extract bribes from innocent motorists,”’ the report adds. Travelers on St. Petersburg-to-Moscow trains are advised to wire shut their cabin doors to keep out robbers who “carefully choose their victims by looking for people who are preoccupied or oblivious to their sur- roundings.\" The consulate says it learned from Rus- sian authorities that ‘in a particularly sinister twist, a powerful odorless gas, derived from ether, has been used by criminals to drug pas- sengers to prevent their waking up during a robbery.” The document also cautions American businesses in St. Petersburg to “be prepared to deal with extortion by the criminal ele- ment,’ as well as sophisticated eavesdropping devices employed by their business competi- tors. “American businessmen _ increasingly have been victims of beating, kidnapping and extortion, sometimes by the hands of their Russian partners,” the report says. Connie Israel, vice president of interna- tional operations for 1994 Goodwill Games, acknowledged crime is troubling in St. Peters- burg. But she said the consulate staff may be “overreacting” because they are ‘a highly visible, high-risk group” that has felt a dis- proportionate share of problems since they are easily targeted. “We will be bringing in extra police and military support to protect our venues and our athletes,” she said. She described such precautions as “not unusual’’ at international sporting events, at least since the attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. “We will advise our people to take pre- cautions like you would in New York or Paris or any big city,” she said, explaining that the Turner Broadcasting security staff is prepar- ing security plans for arriving athletes and other guests. Defending St. Petersburg, Alexander Yevstratin, a top aide in the mayor's office, said crime is no worse in St. Petersburg than in most of Russia. Yevstratin charged that two of the inci- dents involving U.S. officials last year per- tained to consular employees who were ‘‘de- tained for drunkenness” and had to be sub- dued by force “when they tried to resist.” Yevstratin added, “Probably to avoid be- ing sent back to the States, he (one of the consular employees) spread this hoax about a high crime rate in the city.” The U.S. consulate spokesman, David Ev- ans, declined to discuss whether any consular employees had been drinking when crimes oc- curred. He added, “The consulate is per- plexed by being attacked for a report that is simply intended to give necessary information to people planning to come here.” Arizona Daily Star - May 1, 1994 \f"

Communist holiday loses out to Easter picnics in Moscow By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Miooscow — About 10,000 Communists duti- fully marched Sunday to celebrate May Day, but they were vastly outnumbered by Muscovites who traveled to the country to picnic and plant vegetables. The traditional workers’ celebration pro- duced no clashes with police, in contrast to last May Day’s street skirmish that left one police- man crushed to death and scores injured. The day’s fieriest rhetoric came from visit- ing American radical Bill Dores, a leader of the tiny, New York-based Worker’s World Party. Dores told a Communist rally at the former Ok- tybrskaya Square, ‘“‘We stand with you in your struggle to restore the Soviet Union and stop the colonization of your country by U.S. imperial- ism, the No. 1 enemy of your people.’’ The speeches from Moscow’s home-grown hard-liners seemed drained of their normal vim and vinegar. Leaders sounded no trumpet calls to con- front Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s govern- ment any time soon: Russian hard-liner Victor Anpilov, freed from prison in a parliamentary amnesty three months ago, spearheaded the largest march by shouting, ““Down with this government that bankrupted our country!” In a departure from past May Days, Anpilov and his 6,000 marchers found themselves show- ered with thousands of leaflets signed by “‘Anti- communist Action”’ that accused Communists of ““deceiving the people again.”’ Men on the rooftop of a prestigious Leninsky Prospekt apartment building could be seen dumping boxloads of the leafiets, which scat- tered like confetti.

Around midday, thousands of Orthodox fam- ilies took picnic lunches to suburban cemeteries to commemorate Easter near the graves of rel- atives. For many, the day’s biggest draw was the chance to escape from the city on a brilliant spring day to begin the traditional “‘dacha sea- son.”* It is the annual time to plant carrots and cucumbers.

        "ocr_text": "Russia’s new field of gems stirs lust, political discord By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MIRNY, Russia — Diamond sorters in white smocks look unimpressed by the day’s arrivals — hundreds of brilliant pebbles in a wash bowl that formed a shimmering bed for one jumbo, 37-carat rock. “It's nothing exceptional,” said Konstantine Kor- batov, vice director of the sorting center for Dia- monds of Russia-Sakha, shrugging off the big gem that would trigger a saliva flow in any average, acquisitive human. He eyed the ice cube-sized diamond and swiftly pointed to a small discoloration at one tip. Rather low quality, he said of the translucent stone. It was a typical day’s work in this Siberian town of 40,000, graced by pot-holed, ice-slicked streets even in late April, two restaurants, one cinema, a museum that’s usually closed, and Russia’s first diamond mine. Diamond work is humdrum for thousands of miners, sorters, drivers and geologists in the Siberian wilderness. But the dazzling harvest they lift from the permafrost is fueling political discord and criminal lust elsewhere. It is almost as though native shamans who commune with ancient spirits were right generations ago to warn their people away from this swath of frozen taiga as a place of menace. Today’s attention is scarcely noted in Mirny, which exists only because Soviet geologists discov- ered the Mir, or Peace, diamond pipe in 1955. The open-pit mine, shaped like a funnel, yawns to a circumference of nearly 2% miles and sits hard up against the edge of Mirny. Six time zones and 3,000 miles east of Moscow, the town is the nerve center of Russia’s diamond industry, fed by mines dotting the western third of the vast Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), This month, officials announced the discovery of a new deposit that may be the richest of the 800 diamond pipes uncovered in Russia. Photo by Joseph Albright A new diamond pipe may be the richest of 800 uncovered in Russia. Mir mine (pictured) was first., “The discovery ... is an opportunity for us to remain a hard-currency republic and guarantees development and confidence in our own future,” said Mikhail Nikolayev, president of the Sakha republic. Sakha is a treasure house larger than England, France, Austria, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland and Greece combined. It holds 99 percent of Russia’s diamonds. But until the rigid Soviet state collapsed, the republic had no direct income from them and no say in the industry. Nikolayev declared his republic sovereign — something short of independent from Russia — and adopted a constitution. He began to grapple for control of the diamonds; the fight now stands in a partial truce. Diamonds of Russia-Sakha, once a simple appen- dage of the Soviet structure, now is a stock company controlled by Sakha and the Russian government. The Company, as it is known, manages the mining industry and the legal export of all rough stones. Each year it recovers 12 million to 16.5 million carats of diamonds — the company will not acknowl- edge totals. Its stellar finds include the 232-carat “Star of Yakutia” diamond in 1973 and the 242-carat “Liberated Russia” in 1991. Here in the quiet isolation of diamond settle- ments the Company runs schools and clinics, builds hundreds of apartments every year and finances trips to “the mainland” — to Moscow or the warm Crimean coast — to spell workers once every two years from the solitude and 40-below temperatures. But the Company is increasingly caught in politi- cal cross-fire between the ruling regimes of Sakha and Russia. More than a year ago, the republic stopped sending taxes to Russia, So Moscow made it tough to get central bank credits, then retaliated more direct- ly. For almost three months this year, it refused to grant the diamond company a new license, effectively blocking it from exporting diamonds. And the entrance of such “rogue” diamonds to the world market has alarmed De Beers Central Selling Organization, the international cartel that controls the market, maintaining prices by keeping supplies limited. The Company and republic also must worry about crime that is booming throughout Russia. An amorphous “Yakutia Mafia” is widely believed to smuggle diamonds from the Siberian outposts where they are mined. One Company security official acknowledged “accidents” do happen en route. to processing plants. : Palm Beach Post - May 8, 1994 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Gap widening in Russian health care Money matters: Those with the rubles can buy better care; those without face worsening state medical services. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — On the fourth floor of Ma- NM ternity Hospital 23, cracks are forming in a last bastion of Russian communism: socialized medicine. . On one side of swinging double doors, new mothers pay for the luxury of semi- private rooms where they can pet and ogle their newborns at will, tended throughout by doctors of their choice. They have tele- visions, telephones and family visits. “It’s a lot of money, but it’s worth it be- cause I want to have a healthy baby,” said Natalia Polytova, 25, a businessman’s wife, smiling softly at the newborn daughter at her breast. On the other side of the doors, women sleeping eight beds to a room are waiting for a doctor they have never met to deliver their offspring. , They’ll see their babies only on the hos- pital’s rigid feeding schedule. And until the day they leave, their only contact with hus- bands and family will be shouts out the window to visitors on the pavement below. » The state-run sector is often chaotic and, the staff freely admits, not so clean. © Butit is free, if you ignore the bribes hospi- tal staff and doctors often accept from pa- tients seeking special care. At a small but growing number of state- run hospitals and clinics in major Russian cities, commercial associations have leased space equipment to sell what they advertise ds better, safer, cleaner care, often using medicine and equipment from abroad. At a time when Americans are grap- pling with how to make private health care universal, the Russian nouveaux riches are doing their best to achieve the opposite — creating a two-tiered system based on abil- ity to pay. A fledgling private health insurance system is battling to take root. And in smaller towns such as Vladimir, about 150 miles east of Moscow, public facilities offer extra services after hours for a fee. A sportsman with cash or company insur- ance might get microsurgery to repair a knee injury, for example, rather than the more debilitating, painful regular surgery available to non-paying patients. Healthy Generation Ltd. runs commer- cial sections at two Moscow maternity hos- | pitals and rents space in a clinic where it offers related obstetrical-gynecological services. It also sells modern dental ser- vices, as well as supplies private nurses for sick people at home. So why do people pay for health care when it’s available for free? Mark Arkadyevich Kourtser, a physi- cian and president of Healthy Generation, showed some reasons while guiding a visi- tor through the polyclinic where his firm rents space. ‘‘Look at this. You know what this is?” he asked while hauling out a plastic gyne- cological speculum, still in its cellophane wrapper, and packaged disposable needles. ‘‘We use these once, only once,” he said. “T’ll guarantee you 100 percent nobody ever gets AIDS, syphilis or gonorrhea here.”’ Across the reception area, Kourtser barged into a state-run examination room, a dingy, institutional green with spartan furniture, in bold contrast to his comfort- able, clean, white-walled offices. Nodding to the startled state doctor and her patient, he strode to a table and yanked the towel off a tray of stainless steel equip- ment, including an old-fashioned specu- lum. Used medical tools sat in an aging ce- ramic sink. MARCIA KUNSTEL / Staff New mothers Natalia Polytova (left) and Anna Savelyeva cuddle their babies recently in a semi-private, paid room in Moscow’s Maternity Hospital 23. Russians are so afraid of deteriorating medical services that many now refuse even to have their children vaccinated, much less get treatment at state institu- tions. So Russia is suffering higher death rates, a diphtheria epidemic, a rise in mea- sles and fatal incidents of cholera and rabies. At the same time, a new class of monied Russians is demanding, and can pay for, better care. A woman spending 920,000 rubles ($530) for a basic Healthy Generation ma- ternity contract gets full service: pre-deliv- ery exams with the doctor of her choice who will deliver the baby and tend to the mother afterward, all hospital charges and all medicine. The price is more than six months’ pay for the average Russian earn- ing the ruble equivalent of $81 a month. Maria Lukashina, chief obstetrician at Hospital 23, said women and babies in the private section get more care and better conditions. One nurse specialist looks after three to five babies, for example, whereas a single nurse in the public section cares for 15. Noting a “moral” obligation to provide health care, obstetrician Dr. Lukashina said she does not believe the government will allow full privatization of medical care or even begin charging for state services in order to improve them. Health care is, after all, guaranteed in the new Russian Constitution. It just doesn’t say how good it should be. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 9, 1994 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Red Army looking to nukes again JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL COX NEWS SERVICE MOSCOW - For one bittersweet day, the Russian military was back in glory’s glare yesterday as be- medalled veterans cheered a mock World War II dog- fight to celebrate the crushing of Hitler’s Third Reich. Fifty-thousand Muscovites collected to extol their heroes on Victory Day. But today, Russian Defence Minister Gen. Pavel Grachev wakes up to the grinding reality of trying to hold together a sullen, ill-trained military in a time of imperial contraction. The agony of the former Red Army is cold comfort for the West: to compensate for internal ailments, the Russian brass is retailoring its war strategy to rely more on nuclear weaponry. The Russian military numbers 2.3 million - but only on paper. Massive draft evasion has shrunk the actual strength to about 1.5 million. What's left of the military is top-heavy with an estimated 2,000 generals, plus an underlayer of majors and captains who must do the work of corporals, Resentment seethes throughout the officer corps at the 70 per cent of eligible 18-year-olds who find legal or illegal means of avoiding the draft. “Young people no longer consider it their sacred duty to serve, and of course it is weakening our army,” said retired Maj. Gen. Georgi Marusov, 71, a war vet- eran celebrating the 49th anniversary of the German defeat. “It is opposite to what it was when we were young.” Except in elite mobile units like the paratroopers, morale among officers is also glum. In large part this flows from budget slashes imposed or threatened by the Finance Ministry. Throughout the army, 70 per cent of officers and warrant officers didn’t get their pay in March because of Finance Ministry cutbacks, the Interfax news agency reports, In the navy’s Northern Fleet, supplies of fur-lined coats for submarine crews are reportedly 99 per cent short of requirements, And in the air force, operational MiG interceptor flights are often cancelled for lack of jet fuel. Even Grachev openly complained, “The Finance Ministry has planned an allocation for military expen- ditures more or less equivalent to 46-47 per cent of what we are asking for.” Grachev said 120,000 of his officers, including many withdrawn from eastern Eu- rope, have no housing. Adding it all up: the Russian military is going through its most painful contraction since the Red Army shed 1,2 million soldiers back in 1959, Back then under Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the Red Army switched its World War II-style convention- al strategy to assign a central role to nuclear weapons. And now, in another period of budget slashing, Moscow is once again viewing its nuclear stockpiles as the best available avenue to project military power. Montreal Gazette - May 10, 1994 \f"

It seems to me he is a little bit late in returning, He should have come back two years ago,” In recent interviews, Solzhenitsyn has : denied having political ambitions, but he has spoken of his concern over economic hardships, widespread criminal abuses and the advent of what he considers im: moral Western values, “Some new ideas are needed now — new ones which reflect realities of the pres sent day,” Burlatsky said, Does Solzhenitsyn have these ideas? “No, he does not,” Burlatsky said, “Maybe he will find them,” May 23, 1994 \f"

Editor’s note: Though the Soviet Union is long gone, Ekibastuz, in the former Sovi- et republic of Kazakhstan, is still treated as a “closed city.” But last week, in anticipa- tion of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s return to Russia, provincial authorities let two Jour- nal-Constitution reporters visit the city where Solzhenitsyn was imprisoned from 1950 to 1953. It is possibly the first visit by foreign journalists to the site. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS kibastuz, Kazakhstan — An ironic - prophecy is posted outside the old brick power station that Alexander Solzhenitsyn and fellow Soviet convicts froze their fingers | building. “Future epochs will ask us what we did,” reads the weather-beat- en lettering, added by some later Communist sloganeer. Along with the wind- honed brickwork in the Alexander background, the sign Solzhenitsyn serves as an epitaph for the Soviet slave labor camp where several thousand perished from the merciless cli- mate and savage guards. The infamy of Ekibastuz inspired Sol- zhenitsyn to pour out some of the most over- whelming Russian prose since Dostoevski. But in the name of progress, Ekibastuz — a coal-pit city of 150,000 — is steadily rub- bing out the last signs of the 5,000 mainly Ukrainian and Russian political prisoners who labored at the camp four decades-ago. The traces that remain are not marked by any memorial. At the edge of the city lies a deteriorat- ing cemetery, partly buried by an expand- ing open coal pit a few hundred yards away. The unfenced graveyard holds the re- mains of between 1,700 and 2,000 former ~ political prisoners from the 1950s, accord- ing to Pavel Onoprienko, the former editor of the local Communist Party newspaper, Lenin’s Commands, and the leading local expert on the camp. Nearby lie the mud-brick burial mounds of uncounted Muslim Kazakh farmers who perished in a 1930s famine engineered by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin during the collectivization of agriculture. Scores of crude graves have collapsed, leaving a field pockmarked with holes and an occasional abandoned tire. Within the past few months, someone has plowed a trench through the cemetery to improve drainage from the coal mine.

At the height of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost campaign in 1989, the Ekibastuz city soviet approved a fund to protect the cemetery and to erect a me- morial to Stalin’s victims. The project wasn’t popular with older residents, some of whom had worked as camp overseers and considered Solzheni- tsyn a traitor. Inflation eroded the cemetery fund before any memorial was erected. “A number of times I said I want to show future generations the relics of the Stalinist times, but everyone thinks it would be better to get rid of such things,” Onoprienko said. Solzhenitsyn spent eight years as a politi- cal prisoner in the Soviet labor camp system after his arrest in 1945 for criticizing Stalin. He was in Ekibastuz from 1950 to 1953. Ekibastuz is where Solzhenitsyn was forced to lay stones for his own prison — only to be tormented by a perverse exhila- ration when he saw his handiwork. “Such is the nature of man that for some unknown reason he will throw himself body and soul into work that is abominable and hateful to him,” Solzhenitsyn laments in “The Gulag Archipelago.” Political prisoners worked the site until 1955, then turned it over to paid miners. Ekibastuz’s mines today provide Kazakh- stan with two-thirds of its electrical energy and half its coal — and a big share of its air pollution. In the center of Ekibastuz, scant physi- cal evidence remains of the old prison “zone” that was the seed of the modern city. Gone are Solzhenitsyn’s ‘dark watch- towers and sharp-tipped poles for barbed wire’”’ and the “solid board fence four me- ters high” that he said were meant to dis- courage escapes. Gone is the stone Disciplinary Barracks and the solitary confinement “box rooms” that Solzhenitsyn ruefully helped build. Converted in the 1970s into a milk plant, the jail house was later torn down and made into an apartment block and playground. All but two of the more than 20 old wooden prisoners’ barracks have been de- molished to make room for coal miners’ apartment blocks. The last two decaying barracks are likely to:be condemned soon. “Psychologically, it is not good to keep them,” said Arkady Bauer, the city’s depu- ty administrator. “The people in the apart- ment buildings say the barracks are not fit for human beings, only for cattle. And be- sides, the barracks have become shelters for beggars and robbers.” If Solzhenitsyn has any hankering to see Ekibastuz once more, he will find himself unwelcome — at least for now. It’s not because of anything he wrote about the Ekibastuz camp. Rather, his May 1994 interview with Forbes magazine stirred official antagonism by calling Ka- zakhstan’s president a “dictator” and sug- gesting that the Russian-populated north- ern strip of Kazakhstan should be reunited . with Russia. “After all he has just said, I think it is not a good idea for him to come back,” said Ra- mazan Zhumataev, the municipal executive. “The person who brings conflict to people, who divides people, we don’t need him.” ulag Alexander Solzhenitsyn based his landmark novel “One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich” on his experiences as a prisoner in Ekibastuz, Kazakhstan, from 1950 to 1953. The following ex- cerpts demonstrate his power as a writer and the brutality of his experience: “You had to eat with all your mind on the food — like now, nibbling the bread bit by Di nee eee eS a paste your tongue and step out to freedom, just wall \f"

        "ocr_text": "Risky rail route could open up Russian Arctic But environmental cost may be high By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Yakutsk, Russia — As the ice broke this month in the Lena River, provincial leaders in Sibe- ria’s Klondike were getting ready to lay a railroad across 260 miles of permafrost. Back in Moscow, 3,000 miles away, environmentalists worry that the railroad may melt a mas- sive swamp through the virgin northland. “It’s selling our envi- ronment for today’s comfort,” said Greenpeace Director Dima Litvinov. But in Russia’s Sakha repub- lic, it takes an ornery hide to sur- vive 70-below winters, 104-de- gree summers and swarms of mosquitoes from spring to fall. The locals say they don’t want comfort — just a route for pack- ing in groceries during the nine months a year when the 3-mile- wide Lena is frozen. And to haul out treasure from the mines, “Tt won't be a catastrophe for the environment, it is not even that serious, and the benefits are enormous,” said Mark Mikhailo- vich Shats. An ice geographer at the Permafrost Institute in Ya- SALTO Lam TKIP: STAFF kutsk, he is filming the terrain from a helicopter to pick the least risky railroad route. “We simply need to observe certain rules, and nothing terri- ble will happen,” Shats said. The projected Yakutsk-Amur Railroad is part of a venturesome attempt by the Sakha republic to emerge as a quasi-independent island of Arctic prosperity in the heart of old Russia. Visionaries even advance the notion of push- ing on to Russia’s east coast, tun- neling under the Bering Sea and linking up with Alaska. “Over the next 10 or 20 years, I foresee a widening of the inde- pendence of the republic,” Niko- layev said in an interview. From his republic flush with millions from diamonds, gold, tin and natural gas the republic’s president, Mikhail Nikolayev, has set up a trade office in Tokyo and created a “national” oil com- pany to hunt for 21st century pe- tro-billions. Sakha is an immense swatch of timberland and frozen desert five times the size of Alaska. Its 1,2 million inhabitants are an ethnic goulash including Mon- gol-descended Yakuts, native Evenks and Yukagirs, Russians, Ukrainians and Armenians. Ninety-eight percent of Sakha is underlain by a year-round fro- zen stratum of rocks and subsoil up to 1,000 feet thick. Although the upper edges of this perma- frost thaw in summer, the land stays boggy because the mois- ture can’t drain. The Permafrost Institute is a former Soviet research center that has studied Arctic construc- tion techniques for 32 years, us- ing its own underground perma- frost chamber. The institute's Shats insists that Western ecolo- gists often oversimplify perma- frost’s hazards. To thrust northward to Ya- kutsk from a Trans-Siberian rail- way spur at Aldan, the railroad builders will have to deal with frozen terrain that for the most part is rocky or forested, Shats said that is far easier than trying to cross inhospitable mossy tundras like those of northern Alaska or Sakha’s northernmost fringe. The trickiest stage, he said, probably will come first: trying to build a highway paralleling the railroad. ‘The highway would carry construction trucks to haul mountains of gravel for building the railroad. “Our northern landscape is distinguished by the fact that if you destroy the permafrost a lit- tle bit, the process of destruction will perpetuate itself,” Shats said “And later on, when it comes time to construct the railroad, it will be impossible because the route has turned into a complete swamp, a moon landscape where you can’t even drive a Land Rover.” Assuming the highway suc- ceeds, the next step will be creat- ing a massive berm of rocks and gravel 260 miles long to support the rails. : To cross spongier sections of the route, builders will need to pile this embankment 30 feet high and perhaps 250 feet wide — the size of a 25-story skyscrap- er flipped on its side. In rockier terrain, the embankment could be smaller, resembling a conven- tional railroad roadbed. Sakha’s railroad minister, Dmitri Trofimov, said he expects the rail line to reach Yakutsk in the year 2002 at a cost of about $1 billion. He'said Sakha plans to use diamonds mined in the re- public as collateral for bank loans to finance the rail-building. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 30, 1994 \f"

        "ocr_text": "CONFLICE IN RUSSIA | IS YELTSIN OUT? By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright oscow — In his candid auto- biography, Russian President Boris Yeltsin reflects on the strain of dragging his behe- moth country into a new future: “Although it’s very hard to create anything in Russia, it’s even harder to destroy it.” Three years after becoming Russia’s first freely elected president on June 12, 1991, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin still con- fronts not only structures left by 70 years of Soviet communism, but also the mind- set keeping large numbers of his 150 mil- lion countrymen captive to the politics, economics and habits of the past. “Our people used to think that someone, whether God or the czar, must come and Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright are staff correspondents for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

You litter in the hallway in your building. You break trees. You’re a normal citizen. And you think someone from above will come and bring order. “And of course people are disappointed. The [president’s] rating is falling. Everything is going wrong. And the presi- dent is disappointed. He is disappointed with his comrades, disappointed with the people he has been trying to do some- thing for. Because we started such a diffi- cult thing, and many turned out inca- pable” of it. Now, with two more years until his term expires, Yeltsin may have run out of mir- acles. His fundamental problem may be that he has stopped trying to destroy the vestiges of old Soviet Russia. Yeltsin still defines his goal as creating “irreversible reform” by the time his term expires in mid-1996. But some Russians who once numbered among his strongest supporters are won- dering whether Yeltsin, having smashed many old barriers to change, now 1s com- promising with lingering forces of the past to the point of jeopardizing his own objectives. “A new danger has sprung up, and I’m very afraid of it,” said Pamfilova, who resigned in January in the face of slack- ening reform. “When compromises reach the point that they turn into non-princi- pled positions or they lead to stagnation in policy, they are very harmful.” Whether Yeltsin is able to plant “irre- versible reform” in Russia over the com- ing 24 months ultimately will define his role in history. His success or failure also is critical to the world at large. One building block of the old Soviet state still absolutely intact is the stockpile of 25,000 nuclear war- heads. If Yeltsin cannot deliver Russia to the democrats, then Communists or ultra nationalists may one day stand over the button. Please see YELTSIN, G3 > Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 12, 1994 > \fYeltsin: Russian leader losing some o his hight, or is he? > Continued from G1 Since his rise from being a provin- cial Communist boss to assuming a cen- tral role in the Moscow party in 1985, Yeltsin’s fame has been in his fights. A physically imposing man, with ego and ambition to match, he never shrank from struggle. And losing was not his style. _ He fought to demolish privileges of the party elite. He fought to force then- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev into deeper reforms. From the turret of a tank in August 1991, the new Russian president stood up against coup plotters trying to preserve the crumbling Soviet empire. Yeltsin won: The Soviet Union fell, but its spirit did not. So he faced along battle with a back- ward-looking Russian parliament that wanted to dump him and shackle move- ment toward democracy and a free- market economy. He triumphed over impeachment in March 1993. He won a referendum the next month in which a majority of voters endorsed his policies of change. But the Congress of People’s Depu- ties refused to succumb, and it was his final bitter fight against the parliament that seems to have sapped Yeltsin of his old will to win at whatever cost. The quick series of blows: Yeltsin dissolves parliament; his foes stage a bloody rampage through the streets, re- joining the parliamentary leadership huddled in their offices in the Russian White House; Yeltsin calls out the tanks and shells the rebels into surrender. The cost in lives: at least 140, proba- bly more. But the cost was also a nation- al trauma and disgust that politics could plunge into such a treacherous swamp, where Russian guns spilled Russian blood. In his autobiography, “The Struggle for Russia,” Yeltsin acknowledges that he fell into depression after last Octo- ber’s rebellion. In his remarkably per- sonal memoir, Yeltsin describes period- ic fits of despair from which he had to be extracted by friend or family. He wrote: “The debilitating bouts of depression, the grave second thoughts, the insomnia and headaches in the mid- dle of the night, the tears and despair ... the entire burden of the decisions made, the hurt from people close to me who did not support me at the last min- ute, who didn’t hold up, who deceived me — I have had to bear all of this.” The silver-haired president, now 63, emerged from the October insurrection apparently determined to avoid the con- flict he once relished. In the December elections for a new parliament, he refused to endorse any slate, even the candidates serving in his own administration. Partly because of that, the reformist candidates were drubbed by Communists and national- ists. Once again Yeltsin faces a parlia- ment demanding slow movement, if not reverse movement, albeit in a generally less strident tone of voice. Rather than challenge the new par- liament, Yeltsin has gone to great lengths to appease it. He dumped almost all the pro-capitalist members of his government, including the designers of economic reform. He quickly backed off from challenging the parliament vote for amnesty, which freed from prison all the leaders of the October rebellion. He has delayed joining NATO’s “Partner- ship for Peace” — a plan for increasing military ties between Western allies and their former Warsaw Pact foes — largely in deference to nationalist um- brage bristling in the legislature. His chief goal has been getting the Opposition to sign a political truce, the Pact on Social Accord, which lacks legal standing but commits signers to peace- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 12, 1994 (Continued) > \f(5 YELTSIN BURNED OUT?

By Joseph Alibright and Marcia Kumnstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — A Russian- speaking American busi- nessman was kidnapped in St. Petersburg by suspected Russian gangsters early this year and later found slain after a six- week hunt, it was disclosed Tuesday. “He was kidnapped for the purpose of extortion,”’’ said Fiarit Safin, a spokesman for police in Russia’s second-largest city. *““‘His body has been found. That is all I can say for now.’’ The American’s identity is being withheld pending an au- topsy report. But police said the man lived in an apartment in St. Petersburg and was active in the import-export business. He did not work for a major U.S. com- pany. Police are investigating whether the victim — perhaps unknowingly — got caught up in a business deal with one of St. Petersbure’s up-and-coming crime syndicates, which have grown rich on shady commerce in the port city. The kidnappers have not been arrested. St. Petersburg, which in three weeks will host up to S,000 inter- national visitors for cable televi- sion mogul Ted Turner’s Good- will Games, already has been shaken this year by two highly publicized gangland battles that left 17 Russians dead. There is widespread agreement that the city’s street crime has been ris- ing amid all the post-Soviet turmoil. The report of the American’s death comes amid mounting con- cern about Russian organized crime, believed to be spreading its influence in the United States, Europe and China. FBI Director Louis Freeh, who is touring Europe to discuss ways to combat the powerful Russian mafia, will fly to Mos- cow on Saturday with represen- tatives of the Treasury Depart- ment, the Drug Enforcement Ad- ministration and the Secret Service. CRIME SYNDICATES Associated Pi Crime task force officers in Moscow kick in the door of a hotel room in a search for weap- ons under a new crackdown that gives police wider powers of search and detention. Freeh on Monday will open a two-man FBI office in Moscow that will focus on organized crime, drug trafficking and the threat of the spread of nuclear weapons and materials from the former Soviet Union. Despite the rise in crime, Russian Interior Ministry statis- tics indicate the St. Petersburg murder rate remains quite low compared with many big cities in the United States, in part be- cause guns are not as widely available. With a population of nearly 5 million, St. Petersburg last year recorded 875 murders, or 18 per 100,000 residents. By contrast, in 1992 the murder rate in Dallas was 37 per 100,000, and in Atlan- ta it was 48. Interviewed by telephone from Atlanta, Turner Broadcast- ing System Vice President Dwight Ellison, chief of security for the Goodwill Games, said ath- letes and other visitors to the July 23 to Aug. 7 mini-Olympics will be less at risk than Russians and foreigners who regularly do business in St. Petersburg. TBS is sponsoring the Goodwill Games. The American was kidnapped in February, but the case was kept secret at the insistence of the man’s family, an official said. It was unclear whether the fam- ily received a specific extortion demand or whether any ransom was paid. As snow melted this spring, Russian police recovered a body from a forest on the outskirts of St. Petersburg. But it was only in the past few days that Russian fo- rensic tests confirmed it was the missing American. Investigators said the victim was lured out of his St. Peters- burg office by unidentified Rus- Sian business acquaintances. The victim’s driver told po- lice that he followed for some distance in a second automobile. He had expected to drive the American home after what he be- lieved to be a routine business encounter. But some minutes later, ac- cording to the victim’s driver, the car carrying the American suddenly stopped and some Rus- sian toughs jumped out. The American’s driver said the Russians threatened him with guns and told him to ‘‘get lost.”” The driver turned back, and the American was not seen alive again.

        "ocr_text": "FBI chief warns of Russian mobsters Moscow asked to cooperate By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — FBI Director Louis Freeh warned Sat- urday that Mafia-like Russian crime syndicates are linking up with other criminal gangs to break U.S. laws. “This is a | very alarming sign both for Russia and the United States,” Freeh said on the - eve of an unprec- edented summit | between the na- Louis Freeh tionwide crime- busting agencies of the United States and Russia. The three-day security sum- mit will seek to find ways to curb the widening influence of Rus- sian criminal cartels, including their efforts to obtain nuclear materials. ' Ata joint airport news con- ference in Moscow, Freeh’s op- posite number in Russia, Col. Gen. Mikhail Yegorov, disclosed that in the last 18 months, his agency has recorded SO thefts of nuclear materials. | “But as a rule these were of low enrichment and small quan- tities,” Yegorov said. “There have been no thefts of nuclear materials which can be made into weapons. “But all countries which have nuclear weapons, not only Rus- sia, cannot exclude that such these things can happen. There- fore, we should all be ready to ee, ee. Tea we take necessary action.” _ Freeh is eager to prevent Russia’s 27 000 atomic warheads and its poorly cataloged stocks of bomb-grade uranium and pluto- nium from siipping into criminal. commerce, ' “We cannot take a chance that terrorists might steal a nu- -_clear weapon and then use it against a nation, any nation,” he said before leaving Washington. _ The Russians, on the other hand, are more interested in how to stanch what one official called “the astronomical sum” of $1 bil- lion a day in currency flowing out f Russia. While some funds leave legally, there is also a deep, untaxed current of Russian Ma- fia money from extortion, prosti- tution, casino gambling and ille- gal exports of raw materials. _ Yegorov’s boss, Russian Inte- rior Minister Victor Yerin, also would like FBI cooperation in combating hired killings. About 250 mob murders were recorded in Russia last year, and some in- telligence reports claim that some killers were imported by Moscow mobsters from the Rus- sian exile community of Brigh- ton Beach in Brooklyn. On Monday, Freeh will open a two-person FBI liaison office in Moscow. He has said that the “template” for American-Rus- sian cooperation is a 1981 infor- mation-sharing arrangement with Italy that has sent hundreds of Cosa Nostra members to pris- on in both lands. ' Russia’s competing police bureaucracies — the Interior Ministry and Federal Counter- Intelligence Service — are un- comfortable with Washington’s prime focus, the risk of nuclear thefts. Nuclear Energy Minister Vic- tor Mikhailov has insisted no warheads or fissionable materi- als are missing. But Justice Min- ister Yuri Kalmykov said last month that “different spare parts: from nuclear technology are in the hands of organized crime in Europe via Russia.” He did not specify what spare parts he meant. The Russian counterintelli-, gence chief, Sergei Stepashin, as questioned the Americans’ intent in seeking cooperation with Russia’s security services. “He [Stepashin] intends to ask his American counterpart to present documents or informa- tion confirming the danger of nu- clear terrorism in Russia,” the Itar-TASS news agency re- ported. “Otherwise, the FBI’s inter- est in this may be interpreted by the Russian opposition as an as- piration by the United States to establish control over nuclear objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 3, 1994 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Anti-Jewish group arrested in By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — Russia’s coun- terintelligence service revealed Monday it had cracked a fascist cell planning anti-Jewish terrorist actions, as FBI Director Louis Freeh huddled with Russian law enforcement leaders to map out new joint crime-busting efforts. The plans of the obscure Rus- sian band called the Werewolf Le- gion included torching theaters due to show the movie Schindler’s List, Russian television and the independent Russian news service Interfax reported. Last month, the Russian open- ing of the movie, which details Nazi atrocities against Jews in World War II, was suddenly post- poned until September after direc- tor Steven Spielberg cited unspec- ified ‘‘personal circumstances.”’ Meanwhile, Freeh emerged from meeting his counterpart, Ser- gei Stepashin, head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, with a Russian wish-list of suspects on American soil that Moscow au- thorities want help arresting. It was a dramatic example of how relations have flipped since the era when American leaders arrived in Moscow with names of Russians they wanted sprung from political detention. “T handed to Mr. Freeh a list of six criminals who live in the Unit- ed States and on whom the Feder- al Counterintelligence Service is Moscow working, and Mr. Freeh kindly agreed to render us assistance,’’ said Stepashin, who heads a suc- cessor agency to the former KGB. Freeh talked with several top Russian internal security chiefs to sketch plans for actions against crime and terrorism that are ex- pected to be spelled out in an agreement to be signed today. Freeh, accompanied by other top Washington-based law en- forcement officials, urged Russia to balance crime-fighting with ob- servance of human and civil rights. This is a sore subject. Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin has been criti- cized for giving police the right to. detain suspects for up to a month, | search offices and homes without a court order and examine the finan- cial affairs of those suspected of organized crime. In a speech at a Russian police academy, Freeh praised the legis- lative process of writing anti-crime laws as critical ‘“‘because it embod- ies the collective wisdom and is not merely the result of one per- son’s whim.”’ The assault against the fascist terrorist group was shown briefly on Russia’s main evening news show, without mentioning details. Interfax reported that the lead- er of the band and his closest assistants were arrested. It said the group’s aim was ‘“‘physical de- struction”’ of those holding differ- ent ideologies, including ‘‘demo- crats, communists, national patriots and Jews.”’ Palm Beach Post - July 5, 1994 \f"

Russian President Boris Yelt- sin told Clinton in a telephone discussion Tuesday that Russia is ready to sign an agreement on the withdrawal of its troops from Latvia if the Latvian government reverses its ‘‘discriminatory acts” against Russian residents, the independent news agency In- terfax reported. It said that in the conversa- tion, initiated by Clinton, Yeltsin expressed confidence that Clin- ton would concentrate public at- tention during his seven-hour visit to the Latvian capital, Riga, on the plight of Russian minor- ities in both Latvia and Estonia. Clinton himself helped raise such hopes in a front-page inter- view published Tuesday in the Russian newspaper Izvestia, in which he said the United States ‘energetically supports’ the - rights of Russians who remain in the Baltic countries and fully {supports] the rights of national minorities.’’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 6, 1994 *‘This is a very serious prob- lem for us and our country and, yes, for all the world,’’ he told the Russian daily. Since the Latvian parliament, the Saeima, recently adopted leg- islation that would dramatically restrict citizenship for Russian residents, supporters of more re- laxed standards have looked to the West to pressure Latvia into changing the plan. ; Under the legislation, natu- ralization of the 700,000 ethnic Russians — about one-third of Latvia’s population — would not begin until the year 2000. Then a quota system would limit grants of Latvian citizenship to about 2,000 people per year. Non-citi- zens are not accorded equal eco- nomic and political rights. Latvian deputies were re- sponding to Russia’s refusal to pull out more than 7,000 troops still in Latvia and to fears that Russian civilians remaining there from Soviet days might be- come a pro-Russian fifth column. Latvian leaders want mem-: bership in the Council of Europe. and other means of integrating their nation into the West, so dis- approval by European officials of the citizenship restrictions has been important. President Guntis Ulmanis was sufficiently influenced by the criticism to refuse to sign the legislation, throwing it back to parliament for reconsideration. \f"

Pro-Russian residents of eastern Ukraine threw their support to Kuchma, a former prime minister, while nationalistic western Ukrainians backed the loser, incumbent President Leonid Kravehuk, a one-time Communist ideologue who, led his country to independence in 1991, “It looks like we are a people who are able only to be slaves,” lamented Dmytro Pavlychko, a former deputy in Ukraine's parliament, ex- pressing fears after Monday night's vote counting that Kuchma would subject Ukraine once again to Russian domination. Kuchma, who does not speak the Ukrainian language well, has endorsed economic union with Russia but not a political or military merger. In neighboring Belarus, upstart Alexander Lu- kashenko, 39, pulled in an overwhelming 80 per- cent of the vote in Sunday's runoff election, run- ning also on promises to re-engage his financially floundering nation with Russia, In this case, the opponent, Prime Minister Vy- acheslav Kebich, also supported an economic union, But Lukashenko does not support a free market economy and has spoken more broadly of restoring ties with Russia. Lukashenko was the only member of the Belarus parliament who vot- ed against the 1991 agreement dissolving the So- viet Union and thus making Belarus independent. In the short term, Kuchma's victory may de- fuse regional tensions, which flared over the past year as Kravchuk repeatedly wrangled with Rus- sian President Boris Yeltsin over control of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet, which is based in Crimea, and over the status of Crimea itself. In local elections earlier this year, Crimeans voted to establish closer ties with Russia and strongly supported Kuchma for president, But long range, the results could accelerate the disintegration of Ukraine into a nationalist, Catholic western sector and an Orthodox Chris tian east that wants to reunite with Russia, Such a split was forecast in a CIA assessment last year. Ukraine's nuclear missiles and bomber bases are concentrated in the pro-Russian eastern por- tion that voted heavily for Kuchma, During the campaign, Kuchma equivocated on whether he Would honor Kravchuk’s pledges to President Clinton to give up nuclear aspirations, Moscow political scientist Karen Brutents said he expects both countries to edge closer to Russia, but that neither new president would be able to forge a total liaison, “Any extreme policy — a clear pro-Russian policy or clear anti-Russian policy — may split Ukraine,” he said, “And this split of Ukraine Would have many tragic circumstances not only for Ukraine but for Russia also, That's why any Politician who is not crazy must go middle of road,” Kuchma, who received about 52 percent of the vote to Kravchuk’s 46 percent in Sunday's a election, will be sworn in as president July 19, Tampa Tribune- July 12, 1994 \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS St. re his intimate city, graced with canals and lumi- nous summer nights, is straining to complete the mission of its cre- ation nearly 300 years ago: to be Rus- sia’s window to the West. Today it is stalled fitfully on the brink, despite being finally freed from the 70-year bridle of Soviet communism. Plans abound for new hotels, pri- vate shops and renovations that will ensure the future of the Hermitage, one of the world’s greatest art muse- ums, as well as the fate of theaters and churches whose interiors are ar- chitectural gems. If the hopes of progressive Mayor Anatoly Sobchak are realized, St. Pe- tersburg (formerly Leningrad) may well become what it deserves to be — one of the half-dozen preeminent tourist spots of Europe.

PETERSBURG, K4 > - July 17, 1994 > \f> Continued from KI Turner’s mini-Olympics, which run here Saturday through Aug. 7. They will bring not only athletic competition, but also views of the city, into homes of television viewers worldwide. Like all of Russia, St. Petersburg continues the struggle to replace communist restraints with a free market system that would provide the invest- ment needed to lift the city’s plans from the draw- _ ing boards. The transition is complicated, as it is through- out Russia, by the growth of crime syndicates pene- trating the early stages of capitalist enterprise. . Our experi- ence from a fortnight of st. Mee conclude that St: Petersburg . made an tive re- hive to a stinging report on local crime issued earlier this year by the U.S. Con- sulate here. - Bolstered security, at least for the moment, has cleared the streets of thieving chil- dren and mug- gers. But even in the city’s worst days last summer, street crime here was never as menacing as in a typical Ameri- can big city. We have not felt threatened, walking at noon or pat midnight. And that is especially fortunate, be- cause St. Petersburg must be seen up close to be fully appreciated. To get an overall view, start with a city bus tour, which can be booked daily at most hotels for less than $10. A canal tour costing about the same is restful if you have lots of time, but be aware that guides speak Russian. It’s important to know that St. Petersburg nev- er should have been built. Its existence is a triumph of will. : The vision and ego of Peter the Great in 1703 produced first a military outpost in the midst of a swamp, the Peter-and-Paul Fortress, a stone fort and gold-spired cathedral where Peter and his suc- cessors are buried. Peter surrounded this base with one of the most harmoniously planned cities of all Europe. ®: Moving his capital to this impossible site on the Bay of Finland was part of Peter’s dramatic effort to reorient his nation to the West. He achieved it through forced labor and by ordering nobles to up- root themselves from Moscow to populate what be- gan as a miserable bog. His daughter Empress Elizabeth and later Em- press Catherine the Great added to their capital un- der both foreign and Russian architects, who creat- PAIGE BRADDOCK / Staff ed an alluring harmony from Europe’s classical, Baroque and Renaissance styles, with a bit of Rus- sian originality added. Spend at least a morning or afternoon absorb- ing this at ground level. Ambling along the canals and city streets, especially with a guide or book of walking tours, you encounter a rolling series of epiphanies, Buildings, plazas and garden pathways link into symmetrical architectural ensembles un- seen from a car or bus. There are exceptions, such as the extravagantly colored Church of the Spilled Blood off Nevsky Prospektin the center, one of the few typically Rus- sian onion-domed churches in the city. Or an ugly Stalinist apartment block building in the center that exasperates tour guide Marina So- boleva. “Somehow Petersburg managed to pre- serve its face,” she said, hinting at the genteel arro- gance suffusing St. Petersburgers. “We don’t con- sider this our style.” Hf you’re seeking the bustling heart of St. Pe- tersburg, head to Nevsky Prospekt. The main com- mercial and entertainment artery since the city was built, it brims with life day and night. Since private enterprise has begun a Russian comeback, sidewalk craft stalls, musicians and booksellers on Nevsky Prospekt now supplement private stores selling French perfume, Italian leather and lots of imported foodstuffs. Still, St. Pe- tersburg is not yet a shopper’s haven, especially for clothing. One wonders how the women and men who live here turn themseives out so stylishly. One hint for souvenir shoppers: Try the big bookstores along Nevsky. Besides books, they often have good buys in contemporary painting, jewelry and crafts, far superior to the mass-produced stuff in most gift shops. The Russian Museum shop also offers some unique buys. Of course, there is more than architecture and shopping here. St. Petersburg’s leading attraction is the Her- mitage, one of the premier art museums in the world. It is housed primarily in the green Winter Palace, the glorious white- and gold-trimmed treasure chest completed under Empress Eliza- ' beth in Russian Baroque style. The collection includes some of the finest works of the world’s most illustrious artists, as well as Greek and Roman artifacts, period furniture and unique chess and coin collections. Among the most celebrated paintings: “The Virgin of the Annunciation,” by Simone Martini (1284-1344); “Madonna and Child,” Raphael (1483-1520); “Forest Landscape,” Jan Breughel (1568-1625); “Return of the Prodigal Son,” Rem- brandt (1606-1669); “Cottages,” Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890); “Music,” Henri Matisse (1869-1954); and “The Dance of the Veils, Pablo Picasso (1881- 1973). One dazzling example of the excesses of the czars is the gaudy Malachite Room, where the col- umns, pilasters and mantelpieces are faced in bright green malachite stone, set off by gilded moldings glittering around the ceiling and doors. History was made in the building, first as the residence of czars and then as the site of the Octo- ber 1917 revolution.. Here the Bolsheviks attacked the Provisional Government, which itself had re- sulted from a February revolt, and communists took control of Russia. Within months, they moved the capital back to Moscow. : ’ ee ua ae Loss Te plans After the Hermitage, sight is the old imperial palace, Petrodvorets, 18 miles west. It’s possible to get there by bus or train, but traveling by hydrofoil is recommended in good weather. Spectacular grounds — highlighted by the Great Cascade, made up of 64 fountains and 37 stat- ues — surround restored buildings with gilt interi- ors, weighty chandeliers, silk wall coverings, tap- estries, paintings and royal furniture. Other museums, monuments, theaters and parks dot the city, such as the Russian Museum, with its good collection of icons and handicrafts in the center of Arts Square, and the nearby Ethnog- raphy Museum, which gives a glimpse of the dra- matically varied cultures that combine to make up Russia.

        "ocr_text": "Parts for track scoreboard ‘disappear. By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE St. Petersburg, Russia — The disap- pearance of some vital electrical components has forced organizers to scale down plans for a giant rotating stadium scoreboard for the Goodwill Games that open Saturday. But as athletes began arriving Wednes- day, officials said the city was ready for the first international sports event in Russia since the Soviet collapse. “For us, the Games began today,” said Vi- taly Mutko, the first deputy mayor. Originally, Russian organizers planned to enthrall track and field crowds both inside and outside the Petrovsky Stadium with giant instant replays of athletes like Carl Lewis blasting out of the blocks, And to help pay the freight, they sold animated spots on the board to commercial advertisers. Technicians on Wednesday were rushing to test a jury-rigged system to project ani- mated displays on half of the towering score- board, leaving the other half blank. The scoreboard will be capable of showing adver: tising, but it was unclear how quickly and OL Bulle frequently any replays will appear. “We could display replays of starts and finishes if there was a necessity,” said Bog- dan Oganov, the stadium’s general director, The snafu is that no one can find some vi- tal cables and control mechanisms that are supposed to connect the scoreboard to the rest of the stadium’s video and precision tim: ing apparatus, A truck carrying the parts “simply disap- peared” somewhere in Ukraine last month, explained Oganov. The truck was transport: ing the parts from a plant in Hungary where the new scoreboard was manufactured, Goodwill Games president Jack Kelly said the scoreboard problem has no effect on the apparatus supplied by a Swiss company to measure athletes’ times during races, He said the athletes’ times can be displayed on an old- er scoreboard at the other end of the stadium. Nor will televised instant replays be affected. Asked what other problems remain be- fore the opening ceremonies Saturday, Kelly said, “Little things at every venue,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 21, 1994 ‘stands at 150 billion rubles He said Wednesday the city has signed off on construction at “about seve of he 12 vet ues,” The other five sites are ingva ws j all of completion, but he said he expect finished in time for Saturday's Peni ne ‘ “At the one or two venues atare not go ing to be cleared until tontortow (Thutsday] or Friday, they're throwing F erything into the breach,” Kellisaid.

        "ocr_text": "Heroic efforts kept St. Petersburg alive Will to survive: Under a cruel 900-day siege, the city refused to buckle to German invaders. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS St. Petersburg, Russia — More than 50 years ago, a quartet of Russian athletes accepted a challenge more demanding than that faced by any Olympian. The mission of these mountain-climbers was critical to the survival of this city. Mikhail Bobrov, now 71, recalls one trying moment, mounting the-gold ball balanced atop the spire of the cathedral of Peter and Paul Fortress, 366 feet above the frigid, battered ground. It was night. It was winter. And it was World War II in a city under siege, where people endured on five ounces of bread a y. “We were cold and we were hungry. When I got to the bottom level of the ball, I didn’t have enough strength to pull myself over it,” he said. “‘We made two or three attempts to reach the top of the ball. And then we made it.” Sitting on the wings of two gilded angels attached as a weathervane, lurching in gusts of wind, Bobrov and his partner made the whole contraption disappear. They painted the ball, the angels and the spire, just as they would paint or camouflage 15 other gold-leafed churches and monuments that were glinting invitations to Nazi bombers targeting St. Petersburg, then called Leningrad. They worked five bitter months, sometimes under the strafing of German planes. It was but one chapter in a book of heroics acted out during 900 relentless days of the Leningrad blockade. Today this city exists because as many as 2.5 million people did not abandon it back then, staying to confront starvation, winters without heat or electricity, and months of German assaults. Fifty years later, they have a unique . status in this city. Survivors are still awarded special privileges — such as free subway tickets and, this month, free Goodwill Games tickets. Soviet historians say 650,000 civilians died during the siege, but some now estimate the toll at tens of thousands more. They also say Hitler was prepared to level the city, had the citizens of Leningrad buckled. Bobrov, who today is honorary chairman of the Goodwill Games volunteer program, became involved early in wartime camouflaging of the gilded buildings that pepper St. Petersburg’s skyline. The motivation was more compelling than a simple desire to save historic landmarks. Nazi troops not only had encircled the city by Sept. 8, 1941, but also had undertaken a bombing campaign of astonishing accuracy. Reference points for bombing “Tt was the fascist tactic of terror. They hit the places especially crowded — tram stops, squares, hospitals and factory entrances in rush hours,” Bobrov said in an interview. ‘How could they shell so accurately?” When Red army troops captured a German artillery point, they discovered the answer. On large aerial photographs were marked all the tall beacons: the fortress spire, the domes of St. Isaac’s Cathedral, the tower of the Admiralty. Also shown were the distances from each to key military and civilian targets. “These were all points of orientation for German artillery,” said Bobrov. A group of architects concocted the plan to hide these sites of orientation, rather than dismantle them, and Bobrov was among the four alpinists chosen to execute it. In the squad were two women and two young men, available only because they had been injured in military service. At age 17, Bobrov already had been wounded while crossing enemy front lines after an intelligence mission. They started on Sept. 23, 15 days after the blockade began, and by the time they finished in February the deprivation had taken a ruinous toll on these brave young people. And on all Leningrad. It was not just the shooting and bombing — though there were close calls, such as the German fighter that descended from a cloud with blazing guns, pocking the roof of St. Isaac’s on either side of the woman camouflaging it. Hunger the worst killer It was the hunger that killed. Bobrov survived to finish out the war as an army alpine ski patroller, then became an officer and teacher. The others in his team got very sick. “You could study anatomy just by looking at their bodies. You could see every bone of their skeletons,” he said. His partner Aloise Zembe died that April 28, Olga Prigosheva on May 1. They had finished climbing and painting and draping dark cloths on Leningrad’s magnificent buildings less than three months earlier. Olga Fersova was terribly weak, but survived. They were not exceptions. The majority of Leningrad’s citizens kept working. Factories pumped out munitions, including tanks. Orchestras performed. Newspapers were published and radio programs broadcast. When people could not continue, they died. Leningraders literally fell in the streets. One chorus singer died during an opera performance that continued as the body was dragged offstage. Hunger was so intense that people resorted to cannibalism. Bobrov remembers the trip to the cemetery after his mother died of starvation. He saw . JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Staff Mikhail Bobrov, now 71, climbed and helped camouflage the spires of tall buildings during World War II to help reduce German bombers’ accuracy. . . corpses with chunks of flesh cut out. Russian newspaper accounts say 260 people were jailed for cannibalism. *You have to fight back’ Far more common, Bobrov said, were examples of people helping each other, | people helping the city resist. “If you want to survive, you have to. , move. You have to do something. You __. have to fight back and defend yourself,” he said, explaining how his crew could. - work so strenuously under such difficult . conditions. “Some people were fighting on the front line. Children and old women helped firemen throw firebombs from the roofs of buildings. Some people picked up dead bodies in the streets and took them to | mass graves. So everyone did what he could do. We knew how to do this job. So we did it.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 24, 1994 \f"

Sketchers plead to immortalize your face. Vendors, beggars, grandmas with babies, hookers and their bruisers — all ferment in the Nevsky Prospekt stew. This avenue has been the ki- netic main street practically since St. Petersburg was founded in 1703, and revels in a new re- maissance after the fall of com- munist prohibitions against pri- vate enterprise. Today Nevsky Prospekt is the Place to saunter with no goal in mind, a 2.5-mile display of this city’s stirring history and just as dramatic new day of freedom. Look at local art and crafts at stands outside 18th century pal- aces. Sample the ubiquitous ice cream that Russians love and seems to be sold every few dozen feet. Take a breather at the city’s Priciest hotel, the elegant $395-a- night Grand Europe. The rare Italian — or Russian — designer stores are on Nevsky, along with antique shops and French perfumeries. More common is the Russian version of shopping malls, cav- ernous buildings cut into small stalls where new entrepreneurs offer everything from cheap cos- metics to camping gear. One is a former guest house for itinerant merchants, Gostiny Dvor, where about 300,000 shop- pers visit daily. Think as you walk down the arcade of shops in Gostiny Dvor about how one of its hallways was once lined with gold.

        "ocr_text": " City taking tough approach to combat crime problem By Joseph Albright aed Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS St. Petersburg, Russia — Eight days before the Goodwill Games, a staffer with the U.S. consulate was emerging from the Baskin-Robbins ice cream store on Nevsky Prospekt when two robbers jammed him inside the double glass doors. They jostled him and grabbed his wallet. Unfortunately for the thieves, the American fought back. He was able to hold on to one attacker until the police ar- rived. The other escaped. Like tourist cities around the world, St. Petersburg has a crim- inal subculture that feeds on na- ive foreigners. It has its bump- and-grab artists, its black-shirt- ed extortionists, its drug smugglers and its $300 hookers. But the city also has a tough mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, who is determined to broadcast a world- wide impression that St. Peters- burg is 100 percent safe for Goodwill Games visitors. A heavy police presence Under Sobchak’s prodding, federal Interior Ministry police have mounted a heavy crack- down on street crime, rounding up more than 2,000 suspects and confiscating nearly 1,000 fire- arms. At least temporarily, St. Petersburg is a far safer city than it was a year ago — largely due to the 17,000 uniformed militia and police officers standing on near- ly every street corner. No serious crimes against Goodwill Game visitors have been reported. “You can walk around St. Pe- tersburg 24 hours a day, but don’t drink too much vodka, don’t get involved with unknown women, don’t go to places with a doubtful reputation, and you will be all right,”” Sobchak said in an interview. __ Even so, longtime residents still are alarmed by a longer- term uptrend in violent crime. Sobchak’s anti-crime cam- paign culminated in a two-week sweep this month code-named “Operation Signal,” in which about 2 million people from Rus- sia and neighboring republics were stopped and required to show their identity documents at police checkpoints throughout the city. Detention cells were filled with more than 1,000 non-St. Pe- tersburgers who couldn’t show proof that they had obtained po- lice permission to be in the city more than three days. Russian law allows police to detain such suspects for 10 days without charges while they are being identified. A police spokes- man said that for second offend- ers, the choice is paying a stiff fine or catching the next train bound for their hometowns. “The operation was intended to filter out the criminal ele- ment,” says Senior Sergeant Ser- gei Kravasin, 28, of the Ministry of Interior’s*elite paramilitary police, which was called in as re- inforcement during Operation Signal. Certain groups singled out Riding in his patrol jeep last week, Kravasin said his three- member team is still on the look- out. “When somebody is in a nice car and is dressed in a cultured manner, we don’t stop them,” said Kravasin. ‘But if the car is dirty and the guy looks unshaven or badly dressed, we probably check them. There are many peo- ple like that from the Cau- caucus.” As in similar anti-crime blitz- es_in Moscow last fall, many of those detained were dark- skinned natives of the Caucausus region of southern Russia, Geor- gia and Azerbaijan who are Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 25, 1994 viewed by police as the source of much of Russia’s crime. Today, St. Petersburg is no longer populated by gangs of street urchins on the lookout for rubes with rubles. Yet as recent- ly as last summer, street urchins imported from the republic of Moldova by local organized criminals were responsible for “the majority of street crime”’ in the city, according to a report by the U.S. consulate here. An appeal to Yeltsin for help Complaints of street crime by the American and other Western consulates stimulated Sobchak to write a candid public letter to President Boris Yeltsin appeal- ing for “emergency measures’’ to curb crime, especially during the Goodwill Games. “Despite the measures we have taken in St. Petersburg, the criminal situation is very dan- gerous,”’ Sobchak wrote in March. “It can be measured by a noticeable growth in violent crimes, including crimes with fire arms.” Gun crimes continue to terri- fy St. Petersburg residents. And not without reason: > Last month, a Danish diplo- mat saw a gunman shoot another man in the head in Mars Field park, a tourist attraction two blocks from the Grand Europa Hotel, where Ted Turner and Jane Fonda have been staying during the Goodwill Games. ®» Also in June, another American standing in front of the Astoria Hotel — which now houses hundreds of sportswrit- ers and TV technicians — watched as a policeman was shot in the chest while attempting to collar a criminal suspect. The po- liceman escaped with only a bruise because he wore a flak jacket. \f"

St. Isaac’s Cathedral _. an architectural wonder By Marcia Kunste! STAFF CORRESPONDENT St. Petersburg — Tower- ing St. Isaac’s Cathedral, meas- ured in multiples of tons and acres, is a maverick to both this city’s architecture and to Rus- sian Orthodox style. To visit it is to be awed. Builders took 40 years (1818-58) to do right by St. Isaac’s, but they finally pro- duced an edifice that seems to swell out of the ground, reach- ing 30S feet in height, with a floor covering 2.5 acres and a dome faced with 200 pounds of gold.

Underfunded Hermitage a survivor Leaky roof and sewer woes s aside, museum still a treasure By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS St. Petersburg — The man who over- sees one of the greatest collections of Rem- brandts, Matisses and other masterworks on the planet picks up the red hotline that jan- gles behind his desk. ‘Calling on the St. Petersburg city hall’s internal phone network is one of Russia’s new breed of politician-businessmen. He is offering a bundle of rubles if the Hermitage Museum will put up a sign advertising a nearby restaurant. No museum director anywhere is more strapped for donations than the Hermitage’s 49-year-old Mikhail Pyotrovsky. Yet Pyotrovsky tells the donor no. It is a signal that, though times are tough, the proud old Hermitage has somehow held to- gether since the 1991 collapse of Russian communism. “We survived because we knew we had to survive,” Pyotrovsky said. “We only had to ad- just to a new situation. And we began to adjust.” Maybe you enjoyed that spectacular shot of beach volleyball against the Peter and Paul Fortress. That came courtesy of the Hermitage. For although the museum turned down the restaurant ad, it cut a $1,200 deal with the Goodwill Games to allow its roof to serve as a camera venue. This knack for adapting to sudden change has helped the Hermitage survive the last 300 years to become Russia’s greatest cultur- al heirloom. The collection has grown by ca- pricious spurts since it started in Czar Peter the Great’s time as “the Chamber of Curios.” Empress Catherine the Great acquired the core of the Hermitage collection in the 1760s and 1770s, sending diplomats to Eu- rope to snap up entire collections of Flemish, Dutch and French masters. She also built the Winter Palace that would become the heart of the Hermitage Museum In the Soviet Union's days, the Hermitage soared in world importance after Lenin’s commissars gonfiscated Monets, Renoirs, DAVID TULIS / Staff One of the most famous landmarks of St. Petersburg is a bronze statue of ’ Peter the Great on a horse. Cezannes and Picassos from czarist-era Rus- sian collectors. Last year, Pyotrovsky ran the Hermitage — with its five interconnected buildings, its 2.8 million art objects, its 353 Loreen its = Le employees — on a budget of $3.5 milli The Hermitage budget is half the 1993-94 budget of Atlanta’s High Museum, which has 10,900 art objects. The Metropo! litan Muse- um in New York, the British Musstim in Lon- don and the Louvre in Paris have budgets 25 times as big as the Hermitage. Unhappily, the contrast shows. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 27, 1994 On the third floor of the Hermitage, breathtaking Matisses, Cezannes and Picas- sos hang in shabby rooms. The loose-fitting windows have been sealed with masking tape in an effort to keep out dust and rain. The tape is brittle and doesn’t stick. In each room sits an elderly woman pen- sioner. These $15-a-week babushkas are the museum’s foremost security system for works such as Henri Matisse’s priceless can- vas ‘‘The Dancers.” For foreigners who rush through on guid- ed tours, the museum still projects an overall aura of opulence and good care. — But there is a hidden side that is not reas- suring. The roof leaks in every rainstorm, and ground water backs up from the muse- um’s sewers. In some parts of the basement, it is so wet that stalactite form. Meanwhile, the Hermitage is sinking into the saturated earth at the rate of one-half centimeter a year. So far the worst has been avoided. Considering the temptations, theft re- mains surprisingly rare. Three Roman coins and a small Greek statue have been stolen from storerooms in the last few years. Early this month, a glass Egyptian bowl made in the third century B.C. and valued at $500,000 disappeared from a back room. But no thief has walked off with any world-class master- pieces such as Leonardo da Vinci’s “Litta ee or El Greco’s “Apostles Peter and aul. Nor has the impoverished Russian govern- ment repeated the Stalin regime’s selloff of Hermitage treasures between 1928 and 1933. That was when the U.S. Treasury Secre- tary Andrew Mellon scooped up 21 Old Mas- ters, among them Botticelli’s “Adoration of the Child” and Titian’s “Venus with the Looking-Glass,” for a mere $6.6 million. For now, the risk is much more mundane: “The biggest nightmare of the director is fire,” says Pyotrovsky, who broods over un- counted ‘oie of damp, old electrical Given the risks, he signed a contract June with the American company Honeywell Inc., to install a centralized network of fire and security alarms and climate controls during the next five vears. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Russia’s unsafe skies Hundreds of new air' By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS St. Petersburg, Russia — As your Russian airliner guns its jets for takeoff, a flight attendant in an Aeroflot uniform passes out orange juice, Sprite and free Danish beer. Fasten your military-style seat clasp. You are about to experience one of 360 re- gional airlines — nicknamed “Babyflots” — that have spurted up across the former Soviet Union to replace the old Aeroflot monopoly. Forget those Russian official statistics that now show the “level of safety has dropped... more than tenfold” in the skies over the former Soviet Union since the late 1980s. Ignore that nasty crash in March that killed 75 people when an Aeroflot Russian International jet smacked into the Siberan hills and in which flight recorders alleged- ly picked up discussion indicating that the pilot was letting his young son learn to fly an Airbus. Today you are in luck: You are flying on one of the safer, stronger Babyflots. Aboard your 9-year-old Tupelov-154, there are new fire extinguishers and es- cape slides and even a slick in-flight maga- zine. And now comes a true marvel of mod- ern aviation: a Russian flight attendant who smiles. You're in the hands of Pulkovo Air En- terprise. It’s a try-harder airline with such a low profile that few Russians have ever heard of it. Pulkovo Air, with 7,000 employees, owns 50 planes and the city’s domestic air- port, Pulkovo-2. The airline operates vir- tually all the flights between St. Peters- burg and Moscow as well as flights from St. Petersburg to London, Stockholm, Tashkent and 112 other destinations. For air passengers throughout the for- ' mer Soviet republics, the big problem is that few of the Babyflots are as safe or pas- senger-friendly as Pulkovo Air. But be- cause most of the Babyflots, including Pul- kovo Air, continue using the Aeroflot trademark on their planes and at ticket of- fices, it is all but impossible to know which airline you are really flying. The U.S. State Department recently is- sued a blanket warning that all U.S. gov- ernment personnel should try to avoid fly- ing all domestic airlines inside Russia. The warning incensed Russians and is expect- ed to make travel in the vast country much harder for U.S. employees. “T talk to friends and other people in different places who are very much afraid of flying with Aeroflot,” laments Pulkovo’s operations director, Nikolai Kolesov. “You have to understand the situation: that these are all different companies.” Just be glad you aren't flying Tolchikis- ton Airlines. Tolchikiston is the Babyflot that gets to fly to the dicey regional town of Khorog in the ex-Soviet republic of Tajikistan, which has been roiled by civil conflicts. After a Tolchikiston crash at the end of ines have sprung up, and so have crash statistics the Khorog runway last August, authori- ties found the YAK-40 prop plane jammed with 81 passengers and five crew mem- bers — 42 more than the plane’s limit. All but six aboard died. “The plane was overloaded by more than 3 metric tons, the crew being threat- ened at gunpoint by members of a fighting group,” said an official report on the ac- cident. At last count, 286 Babyflots were oper- ating with varying degrees of reliability across the face of Russia. An additional 74 were flying in the Baltics, Central Asia and other former Soviet republics. The only splinter that survives with the formal name Aeroflot is Russia’s Moscow-based international airline. Last year’s Tolchikston crash was one of six Babyflot crashes in 1992 and 1993 in which investigators found the planes were grossly overloaded on takeoff. ae Last Sept. 25, crew members of an overloaded Rostvertop AN-12 cargo flight realized the plane was running near empty” while on a flight over Western Siberia. Ee they also realized that if they landed at - their designated alternate airport, they . , would have to pay for fuel in cash. “s The crew decided to press on — and |* nearly made it. is “All the engines cut at the descent bet, cause of the complete burnout of fuel,” the: accident report said. “The crew made ae f forced landing off the airport.” The six crew members and the plane’s one passen¢, ger survived. rd Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 29, 1994 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Is ‘Skeleton No. 4’ Nicholas IT? Bi-czar scenario: Officials seek proof that bones are those of exiled leader and not the family chef By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS t. Petersburg — Only a few hundred yards from a sandy pit dug for beach volleyball lies the burial ground for the bones of a murdered czar. Here’s the problem: Are they _ really his bones — or those of his cook? The lack of certainty is vexing churchmen and has criminologists working overtime. The Russian Orthodox Church has been waiting for months to perform the solemn . reinterment of Czar Nicholas II, who was executed with his family in 1918. Given even the slightest possibility that authorities might be putting the remains of a cook — even a chef — in the same ground that holds Peter the Great, the Church has decided to wait, while the exhumed body of the czar’s brother is examined for a genetic match. “TIT am 99.8 percent sure it is Nicholas, but we are called on to be 100 percent certain,” said criminologist Andrei Kovalyev, one of five Russian forensic experts summoned by the Kremlin and the Church hierarchy to identify the remains. He said lingering uncertainty involves the identity of “Skeleton No. 4,” one of nine acid-charred skeletons recovered from a mass grave in a Siberian meadow that had been located in 1991 on the basis of one executioner’s long- secreted memory. “We know that Nicholas was about 50 when he died, and we know that Cook Kharitonov was also about 50,”’ said the criminologist. ‘‘Skeleton No. 4 at the present moment could belong to Nicholas, or it could belong to Kharitonov.” *““Cook Kharitonov,” as he was known, was among at least 13. royal retainers who accompanied the abdicated czar and his family in 1917 on a train DAVID TULIS / Staff Tourists view royal tombs in the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, near the Goodwill Games beach volleyball site. ride into exile in Siberia, where the Romanovs passed their final year as pampered prisoners. Nicholas recorded in his diary that Kharitonov taught his daughters how to cook. “In the evening they knead flour and in the morning bake the bread,” Nicholas wrote in June 1918. “Not bad.” On a July night in 1918, a Bolshevik secret police detachment tricked the family into lining up inside a room for a photograph. Opening fire from a doorway, the dozen Bolshevik executioners killed 11 people — the czar, the czarina, their five children, the cook and three other family retainers. The mass grave yielded only nine of the 11 victims, and a search continues near the Siberian city Yekaterinburg for two other bodies thought to be the two youngest Romanov children, presumably including the daughter Anastasia. Early last year, government and Church authorities began planning a high-profile burial ceremony for the slain Romanov family near the tomb of Peter the Great. The designated burial place — under the stone floor of the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul — is a few hundred yards from the site of this week’s Goodwill Games beach volleyball court. But month after month, the Romanov reburial has been put off without explanation. Finally two weeks ago, the church took the unprecedented step of approving the exhumation of the late czar’s closest relative for DNA comparisons. If the tests are conclusive, the reburial will probably take place next spring, said Natalia Dementieva, the historian in charge of overseeing the cathedral inside the Peter and Paul Fortress. ‘‘Formally, the decision is in the hands of a government commission, but in fact it’s 70 percent up to the church,” she said. A few weeks ago, forensic specialist Kovalyev and a half- dozen other commission experts dug up the floor of the cathedral and unsealed the sarcophagus where Grand Duke Georgi Alexandrovich, the last czar’s 21- year-old younger brother, had been buried. The sickly heir apparent had died in 1899 of tuberculosis. Georgi’s skull and skeleton have been moved to the morgue of St. Petersburg’s Kirov Academy of Military Medicine, where Kovalyev took X-rays of the jaw to compare the dental work with that found in “Skeleton No. 4.” Two of Georgi’s leg bones were then transported to a Russian Health Ministry genetic laboratory in Moscow so that samples of the grand duke’s DNA genetic code could be compared with samples from the body assumed to be Nicholas’. Georgi’s bones are expected to be reburied in August. Last July, British geneticists found positive indications in DNA tests that Czarina Alexandra’s skeleton was indeed among the nine tangled bodies recovered in 1991 from a mass grave in the woods near the execution site in Yekaterinburg. The genetic code of the body assumed to be Alexandra’s was found to match almost exactly with a blood sample contributed by Britain’s Prince Philip, whose grandmother was the czarina’s sister. But according to Kovalyev, there was no clear-cut match . between the DNA of Nicholas’ presumed skeleton and a sample contributed from one of Nicholas’ present-day descendants, Princess Sheremetovo. “At the moment of exhumation, I put it at 50-50 whether Skeleton No. 4 belonged to Nicholas,”’ said Kovalyev. ‘“‘Now, because of what we have learned from dental X-rayson | Georgi’s jaw, I am inclined more and more to believe Skeleton 4 is Nicholas. But we are just at the beginning of our work.”’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 29, 1994 \f"

Catherine Palace embodies the pride and vanity of this minor German princess who at 32 grabbed the Russian throne after conspiring in the palace coup that killed her husband, Czar Pe- ter III. Catherine’s glittering throne | room is 150 feet long, almost big aes to hold an Olympic-size pool. Down the hall is her silk-upholstered Chinese blue drawing room. There are three outrageously fancy dining rooms and her picture hall with its 130 Europeap canvases hung floor-to-ceiling. This was her summer pad; for cooler weather she maintained at least six other palaces. Catherine ruled from 1762 to 1796, adding to Russian territory through military conquest while also exchanging intellectual cor- respondence with the French writer Voltaire. Meanwhile, her famous courtier, Grigory Potem- kin, shielded her from the pover- ty around her by devising porta- ble “Potemkin villages” for her to observe during her regal tours between her palaces. About a mile away you can glimpse Nicholas Palace, in which Catherine’s great-great- great grandson, Czar Nicholas II, was held prisoner after he abdi- cated in 1917, thus ending the Romanoff dynasty.

        "ocr_text": "Empty seats, low ratings mar 1st half False impression: Lack of crowds makes Games look insignificant to U.S. viewers, but Russians pleased with city’s showing. By Joe Drape and Joe Albright STAFF WRITERS t. Petersburg — Halfway through these Goodwill Games, the most important competition occurs each day at a 9 a.m. organizers meeting, where Goodwill president Jack Kelly urges, pleads, politely demands of his Russian counterparts: “You got to put fannies in the seats.” Call it Turner Enterprises vs. Russian Culture. The ultimate American judge says Turner Broadcasting System, owner of the Games, is getting killed. Television ratings imply that despite growing crowds and some attractive competitions coming — like figure skating and gymnastics - early empty seats have given U.S. viewers the impression that the Games aren’t significant. The Russian judges — local organizers and people on the street — claim the sparse crowds don’t reflect the spiritual and publicity boost the Goodwill Games is giving this ancient Russian city. Big crowds aren’t important to them. The lasting legacies are new roads, cleaner buildings, decent stadiums, and an international television debut as a re- christened St. Petersburg. So Russians have gotten much of what they sought from the Games — and a week’s worth of Sport Promotion 101. Goodwill executives will suffer the most, however, for a flawed ticketing strategy and a tendency toward procrastination. The Goodwill Games lost a Saturday of swimming, and perhaps television ratings, because the Army Sports Club pool was a forbidding Gatorade green. The ratings were considerably lower than the 1990 Games. At all 11 venues, substantial improvements were unfinished until the final days. ‘We wasted time till the very last moment. There was a lot of administrative chaos,” concedes Mikhail Bobrov, honorary chairman of the volunteer effort. Vladimir Gronsky, deputy editor-in- chief of the Nevskoe Vremya (Nevsky Time) here, says actual work on restoring DAVID TULIS / Staff Russians watch beach volleyball, one of few sports that has drawn well. stadiums and repairing roads didn’t actually start until a few months ago. “But it’s nothing to be really worried about. My viewpoint is that the city is meeting guests as we [do] when we expect guests to our apartment. We start cleaning it a few hours before their arrival,” says Gronsky. Most logistical problems have passed now, leaving attendance as the the only chronic worry. Russian officials have responded to Kelly’s pleas for bodies by holding lotteries, giving free passes to war veterans, junior athletes and survivors of the Siege of Leningrad. They’ve handed out awards for the “nicest lady” spectators and youngest attendees, and on Friday, somehow managed to find the 200,000th ticket buyer in a land without turnstiles. The St. Petersburg Organizing Committee keeps all ticket revenues earned from the Games, and from the beginning set a price structure aimed at rich foreigners. They were after hard currency, not the weak rubles of the home crowd. The city began the Games with the intention of selling 80,000 tickets to foreigners — even though they have Western-style hotel space for only a few thousand. _ Howclose organizers came to their mark is unknown. In fact, the whole ticket count has been a mystery. Numbers often fluctuate, and tickets used are often equated with tickets bought. Organizers also failed to use St. Petersburg’s well-established network of ticket kiosks that supply seats for opera, ballet and other events. “We forgot about our street ticket vendors. They are convenient to people,” Bobrov said. A day wandering the Southwest District outside central St. Petersburg found few promotional signs touting the Games — at subway kiosks and stores in the suburbs, no one could be found who knew where to buy Games tickets. Even in the central city, in the post office, no information was available. But even promotion may not be the point. There is virtually no discretionary income here, and the future is uncertain so little is spent on frills. “We have no middle class here, as you have in America. Probably that’s why the stadiums are nearly empty,” said Anatoly Groshev, 46, a movie operator. A Russian worker pulls down only $90 a month, or one-twentieth of what the average production worker in metro Atlanta earned last year. The cost of a figure-skating ticket, a beer, a soft drink, a small popcorn and a T-shirt is the equivalent of an Atlantan spending $273 for a Braves game. “Life is so difficult for us, that’s why we can’t do anything. Every week the prices go up and up, and the wages are too low,” says Galina Ivanova, a 32-year-old computer operator who was priced out of the Games. So why didn’t Goodwill executives step in, especially after they had attendance problems and similar headaches during the 1986 Moscow edition of the Goodwill Games? 82 drink, rel oomedarane’™ the same as asking an Atlanta worker to’ ° 73 for the result ‘ Ei reatacnmerae: “What they didn’t want, and we non couldn’t do, is come in and tell them what ‘ to do.

        "ocr_text": "By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS t. Petersburg — For a fare of 7.5 cents, sports fans can ride practically to the doorstep of most Goodwill Games sites via speedy, traffic-free routes. Smatterings of art, history and science are tossed in for free, sprinkled with leftover communist propaganda. It is not a special transport service set up to whisk visitors to the international games. It’s the 39-year-old public metro system, one of the few unassailable legacies of the bygone communist era. Unlike any underground train network in the world, the stations in Russia’s major - subway systems here and in Moscow are miniature museums, heralding poets, cosmonauts and ancient warriors. Their mosaics or friezes proclaim, too, the collective heroism of average people who simply managed to endure the matrix of war and tyranny that is Russia’s history. The subways also remain amazingly cheap. They are clean and in relatively good working order, considering the millions of people they carry every day. If communism had done so well above ground, the hammer and sickle might still be flying. The Petersburgskiy Metropoliten is extensive enough that it gets passengers to within walking distance of seven of 11 venues where Goodwill athletes are competing. Of the rest, all but the triathalon site can be reached by transferring from subway to bus or trolley lines. That is the point of the system: transporting the most riders to places where people congregate most, from downtown offices to outlying apartments to sports stadiums and train stations. It is a notion that was integral to communist ideology, which aimed to guarantee a rock-bottom standard of living for everybody, but not much more. Cars, in contrast, were spartan and few. In this city just short of 5 million people, for example, the daily subway ridership still averages 3 million, according to Vladimir Lysenkov, first deputy director general of the Petersburgskiy Metropoliten. Trains ride on 56 miles of underground rails, which means each car packs a lot of passengers. Trains carry about 53,000 per mile each day. Paris, with 300 miles of rail, carries about 15,000 passengers per mile each day. The St. Petersburg system is closer in expanse to that of Atlanta, which will be tested during the 1996 Olympics — but which in May carried only 223,000 MARCIA KUNSTEL / Special Efficient subways a monument to communist era passengers each weekday, or 5,868 passengers per mile. The daily per-mile load of St. Petersburg subways is nearly 10 times that of Atlanta, producing crushes of bodies in stations. In a 20-year-old Soviet travel guide, author Pavel Kann relates how Czar Alexander I in the early 1800s rejected the bold proposal of one Citizen Torgovanov to build an underground tunnel to link pieces of this multi-island city. The man was ordered to pledge, in writing, to abandon such “hare-brained schemes,” he wrote. Others proposed the idea, but they too were ignored. Merchants feared the construction would disrupt their trade, landlords complained the underground traffic would undermine their buildings’ foundations and the powerful clergy claimed underground passages would violate the dignity of nearby churches. It was left to the communists to provide for the general population, a generation after ruthlessly sweeping away merchants, landlords and clergy. Among unique building problems was the need to bridge the Neva River where it runs underground and other subterranean water. So some stations are exceptionally deep, requiring long, steep escalator rides that may run a tad fast for the uninitiated. Now the old communist system has collapsed, and the days of largesse toward public works are over. In 1992, financial responsibility for the subway system was shifted from the national government to the city of St. Petersburg. Fares seem absurdly low to ; Westerners — 150 rubles (7.5 cents) here and 100 rubles (about 5 cents) in Moscow. But they look exorbitant to Russians, whio remember when the fare was less than a ruble just a few years back. Rampant inflation and the dropping value of the ruble are partly to blame. But the real cost to riders also has gone up during the two years of city control. The city formerly subsidized 70 ~', percent of the cost foreach paying . passenger, Lysenkov said, but now it ‘tah only afford 50 percent. That has meant fare increases. Yet the city has not abandoned the ‘old obligation to help the helpless. It turns‘out that only about half those 3 million ©» passengers pay to ride. Pensioners, war veterans, invalids, soldiers, survivors the Nazi siege of World War II — all ride ‘for free. “Tf all passengers paid 150 rubles, thén we would break even,” Lysenkov said, . envisioning the metro far removed from the communist dream, a metro that weed pay for itself.

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT St. Petersburg — Cruising down the rivers and canals that spider-web the city gives a new perspective on life in this Venice of the north. From the broad Neva River that threatens to one day engulf the city, to the placid Griboyedov Canal, the scen- ery rolling past offers intimate views of St. Petersburg and how it works. Along the Neva sit some of the city’s most magnificent attractions —- the ba- roque Winter Palace, red Rostral Col- umns with replicas of ship prows, the Bronze Horseman statue sitting in the square where Decembrist revolutionar- ies were executed, The river level gives a close-up view of the drawbridges that emphasize how dependent this city remains on water traffic. In the middle of the night, every night, the bridges go up to let ships haul their goods in and out of the city on the Neva. The smaller rivers and canals flow through the microcosm of life. As the Fontanka River passes the Summer Garden, elderly babushkas can be spotted on secluded benches day- dreaming. Young mothers wheel their babies. Kids roll up their pants to wade along the bank, unmindful of the pollu- tion that infects all these waters. It’s a quiet, peaceful way to view St. Petersburg without the bother of nox- ious bus fumes or sometimes-heavy pe- destrian traffic. The most popular canal trips start off from the Anichkov Bridge off Neva Prospect. They last about an hour and cost about $7.

        "ocr_text": "Communist breakup puts island on map Secret’s out: Russia’s naval base at Kronstadt was off limits for many years under Soviet rule. Now there are plans to make it a magnet for affluent tourists. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS ronstadt °4aval Base — In the hazy distanc: along this week’s yachting courses at the Goodwill Games, you can see the shadow of this island, and on it a tall church spire. Only a few years ago, Kronstadt Island was invisible — inaccessible by sea, absent from official maps and from history books. As late as 1990, an official tour book map shows blue sea where Kronstadt Island should be. A combination of security and shame has - been responsible for Kronstadt Island’s reclusiveness, making it off limits except for an occasional foreign dignitary and a trickle of KGB-approved Russians from the mainland. Though some tour groups were admitted during the last few years, access to the island and its 291-year-old navy fortress remains restricted. Under the communists, the Kronstadt submarine base was considered too secret to appear on maps. And the uprising that erupted here in 1921 against the first Soviet leader, Vladimir Lenin, was far too embarrassing to discuss. But if President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian navy stay on course, Kronstadt could become a 21st-century port and watering hole for affluent foreign visitors — complete with new hotels, dry dock, foreign banks and a luxury yacht club. Kronstadt is lobbying Moscow to turn the island into a “free economic zone” in the mouth of St. Petersburg harbor. “Naturally, a lot of problems arise from this plan because Kronstadt has been a closed city for more than 100 years,” said First Captain [Viktor Surikov, the town ad- ministrator. “ DAVID TULIS / Staff Savannah’s Eric Oetgen (right) races toward finish line earlier this week, along with Canada’s Richard Clark (left) and Russia’s Michael Apukhtin. Oetgen was sec- ond in the Finn class through Thursday. Surikov sketches out an economic “free zone” that would share the skinny, 7.5-mile- long island with the navy’s existing dry dock and training operation. Customs duties and perhaps other taxes would be set lower than in the rest of Russia in order to stimulate international trade. Though there is now a road to Kronstadt across a partly finished dam, Surikov says Kronstadters are determined to keep the island closed to Russian mainlanders unless they have a special reason to visit. However, “hard-currency” tourists would be welcome. “We had a referendum here in 1991, and 95 percent voted to keep it a closed city,” says Surikov, whose town is formally a subdivision of St. Petersburg. ‘We have our own local sausage factory, our own milk factory, and everything is quiet here.” The navy has approved the zone plan in principle, even though Kronstadt is still a functioning base. “Why should I object to the zone as such if it is of use to the people?” re- marked Adm. Felix Gromov, commander-in- chief of the Russian navy. Czar Peter the Great created a naval fortification here in 1703. It now has a population of 10,000 sailors and 50,000 civilians, all of them dependents or workers in the navy’s infrastructure. The Kronstadt garrison was crucial during the Russian revolution. But for decades, Russian schoolchildren learned only part of the story: how 5,000 Kronstadt oo sneaked into St. Petersburg and { hélped capture the Winter Palace in October 1917, sealing the communist takeover. What Soviet history books never candidly discussed was the mutiny four years later by an even larger contingent of Kronstadt sailors, who broke with the Bolsheviks in 1921 during the hunger of Russia’s civil war. After hearing that Lenin’s Bolsheviks were firing on strikers on the mainland, about 12,000 sailors and infantrymen at Kronstadt took up guns to defend the island. They appealed to the nation and the army for support against Lenin. If the mutineers had waited until summer, they might have succeeded. But it was March, and 50,000 Red army troops managed to attack across the ice. Following machine-gun battles and hand- to-hand combat, the Kronstadt mutiny was smashed. Lenin’s forces slaughtered several hundred prisoners, and on his orders the survivors were imprisoned in Arctic concentration camps. Only last January were the Kronstadt mutineers rehabilitated. It happened when Yeltsin ordered a memorial to be erected in Kronstadt in memory of the “victims” of what he called illegal repression by the Bolsheviks. Poet Ivan Yermolayev, 95, the one known surviving mutineer, received a telegram from Yeltsin saluting him for enduring a “war unleashed by the totalitarian regime against the people of Russia.”” Two months after his rehabilitation, Yermolayev died at his home 600 miles scutheast of St. Petersburg.

Petersburg — The boss of this city’s 30,000-member Communist Party recently strolled past the palace that once . housed the museum dedicated to Vladimir Lenin. In front, a strange, bulbous object loomed atop a pedestal — a 1994 Ford Mondeo sedan, slathered with a fake marble coating to give it a sculpted look. “Tt is one more mockery of our history,” mourned Nina Andreyeva. “That little car is absolutely pointless and doesn’t match the place. It is total stupidity, that’s all.” For the past 15 days, Goodwill Games visitors have had a small taste of post-Soviet Russia, a sometimes discombobulated place where the communist system has died, but the next system has yet to replace it. For Russians, the confusion runs deeper than dirty swimming pools and iceless rinks, down to the most intimate question a society can pose to itself: Who are your heroes and what are your symbols? Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 6, 1994 JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Staff Goodwill not felt by Lenin loyalists The answers can be dizzying: > In 1991, the masses stormed the polls to take Lenin’s name off the city stationery. Yet the convention center here is called LenExpo, and the tourist port building has “Leningrad” in large letters on top. A small replica of the Statue of Liberty stands nearby. > The Goodwill Games has for its mascot a fuzzy white cat named Petya, for Peter the Great, the 18th-century founder of St. Petersburg. Just-married couples trek from the marriage license office to the westward- - looking Peter the Bronze, and there toast themselves. The city has consciously sought to revive traditional naval symbols in lieu of communist ones. And yet Lenin’s visage can still be found on the Admiralty building, and last month sailors celebrated Navy Day by waving a flag that still bore the hammer-and-sickle. > New heroes are at a premium. This week, a small church held a memorial service for a young navy officer who in 1975 led a mutiny aboard a missile frigate, protesting the totalitarianism of the Brezhnev era. The name of Capt. Valery Mikhaylovich Sablin has barely been breathed here for nearly 20 years. And then, of course, there is the tribute to Henry Ford. The car sculpture had been whipped up by a pop artist in collaboration with Ford’s headquarters in Germany. The city’s Ford dealer donated it to the new portrait gallery that replaced the Lenin exhibit. The Ford replaced the near-sacred armored car on which Lenin stood in 1917 and proclaimed, “Long live the socialist revolution!” And for the past two weeks, the whole of St. Petersburg has been a monument to another American capitalist: Ted Turner, founder of the Goodwill Games, The Games, as much as anything else, are the city’s venture into a capitalistic, tourist-based economy. And they haven't resonated well with die-hards. “Tt is like a banquet in the time of a plague,” thundered Andreyeva, the ‘Bolshevik leader. “When everything is falling apart in our country, our former Communist Party members like (St. Petersburg mayor Anatoly] Sobchak are staging one more entertainment event, one more show, and they are doing it at the expense of our poorest, our most suffering people, the pensioners.” What, she is asked, would her hero Lenin think if he could see today’s Russia? “He would say our current leaders are behaving like traitors to the working people,” she replies. And so she toils on in the struggle to produce October Revolution, Part II, in a city that’s rapidly filling up with advertisements for Marlboros and Snickers. \f"

It was all very fortunate.’ By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau MOSCOW — A 28-year-old Texas entrepreneur has divulged how he fled from Siberia one step ahead of Russian security agents last winter, leaving behind 10 tons of lilac-colored gems from which he hoped to make his first million. “T escaped after I learned that there was a warrant issued for my arrest in the city of Bratsk,” said James Woods, president of the Dallas-based Texas-Siberian Trad- ing Co, “I am a small businessman, so I am bankrupted by this.” Reached by telephone in Dal- las, Woods said he was in Bratsk on Jan. 29 seeking export permits for a stranded shipping container full of his raw gems. That’s when he says he heard from Russian contacts that Ministry of Interior militiamen were knocking on friends’ doors trying to find him. “] heard they were waiting for me to board the flight leaving Bratsk to Moscow,” he said. “When I found out that they were going to do this, I bought a ticket from Bratsk to Irkutsk at 8 o’clock in the morning. “I got to Irkutsk about 9 o'clock; I got an 11:30 flight from Irkutsk to Moscow. At Shereme- tovo (the Moscow international airport) there was a KLM flight leaving for Houston in five min- ‘utes. I got a ticket; I rushed through customs. I got out of Russia. It was all very fortunate.” At first Russian authorities ' said nothing. Then on April 14, the ‘Federal Counterintelligence Ser- ‘vice — the domestic arm of the former KGB — made the Woods case public in a meeting with Rus- sian reporters in Irkutsk. Gen. Valery Shostak charged that Woods had tried to “smuggle” out $1.2 million of rare semipre- cious stones, according to a report in the local Evening Irkutsk news- paper. The paper said that “in the view of the Irkutsk FSK staff, their greatest accomplishment (against foreign agents and smugglers) was putting a stop to the activities of the U.S. Citizen James Eric Woods of Dallas, Texas.” It reported — erroneously — that Woods had been arrested. _ This outraged Woods almost -as much as leaving behind his 'violet-tinged nest egg. Now he says he is working to gather ' American businessmen burned in ' Russian deals to file a class-action suit aimed at winning a financial payback, Foreign newspapers and the U.S. Embassy failed to pick up on Woods’ story from the Irkutsk media, even though one Russian national newspaper — Business World — carried an intriguing fol- lowup account on April 28. “Besides collecting gems and semiprecious stones, Woods also collected classified information on the stocks and prospects of devel- oping mineral resources in Sibe- ria,” wrote the paper’s Irkutsk correspondent, Anatoly Malyshev. He said by phone last week that he based his story on the counterin- telligence service’s news confer- ence in Irkutsk. From his home in Dallas, Woods said his Siberian venture grew out of friendships he formed in 1989 with visiting Russians dur- ing his last year at the University of Texas in Austin. The Russians, who were from the State Universi- ty of Irkutsk, were in Austin on a student exchange project. “T kept in contact with them,” said Woods. “I came to Siberia as a businessman in March 1991. They made the contacts, and that is how it all got started. At the time I did not speak Russian, but I learned it. Except for some short trips back to the United States, I lived in Russia for the next three years.” Irkutsk, a two-fisted Siberian DrOVINCla NenN in th midst of a precious minerals boom. It centered around a unique violet- colored rare earth mineral called charoit, which had been recently discovered near Lake Baikal dur- ing the construction of the Baikal- to-Amur Railroad. Nine months after Woods turned up in Russia, the Irkutsk regional governor ordered a ban in charoit mining, on grounds that a mining expedition had grabbed up 50 tons of stones and sold them to “black-market profiteers” at give- away prices. Charoit mining reopened a month later but only after Irkutsk province imposed a licensing sys- tem. Sometime after that, Woods and a Russian partner obtained what he calls “a monopoly contract for this stone.” He says over the next few years he shelled out $35,000 to buy 10 tons of charoit, as well as about 400 pounds of quartz crys- tals and 400 pounds of other semi- precious stones. Meanwhile, he struck a deal with a California- based jewelry factory, which agreed to make curios out of the stones at its factory in Asia. Woods also shifted operations to the near- by Siberian city of Bratsk. “Spheres, eggs, bear shapes — it's a trend in America,” Woods explained. “We were going to work them and sell them in Ameri- ca and divide profit.” Palm Beach Post - August 21, 1994 \f"

And so the nine-day operation began at the Totsk Test Range on Friday. ! A few years ago, the two divisions faced each other with hair-trigger in- tensity across the border separating East and West Germany. The transition from foe to friend has gone smoothly. “T haven't felt threatened at all,” said 2d Lt.

Christopher Sharp, 19, of Tampa. “T was there for three hour's.” The exercise is taking place at a des- olate army base 800 miles southeast of Moscow, which in 1954 was the setting for a Soviet nuclear test that used Soviet troops as guinea pigs, An American nu- clear safety team checked the site to en- sure that U.S. troops would not be ex- posed to elevated radioactivity. “Eleven year's ago in Halle, Germa- hy, you were sitting on the border of East Germany defending against a . NATO attack,” said Col. Mike Bare- field of Ozark, Ala., addressing his Rus- sian counterpart as Russian and Amer: ican flags flapped over the desolate practice checkpoint. “At the same time, 11 years ago, I was in Kirchghoens planning the de- fense of NATO and Western Germa- ny,” said Barefield, the U.S. operations officer of Operation Peacekeeper-94. Col. Vitaly Magazov, 43, the Rus- sian operations officer, said his view of Americans has changed. ‘I was influ- enced by the way our media was por- traying the American soldiers and the American way of life,” he said.

Eddie Cox, 26, of Pitts- burgh, the problem Sunday night was what to do when an ostensibly friendly Russian rumbled up to his sentry post on a motorcycle after the mock curfew.

It could have been a ruse to break through the gates, But Cox and his watch commander de- cided that the visitor was sincere, Pulling out a photograph of his wife and children, Cox handed it to the Rus- sian, saying, “You always have a friend in America.” And the Russian em- braced him.

I won- dered why there was only one spark, and then suddenly after a couple of minutes came a horrible, powerful shock.” Dvornyov is one of the luckiest of the more than 50,000 Russian human guinea pigs who took part in history’s most horrifyingly realistic atomic experiment. He is still alive, By estimates of Russia's Committee for Special Risk Veterans, fewer than one out of 10 have survived the Sept. 14, 1954, test of how humans would react to the radiation and psychological stress of a nuclear battlefield. “Tt was barbaric, a barbaric measure, aimed at the probable destruction even of our own people,” Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev declared this week in Totsk, in the government's first high-level apology to the living victims, It happened at the crest of the Cold War, at a time when the United States had 1,400 nuclear bombs and the Soviets had only a handful.

At a collective farm four miles from the aim point, the strongest farmers and most dedicated Communists had been ordered to lie in trenches. Schoolboys like Dvornyov 11 miles away were instructed to stay outside and keep their doors and windows open. The director of the test, Soviet World War II hero Marshal Georgi Zhukov, watched from an observation tower about four miles away along with Defense Minister Nikolai Bulganin. The defense ministers of other Communist bloc states also watched, from bunkers 10 to 12 miles off. “We knew already this would be the only test [involving humans and animals], and we wanted to make it a high-quality experi- ence,” Russian army Col.

        "ocr_text": " Communists abort anti- Yeltsin strike *: Collapse signals weak opposition “* By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Miooscow — Hard-line Com- munists dropped plans Sunday to lead a general strike in Rus- Sia this fall, saying that workers are in no mood to be stirred into challenging President Boris Yeltsin’s security forces. ‘“‘We didn’t succeed in rais- ing people for a political strike,’’ conceded Russian Communist Workers’ Party chief Victor Anpilov, who four months ago made a fiery May Day speech calling for a nation- wide work stoppage aimed at driving Yeltsin from the Kremlin. **Do you think the people are ready to lie down under tanks again?’? asked Anpilov. ‘“‘We {the anti-Yeltsin opposition] don’t have tanks at the moment. When we have them, we will be- gin to speak about the struggle again.’’ As first envisioned, the gen- eral strike was supposed to bring massive street and fac- tory protests starting as early as Wednesday — the anniversa- ry of Yeltsin’s annulment of the last Soviet-era parliament last Sept. 21. The strike’s collapse sends an emphatic signal that Rus- Sia’s ultra-leftist Communist factions and its right-wing fas- cists are both too weak and dis- united to threaten Russia’s sta- bility —except perhaps by win- ning elections or resorting to terrorism. Interviewed Sunday near the Kremlin at a desultory rally of 150 of his Stalinist followers, Anpilov said Russians are terri- fied of getting involved in fur- ther violence. *‘He [Yeltsin] will shoot, and working people understand Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 19, 1994 that,’’ Anpilov said. ‘ ‘They us if we have a force to resist that, and we don’t have ee ay you know.”’”’ BAY A coal miner approached Anpilov asking what went wrong with the general He replied that organizers w : backing only in a few scatteré cities, including Ryazan “ Kostroma near Moscow. ~~ — On the nationalist flank‘ the opposition, editor Ale der Prokhanov of the news per Zavtra (Tomorrow) plans will go forward for a fort-, night of ‘‘quiet’”’ street demon strations to commemorate the, ‘“‘martyrs’’ who died when. tanks, acting on Yeltsin’s or>. ders, fired on parliament last, Oct. 4. ~jar?

Dale Miquelle, field co- ordinator of a project to save the rare cats from extinction, performs the delicate task with his Russian colleagues. The tigers are often killed, because they bring thousands of dollars. AT ea ST) Sa ge db Me aa AS Pel vheiieoce eae eon es HOWARD QUIGLEY / Special Tiger, tiger, burning out Cats of Russian outback fall prey to poachers By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Viadivostok, Russia he two poachers’ agents lifted a garbage bag from the car trunk. Stooping in a secluded clearing, they un- rolled the hide of a newly extinct Siberian tiger. The fur on the cat's belly felt as soft as whipped cream. “Four thousand dollars,” said the beefy man called Ruslan, naming his price for this appalling, illegal keep- sake from the chaos of today’s Russia. Ruslan didn’t know that the for- eigners he had casually approached in a hotel lobby were journalists. He made clear how easily the poacher’s trade is practiced, clear why the world’s biggest cats may disappear by the year 2000. These fearsome predators have become easier prey than ever. On a wood’s edge 300 miles to the north, a radio receiver caught a clear, high-pitched beep that suddenly quickened. It came from Katya’s radio collar, and it signaled she was half a mile into the forest. The big cat was on the move, maybe on the hunt. Nearby, the hoofed leg joints of an elk and a few bare bones were scat- tered along the drag path where the great Siberian had lingered several days over her last kill — gnawing, tug- ging the carcass through trees and tall grass, then eating again until the elk was devoured. All lay within shooting range of a public road. \fTigers: Wild beauties ed in hunt for cash . “To destroy all the tigers is a yery simple job. It is no prob- fe ,” said zoologist Dimitri Pi- kunov. “If we just let things be, that would mean the end to the tigers.” ' Pikunov, a scientist from the Pacific Institute of Geogra- phy in Vladivostok, made the st count of Siberian (or Amur) tigers in 1985. He found 350 of the endangered wild beauties; And today? “I’m not sure that we can find 200 tigers in the whole area,” Pikunov said. Poachers and timbering are deadly twin enemies of the Si- berian tiger. Armed human predators are proliferating in the wilder- ness, freed from old Soviet pro- hibitions against guns, travel and business. The lawlessness bleeding across Russia, along with lackadaisical enforce- ment, undermines the remain- ing restrictions against hunting and trading in endangered an- imals. - “Perhaps it’s ironic, but communism was a very good conservation tool for Siberian tigers,” said Dale Miquelle, American field director of the Siberian Tiger Ecology Project, which is trying to determine How much space and protection Siberian tigers need to survive. Marketing animal parts - The project is run by the University of Idaho’s Hor- nocker Wildlife Research Insti- Atlanta Journal-Constitution search worldwide, and is based in the heart of shrinking tiger country in the Sikhote-Alin Reserve. » The breadth of complicity in poaching frustrates Russians. and Americans trying to save the animals. . For example, game warden. Vladimir Naumenko, whose job i$ to protect animals in the Si- khote-Alin Mountains, was caught selling a tiger skin in a KGB sting operation last year. He said he killed the cat in self- defense and never considered selling it until an undercover agent offered him $5,000. ». He was fired, convicted and: put on probation. He was re- hired this spring. : And there has been no word of action against Ruslan, whose efforts to peddle a tiger pelt in Vladivostok — along with his automobile license tag — were detailed to Russian authorities five weeks ago. - The fall of the Soviet empire relaxed borders and opened up Russia’s Far East, much of which had been off-limits even to Russians. ’ The Chinese quickly found a bonanza in tiger bones and oth- er animal parts, such as bear gallbladders, reputed in tradi- tional Asian medicine to en- hance sexual potency and health. Sellers may get $10,000 per tiger. This rewarding black. market led to the illegal slaugh- ter of an estimated 50 Siberian tigers last year and 60 in 1992. Habitats at risk . At the same time poachers: are attacking the animal popu-! lation, international conglom-| erates are plundering Siberian woodlands. The South Korean firm Hyundai is clear-cutting the forest north of Vladivostok and is straining for timbering rights in the rich upper Bikin River Basin, a tiger haven. ; On a smallee scale, about local organizations have .registered as farmers in the nearby town of Terney, but most don’t farm under the new land rights. They just fell trees. Trucks piled with fresh-cut trees routinely travel the pot- holed, gravelly roads bordering the Sikhote-Alin Reserve, a 1,339-square-mile patch where timbering is prohibited. So is hunting, driving and even visit- ing on foot without permission. It is part of the network of 85 reserves known in Russian as zapovedniks, which means closed or secret areas. The Communists created many in the 1920s and 1930s to protect areas with extraordinary plant or animal wildlife. Sikhote-Alin Reserve, a land of high, wet forests and jagged cliffs on the Sea of Japan, lies in Russia’s extreme southeast, which thousands of years ago was spared the ravages of glaci- ation. It became a refuge for species unable to prevail else- where, an uncommon neighbor- hood where creatures endemic to either a southern or northern clime coexist. Tigers, widely regarded as jungle creatures, share the re- gion with brown bears and reindeer. Struggling for space But most of Russia’s tiger terrain is not protected. . “Tigers live outside the za- povednik, where people live, where people work, where peo- ple hunt, where people cut down the forest, where they farm,” said Yevgeny Smirnov, a Russian biologist who has worked in Siberia for 30 years.. “If we were to just save the 5 percent [to 10 percent] that live in the zapovedniks, we haven't - saved anything.” “The point is to figure out how big the [tiger] habitat must be. How many animals they: need for food. How much space each needs for a range without crossing another tiger,” said Bart Schleyer, 39, of Palmer, Alaska, another American working full time on the: project. The group has tranquilized. and radio-collared 10 tigers since January 1992, and seven: are being tracked. Schleyer acknowledged that residents are suspicious of the project’s work. A string of mishaps include the deaths of two bears inadver- tently trapped. One female ti- ger apparently was killed by poachers who buried her collar, but some Russians wondered whether the foreigners had a hand in her demise after the project sent her surviving cubs to a Nebraska zoo. “It’s given us a real bad name,” Schleyer said of the in- cidents. Also complicating conserva- tion efforts is more typical re- sistance among farmers whose livestock has been eaten by ti- gers or who covet the forestry jobs that conservation would restrict. ’ Tigers now may need even more space than in the past, be- cause the density of prey has grown so thin. The project’s major finding is that a male Si- berian tiger in Russia ranges over a 190-square-mile territo- ry. A female’s range is about 95 square miles. “Fifty tigers in India may be able to live in 500 square miles. And here you might get two or three tigers in 500 square miles,” said project director Miquelle. “A small encroach- ment here has ghuge remid- - September 25, 1994 (Continued) \f"

And if that change isn’t radical enough, they are even selling wigs at the one-time Soviet food market. “Whatever the store is sup- plied with, people are buying in huge amounts,” said Tatyana Ivanova, a pensioner aged 73, stashing a nearly 4-pound chunk of beef in her sack. “I myself, for example, bought this meat for 12,000 rubles ($5.45). Before 1 couldn't afford it.” This emerging stage in the life of Russia could not be more timely for Russian President Bo- ris Yeltsin, who addressed the United Nations on Monday and continues a third summit with President Clinton in Washington today.

Worries sharpened with the sudden 5.3 percent drop of the ruble’s value against the dollar last week, though the Russian currency has rebounded slightly. “Prices will go up with the dropping of the ruble, But what can we do about it? There is no ideal life anywhere,” said Valen- tina Proyava, 36, who works at a city water heating plant. But almost all of the two doz- en people interviewed said they are better off financially than they were a year ago. “We have the basics,” said Tamara Skripkina, a nurse, “We eat pretty well. We buy what we need. As to the way we dress, well, of course, we don’t buy much.” She makes a paltry 75,000 rubles ($32) a month at the public clinic, but her hus- band pulls in about 475,000 ru- bles ($206) as a factory welder — more than double his salary last year, ( Other Russians who live or labor in the working-class indus- trial sector of southeast Moscow told similar stories of making do. Yet most recounted major pur- chases in the past year. Tatyana Orlova, a polished 15-year-old in blue jeans and heels, said her factory worker parents bought both a television and refrigerator in recent months. She has no gripes. Some have done well in pri- » vate business, such as Igor Krug- lyak, 32, a worker at a private construction company who makes more money than he ever expected — the ejuivalent of $450 to $550 a month. But he hates the new economic dispari- ties, which leave some Russians unemployed or even begging i in the streets. And he is nervous about his own future. “T can afford everything now, but I don’t know what's going to happen,” Kruglyak said during a break from laying an asphalt driveway. “Elections are com- ing. Will there be a different president? Maybe the private companies will be shut down again.” Last year, shoppers’ main complaint was that salaries lagged far behind the billowing costs of even basic food such as = and eggs. Pessimism was Now, inflation has pumped up incomes as well as costs. One business newspaper recently re- ported that consumer prices rose 680 percent in the first half of this year compared with 1993. But at the same time, average per capita income jumped 730 percent and pensions 660 percent. That is the key. Russians can absorb higher prices when the average salary has risen to 235,000 rubles, or $100, a month. Last year, store director Oleg Pihzakov said he was buffeted by protests against food prices, mostly from retirees. Now com- plaints have slackened. “There is no decline in de- mand,” he said. “Old people get enough money to buy basic food products now.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 28, 1994 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Moscow's mean streets give Americans pause By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Fifteen-year-old Nicholas Platt of Memphis had been here a month when the news broke last week that anoth- er American exchange student had been discovered lying in a pool of blood outside a Moscow student dormitory. Authorities said suicide, but evidence of murder is building. “T wasn't scared, but now I sort of look over my shoulder,” said Platt, walking with a friend outside the McDonald’s on Novy Arbat Street. His school was right around the corner, but the high school junior faced a half- hour commute by subway to. reach the Russian family with which he is boarding. Along with the rest of Mos- cow's 30,000-strong American expatriate community, the young student of Russian has been forced to grapple with a question posed to him by his family: How safe is it for Americans in the tu- multuous environment of post- Soviet Moscow? “You need to take logical pre- cautions — go out in a group, don’t go, aut late at nigh,” said Laura Wilbur, 22, of houston, “My gut tells me it is still comparatively safer to live here than in many American cities,” RICHARD CONN American lawyer in Moscow studying Russian in Moscow un- der a University of Texas program. Resident American business people are adamant that the rela- tive scarcity of handguns makes * daily life less perilous in Moscow than in New York or Miami, A check of news databases shows that within the past five years, no more than three Americans have been murdered in Moscow, a city of 9 million people. Even so, the mysterious death last Tuesday of Anthony Riccio, 21, a junior from Brown University, sent a shudder through the expatriate set and left American students confused. On Sept. 20, 10 days after ar- riving in Moscow, Riccio fell or was pushed from a high balcony in a 16-story apartment building for students. Moscow police as- cribed the death to suicide, say- ing he was found with a severed rope around his neck. But a pre- liminary coroner’s report re- ceived by the U.S. Embassy said Riccio was the victim of murder. Businessman Cary Languir- and, 37, of New York, who heads the Russia office for the Certified Industries food and beverage distributors, says Moscow is “the safest big city in the world.” But to make sure, he arranges all his business appointments outside his office, which is guarded by a steel door. “You have to be careful,” he said. “Don’t flaunt what you have. Don’t drive a fancy car. You invite trouble.” David Deason, 22, of Hous- ton, lives in a dingy dormitory for foreign students about six miles from'where Riccio died. “I knew where it was OK to go in Houston. Here, I: don’t know what’s safe angl what isn’t,” said Deason, a student in the Univer- sity of Texas’ Russian studies program. Said Deason’s dormitory roommate Matt McGarrity, 21, of Colorado Springs, Colo.: “The biggest concern we have is pick- pockets — killings are between mafia gangs trying to control ter- ritory. “If you consider violent crime is mafia hits, that’s not us; we're not targets. But you do have to watch out for mafia guys. Don’t look at them the wrong way.” To lessen the chances that its employees will run into such risks, American companies like Caterpillar pay up to $5,000 a month to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Park Place, an iso- lated, high-security complex with its own grocery store and health club. The complex also rents office space to security-minded clients like Latham & Watkins, a U.S. law firm representing several in- ternational corporations. “My gut tells me it is still comparatively safer to live here than in many American cities, al- though the increase in crime during the last three years has been dramatic,” says Latham & Watkins lawyer Richard Conn.

A lawmaker Wednesday called Yeltsin an alcoholic. first time the 63-year-old president has been faced with such an accusation in an official Russian forum. In a speech to mark the opening of the . Duma’s fall session, Ilyukhin said the presi- dent’s behavior abroad had brought “the peak of shame for the Russian nation. It is our anguish.” The lawmaker based his call for an inves- tigation on two episodes, one in Germany and one in Ireland, both within the past five weeks. On Aug. 31, Russian television showed Yeltsin stumbling on the steps of Berlin’s City Hall after a champagne reception hon- oring Russian troops withdrawing from Ger- many. It also showed Yeltsin seizing a con- ductor’s baton and singing lustily to no par- ticular tune. At the time, the respected pro-reform newspaper Izvestia commented, “Those were the minutes when millions of our com- patriots felt ... extremely awkward, if not ashamed.” Last Friday, after a trip. to the United States that was free of flubs, Yeltsin failed to get off his plane during a 70-minute stopover in Shannon, Ireland — stranding the Irish prime minister, a military band and flower girls on the runway. “He suffers from high blood pressure. When a man is ill, a man is ill,” explained Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who had been scheduled to brief Yeltsin on the Northern Ireland cease-fire. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who was sent from the plane to meet Reynolds in place of Yeltsin, told Irish journalists that the Russian president was “extremely tired. He has been traveling for 17 hours.” Under the Russian system, Yeltsin has the final authority to launch Russia’s residu- al arsenal of more than 20,000 nuclear war- heads. However, Western nuclear experts think the Russian army general staff retains physical control over war communications networks and that the president has no more than veto power over the launching of nucle- ar weapons. Last November, Yeltsin acknowledged to Germany’s ARD television network that he sometimes takes a drink. But, he insisted, “I never drink so much that I get drunk.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 6, 1994 \f"

Lavers, chairman of the Connecticut- based Phibro Energy Production Inc. Lavers said his project, known as “White Nights,” as well as Conoco’s “Polar Lights” and four smaller Western-led joint ventures won exemptions under the same decree. He said it will be effective until the companies begin to show profits. Phibro opened shop in the grim Siberian city of Raduzhny in July 1991, expecting to turn a reliable profit by salvaging Russia’s mis- managed Arctic fields. Instead, its $116 million invest- ment has yielded nothing, largely because of a $5.85-per-barrel oil Grand Junction Daily Sentinel - October 14, 1994 export tax adopted by the cash- starved Russian government in January 1992, a month after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The four taxes agreed to when the former Soviet authorities approved the project in 1990 have swelled to more than a dozen under President Boris Yeltsin. Lavers said that months of com- plaints by the Western oil industry led to the creation of a Russian ministerial study commission last spring, and finally to the exemp- tion ordered by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. “We believe this creates the ground for optimism that the gov- ernment will work aggressively to create a level playing field in regards to taxation and tree the industry to resume investment in the Russian oil sector,” Lavers said. He said the Phibro joint venture’s cash flow was running about $2 per barrel in the red, largely because of the unantici- pated export tax that hits the company’s gross revenues even when there are no profits. Once the tax is lifted, he said, the cash flow should turn positive by about $3 a barrel. \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Trucks filled with rubble stream nonstop around wooden fences guarding a monumental construction project that unites the Russian church and state behind a vision from the czarist past. The rebuilding of Christ the Savior Cathedral, launched with Russian taxpayers’ money on prime real estate a quarter mile from the Kremlin, is the most visible sign today of the resurgent power of the Russian Orthodox Church. Broadly viewed, this project will resurrect a landmark of . Russia’s discarded history, a commanding national shrine to czarist glory that Josef Stalin ordered blown up on a grey December dawn in 1931. More narrowly, it advances the interests of a church that tends to autocracy and national chauvinism. It fills many Russians with reverent hope, others with consternation. ~ “Tt’s necessary for us, like air, like a toast of spirits before going into attack,’”’ wrote World War II veteran Andrei Siderov in a letter to the newspaper Moscow Komsomolets. Alexander Doronin, who stopped to talk last week outside the fence shielding dozens of busy bulldozers, wreckers and trucks, takes another view. “This idea is nonsense — to spend that much money when people are suffering in poverty,” said Doronin, 40. “I think that right after the cathedral we will need to rebuild the Tower of Babel.”’ ’ | RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH Photos by JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Staff Fs a for us, like air’: Visiting Patriarch Pavel of Serbia is helped by a young ruxtien priest during a celebration for pilgrims at a monastery north of Moscow. | | the massive cathedral, with the | addition of three underground floors, parking deck, meeting halls, religious museum, restaurants and a residence for the patriarch, who heads the Russian Orthodox Church.

President Boris Yeltsin ardently endorsed the project, and is expected to funnel federal funds to it. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov handed over the land, ordered the city’s dilapidated 34-acre swimming pool destroyed to free the original site, and appropriated at least $5 million to start the project estimated to cost $250 million to $300 million. ‘An appeal to religion’ It is the clearest example of Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 15, 1994 > \fhow Russian politicians, even Communist Party leaders, in- creasingly are embracing the church in efforts to reach a dis- content public yearning for sta- bility. “An appeal to religion [in Russia] means that one appeals to historic traditions — to na- tional roots, spiritual values, to the peoples’ genes, to something sacred that lays deeply in the peoples’ souls,” said historian Mikhail Odinstov. Politicians think this will gain them “quick and massive support,” said Odinstov, a reli- gion professor at the Presi- dent’s Academy of State’s Ser- vice which trains public admin- istrators.

He settled on the Christ the Savior Cathedral as a means to thank God for the victory. Most construction of the ca- thedral was done under Nicho- las I, who best enunciated the intertwining of church and state in Russia when he cited three pillars of his conservative, rigid regime: orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality. That meant the church, the czar and the people. Church is free again The advent of communism removed both the church and the monarchy as moorings of the Russian state. Stalin’s de- struction of Christ the Savior Cathedral not only eliminated the golden cupola that had dom- inated Moscow’s skyline, but symbolized the death of orga- nized religion as it had been practiced. Today the church again is free. Millions of Russians have returned to the bulging onion- shaped domes and shimmering icons that sustained their ances- stability in a world suddenly shaken from its 70-year course. An estimated 43 percent of | Russians call themselves Rus- sian Orthodox. In recent years the church has opened nearly 10,000 new parishes and raised the number of monasteries from 16 to 266 in an effort to re- store its former pervasive presence. Catholics, Jehovah’s Wit- nesses and other “foreign” reli- gions are permitted under Rus- sia’s new democracy, and al- though they provide unwanted competition to the Orthodox Church, none has its cultural draw or anything approaching its political clout. The city’s architectural ad- visory committee recommend- ed building a new cathedral not replicating the old siructure, but combining new ideas to re- flect more recent events shap- ing Russia’s history such as the world wars, victims of the revo- lution and of Stalin’s re- pressions. “Tt must be a tool of consoli- dation ... so this will unite peo- ple and not split them,” said Al- A construction worker in a front-end loader removes the old swimmi pool that was built on the site of the Cathedral of Christ the Savio exander Kudryavtsev. head of the committee and rector of Moscow Institute of Archi- tecture. The committee has been shut out by the mayor and the patriarch, whose offices have not even acknowledged receiv- ing its proposals, Russians like Kudryavtsev and historian Odinstov worry that the conservative church is digging an unbreakable foot- hold in the state once again, and that it endangers the developing democracy. Priests bless new govern- ment offices, meet with offi- cials, influence laws. The most radical church faction demands not only resti- tution of the throne, but of au- tocracy buttressed by a formal state church. At a recent monarchists’ convention, black-cossacked priests were the most fervent speakers. Metropolitan Joann of St. Petersburg, who openly de- fends the anti-Semitic “‘Proto- cols of the Elders of Zion,” sent a message railing against popu- lar elections and western-st,le democracy. Odinstov acknowledges the church-state linkage is a Rus- sian tradition, but does not be- lieve Russians should make :t their future. “Tf they see from our past that the symbiosis is not good, mm why should they support it?

After all, their dynasties have been intermarried for more than a century. But no. “We are trying to open her eyes most widely to today’s Rus- Sia,’”’ said Britain’s ambassador, Sir Brian Fall, disclosing a schedule for the 68-year-old queen that is long on meetings with Russia’s up-and-coming younger generation. And some of the reputed Romanov kin have a questionable lineage anyway. In the first-ever visit of a British monarch to Russia, the queen plans a telegenic stroll through Red Square after her ar- rival today to chat up the proto- typical Russian shopper outside the GUM department store. Then she’ll visit the old British Embas- sy, given to English merchants as a trading house headquarters by Czar Ivan the Terrible in the 16th Century. Romanov royal wannabes feigned indifference to being fro- zen out of the guest lists for the queen’s four-day round of recep- tions in Moscow and St. Peters- burg. The queen will be hosted by President Boris Yeltsin. *“T am here on a working ses- sion in Russia, and I don’t know if her visit will coincide with my visit,’’ sniffed Olga Nikolayeva Kulikovskaya Romanova, a Ca- nadian-raised grande dame who is arguably Queen Elizabeth’s third cousin by marriage. The self-styled Grand Duke Nikolai Alekseevich Romanov Dalysky, who claims to be a long- lost grandson of Russia’s last czar, Nicholas II (though most historians think the czar had no grandchildren), made clear that he is keeping his datebook free.

Adorned with sapphires and diamonds, the 68- year-old British monarch responded with a benign smile and a wave to the applause of 2,000 at the Bolshoi Theater. Russia’s main TV network led its evening news with a lavish seven-minute report of the arrival of the queen and her 73-year-old husband, Prince Philip, for the first-ever state visit to Russia by a British sovereign. The newscast did not mention the furor in London over a new authorized book that says Philip pushed their eldest son, Charles, into a loveless marriage to a jealous, suicidal and bulimic Diana. In Britain and the United States, the prince’s revelations upstaged his mother’s landmark visit to Russia. They even prompted a rare signal of disap- proval from Prince Philip. “T've never discussed private matters and I don’t think the queen has either. Very few members of the family have,” he told London’s Daily Telegraph in an interview published Monday before the royal couple left for Moscow. Russians seemed intrigued — not by the latest princely brouhaha in London, but by the queen’s very presence in the country where her Romanov cousin Czar Nicholas II was executed in 1918 by Bolshevik revolutionaries. “T like England and I love the queen,” said Olga Kedeshova, a 45-year-old English teacher, as she waited on a frosty evening in a crowd of 500 for a glimpse of the queen’s black Rolls-Royce.

During the next three days, Elizabeth and Philip are due to meet scores of Russian politicians, entre- preneurs and students as they tour Moscow and St. Petersburg.

While strongly supporting the three-year-old peace process — it remains a co-sponsor along with the United States — Russia at the same time is courting the region’s two most resolute foes of cooperation, its old buddies Syria and Iraq. The crux of the relationship worrying Israel and the West is sim- ple: An economically. exhausted Russia needs money.

Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyr- ev recently irritated much of the West with efforts to ease sanctions against Iraq. That would open the way for Iraq to sell oil and begin doing business again with Russia, which has lost $30 billion, by some estimates, due to the freezing of Iraq's assets and ability to conduct normal trade. That apparently is why Kozyrev, who issued appropriate plaudits to peace from the speaker's stand dur- ar ae oe if we don’t sell weapons to the Syrians, others will.

        "ocr_text": " Snow hides signs of oil damage from arctic Russia pipeline spill By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau USINSK, Russia — A wet arctic snowstorm cloaked the scene of a giant Russian oil spill Thurs- day, obliterating traces of muck on the river banks and covering the impromptu network of booms and vacuums that apparently has succeeded in localizing much of the spillage. On a bridge high over the 200-yard wide Kolva River, local newspaper editor Oleg Sultanov pointed down at the banks he said were shrouded with knee- deep smelly oil at the high point of the oil outflow from Sept. 28 to Oct 2. “Some chunks of oil flowing near the banks were 2 feet thick,” he said. But now, three weeks later, as Sultanov led the the first Western journalists to arrive for a glimpse of the river, the stench of oil was absent. All that could be seen floating were chunks of ice as the river began its winter freeze. _ Arctic winter has given the beleaguered region a respite. Once the ground temperature falls below 48 degrees, the mass of hot oil that sank into the permafrost in the fall solidifies like a lump of tar and “cannot flow, explained Gennady Zaripov, chairman of Geneco, a local environmental company supervising part of the cleanup. ~ “Maybe our luck with this accident is that it was ‘already beginning to get cold when it happened,” Zaripov said. “But in the spring, when the snow melts -and the creeks begin to flood, then the biggest danger comes.” _ — Zaripov estimated that at least 60 percent of the ae oil remains embedded in swampy land that “Borders the pipeline serving 5,000 Russian oil wells ‘OM the fringe of the Arctic Circle. Some of the spilled +e There are no foreign investors in Komineft, “Operator of the leaked pipeline. By another twist of fortune, the bulk of the oil that did flow into the Kolva in early October was subse- quently blown downstream by a heavy southwest wind into a lagoon of the tiny fishing village of Kolma. There the wind trapped the oil, making it possible for cleanup crews to contain it. Unhappily for the 350 northern natives known as Komi people, who live in Kolma, the lagoon full of oil surrounded their houses with knee-deep muck and sank their fishing boats. By the official estimate of Komineft, about 200,000 barrels of an oily emulsion escaped from the pipeline in August. Komineft says this mixture includes 100,000 barrels of salty water and 100,000 barrels of crude oil laced with highly corrosive hydrogen sulfide. If that estimate bears out, it means the spill would fill an American baseball stadium to a depth of about 16 feet with the oil-water emulsion. But that quantity is vastly smaller than the estimate cited by Deputy U.S. Energy Secretary William White earlier this week. If his statement that the spill could constitute more than 2 million barrels of oil were accurate, it would fill a baseball stadium to a depth of 160 feet and would be eight times the size of the spill when the Exxon Valdez ran aground off Alaska in 1989. Provincial bosses insisted that the oil spill is far less than a catastrophe, especially since they say that no leaked oil has reached the salmon-spawning Pechora River less than 50 miles downstream. Vyacheslav Bibikov, vice president of the Repub- lic of Komi, which lives on tax revenues from the pipeline and nearby oil fields, rejected on Thursday aid offered by the Clinton administration. “The accident pertains only to the Republic of Komi,” he told reporters. Bibikov insisted “not one fish, not one bird, not one animal has been found dead as a result of this whole incident.” a Post correspondent Marcia Kunstel contributed to this article from Moscow.

        "ocr_text": "From a trickle to a torrent As executives hesitated, Russian oil spill mushroomed into disaster Middle ground: Company officials insist they were trying to ce economic and environmental concerns. By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT sinsk, Russia — Environmental dam- age from an Arctic oil leak escalated to dire proportions only after Russian oil executives — one representing a Canadi- an-British-Russian venture — refused to shut down a pipeline when it started leaking. “Naturally, less oil would have been spilled if they had immediately listened to us and shut down the pipeline,” said Sergei Zhunyev, chief environmental inspector for the desolate oil town of Usinsk. It was Zhun- yev who reported the accident Aug. 23 after he peered out of a helicopter and saw oil bubbling uncontrollably into a remote swamp. His account — along with details given by the chief of the Western joint venture — provide the first evidence that oil company executives let a minor accident grow into an international panic. Russian authorities hid the existence of the spill until it was disclosed by the U.S. Energy Department last week. Since then, reporters have run into bureaucratic obsta- cles from local authorities as they sought to determine the extent of the accident. Had the pipeline been shut down shortly after the leaks were noticed two months ago, the Arctic river system that runs through the region almost certainly would have escaped this fall’s cascade of oil. In an interview with The Atlanta Jour- nal-Constitution, Zhunyev said the chiefs of about eight companies that ship oil through the pipeline rebuffed the closure request during a secret meeting in the town hall on either Aug. 24 or 25. The inspector said he sat in on the meet- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 2, ing while Usinsk’s acting mayor, Anatoly Zinoviev, delivered the appeal to oil men summoned to hear of a sudden outbreak of pipeline leaks. One after another, Zhunyev said, the oil men explained that a quick shutoff would harm the future production of their wells and cost the companies desperately needed revenue. Instead, the bosses agreed to pump at a slackened rate while rushing to install a line to bypass the leaky section. On Aug. 26, the companies shut down 22 of the 5,000-odd wells that contribute oil to the pipeline and slowed the pumping rate in some others. But the pipeline kept flowing, and new breaks kept popping along a 30- mile section of the pipeline. After the crippled line had been allowed to leak uncontrollably for another 10 days, a final leak occurred Sept. 5 near Palnik Shor creek. It would turn out to be the most dev- astating, even though it wasn’t the biggest spill. The next day the Russian oil executives received an order from the pipeline compa- ny to shut down their oil fields until the damaged five-mile section could be by- passed with a replacement pipe. The line reopened Sept. 16 and hasn’t leaked since. But when heavy rains swelled river trib- utaries three weeks later, two impromptu dams built to hold back the oil on Palnik Shor washed away, cascading spilled oil into Russia’s Arctic-bound river network. The total spill was in the range of 10 mil- lion gallons of oil, according to an unofficial estimate based on internal figures duced by two of the oil companies aE their own oil losses. That would be nearly ds large as the volume lost when the Exxon Valdez ran aground off the Alaskan coast in 1989, though that leak had a more immédi- ate effect on the environment since it 0c- curred in open seas. So far, the bulk of the leaked oil in nofth- ern Russia has been contained behind simi- lar makeshift dams on 11 other creeks, Yevgeny Leskin, the Russian director- general of the joint venture that is 50 per- cent owned by Gulf Canada and British Gas, acknowledged that he and other oil company representatives met at the town hall and unanimously rejected the mayor's error to shut nearby oil fields immer ately But Leskin, who runs the KomiArctigOil venture with Canadian, Scottish and Ameri- can assistants, disputed Zhunyev’s empha- sis on the supposed financial motivations. of the oil men. He said he and others were merely trying to fashion a solution that would minimize environmental harm while saving their oil fields. .* “All the representatives of the oil coni- panies talked about facing financial losses, but they did not put it on top of the list as a reason for not stopping the pipeline,” said Leskin. “That would have been inhuman and against the ecology.” * Leskin and the inspector agreed that Vladimir Anisimov, acting chief of the Rus- sian-owned Archangelsk Neftegaz compa- ny, was the chief opponent to cutting off the oil flow. By Leskin’s account, Anisimnov warned that his company’s field 75 miles to the north “will be permanently ruined” if ' the pipeline were shut for more than Gute or four days: Anisimov was described as remiidtins the acting mayor that his oil is exceptional- ly viscous and waxy. If the wells’ taps were shut even briefly, oil rising to the surface would permanently congeal inside the oil well casing, under the cooling effect of a 300-yard layer of permafrost. His only option, Anisimov reportedly warned, would be to keep his wells flowing and burn off the oil as it comes out of the eround. ahh 7 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Russian ultranationalist to include Florida on U.S. tour By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers LESNY GORODOK, Russia — Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has sparked near-riots on trips out of Moscow, will visit Florida ‘next week dur- ‘ing an Ameri- can tour already ‘provoking an- gry reactions. ~ “A main goal is to tell ‘people that all Zhirinovsk these labels — lables ‘anti-semite, fascist, extremist — ‘all these labels they pin on me are wrong,” Zhirinovsky said Wednes- ey. “T want to destroy this dis- torted image created by today’s mass media.” ‘. The USS. State Department an- nounced Tuesday that it had de- cided to grant a visa to the head of the Liberal Democratic Party. His aides said Zhirinovsky plans to visit Florida, probably Miami, as well as the previously announced destinations of San Francisco and New York. He also hopes to get to Washington. The U.S, Embassy in Moscow emphasized Wednesday that the U.S. government had no grounds to deny a visa. Several U.S. Jewish groups have condemned the deci- sion. The Conference on Soviet Jewry called on Americans to let Zhirinovsky know that “those who sow the seeds of bigotry and intol- erance are not truly welcome visi- tors to our shores.” An ethnocentric _ politician, Zhirinovsky has complained that too many Jewish people appear on Russian television. Upon arriving in Paris for a visit, he told the French government that “it’s all over for you, once you're Ameri- canized and Zionized.” Long considered a buffoon in Russian politics, Zhirinovsky and his party scored a shocking suc- cess by leading last year’s parlia- mentary elections with 23 percent of the party-based vote. Although polls show his popularity has waned since then, he lurks as a magnet that could draw disaffected Russians in the 1996 presidential elections if economic conditions worsen. On Wednesday Zhirinovsky shrugged off the potential for trou- ble during his American visit, such as the agitation that has followed him on trips to Slovenia, Bulgaria and Austria, where local officials asked him to leave after charging he stirred ill feelings or had been drunk and rowdy. This summer, demonstrators provoked him to a reckless outburst in the progres- sive Russian city Nizhny Novgo- rod, where he physically took over the mayor's office, “It's a democracy,” Zhirin- ovsky said when asked whether he was worried about demonstra- tions in the United States, “We've gotten used to people who meet us with slogans as well as people who meet us with flowers.” Zhirinovsky, who has been _ embroiled in two physical fights in parliament this year, was on good behavior Wednesday at a seminar in a northern Moscow suburb. He was trying to attract new members to his party and apparently leave a good impression before embark- ing on his U.S. trip on Sunday. During a break, Zhirinovsky said he wasn’t going to the United States on a whim, but that he had been invited by seven organiza- tions to appear at various functions around the country. The only two inviting organizations he and his aides could name immediately were the World Affairs Council in San Francisco and the Russian Orthodox Community in New York, | “Our goal is to get people acquainted with our position...{ know from my own experience that after people talk to us directly and listen to us they will leave with quite a different impression,” he said. “I want to destroy this distorted image .” He said another aim of his trip is removing “the remaining preju- dice and fears about Russians,” Palm Beach Post - November 3, 1994 \f"

        "ocr_text": "‘Mad Vlad’ could emerge as Russia’s next leader By MARCIA KUNSTEL AND JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service MOSCOW — When ultranation- alist Vladimir Zhirinovsky floated into the car-building center To- gliatti on the Volga River this summer, thousands of working people stuffed a big city square to see him. _ Just hours earlier, President Bo: ris Yeltsin had docked his river entourage at the same port, but he had been received by a typical gaggle of bureaucrats. No ordi- nary people. “Since Zhirinovsky first showed up in the political arena, his charm has faded. But the interest in him remains,” said Igor Yelisorov, a political analyst at the Togliatti newspaper Freedom Square. - “People are a little tired of his extravagancy,” Yelisorov said of Zhirinovsky, whose party won the plurality in parliamentary elec- tions there a year ago, “But we have to keep him in mind anyway, because he will be among the most outstanding figures at the upcom- ing elections.” ‘ Sometimes, in their darkest mo- ents, Russia’s increasingly dis- tarhned democrats fear that the 1996 presidential race will bring Zhirinovsky to power. If he can ‘come off as tough-minded, yet re- spectable, in his trip to the United States next week, Zhirinovsky will have edged closer to that goal. How the man the British tab- loids call “Mad Vlad” fares in Rus- sian pales must be more than a simple curiosity to the West, be- cause Zhirinovsky remains this country’s pre-eminent Russia-firs- ter, a feisty nationalist who cou- ples calls for renewed empire with anti-western diatribes.

But only: five others drew more support, including Yeltsin, who was named by only 9.6 percent of the people polled. First place went to econo- mist Grigory Yavlinsky with 10.3 percent. The biggest winner, how- ever, was nobody. Fully 22 percent said they could name no one in political life in whom they have confidence, while an even bigger 38.7 percent said the question was too difficult to answer. That suggests a lot of disaffected Russians, and it is precisely to the disaffected that Zhirinovsky would appeal if the national econo- my — and pride — slump further. Key to the 1996 election will be the yet-to-be-written law that will decide whether a plurality or ma- jority is needed to win.

By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — For five days Muscovites have been yanked back to the bad old days of mass shortages due to a sudden pinch in gasoline sup- plies that forces motorists to choose between two-hour gas lines or paying $5 a gallon. Some resident foreigners who didn’t experi- ence Communist-era shortages were among the most amazed to pay that rate. “It’s outrageous,” said lawyer Buck Wiley, 28, of Atlanta, Ga., who works in the Moscow of- fice of a London-based venture capital firm. “I paid $5 a gallon over the weekend, and now I am sitting here in line for an hour and I am reading in the newspaper that the gas crisis is over. What’s going on?” Coupled with last month’s temporary col- lapse of the ruble’s value, the unforeseen “gaso- line crisis” may signal a winter of increasing economic turmoil in a country that still has more than 25,000 nuclear warheads. Dealing with an unstable Russia could turn out to be among the most crucial tests of bipartisanship between the new Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and the Clinton administration. Since gasoline lines erupted Friday, angry fingers have wagged at a host of suspected cul- prits, from President Boris Yeltsin to the chiefs of Moscow’s big state owned oil refinery. “It’s a trick by someone to make money,” said Konstantin Voronchuk, 29, as he crept through a 75-car queue in the university district. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 10, 1994 “There must be someone in Yeltsin’s entourihs who is behind it.” In an indication that some military officer are also increasingly fed up with economic t Ur: bulence, the Defense Ministry newspaper F eC Star declared: “Tough measures are needed prevent our nationhood from the delights o say age capitalism. We can only hope that the p dent, the parliament and the government have enough strength not to be led by the tail by events.” The front-page article was signed by a R' sian Army lieutenant colonel from the Red Stir editorial staff. { This is the first time since the fall of commy- nism in December 1991 that waiting lines hayeé reappeared on a mass scale in Moscow. a Endemic queues for such essentials as sall- sage, sugar and vodka virtually disappearé¢ when Yeltsin and his team of market reformers ditched price controls in January 1992. But ove! the past nine months, Yeltsin has sidelined his free marketeers and relied more on governme: nt controls to steer the economy. At the root of the gasoline shortage is the co tinuing decline in Russian oil ane The Fuel and Energy Ministry says an 0 29 accident at the state-owned refinery servinp Moscow cut the city’s gasoline supplies by 3 percent. But most newspapers dismissed this of- ficial explanation — some insisting that refiner: ies elsewhere in Russia would have rushed to fill the gap except that the mayor of Moscow mayg insisted on holding down prices at government stations to around 52 cents a gallon. As supplies dwindled and lines multiplied over the weekend, some private stations jumpec prices to $5.30 a gallon for high-test. At that rafe, 10 gallons would cost a typical Russian factory worker three weeks’ sale t \f"

Then in 1989, the shocks started. First, Pepsi’s blue chip business partner — the Sovie: Union itself — slid toward bankruptcy.

It was an indicator that Coca- Cola’s big-stakes bet on a peril- ous, enormously tempting mega market here is paying off with rapid gains on its entrenched rival - Pepsi. “The Kremlin is one of our customers,” said Michael O’Neill, Coca-Cola’s regional manager for Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Moldova, diplomatically under- stating what was clearly a coup in the fierce cola competition being waged across Russia’s 11 times zones. f The prize is 150 million Rus- sians as potential consumers, many now holding significant dis- cretionary income for the first. time. “The opportunity is fabulous,” ~ said O’Neill, a former Irish diplo-~- mat, speaking of the low rates of soft drink consumption here. - Every hour, 6,000 2-liter bot-~ tles roll down the production line - at Coke’s new red-and-white fac: tory on Moscow’s southern out- skirts.

        "ocr_text": "Russians hit with visa fee But U.S. Embassy vows faster service with a smile @y Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT “fg oscow — Already bat- tered by complaints of rude and limited service, the U.S. Embassy announced Wednesday that it will levy an unrefundable, $20 fee on Rus- sians seeking visas to visit the United States. ‘ On the bright side, U.S. Am- bassador Thomas Pickering also anounced new “express” ser- vice-and promised training to combat charges that embassy workers offer surly service. The new application fee, which goes into effect today, was mandated by Congress to offset the costs of automation. The amount is equal to about a week’s wages for the average Russian. >*'“If Thad a choice, frankly, my choice would be to collect no fees,” Pickering said. , i The timing of the surcharge could hardly have been worse. ‘For months Russians have Griticized the U.S. Embassy for a high rate of visa rejections, for ‘poorly accommodating lines that linger for hours and for asking very personal questions about ‘applicants’ incomes and families. + On top of all that, many Rus- sians have complained, the con- sular staff is rude. '. The rejection of about 20 per- cent of 133,000 applicants last ‘year was due largely to efforts to Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 1, 1994 weed out Russians wanting to live permanently — and illegally — in the United States, the am- bassador said. About 10 percent to 15 per- cent of Russians overstay their visas. “It is a human right to visit the United States, but not a hu-. man right to immigrate,” Picker- ing said. Efforts to discern between those with legal and illegal inten- tions have resulted in notorious rejections, including performing artists invited to appear in Amer- ica and Russians wishing to trav- el to a funeral. In a recent controversy, ul- tranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has called the United States an “empire of evil,” was granted a visa while a chemistry professor was denied one. Such accounts have spurred temporary boycott of visits to America by members of the Rus- sian Parliament and have fed a growing mood of anti-Ameri- canism. “T am not interested in having the United States portrayed as an ugly, Soviet-style bureaucracy,” Pickering said. He outlined ef- forts to ease the visa logjam: > As of today, American busi- nesses may sponsor Russian em- ployees or guests and apply for them through the embassy’s commercial section. Thus they can avoid the ap- plication line winding outside the embassy every day that stops ac- cepting new applicants at 10 a.m. > Also, one person now may handle all the applications for a group, and designated travel agencies may apply for visas for their clients. > An express line will be set up for certain applicants, includ- ing those who have received a visa in the past. Pickering said counseling and training have been targeted at halting discourtesy, if it does exist. “It’s a complaint that con- cerns me,” he said. “In all hones- ty, I do not believe consular offi- cers call people liars.” But, he said, that may be the interpretation of applicants asked to present proof of finan- cial stability or of family ties that would draw them back home af- ter a visit abroad. \f"

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — Russian troops struck at dawn Sunday into the rugged, oil-rich republic of Chech- nya, moving into a rebellious eth- nic enclave for the first time since the Baltic invasion of 1991. Russia’s hopes for a painless victory faded as Chechens and their neighboring allies, the Ingu- shetians, sabotaged one Russian troop train and blocked a column of tanks. Four people were report- ed killed. By nightfall, a reported 40,000 Russian troops were in the region, with tank units halted in a village 16 miles north of the entrenched Chechen capital of Grozny.

Both Chechen and Russian of- ficials held out prospects of a peacemaking session today. But Russian Interior Ministry special forces were reported by the Inter- fax news agency to be preparing to assault Chechnya’s most prized strategic installation, a major oil refinery complex capable of pro- ducing 200,000 barrels of oil a day.

Itar- Tass, a Russian news agency, reported explosions near Che- chen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev’s home in north Grozny. The air raid dashed hopes of deterring an open struggle be- tween Moscow, which is trying to force Chechnya back into the Russian Federation, and rebel fighters defending the mainly Muslim region’s independence declaration of 1991. Russian fighter-bombers have repeatedly dropped bombs on the outskirts of Grozny since Moscow sent troops and tanks to Chechnya on Dec. 11 to try to crush its bid for independence. But until now, they have stopped short of an all-out assault. Russian airstrikes included a Sunday assault on a regional elec- tric generating plant. Around 3 p.m., airplanes buzzed the city and waves of concussions shook the windows. Responding to Dudayev’s of- fer late Saturday to renew talks, Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed the Chechen leader meet with Russian representa- tives to work out an immediate cease-fire. \\ Yeltsin may have been influ- enced by widespread political op- position to a show of force against Chechnya. But the proposals and counter-offers had not led to any concrete action by late Sunday, with Dudayev forces demanding a meeting “at the highest levels,” which means with Yeltsin or his prime minister. So far, the Rus- sians have rebuffed the rebels’ offer to hold peace talks here. Opposition to the anti-Che- chen campaign was likely to be inflamed by segments on Sunday night’s popular /togi television news magazine showing dozens of wounded Russian soldiers in field hospitals and grieving family and friends at an officer’s funeral. Also embarrassing to the gov- ernment were reports that Rus- sian soldiers fired on a convoy of Chechens fleeing the zone of combat, killing at least nine refu- gees. Russian wire services re- ported that tanks let at least seven cars of the convoy pass a check point, then a soldier shot the driver of one car, and troops fired on people attempting to escape from the last three cars. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Russian Lt. Gen. Valery Vostrotin stands Sunday over a Rus- sian soldier killed near Nesterovskaya, where soldiers massa- cred nine refugees Saturday.

        "ocr_text": "Bloody past drives fierce Chechen defiance By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Grozny, Russia — The Che- chens are defenseless against high-flying Russian bombers, but that didn’t worry Chechen commando Abdul Rahim Ayda- mirov last week. “We feel we can shoot them down with our‘hearts,” said Ay- damirov, watching fellow die- hards gather in broad daylight just 200 yards from the Presiden- tial Palace, the Russians’ chief target. Even after the bombs started falling, even when there were no TV cameras around, Chechens kept assembling in the mornings at ground zero so they could join arms in a mystic religious dance called the zikr, For reasons that still mystify the Russians, the Chechens again are proving they possess an in- ner resilience that makes them fight for the preservation of their ethnic identity — even at the cost of massacres of their kin. It is their damn-the-conse- quences ruthlessness that caused one Chechen artillery unit to blast away for several days this week from a firing point next to an oil storage tank. It is the same common willing- ness to die that impelled busloads of Chechen women, whose sons or husbands had died in Afghanistan or other Soviet wars, to rush to the front lines so they could stand in front of Russian tanks. This same determination was what once led Chechnya’s strongman, President Dzhokhar Dudayev, to threaten attacks on Russian nuclear plants rather than give up independence. In the Russian mind, all Che- chens form a kind of mafia. Rus- sians as mainstream as Vladimir Shumeiko, speaker of the upper house of parliament, have called for “surgical intervention” on grounds that Chechnya is “a shelter for criminals from all over the country.” The Russians are partly right: Grozny is the capital of Russia’s illegal arms trade. It also is a railroad hub. In one month last year, Russian rail- road police discovered that 700 boxcars of goods had disap- peared while passing through Grozny. Although some Chechens are getting rich on dirty money, what the Russians don’t realize is that the whole Chechen population remains committed to a long- term liberation struggle. In purely economic terms, Chechen independence could make sense — which may ex- plain why Russian President Bo- ris Yeltsin decided after three years that he could not wait for independent Chechnya to col- lapse of its own weight. The Chechens are sitting on an area smaller than Connecticut that not only is fertile but also is an oil patch. Chechnya produced 55,000 barrels of oil a day from rundown old. Soviet fields in 1993, yielding $200 million a year for Dudayev and his allies. Judging from recent oil dis- | coveries by Western geologists around the Caspian Sea about 100 miles to the east, the Che- chen homeland could yield equally rich oil finds in the 21st century. Because the Chechens are Muslims, some commentators have interpreted their implaca- ble militancy toward Moscow as an expression of fundamen- talism. But during a visit to Chech- nya last week, what seemed striking was that the Chechens’ practice of Islam is not nearly as strict as can be found in such di- verse Islamic countries as Af- ghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan or Egypt. True, vodka is illegal because of Islam, and that helps the Che- chens avoid the ignominy of alco- holism. But because Chechens have been deprived of religious indoc- trination by the Soviets since the , 1920s, most Chechen Muslims do not regularly recite the Koran or prostrate themselves toward Mec- ca. Dancing the zikr, which is said to convey a sense of religious ec- stasy, is a source of strength for some Chechens — but many oth- ers do not practice it. More crucial than religion is the Chechens’ unique history: Few ethnic minorities have risen in revolt so often, only to be crushed and rise again. In 1864, when the Russians fi- nally defeated the Chechens and their Caucasus allies in the first Caucasus War, they deported hundreds of thousands of Che- chens, Circassians and other rebel tribesman into the Ottoman Empire. Then, in 1944, Soviet leader Josef Stalin ordered 350,000 Chechens to Kazakhstan based on suspicion that they sympa- thized with the Nazi army.

The battle death of Maj. Gen. Victor Vorobyov, who com-. manded all Interior Ministry spe- cial forces in the Caucasus region, (came amid Western reports that some of Russia’s elite units have simply refused to join the battle. Some paratrooper and special forces units reportedly have balked at entering the fray in Chechnya, leaving more poorly . trained and equipped conscripts to face the tenacious Muslim rebels. Earlier, some Russian officers and troops refused to advance when civilians blocked their path. The death of the first senior Russian officer was sure to raise even more disquiet among the estimated 40,000 Interior Ministry «:: and regular army forces that have been unable to accomplish the | expected quick defeat~- of : Chechnya’s ragtag rebels.

Chechnya declared itself inde- ¢ - pendent of Russia in 1991, but bi only in mid-December did Russia «i press to reclaim the oil-endowed rebel stronghold that sits astride key Russian pipeline and railroad routes. Yeltsin late last week expressed hopes of removing reg- ular army troops from the con- flict zone soon, leaving Interior Ministry forces to take command of what the Russians character- ize as a domestic revolt. Vorobyov’s death will make that harder. “Gen. Vorobyov was the key figure in the peacemaking process,”’ an Interior Ministry spokesman told the independent Russian news agency Interfax. The general had been meeting with Chechen elders and clan leaders to urge surrender of arms. Continued attempts to negoti- ate, however, were accompanied by renewed heavy bombing despite Yeltsin’s promise to halt the air assaults devastating civil- ian life. “Russian troops have been massively shelling downtown from all types of artillery guns and rocket launchers,” Interfax reported Saturday, as apparent preparation for a renewed ground assault. Russian evening news showed flames gushing from an upper floor of the presidential palace in Grozny. The Russian Defense Ministry said Russian troops so far had killed 2,500 Chechen militants and destroyed 26 tanks, 40 armored vehicles, 60 artillery pieces and 150 warplanes. Losses on the Russian side were reported at only 41 Interior Min- istry troops and 116 soldiers from army land forces and 100 paratroopers. However, the normally reliable weekly newspaper Moscow News reported at least 1,800 Russian soldiers have been killed, a claim buttressed by daily video footage of mangled corpses. Along Lenin Prospekt, Grozny’s main boulevard, Rus- sian sniper fire was more intense than in past days, journalists returning from the city said. Some of the snipers are thought to be Russian soldiers who escaped the Chechen attacks that destroyed their armored col- umns and now are trapped in scattered buildings. The Russian government said its soldiers were successfully blocking Grozny’s streets. But Chechen defenders seemed to be holding strong, and TV cov- erage showed a bridge that had been mined by the rebels explod- ing, sending a line of Russian tanks to their doom. Chechen defenders said they still controlled most of the city and were battling the Russians at the train station, about a mile from the presidential palace. Dayton Daily News - January 8, 1995 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Chechen blood could stain Boris Yeltsin’s past, future BY MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service MOSCOW — President Boris Yeltsin begins a critical week today that will help determine whether his future and his place in history are stained by the blood from Rus- Silas assault on the rebel Chechen Republic. _ Yeltsin, who has been all but invisible since Russian troops stormed into the predominantly Muslim enclave one month ago, | faces rising pro- tests converg- ing this week in street demon- strations, a spe- cial session of parliament and criticism from abroad. As Chechen Yeltsin rebels continued Sunday to hold their capital of Grozny against Russian bombing, shelling and armor, the key politi- cal question in Moscow was wheth- er Yeltsin still had the power to pull out of this mess. Speculation is growing that Yeltsin is hostage to the hard-line leaders of the defense, interior and security ministries — the so-called ANALYSIS “force ministries’’ — that got Rus- sian troops embroiled in Chechnya. Yeltsin is indebted to these ministers for their support during the October 1993 insurrection. Yeltsin's withdrawal from public debate, the military’s apparent de- fiance of his order to stop bombing Chechnya, and the president’s his- tory of trouble with health and alcohol have combined to distance him from the democratic forces that brought him to power. Yeltsin and the Russian Security Council have rebuffed calls for a conference that would bring to- gether diverse groups to seek a peaceful resolution to the Chechn- ya crisis. “It is not too late yet to begin negotiations,” implored Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament that till the Chechnya debacle had been broad- ly supportive of Yeltsin. Like Abdulatipov, the full spec- trum of democratic leaders has peeled away from the Yeltsin’s side. Some, such as economist Gri- gory Yavlinsky, have called for his impeachment. The full extent of political disil- lusionment with Yeltsin may be made clear Wednesday when the State Duma, the broad-based lower house of parliament, is to debate the Chechen crisis in a_ special session. In what is billed as the first mass protest against Russian poli- cy in Chechnya, Russia’s biggest democratic parties and the human rights group Memorial have sched- uled a rally for Tuesday night in downtown Moscow. Yeltsin could still escape a polit- ical confrontation if the stepped-up assault on the Chechen capital Grozny succeeds and Russia begins to salve the wounds there with medical and material aid in the next few days. But the president’s position has sparked concern among Russia’s allies. A Russian delegation expected to attend the parliamentary assem- bly of the Council of Europe on Tuesday in Paris already has been warned that the continuing hostili- ties in Chechnya “‘may become a restraining element” in Russia’s application for full council member- ship, according to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass.

The cease-fire was to take ef- fect at 8 a.m. today (midnight Monday, Eastern Standard Time), but it was uncertain whether it would have any effect. The stern disarmament terms at- tached to the Russian offer would be difficult for the Che- chen rebels to accept. There was fierce fighting Monday in Grozny, with Russian troops continuing to take heavy losses even as they advanced on the presidential palace, the sym- bol of Chechnya’s independence. “J feel sorry for these 18- year-old Russian troops,” said Chechen commando Musa Ta- zulkayev, a 32-year-old physi- cian. “We let them come part way into Grozny and then we trap them and kill them, and the dogs are eating their corpses. It is a killing machine here.” forces controlled as much as two- thirds of the city. From a vantage point one mile away, reporters heard Rus- sian tank and artillery shells raining down, sometimes at in- tervals of less than 10 seconds, on the presidential palace and surrounding Freedom Square. Fresh troops arrive Russian reinforcements con- tinued to arrive. At daybreak, a large armored column backed up by fuel trucks rumbled toward the capital, evidently intent on launching a final push to capture the presidential palace and who- ever remains inside the rein- forced bomb shelter in the basement. Russian officials now claim Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev had left the bunker and the city by last weekend, Du- dayev, whose whereabouts was unclear, appeared on television Monday night to comment about the war. Technical problems dis- rupted his message. Yeltsin has sent tens of thou- sands of troops into Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region of 1.2 mil- lion people 1,000 miles south of Moscow, since the Russian offen- sive began Dec. 11. Chechnya de- clared its independence in 1991. Thousands have been killed and wounded in the fighting, and the Red Cross estimates there are 350,000 refugees. Russian advance troops re- mained under a punishing coun- terattack. One recently captured Rus- sian tank fired away at Russian positions from the city center. It bore the green Muslim flag of the self-proclaimed Chechen Re- public. (WAR IN GROZNY truce, warn The independent news agen- cy Interfax reported Russian “If they don’t throw in more troops, we'll manage fine. If they do, we will fight on somehow,” said Chechen guerrilla Lom-Ali Sosayev, 38. ‘“‘With Allah’s help, . . we will not run out of fighting spirit.” t A bearded Chechen unit com- mander, Lt. Col. Oleg Makhayev, 54, claimed the two Russian lead units were pinned down by Che- chen fire, one near the railway terminal half a mile west of the presidential palace and the other near the Kosmos movie theater a quarter-mile to the east. Another Russian unit was re- ported within 400°yards of the palace, near the central market. Outsiders join conflict The Russian government press service reported that as many as 200 irregulars from nearby Azerbaijan had arrived in Grozny to help defend the cause of their fellow Muslims. A small- er number of Ukrainians sympa- thetic to the Chechen bid for in- dependence also~ have joined their fight. In a basement bomb shelter beneath her wrecked apartment building, 81-year-old Anna As- trapova said the Russian bomb- ing of Grozny was far more in- tense than the German bombing she remembered here during World War II. “Then they bombed a few fac- tories,” she said, “but now they bomb everywhere.” “It is getting worse. It doesn’t Stop,” said Fatima Batasheva, 31, a nurse with a Muslim headwrap and a Red Cross medicine kit. “I treated 10 or 15 yesterday or maybe it was 30, one who lost an arm, one with shrapnel in the head. I have stopped counting.” The weekend bombing was too much for a 55-year-old wom- an named Valentina, a member of the Russian minority in Groz- ny. Along with four members of her family, she rushed to the bus ‘station Monday morning. But ‘there, she maintained, she was told by Chechens with guns that shé could not leave. “We tried to get out, but they wouldn’t let us,”’ said Valentina, as she lugged her suitcase home amid the din of artillery fire. As she told the story, she began crying. Despite a month of siege, the Chechen authorities have man- aged to stave off acute hunger by supplying civilians with free bread and by’ sending around trucks full of drinking water. Bomb-damaged grocery stores on Monday were being systematically looted by local block committees.

By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT rozny, Russia — The bat- G tle-blackened presidential Palace is a symbol of power and victory so craved by Russian attackers and Chechen defend- ers that, on Tuesday, neither would allow even a two-day re- spite in the fight for it. It remained the center of fighting Tuesday as both sides ig- nored a Kremlin offer of a 48- hour cease-fire to allow removal of the dead and wounded from the month-old conflict in this se- cessionist republic. By midday, from a Chechen guerrilla outpost 100 yards out- side the palace, big puffs of gray dust could be seen erupting from the fourth and fifth floors, fol- lowed in an instant by the thun- der of cannon. The nine-story building has been hit by hundreds of shells and bullets, and whole floors have collapsed. Huge shell cra- ters pock the surrounding square, and burned-out Russian armored vehicles litter the area. People who have been inside say dead Russian soldiers lay in some rooms of the building, while other mangled bodies sat slumped outside. The bodies of dead Chechen fighters were Placed in the corridors on doors and other makeshift stretchers. On Tuesday, the building was being blasted from the general direction of Grozny’s downtown Oil Institute, where the front-line Russian Interior Ministry re- portedly has a headquarters. As happened again and again throughout the devastated city center, Chechen fighters re- sponded by ripping off return fu- sillades at real or imagined tar- gets, using their rocket launch- ers and Kalashnikovs. in Chechnya i a a Photos by Associated Prés| In the urban wasteland of Grozny, a Chechen rebel keeps an eye out for army snipe ‘Tuesday as a woman crosses the street. The presidential palace is in the background. It was impossible to know which side broke the cease-fire first. Guns around the palace roared early, shortly after the truce was supposed to have be- gun at 8 a.m. “We have to defend them. There are SO of our fighters in- Side the palace,’’ said Adam Oz- niev, a 30-year-old Chechen street warrior with a Kalashni- kov in one hand and an RPG-7 grenade launcher over his shoulder. But it was more than 50 re- bels at stake. The palace where the breakaway republic’s presi- dent, Dzhokhar Dudayev, de- clared Chechnya’s independence from Russia three years ago is the nugget that Russian forces want to pocket, on the belief that taking it will win back Chechnya. ““I don’t understand why we don’t just bomb the palace and get the people out of there,”’ said ‘Russian Senior Set. Sergei Noz- Gracheyv, interviewed at a Rus- sian armored unit outpost out- side Grozny. Unless the palace is taken, said the 20-year-old sol- dier, ‘“‘the fighting will go on, the Same as before.”’ Dudayev supposedly has fled the palace to safer ground from which he can be expected to con- tinue the Chechens’ rebellion against Russia one way or anoth- er, even if the palace falls. Many potential guerrillas are believed hidden in the mountain- ous terrain of Chechnya outside Grozny. There are generations of them. Rustan Satuyev, a 13-year- old commando with an antitank ea2renade slung umder his arm, provided a fleeting image of what some would call courage and oth- ers obtuseness. Fie may be the portrait: of future Chechen revenge. With a dazed expression that could well have been combat shock, the sixth-grader told re- porters how he and his school- mates personally destroyed two Russian tanks im the last two months by running up and dous- ing therm with Molotov cocktails. “They came into my town,’’ said the pre-adolescent, 4-footr-8- inch guerrilla. ‘‘I had to defend >\" Despite the cease-fire viola- tions, tank and artillery bom- bardment was less intense and less coordinated in Grozny on Tuesday. Consequently, hun- dreds of civilians emerged from their basements to hunt for lost relatives, search for bread or pack their cars for a dash to refu- gee centers 100 miles to the west. Chechen seamstress Zargan Magamadova, 41, was able to walk down a main boulevard to reach a bombed grocery store within SOO yards of the presiden- tial palace, something that even the fighters didn’t dare one day earlier. ; As she spoke, a car drove up to the curb, performing a maca- bre dual task in the effort to do exactly that — live without out- side help. Strapped to the rooftop bag- gage rack was a battle casualty wrapped ina black rug. The driv- er was on his way out of town to the burial site, and on the way he stopped to perform his second task: passing out loaves of free bread to a thankful crowd of about SO off-duty fighters, civil- ians and flak-jacketed Western journalists.

The first wave of Russian bombers buzzed over the city about 101% hours before the expi- ration of a unilateral 48-hour “*cease-fire”? called by Moscow. The truce was largely ignored by both sides, and there was heavy ground fighting in Grozny on ‘Tuesday and Wednesday. President Yeltsin, who sent upwards of 40,000 troops into Chechnya on Dec. 11 to put down a three-year-old indepen- dence movement, had ordered a halt to aerial bombing on Jan. 5.

Half an hour after his press conference, what seemed to be a long-range artillery shell crashed into Grozny’s oil refinery com- plex. It began two hours of spo- radic rocket and shell fire. Though Dudayev presented himself as a peacemaker, he made clear that he still wants some kind of separate identity for Chechnya. The republic has been claiming independence since the breakup of the Soviet Uniion in 1991, but no country recognizes that claim. Dudayev indicated that his people still support secession. “Even if you wipe out every village and every town and then level the Caucasus Mountains, nobody can take away the spirit of the nation — except the Al- mighty,”” said the Muslim rebel leader, who spoke to about 60 foreign and Russian journalists in a conference center on the south- ern outskirts of Grozny. The renewed Russian aerial. Associated Pi After defying Russia for a month, Chechen leader Dzho- kar Dudayev acknowledged Wednesday that he can’t win on the battlefield. He said he still demands independence. He became grimly realistic at one point, acknowledging that Chechnya has little chance of pre- vailing if Russia applies full mili- tary power for a long time. ““As for victory or defeat, in a war like this there are no winners er losers because both sides lose”” he said. ““Hlow can you talk of vic- tory?”” he added. “*“We cannot stand up physically against a state like Russia. It is impossible to stand up to them in war.” Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general, estimated that 18,000 civilians in Chechnya had perished in the warfare... Whatever the figures, the car- mage in Chechnya has produced widespread revulsion among Rus- Sia’s people, its politicians, and its international friends. One nationwide poll reported by the independent news agency Interfax said 78.9 percent of Rus- Sians surveyed want the fighting halted immediately and Russian troops withdrawn.

Ree ren climactic battle for cen- tral Grozny seesawed throughout the day, artillery rounds and machine-gun fire could be heard. Reporters were driven away by the shelling when they tried to approach and observe the smoke-covered scene near the presiden- tial palace, the symbol of Chechen re- sistance. The Russian commandos apparently launched their attack from the Russian- held Oil Institute, two blocks northeast of the parliament building and three blocks from the presidential palace. Though on-the-scene confirmation was lacking, Moscow officials insisted their ring around the presidential pal- ace by capturing three key downtown buildings. Most critically, the Russians claimed to control the once-imposing Cabinet of Ministers office building, which is less than 250 yards northwest of the palace. Nigel Chandler, 37, a British free- lance cameraman, provided the only neutral account of the initial shootout Friday night in the parliament building, a big stone structure 150 yards from the presidential palace. Chandler, trapped inside the Che- chen-held parliament building as it was being assaulted by Russian commandos, said the Chechens initially were caught off guard when the Russian assault team chucked an incendiary device into the basement shelter, where he and the Chechen defenders were hiding out from a day of ceaseless Russian artillery bombardment. Chandler said that, after initial con- _ fusion, the Chechens fought back and that Russian soldiers had tightened ' managed to drive the Russians out, us- ing Kalashnikov rifles, grenades and an armored car. He said that, after his TV camera batteries ran out of power, he escaped by riding in a car astride a pile of a half-dozen dead Chechen fighters.

Some Chechens said their wounded were taken to the New Republican Hos- pital on Grozny’s eastern fringe. At- tempts to interview the wounded were unsuccessful since the hospital lies in ruins as a result of a bombing attack more than a week ago. Meanwhile, about a mile east of the, palace, Russian artillery and attack bombers targeted the strategic cross- roads at Minutka Square for the second straight day, evidently trying to cut off the flow of Chechen fighters passing through on foot with fresh supplies of bullets and anti-tank grenades. Around noon, an air raid at Minutka came within minutes of killing two Rus- sian prisoners-of-war, who are among the 19 Russian POWs being held captive in a candle-lit basement shelter beneath the square. About 15 minutes before the air raid, the two POWs were led up to street level so they could be interviewed during a lull in artillery bombardment by a ful of journalists who have remaine throughout the fighting.

Military action that was promised to succeed in a flash has been drawn out for more than a month. It has let loose a river of blood, drained the Rus- sian treusury of scarce resources and roiled much of Russia's pop- ulation as well as its friends in the international community. When historians judge what sucked Russia into such a deep swamp once hostilities began on December 11, they will likely re- flect upon a tragic series of Rus- sian miscues. From what can already be seen, both in Chechnya and in Moscow, here are seven of the most fateful errors in Russia's attempt to end the Chechen Re- ANALYSIS 1. A week after Chechnya de- clared itself independent from Russia in November 1991, Rus- sian President Boris Yeltsin or. dered emergency rule in the re. gion and flew nearly 1,000 Inte- rior Ministry soldiers to Grozny to enforce it. But that wasn't enough. Thou: sands of Chechens blocked the streets and surrounded the air- port. The ill-prepared Russian troops were ringed by Chechen militiamen, put on buses, and ig- nominiously driven away. It was a moment a stronger show of force or a stiff economic blockade might well have brought into line the new Chechen President Dahokhar Dudayev. But Russia looked weak. Moscow lost the chance to derail independence during its unstable first days. 2, In June, 1992, Defense Min- ister Pavel Grachev announced he was pulling out of Chechnya the re- maining Russian army garrison, which was encountering hostility. Grachev said at the time he was withdrawing the soldiers, their ar- maments and their families. dn fact, tons of Russian muni- dayev's control, and these Weapons are now being used to shoot Russian soldiers, Today fin- gers are pointing wildly at Grachev, Yeltsin and other lead- ers for knowingly letting weapons remain in Chechen hands. 8, Russia could have cut off the oil pipeline from Grozny to the Black Sea any time after the re- public declared independence, But for the last three years it didn't ~ because some Russian oil flowed through the same pipe. Chechnya happily continued producing more than 50,000 barrels of oil a day, which helped build a war chest. 4, In late August 1994, Yeltsin agreed to @ major covert opera- tion, run by the former KGB, to help Chechen opposition groups unseat Dudayev. But like Presi- dent John F. Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs operation, Yeltsin's circle overestimated the strength of the Chechen pro-Russian loy- alists and underestimated the support that would rebound to Dudayev once Russia intervened. Despite Russian-supplied tanks and air ap opposition forces collaps ate §, With Russia's role in the covert anti-Dudayev operation bared, Yeltsin's options includ- ed backing off, raising an eco- nomic blockade or waging all-out war. Defense Minister Grachey announced a war, foolishly boast- ing it would be won within 72 hours by only two Russian para- trooper regiments. Initial forays by Russian troops, however, proved to be half-hearted and ill-prepared dis- asters. As patriotic support for Dudayev rose, the Chechens be- gan to believe they could win. 6. Yeltsin's team ignored out: side efforts to recharge negotia- tions, and the president himself has been unreachable to friends proposing peaceful solutions. Yeltsin's aides offered no com- promises in talks with Chechens, 7. Russia's position enjoyed some sympathy around the world when the conflict began. But the Russian military shunned news correspondents as the fighting continued. Meanwhile, the Chechens opened up to inter- views and cameras, offering out- side journalists everything from breakfast to drivers. Casper Star-Tribune - January 17, 1995 \f"

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Grozny, Russia — Yaha Du- kayeva and her family trudged a household of possessions through the snow Friday from her sister’s apartment, where a new, black-edged hole yawned through the building. “Until today I lived here,” said Dukayeva, a short, squat woman of 52 years. “We can’t live here anymore, because a hole goes nine floors from the roof to the basement.” If her family had thought the war in Chechnya would end when the Russians captured the much-battered presidential pal- ace, they were wrong. Russians took the palace Thursday. Then, overnight, they attacked Dukayeva’s building, in a residential area almost two miles from the center of the city.

Russians have the palace, but they are still trying to pacify the city, leading to new victims of the war. Chechen authorities say that upwards of 18,000 civilians have been killed in the 5-week-old conflict and that another 400,000 are refugees. Up to 4,000 Rus- sian troops reportedly have been killed. Dukayeva’s building is in a region of Grozny where, accord- ing to Russian authorities, 1,000 Chechen “bandits” armed with. GRAD rocket launchers and sev- eral tanks were hiding from air- plane attacks. Chonsaiak up the mess: Two women tidy their apartment Friday after a Russian bomb penetrated all nine floors of their building in Grozny, Chechnya. One corner of her building lay sliced open Friday, ripped from top to bottom. Rescuers were trying to reach an elderly woman trapped on an upper floor. Dukayeva said seven people were killed in the overnight as- sault: three ethnic Russians and four Chechens. Most windows were blasted out. Other buildings were dam- aged too. The attack on Dukaye- va’s building scarcely made the news. Falling ‘Snow and fog muted up what's left of the sound of continuing battle, but it did not mute Dukayeva’s anxiety and anger. “Everything I saved for the safety of my old age is gone,” she said. Now she is worried that her brother’s apartment will be next in the line of fire. It was to his apartment, about half a mile away, that Dukayeva,' her husband, sisters, brother and: younger offspring carried by: hand and by sled everything they could take from the damaged’ apartment.

By Marcia Kunstel fave CORRESPONDENT . Assinovskaya, Russia — The war in Russia’s rebellious Che- len republic moved to the coun- ide Saturday, and residents f this farm town reported that ussian troops seized a group of i men and smashed resi- flents’ belongings during violent house-to-house searches. ; . While the capital of Grozny came under renewed shelling, Russian troops concentrated on consolidating their hold on a swath of towns and territory to the south and west, cutting off es- cape and supply routes for the rebels. Assinovskaya, a village near the Ingushetia border about 50 miles west of Grozny, was the scene of fierce fighting over the past 24 hours. Russian war- planes attacked Chechen rebels who had shelled Russian ground units with heavy artillery, the In- terfax news agency said. Villagers reported that Rus- sian interior ministry forces: have been conducting searches | of homes in the town for the past | two days, smashing residents’ Shaklid Umayev, 24, said the Russians took 16 young men from the town, possibly because they suspected they were fight- ers. Other townspeople speculat- ed that the Russians may want the young men to use in ex- changes for captured Russian soldiers. “They broke my furniture. They ordered me to stand against the wall and told me not to turn around,” said Ramzan Dos- kuyev, a tractor driver at a col- lective farm. “They turned ev- erything upside down in m house.” Meager property looted Tank shells exploded on the outskirts of town Saturday. The streets were largely abandoned on a brilliantly sunny, snowy af- ternoon, a time normally filled with shopping and visiting. - Russian troops were not in > evidence, except for one ar- mored personnel carrier that headed out of town in the direc- tion of the shelling. One resident said the rebels had fled the town before the Rus- sians moved in on Friday. :\\ Most villagers huddled inside their homes for fear of the shoot- ing, expecting more searches from the Russian troops. ~ Doskuyev said the squad that searched his home stole 70,000 rubles, which is less than $20 but equals more than a week’s farm , “They’ve taken the school. y?

The Russians were trying to establish firm control to strangle any stream of reinforcements and: supplies that might be sent from these towns to the pockets of. ..resistance maintained in Grozny. . Helicopters whirled across the rural landscape, broadcast- ing warnings over loudspeakers that people must give up their weapons and not resist. “Tt was about a half an hour “They said, ‘Let the Russian troops through.

Food is growing scarce A handful of villagers gath- ered outside a house where a woman was selling a few onions and garlic, some apples and home-canned vegetables that she had spread on the snow-covered ground. They described their town as virtually blockaded, with stores and public offices closed, and food hard to find. They said bursts of shooting ring out every night, coming from the outskirts of town. “T haven’t eaten anything to- day because we don’t have bread. I don’t even have any flour at home. And there are five of us in the family,” said Nina Kopo- cheva, 65, who wept as she talked. “Do you think we can live like this?” ovskaya. “They said, ‘Let the Russian troops through.

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT ernovodsk, Russia — They come S to snatch their soldier sons from the killing grasp of a war machine. “Soldiers, Don’t Kill Your Mothers,” read the signs on three buses that lurched over potholed hills and ice slicks Monday, seeking a safe route to the battlefield where the Russian army is trying to subdue Chechens fighting for independence. “If I find him, I’ll try to get him out of here, get him back home,” said Ta- mara Yolkina, 47. She has an 18-year- old conscripted son. “I don’t think they'll let him go. I want to steal him, to kidnap him.” Yolkina came more than 7,000 miles from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia’s Far East. She has joined more than 100 Russian parents em- barked on one of the most unthinkable tasks in the history of war. They so oppose the conflict over Chechnya that they have come to ex- tract their sons and take them home. Others think their boys are prison- ers of war, and believe the Chechen side will turn them over to parents. Thousands of Russian troops reported- ly have been killed, although estimates of the number vary widely. The war that Russian leaders claimed would be finished within hours continued into its seventh week with neither side yet controlling Grozny, the capital, where fighting was heavy Mon- day. Hostilities also continued in the countryside, — The Russians suffered a setback Monday, according to the ITAR-Tass official news agency, pulling some of their crack troops out of the city after suffering severe casualties. The parents looking for their sol- dier sons have been frustrated repeat- edly. On Sunday, Russian checkpoints delayed them as they tried to reach Grozny, and one bus got stuck in the rutted, snowy road. They finally turned back when it became too late to travel safely, Monday was just as bad. The grim collection of mothers and fathers, car- rying civilian clothes, food and medi- cine for their sons, was stopped by Rus- sian soldiers who reported fighting far- ther down the first route they chose. Returning to her apartment in Grozny, Tamara Sagaipova cries in terror Monday when Russian shells hit nearby buildings. The second route was too steep for the buses to travel. They set out on yet a third route in late afternoon with plans to spend the night along the way. They were pessi- mistic, but determined to continue. One bus that split off from the cara- van did manage to reach Grozny, but it was halted at a Chechen checkpoint due to heavy fighting. Most of the parents seemed to have little hope of success, but pressed on because they said they had to do something. “T got a letter from my son,” said Valentina Filemonova, 45, who trav- eled from Lipetsk, about 200 miles south of Moscow. “He was writing it in the battlefield. He said out of 100 in his unit there were 18 left. And maybe this is his last fight.” “T don’t even know if he’s alive,” she said through tears. “There was hopelessness in the letter. I don’t think he'll come back.” Others, like Rashid Khaliyolem, a 44-year-old Moscow doctor, said he saw a name on a newspaper list of pris- oners of war that may have been his son’s. The family name was the same,. but the initials were different. It was reason enough for Khaliyo- lem to drop his work and set out for Chechnya. | “The army took care of prisoners during the Second World War, but not now. We can’t count on it anymore. This is the only way to find out what happened,” he said. All the parents interviewed said they would not be interfering if Russia was engaged in a legitimate war. “Chechnya is our family, our Rus- sia. Why do they bomb our cities? If they want to be independent, let them be independent,” Khaliyolem said. “If another country had attacked us, we wouldn't have come to look for our sons,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 24, 1995 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Soldiers find Chechen war is frustrating Want ‘decisive action’ to end conflict quickly By Marcia Kunstel © 1995 Cox News Service MOZDOK, Russia — Russian soldiers, un- easy about their mission and critical of their military tactics, fear the war in Chechnya will bleed on for years. And as confused troops keep battling in the unstable Caucasus region, civilians who sympathize with the Chechens and feel ha- rassed themselves warn that the longer fight- ing lasts, the greater the chances it will spread. “It’s a stupid war,’ said Pvt. Vladeslav Marovyev, 20, a conscript from Siberia, inter- viewed in this garrison town that is the Rus- sian army’s headquarters in the conflict with Chechnya. Marovyev, who serves in an interior min- istry fighting unit, expressed mixed feelings about using force to end Chechnya’s bid for’ independence. But like other soldiers, he was angry that the troops, once deployed, have not been freed to fight full strength to quick victory. “It could have been over in two hours if we wanted,” he said, referring to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev’s boast that Russian soldiers would take the Chechen capital Groz- ny within two hours. “A lot of people would be dead. But this way it will take two years,”’ he said, adding maybe even more will die — and echoing American soldiers’ critiques in the Vietnam War. The Mozdok base headquarters almost al- ways is off-limits to Western journalists, but soldiers and officers frequent the wintry city streets and sometimes are willing to talk about the war that began when Russian troops advanced on the breakaway republic Dec. 11. “It’s big politics,\" said Capt. Nikolai Sergeyev, 32, a contract serviceman who was calling home to Rostov at the central tele- phone exchange last week. “I mean that the high-ranking politicians need this war. But we ordinary people, we don't need it. You can ask anybody around.” Sergeyev, soft-spoken and _ thoughtful, could not call this war either right or wrong. Perhaps it was impossible to avoid, he said, not because Chechnya declared itself indepen- dent three years ago, but because guns and crime in the republic were spilling beyond its borders. ‘“*My personal opinion is that I don’t con- sider Chechnya a part of Russia. But things The Associated Press A Russian soldier prepares ammunition for his heavy machine gun at Beslan army base had gone too far. Russia had to show that it could do something against dissenters, against lawbreakers,’” he said. The feeling is widespread among troops they should take ‘‘decisive action’’ that will lead to a quick conclusion of battle, Sergeyev said. He does not expect that to happen. “I would like to believe that it will end,” he said. ‘“‘But no, I don’t believe that it will end soon.”’ Dissent is limited to talk, as troops seen at field exercises or interviewed in town seemed willing to trudge ahead, doing their duty. Marovyev, the conscript from Novosi- birsk, said he may decide to stay here for an- other six-month term. Chechen clan leaders may decide to lay down arms to stop the bloodshed, but no signs of capitulation have appeared. Talk fo- cuses on fighters retreating to the mountains to mount a guerrilla war that could tie up Russian troops for a long time. The longer the conflict continues, the more angry become the people in the sur- rounding countryside, especially the predomi- nantly Muslim populations of Ingushetia to the west and Dagestan on the east, who con- sider themselves family to the Muslim Chechens. Daily they watch columns of tanks and trucks lumber down their roads. Daily they struggle to feed and clothe more than 300,000 refugees, first from Grozny and now fleeing from smaller towns the Russians are sweeping supply lines to Chechen fighters. “Ingushetia was against the Russian troops coming here. All our people were 100 percent against it,” said Khamzat Bekov, min- ister for emergency situations in Ingushetia. to stop Arizona Daily Star - January 29, 1995 \f"

Dr. Victor Prokhorov, chief physician at the hospital in Moz- dok in the neighboring republic of North Ossetia, said the condi- tions for epidemic are ripe. Tu- berculosis already is spreading. “In February and March, it’s already warm here. That’s when disease will spread,” said Prok- horov, 44, who believes people in the region still carry the cholera virus that last summer swept Chechnya and its eastern neigh- bor Dagestan, part of which was Grozny hit as Russia shrugs at threat ASSOCIATED PRESS Grozny, Russia — Russian troops and Chechen rebels brought the now-familiar sounds of battle to Grozny’s battered streets again Sunday as a European team arrived to investigate allegations of excessive brutality. Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev renewed threats to burn Russian towns, but the Russian government dismissed oe as a “Grozny godfather” and said he had lost his grip on re- ty. Chechen separatists attacked Russian troops holding a mili- tary airfield in the eastern outskirts of Grozny and took aim at Russian soldiers holding a bridge in the city’s center, Chechen Information Minister Movladi Udugov told the Interfax news ncy. Russian helicopters with loudspeakers circled over villages west of Grozny on Sunday, warning residents against attacking military columns moving through the area. Meanwhile, a delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe arrived in Grozny on Sunday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The delegation is investigat- ing allegations of human rights abuses. quarantined. “There will be infectious dis- eases in Chechnya, and that will affect us, too,” he said. “We have to be prepared to help that terri- tory quickly.” Refugees like these in Shatoi are gorged into cities and ham- lets across the region, having fled the battling that began when Russian troops stormed into Chechnya on Dec. 11 in an effort to end the rebel republic's bid for independence. They are running low on food, have no blankets and only the clothes on their backs. Grozny, 40 miles to the north, is an open graveyard where bod- ies lie in streets, under crumbled buildings or in the shelter of basements where survivors were able to cache them away from mongrel dogs feeding on the’ dead.

        "ocr_text": "He’s cosmonauts’ long-term buddy American will have a blast, spend ‘months aboard Mir sp By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Star City, Russia — For the past year, Norman Thagard has trained to become the first American in space — the first, at least, to be sent there via a Soyuz rocket. U.S. astronauts were lucky just to wave at the Russian Mir space station on a recent trip, but Thagard will walk through the front door of the gangly conglom- eration of space modules and docks, then get comfortable. And no, he said, he’s not wor- ried about problems aboard Mir, which have included failure of the automatic docking system last fall and delays in getting cru- cial food and water to its cos- monauts. “Their track record is good,” said Thagard, 51, a doctor and former Marine fighter pilot from Jacksonville. “I’m not worried.” Thagard, a veteran of four U.S. spaceflights, is supposed to set an American longevity-in- space record by spending three months aboard Mir. He spoke re- cently at a news conference, us- ing both English and labored but understandable Russian, which he will use to communicate with his two Russian colleagues in space. “T haven’t had a problem with technical language. Ordinary conversation is a little different matter,” said Thagard, who stud- ied Russian on his own for a year and then in an intensive program for 19 weeks. “It won’t be a prob- lem. We can communicate.” Thagard is being backed by astronaut Bonnie Dunbar of Sunnyside, Wash. The two Amer- icans, based for the past year at Star City, a guarded, isolated training center 30 miles north- east of Moscow, said the biggest Hello up there: A technician at mission control in Star City, Russia, talks to cosmonauts aboard the Mir station. They need a call from home: they spend months at a time in space. difference in training in Russia compared with the United States has been the preparation for long-term missions. Cosmonauts spend months at a time in space. Their record — more than a year — is about to be broken by a cosmonaut now aboard Mir. U.S. astronauts usu- ally spend only a week or two in orbit. “In our program, we normal- ly rehearse many times virtually every last detail of every last thing that we’ll do,” Thagard said. “In the course of a three- month mission or more, you can’t do that.” Dunbar, referring to plans to staff a new international space station in 1997, said, “In that re- spect, everything we’re doing ‘now is really a very good learn- ing ground for how we’ll do busi- ness in the future.” Thagard will spend his time aboard Mir engaged in science and medical experiments possi- ble only in zero gravity. Among them will be tests of neurological functions. At the “press day” marking the formal end of training for the Americans, Thagard and Dunbar were upbeat about the future of the Russian-American space program, which is to lead to con- struction of the 1997 station. They brushed off a question about media reports that NASA has misgivings about how the Russians are using the first in- stallments of America’s $400 million share of the joint program. Tommy Holiday, NASA di- rector of the program’s initial phase, said he was unaware of any misuse of U.S. money. “NASA monitors the finan- cial situation between ourselves * t t t and our Russian partners very — closely,” Holiday said. “To my * knowledge, all the activities are + being accomplished for the work\" we expect to be done and with re#* spect to the money being trans)? ferred. I know of no problems in _ this area.” wil ‘ Boris Ostroumov, who rufis | the manned program of the RuB§ | sian Space Agency, also deniéé: | that there has been any misap* | propriation of money. But he did express concern that the Russian government won't come up with» the funds needed to keep space: exploration afloat. a “We are now facing the probe: lem of lack of money,” said Os*; troumov, who soon will make 4, pitch for funding to the lowet* house of parliament, the State. Duma. “Let’s hope for the best, that everything will be settled” You know 1994 was not easy for us.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 25, 1995 \f"
