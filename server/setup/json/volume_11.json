Both seek a home, He has come to a parliament-in-exile, an ephemeral body that cannot enforce the laws it may write, cannot se+ lect its leaders by popular election, and cannot even affix itself to any geographical mass recognized as a country, The Palestine Liberation Organization, the human network that attempts to hold together the Palestinian people in lieu of a land base, convened its National Coun- cil here last week to pursue that homeland goal, It is this weeklong meeting that drew Zaghab, a 35+ year-old, curly-haired and bearded university professor who prefers Shakespeare to militant politics, The story of his problem, his expulsion from the West Bank, has not been publicized, World headlines dwell in- stead on agendas adopted or rejected by PLO leaders, or On the rhetoric bellowing from the microphones of ideo- logues, But besides the Yasser Arafats and the militants who have readily spilled the blood of enemies, the PLO on dis» play here is peopled with hundreds of men and women who try to help the thousands like Ali Zaghab who have been uprooted from their Palestinian homes, ‘Helping thousands of the uprooted They are people like Khadija Abu Ali, 36, a psycholo- gist who has produced movies about the problems of Palestinian women and children and also heads the social affairs liaison branch of the General Union of Palestinian Women, She was drawn into the movement after treating the psychological disturbances arising from the dislocation Palestinians suffered, and now trains kindergarten teach- ers in ways to ease the confusion of small children split from their families and homes, “T found that whatever participation you make in the revolution, no matter how small, is a way of helping to make change,” she said, They include people like Ziad Abdel Fattah, a one- time schoolteacher who has turned to political journalism to tell the world about Palestine and to tell the scattered Palestinians about each other. He directs the Palestinian News Service. They are engineers and social workers, doctors with the Palestinian Red Cross and university students, These have been activists for a dozen years or more, unlike Ali Zaghab, the professor who said this visit to Algiers was his first serious foray into Palestinian politics. Indeed, his refusal to engage in political action got him into his current nomadic position, Zaghab said during an ‘interview in the Palais des Nations, the whitewashed seaside meeting complex loaned to the PLO by the sympa: thetic Algerian government, “This is the first time I came to a place like this,” Zaghab said, referring to the PLO meeting. “If I were al- lowed to stay and teach on the West Bank, I wouldn't even be here, but the Israelis are forcing us to get involved, I was expelled from my university, from my land, from my home,” Zaghab left the life of a shepherd in his West Bank village at the age of 17 to advance his studies in Jordan and then the United States, In 1980 he finally returned home to Jammain, a town without running water or full. time electricity, bearing a Ph.D, and an opportunity to teach his kinsmen at the Bir Zeit and Al Rajah universi- ties. Refusal to disavow PLO brings expulsion Last year the Israeli occupying forces asked all resi- dents not considered permanent to sign a pledge that they | would not ald the PLO or any terrorist organization, “Of course I refused,” Zaghab said, “I said this was politics, My degree is in Shakespeare, who died 400 years ago, All I wanted to do was teach,” Zaghab said he also feared that a disavowal of the PLO, even had he wished to make it, would have caused his family trouble among fellow Palestinians, And so the Israelis expelled him, Now his other relatives remain on the West Bank, which he may not even visit, and his wife has returned to her own family in the United States to deliver the couple's first child. “We were hoping to have our first kid on the West Bank,” he said rather wistfully, “I'm the only son — you know, the first son of the first son, and all that jazz, “We called him Kareem, A cute baby, his mother tells me, I haven't seen him yet,” Zaghab left behind the new house built a few kilome- ters from his mother’s place, and the handful of sheep and goats he bought for his homestead, About 80 other professors also were expelled, and the group sponsored Zaghab’s trip to Algiers to explain their plight and to seek help from the PLO, He probably will take the story of the Palestinian academics to Western Europe and to the United States, hi vs hanging in there, but I don’t know wpat the bell i doing,” 7 ; b Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 20, 1983 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bigger PLO role sought for women By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service ALGIERS, Algeria — After 14 years of obscurity, retired hijacker Leila Khaled has surfaced at the Palestine Liberation Organ- ization’s parliament in exile, standing up to Yasser Arafat over women’s rights. Mrs. Khaled, who was 20 when she and a male com- rade pulled off one of the most publicized hijackings in history, says she now spends time doing “social work dealing with children who lost their parents in the wars we have fought.” In August 1969, the two PLO members took over a Trans World Airways jet that was carrying 213 pas- sengers and crew from Rome to Athens. They forced the plane to land in Damascus, Syria, where it was heavily damaged by a terrorist bomb. Four pas- sengers were injured in the incident. At Friday’s session of the Palestine National Council, Mrs. Khaled jumped to her feet as PLO leader Arafat was pushing through his own slate of members. Demanding recognition among the predominantly male council members sur- rounding her, she called for inclusion of 12 new women members. new council Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 20, 1983 “Any achievement. of women is an achievement to the revolution,” she told Arafat. Arafat politely turned her down. He said the women applicants had not followed the proper proce- dure. Mrs. Khaled, followed into a corridor for an im- promptu interview, talked freely about her work as a PLO women’s activist, but refused to say where she lives now. “‘The Mossad is expand- ing,”’ she said, referring to the Israeli intelligence agency. She said she had been living among the PLO com- mandoes in Beirut, Leba- non, until after the Israeli invasion. Asked whether she per- sonally fought against the Israelis in Beirut, she said, “I, myself, no, because I Was pregnant.” Would you have, other- wise? she was asked. She replied, ““Yes, of course.” She and her _ husband, also a PLO activist, called their first child Beder, meaning ‘Full Moon.” The boy was born after her forced departure from Bei- rut. Mrs. Khaled, one of 37 women on the 355-member council, did not sound angry at Arafat over defeat of the move to boost the ranks of women represen- tatives. “Even though he is not beside us in our struggle in this sense (increasing fe- male membership), in general he is with us,” she said. \f"

For nine months she had lived in this peace camp lodged at the main gate of the base, where a motley col- lection of women has spent almost two years protesting and obstructing U.S. plans to install 96 cruise missiles » here in December 1983. Local authorities were in court trying to eliminate the camp, and Ms. Booth knew the chilly March morning - could be one of her last mornings ” here. She had awakened weeping. “I don’t have anywhere to go. This is my home,” the 40-year-old woman told three visitors to the campfire. “No, I’m not going to leave.” Not only was the missile protest at stake, but a way of life integrating the politics of peace with an anarch- ' istic, feminist spirit so hostile to traditional hierarchical structures that it has been run by one rule only: ~ No men overnight. “What this place is all about is women taking things into their own * hands, as well as (about) cruise mis- siles,” said Caroline, a 25-year-old dancer who would give only her first name when interviewed. The women did not fare well in the hands of a male judge. Ms. Booth and 20 others were exiled from Greenham Common for life. The next day another 113 were banned from the site. And the High Court judge sitting 50 miles away in London held the land no longer is “common” or public land, but is private property. That meant unauthorized personnel were trespassers, and it cleared the way for bulldozers to plow through the ramshackle accumulation of a 21- month, live-in protest. The women vowed, somehow, to continue the vigil that has attracted thousands of sympathizers. At the camp they stood to lose lit- tle of material value: The communal sleeping quarters of plastic slung over clothesline, the high wooden table laden with a confusion of half- eaten parcels of bread and chees and peanut butter, and square woo pallets squished into mud holes t make them passable. But some were afraid of losin each other and a place to put lif principles to the test. Caroline, who was unemployed an separated when she came here fror Manchester a month ago, said men’ structures have not worked. She cited men’s creation of nuclea weapons as an example.

They may plunk down a new camp on a hill across the road. Or some might temporarily make quarters in the home of a local woman who al- ready had converted her house to a communications center and retreat for protesters to bathe and sleep. The dedicated core group probably will find a means to vent their out- rage over the nuclear predicament. Of broader impact is whether they can find a vehicle to accommodate the thousands of women and men who have given short-term voice to their own nuclear protests at Green- ham Common. The camp’s strong feminist orien- tation has wrought controversy, but the women’s cries for peace have tapped a vein of the British con- sciousness. It has been the most successful of several peace camps in Britain, with the Dec. 12 event serving as one gauge of support. The morning Gillian Booth contem- plated her dismal future, Her Majes- ty’s Royal Post delivered letters carrying more than $500 in donations to the old refrigerator used as a camp mailbox. Hundreds of sympathizers routinely have visited for a few hours or a few days, some staying for months before heading home. They may have been perplexed ini- tially by the colorful odds and ends decorating the camp — like the one- foot-thick aluminum foil snake coil- ing up a small tree or the witch-god- dess of peace propped in some bushes.

This visit they brought juice and firewood for the campers. “We're not so concerned for our- selves. We’ve had our run,” Bignell said. “We think about our grandchil- dren, or the kids down the street.” A native Canadian, Bignell said he was in Britain during World War II. “It was rather tame compared to what this (nuclear war) would be. A complete wipe-out,” he said. Men could visit, but only women could stay. And they arrived, singly and in groups, from more than 300 miles away. Charlotte Walsh came with five women friends from Shropshire, a four-hour drive, to spend Saturday it. After the communal vegetable din- ner was done, when the wine was beginning to enhance _ sociability around the campfire, the social cen- winters, Mrs. Walsh slowly and thoughtfully spoke of why she had come. She had long feared nuclear war, said Mrs. Walsh, 32, but the prospect of cruise missiles so near to_ her home, missiles planted on her land by a foreign government, had a polariz- ing effect.

Lately the bombing has reached new levels of inten- sity, according to a western an- alyst in Pakistan. “The effort is to bludgeon the people into ac- quiescence,” said the source, who has access to reports on military action throughout Af- ghanistan. Another person who insists on remaining in. this. village about 30 miles east of the cap- ital, Kabul, said that during air attacks, the women and chil- ‘dren in her clan flee to the’ mountains. “We go without tea Cmieager. with little food,” she said. “I’am.afraid all the time for my children;-of the helicop- ters and bombardment.” : gee : Since the otftset of war in 1979, Guerrillas, known as mujahi- deen, must undertake chores once performed by villagers.

According to one survey, harvests are one-fourth to one-fifth of those _before the war. ; Peasants and rebels can do little to Stop the Soviet helicopters and jet bombers that sweep over th e countryside dropping payloads that seem absurd considering that they often are aimed at earthen huts. Said one rebel commander; “In are cases they [Afghans] have just been. slaughtered.” Despite the punishment inflicted on villagers and their land, the Soviet Union seems no closer to victory than in 1979, when Moscow —Continued on Page 13 Newsday - June 12, 1983 esieged in coun- Afghanistan —Continued from Page 4 installed Babrak Karmal as president and dispatched troops to prop up his regime. Now there are 100,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan, enough to disrupt the countryside and frighten the remaining population of 13.5 million, but not enough to quell the guerrillas. Said a western analyst: “The Soviets would have to double or triple their forces to crush the rebels.” Insurgents continue to hold 80 per cent of Afghani- stan’s rural areas and now, rebel commanders say, in- tend to put pressure on Kabul as well. “It’s the center of - Afghanistan,” said Abdul Hag, a resistance command- er, “They [the communists] are proud of Kabul... This is why we are attacking. To show they don’t have control of the city.” In preparation for new fighting, caravans of muja- hideen returned last month from Pakistan, where they spent the winter months. Rebels, who consider them- selves to be fighting a jihad, or holy war, will be as formidable as ever, military observers say. Soviet troops and Afghan regulars may be showing signs of anxiety. Western intelligence reports say that Russian troops are demoralized and that many soldiers suffer from hepatitis or the effects of drug abuse. Af- ghan soldiers often are recruited by force and threat- ened with death if they refuse to serve. Tamama, a small woman who estimated her age as 90, recalled the day when soldiers — she thinks they were Russian — arrived and took her grandson for the Afghan army. “They come in my tent,” Tamama said through an interpreter. “My .dog killed. My camel killed, One person in my family taken. In three years he not come back.” — Some soldiers flee the army, and many others might desert if the danger were not so great. One young man who had slipped away from a government garrison in Jalalabad, 60 miles east of Kabul, said the soil around his base was seeded with anti-personnel mines intended more to keep Afghan troops in the compound than rebel units out. All is not tranquil with the rebels, either. Often there is fighting among resistance groups, each intense- ly political and loyal to its owm leadership. Hostilities also can be based on tribal affiliation and interpreta- tions of Islamic teachings — differences that have exist-_ ~ed. for centuries.Recently asupply train to Jakdalag’ to be delayed a week because of a bloody assault on Several mujahideen by members of a Moslem sect. Rebel leaders claim that the Soviets attempt to ex- ploit tribal tensions but, even if that is true, the insur- gency shows few signs of weakening. The notion of jihad remains a formidable influence — stronger than petty politics, and, guerrillas claim, stronger than Mos- cow and its Afghan allies, as well. - “If we think about an ordinary battle, we cannot fight the Soviets,” said Mohammad Anwar, leader of the resistance in Jakdalag. “Russia can destroy Af- ghanistan in two hours. If we believe God has promised us victory because we are right. . . this makes us very powerful.” \f Photo by Marcia Kunstel Tamama, a shepherd who says she is about 90, has chosen to remain in Jakdalag, despite the fighting ee . eee Photo by Marcia Kunste Mohammad Anwar, an Afghan resistance leader, cleans his rifle at a rebel camp \f"

We stay. You belong in Russia.’ ” Her husband is the village's Moslem judge, and Islam exhorts believers to resist whomever invades their land. Jakdalag, strategically located near the road connecting Kabul, the Afghan capital, and the government army base at Jalalabad, was one of the first towns subjected to relentless bombing.

The communists have not depopulated the town of rebel fighters. The rebels still sabotage military convoys to Jalalabad and beleaguer Kabul with strikes on nearby electrical towers. _ Mohammad Anwar, the local mujahideen ~ commander, expresses frustration at demanding - farm and domestic work from his men, but says . even his family joined the exodus. “Every time, there was a bomb for my » house,” Anwar says, showing the ruins of his - family’s mud and straw compound to an Ameri- - can reporter, clandestinely guided into Afghan- ' istan in April and May to view the wreckage of war. A hint of walls and a mangled wocd-burn- . ing stove remain. _ Anwar points out bomb craters surrounding the idyllic homestead, built above a stream among apricot and walnut trees just beginning to bloom. One rusting bomb shell is 6 feet long. In the last year, the communist regime of President Babrak Karmal, defended by 105,000 - Soviet troops, has expanded this policy of ’ devastation. “There is not business. There is not agricul- ture. The animals have been killed,” says Abdul Haq, the commander of Kabul province for another guerrilla group. “People have no work, and yet now everything comes four times, five times as expensive as before.” Three million to four million Afghans have abandoned their homeland and become refu- gees. Through a 75-mile stretch of eastern Af- ghanistan, the absence of people is evident. Vil- lages are hushed. Wrecked, empty buildings litter most towns. The populous eastern border area is among the hardest hit. - Farming unquestionably has suffered, but gauging the extent of the food supply is dif- ficult. An Afghan support organization in Pakis- Afghanistan tan, in an as-yet-unpublished report, claims agricultural production is one-fifth to one-quar- ter of the prewar harvest. Western analysts question the figures, but they have little means of confirming or refuting such findings. The Afghan government keeps most foreigners out. In Jakdalag, the rebels seem well-provi- sioned, partly because nomad shepherds graze in the area. The fighters usually have chicken or lamb and fresh dairy foods to sell. Even the nomadic Koochi people have left Afghanistan in large numbers. Those who re- main must accommodate themselves to war- fare, as the Koochis passing through Jakdalag had done. Tamama, a small, weather-worn woman who guessed her age at 90, recounts a story of the day three years ago when her grandson was conscripted into the Afghan army, she believes by Soviet soldiers. “They come in my tent. My dog killed. My camel killed,” says Tamama, interviewed through an interpreter. “One person in my family taken,” she says, tears moistening her aes face. “In three years he not come c Pig A Moslem, like nearly all Afghans, she says she prays the guerrillas win her country back from atheistic communists. “Without the mu- jahideen,” she said, “maybe all of Afghanistan is communist.” Her son, Khan Maharaban, 70, used to lead his clan across the country to western grazing lands near the Iranian border. No longer. “Too much danger to go there,” he says, citing the heavy bombing. “No bridges are in the rivers.” However, life in the eastern part of the country has not been tranquil either. Last year, in Logar province, his 18-year-old son was killed by a mine in the road. His camp was bombed. The one family that lives full-time in Jakdalag, the 19-member extended clan of the Moslem judge, at times has had to take drastic measures to preserve its safety. During bombardment, the women and chil- dren flee to the mountains. “We go without tea or sugar, with little | food,” said Shababubu. “We take a little fruit. The bread and ghee (cooking oil) are all here. We can’t take it with us because the gunships are coming.” They stayed in the mountain caves a month last year, while their fought with the other guerrillas. “I am afraid all the time for my children, of the helicopters and bombardment,” she says. But still she would not be a refugee. “It is very difficult for them in Pakistan,” Shababubu says. “After Afghanistan liberation, all the peo- ple will come back.” Refugees interviewed in Pakistan in the camps or in private homes all express a wish to go home. The family of Anwar, the Jakdalag com- mander, has built a house of a few rooms sup- plemented by tents. It sits near the end of a crowded, narrow dirt road in Peshawar, Pakis- tan. The contrast with the mountain village of Jakdalag, with the house above the river, brings depression to his family. Anwar’s sister Laila, 30, says money is a problem, especially since so many of the family are sick so often in Pakistan. On the spring day of the American report- er’s visit, she has spent badly needed rupees on medicine for a younger sister, whose neck is distorted with swelling. Her husband and her fa- ther also are ill. _ Recently, she says, she sold a watch to pay her children’s school fees. “Pakistan is not good,” Laila says. “The food is not good. The water is not good. Pakistan is dirty.” She and her younger sisters speak wistfully of the clean mountain air and the people they miss from Afghanistan. They will go back, they say, when the Soviets leave.

This is the second of a three- part series. By MARCIA KUNSTEL ; Special to the Daily American AZAR VALLEY, Afghanistan — Rebel soldiers snaked over the mountains in long caravans, returning to their homeland rearmed to face what may be the harshest Soviet summer offensive in more than three years of war. They came last month as steadily as the snow melt bounding down the Safed Koh mountains, Kalashinikovs slung over their shoulders and rockets carried in clear plastic sacks on their backs, ” Pack horses bore rocket launchers, thousands of rounds of ammunition and whatever small arms the Afghan guerrillas could secure in neighboring Pakistan to con- tinue grinding out their resistance to com- munist rule. Their struggle has been not only against the Afghanistan government. They are stan- ding up to the might of the Soviet Union, which invaded the country to install Presi- dent Babrak Karmal in 1979 and now defends his regime with more than 100,000 Soviet soldiers. After the usual winter respite from battle demanded by rugged weather, the new offen- sive is here. Soviet and Afghan forces are bombing in- tensely. ’For the moment, they have soldiers everywhere,’ said Abdul Hag, commander of a major resistance group in Kabul pro- vince. Even if we know where they are going to attack, we don’t have the ability to transport materiels for a defense. We are civilians, not a government.’’ A Western analyst in Pakistan, with access to reports on military action throughout Afghanistan, said the bombing against the insurgents in some places was the most brutal ever. The effort is to bludgeon the people into acquiescence, ’” he said. Despite being outgunned by Soviet tanks, “ helicopters land jets, the bands of rebels known as Mujahedeen so far have kept the fight locked in a stalemate. The Soviets would have to double or tri- ple their forces to crush the rebels,” said the _ Western analyst. The Mujahedeen, guerrillas who say they are fighting a holy war to regain their land from atheist hands, fight with a messianic Spirits Even they cannot estimate their own numbers, but the rebel groups by most ac- counts control 80 percent of Afghanistan, the land outside the cities.

Villages were destroyed, and so were the harvests. Slim support services remain for the rebels in some locales. \"Every kind of supply for the Mujahedeen comes from the civilian population,” said Abdul Haq. The Mujahedeen don’t take tea or food from Pakistan. It makes trouble when the villages are empty.” Between three and four million Afghans already have fled their country. The Mujahedeen are hindered as well by fighting among the resistance groups, which are political parties each loyal to a different leader, Hostilities among the Afghan people, some bas- ed on tribal affiliations, others on differing inter- pretations of Islam, are centuries old. Traditional- ly, the Afghans are fighters, Mohammad Anwar, commander of Jakdalag and surrounding countryside for the resistance group Jamiat-i- -[slami, said a united stronghold was one of the rebels’ most compelling needs, He and others say they believe the Soviets inspire enmity among the guerrillas and also provoke tribal peoples in Pakistan border territory.

This is the final article of a three-part series. By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to the Daily American PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Nearly three million refugees from Afghanistan, the largest concentration of war exiles in the world, are better fed and healthier than the local Pakistanis who have given them refuge. The Afghans, who have fled from the nearly four-year-old conflict battering the cities and villages in their country, are beneficiaries of roughly $1.5 million a day in international aid. Although health problems including widespread diarrhea and anemia persist, the refugees do get better health care and better food than the local population, according to an unpublicized United Nations survey completed earlier this year. The study was conducted by the U.N.’s World Food Program at refugee camps near the Afghan border, holding more than 22,000 families. The refugees, by fleeing the bombs of the Soviet-backed communist regime in \\. many express loyalty. The guerrillas, known as Mujahedeen, have blocked some exit routes to keep Afghans inside their country, on grounds they are needed to provide a support network that will leave the fighters time for fighting. Some Mujahedeen leaders express fears that continued aid for refugees, with little help going to the embattled Afghans inside the country, may fit precisely into the communist strategy for victory. ”There are other categories of refugees which are inside. (Afghanistan], casualties of fighting,”’ said resistance leader Syed Ahmed Gailani, interviewed recently at his exile head- quarters in Peshawar. ”’They have left their destroyed homes and they have taken shelter in the mountains. They have been dislocated,’’ he said. ’’There is no doubt there is poverty. There are diseases. And we are not able to do much about it.”’ The refugees do not live in luxury. By Western standards, the sea of tents and pressed mud huts filling acres of land at 13 ma- jor refugee camps are depressingly meagre ac- commodations. Some, however, are at least as large and are structurally similar to homes in Afghanistan. One extended family at a Kohut camp was sprawled among several broad tents and small sie a yoonurt with dinner, —_ butter with the morning’s fresh- akedl bread, A family at Nasir Bagh, the camp in Peshawar, had built a compound around a well and was attempting to provoke a garden out of the dry, inhospitable earth. One cow and a scattering of chickens lived in the compound with 16 people. At least one child and the family matriarch were sick, the woman racked by a deep cough, fe feverish girl sleeping in a hammock at mid- ay. But a young mother proudly told how her oldest son attended the camp school, and more proudly pointed to a toddler daughter who would have the same chance. Inside Afghanistan only a tiny fraction of the women are schooled. _ The family elder, Asal Din, said through an interpreter that his clan fled its farm near Jalalabad three years ago, when the communist planes and tanks arrived at he close of a battle victory. He had fought with the rebels, he said.

        "ocr_text": "Newswoman makes secret trip to ghanistan By KENDAL WEAVER Associated Press Writer Marcia Kunstel once tracked down wayward politicians in the Al- abama state- house. Later she took her pen and notepad to the hubbub of Atlan- ta. No small step from that to the barren and war- torn terrain of Afghanistan, trudging on foot and riding Kunstel horseback with armed rebels into an alien, primitive land scarred by four years of bloodshed with occupying Soviet troops. Her recent secret trip into Af- ghanistan made her one of only a few women reporters -to cross into the Afghan countryside since the Soviet invasion of December 1979. Only a small number of American reporters have made the clan- destine journey into Afghanistan to gather first-hand information on the war. Few of them were women, partly because of the prevailing cul- ture and its restrictive role for women. Ms. Kunstel, 35, was more ac- ‘customed to Deep South culture. She was a political reporter for The Advertiser for six years. Then she wrote for the Atlanta Journal- Constitution on a variety of subjects before leaving last December to set- tle in Rome — Italy, not Georgia — as a freelanc®é writer. Back in the states, visiting her family in Willoughby Hills, Ohio, she said in a telephone interview last week that her trip into Afghan- istan was not without fear. ‘*At first I was scared.”” she said. “*I was thinking about a French doc- tor who was caught by the Afghan communist government and sen- tenced to eight years in prison.”’ But as she waited in Pakistan for the trip to begin. she said, her fear turned into anxiety that it might be canceled. The wait stretched on from one week to three weeks. “I had come this far,”’ she said. “I wanted to do it. I felt it was significant journalistically and something important. Most people aren't aware of the war, that the Moslems have been fighting here four years against the communist government.” Finally she rendezvoused with her rebel escorts and. after a two-day trip by truck from Peshawar. she crossed the border into Afghanistan. She said rebel groups were ‘‘very reluctant’’ to take a woman with them. But she convinced them she was physically able to handle the trip. “T told them I run. J run a couple of miles each day. I had just been skiing. I was in pretty good shape,” she said. Also, she had the proper looks — black hair, dark eyes, olive skin. “Tt would be a lot more difficult for someone who is red-headed or blonde, someone with light skin,” she said. But there was a problem: She was no veteran of horseback riding and she could never seem to keep her chador, or veil, wrapped properly across her face. That led to one of the most terri- fying moments of her two-week ven- ture across the Afghan countryside. As she rode with her escorts, a soldier with a gun was spotted per- haps a hundred yards away. They ‘could not tell if it was a Soviet or Afghan government soldier, she said, but they wanted to proceed casually and give him no reason to suspect they were rebels. But her chador would not stay on. “IT couldn't keep the thing on,”’ she said. “Here I was trying to negotiate a horse and keep it on at the same time. There had been fir- ing ahead of us ... then the soldier appears in the distance. I said to myself, ‘I'm not going to let this happen.””’ The chador didn’t fall. The rider didn’t fali. ‘‘I looked at the guy and I looked away,”’ she said. The soldier did not come up very close, and they passed without being stopped. She said she sustained herself on See NEWSWOMAN, page 2A) (continued from page 1A) bread called ‘‘nan,” and black or green tea. A stringy, greasy kind of mutton stew was a staple of many, she said, “but I got to the point I couldn’t eat it.” The tea, however, ‘‘was really a life-saver,”’ with heaps of sugar pro- viding energy, she said. Ms. Kunstel said they traveled for a time in the mountains where it was ‘cold and snowy ... you could sink to your waist in some of the drifts. It was difficult to get the horses through.” Later they traveled across barren terrain that was “arid, desert-like” and hot. In two weeks she had two baths, of a sort, using water from a barrel. Finally they reached their desti- nation, Jakdalag, which she de- scribed as a bombed-out village where the rebel commander made his base. Ms. Kunstel, who is writing of her experience, said the anti-com- munists fighting to regain their country want Western reporters to bring attention to their cause. “They don’t have any choice but to fight,” she said. The communist regime ‘‘goes against their values, against their religion. The idea of being dominated by a foreign power — it is foreign to their spirit.” Montgomery Advertiser - June 19, 1983 \f"

        "ocr_text": " AFGHANISTAN Glimpses of a Holy War As the Soviets launch a spring offensive, the guerrillas hang tough Ever since Soviet tanks first rumbled across the border in December 1979, Af- ghanistan has been an isolated land of mystery and misery. Some 3.3 million Af- ghans—20% of the population—are in ex- tle, most of them in Pakistan. But little is known of the conditions they left behind. This spring Joseph Albright, chief foreign correspondent for Cox Newspapers, and Marcia Kunstel, a freelance reporter, spent six weeks between them in separate travels through the strife-ridden nation. Their Joint report for TIME: explosions boomed every five sec- onds across the Shomali region of northeast Afghanistan, as Soviet tanks and artillery fired more than 1,000 shells at suspected guerrilla hideouts. Every 15 minutes, in reply, came the resounding rattle of heavy machine-gun fire as the guerrillas aimed, in vain, at two helicopter gunships circling high above the green plains. That evening tanks could be heard clanking through the darkness. By morn- ing they were gone. Such were the sounds of the Soviet spring offensive, vintage 1983, perhaps the most savage assault since the invasion. There are, according to Western esti- mates, some 105,000 Soviet troops now in Afghanistan. Using tanks, helicopters and fighter-bombers, these forces pound- ed villages throughout the Shomali re- gion. Their objective, presumably, was to obliterate guerrilla strength around the crucial 50-mile stretch of highway leading from Kabul toward the Soviet border, along which the invaders transport their supplies. Meantime, according to West- ern intelligence reports, Soviet bombers were attacking targets near Herat in the west and around Kandahar in the south. They apparently hope that by demolish- ing villages they can devastate local agri- culture and drive the residents from areas that might otherwise lend support to the insurgents. As Abdul Haq, a guerrilla commander interviewed in Pakistan, points out, “Every kind of supply for the mujahedin [warriors] comes from the ci- vilian population. It makes trouble when the villages are empty.” Whatever its wider aims, the offensive failed to squelch the guerrillas, who num- ber anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000. Bolstered by their religious zeal—and, more practically, by a flow of arms and supplies from abroad—they are grimly determined to rid their homeland of the hated invader. “The Islamic faith is the force behind our jihad [holy warl,” says Rebel Unit Commander Mohammed An- war. “If we thought this was an ordinary battle, we could not fight the Soviets. 50 F or two hours after dawn, thunderous In the heat of battle: a guerrilla attack lights up the night sky over Kabul ay A! ¢ afi Along the sidelines: rebels scramble down arocky hillsi = ae a — ide toward a Severnment target Photographs for TIME by Aral/Flandrin/Reza—Sipa/Black Star TIME, JUNE 20, 1983 Time - June 20, 1983 \f through a camp established amid the rubble of a shattered Afghan village d destroy Afghanistan in two ee if we believe God has promised us victory because we are right, it becomes quite feasible.” That determination has won some battles. Only last week one Western analyst claimed that guerrillas killed some 200 government soldiers dur- ing a three-day battle, while forcing the rest of the unit to desert. Elsewhere, one young fighter claimed to have knocked out two Soviet tanks in a single day; an- other boasted that on the same day he had killed five enemy soldiers. Declared a errilla radio operator named Miroja- deca: “We will fight until our blood runs out—ten, 20, 100 years. the guerrillas also fight vehe- mently among themselves. The So- viet invasion has sparked friction between ethnic Tajiks and ethnic Push- s and thrown gasoline on centuries- tun. feuds between Shi‘ite Muslims and Sunni Muslims, and between pro-Iranian Shiites and independent Shi‘ites. The errilla movement is thus fragmented into hundreds of units organized along vil- lage lines, each loosely affiliated with one of the six major resistance groups. Based in Pakistan, the leaders of most of those groups are quite unable to control events at the front. The divisions are so deep, moreover, that in the absence of a foreign enemy, Afghanistan might be plunged j ivil war. aaa the moment, the Soviet strategy has tipped the scales in Moscow’s favor. Largely as a result of widespread devasta- tion—which has brought high prices in the wake of shortages of labor, fuel, fertil- izer and seed—Afghanistan’s agriculture +s fast deteriorating. According to one es- tcasite, wheat production was five times TIME, JUNE 20, 1983 greater in 1978 than it was last year. In the Logar province and in isolated vil- lages around the country, entire settle- ments have been reduced to ghost towns. One such tragedy took place in the medium-size farming community of Dasht-e-Rivat (pop. 1,800 in the past), many of whose inhabitants fled on the third day of bombing in April 1982. Scrambling up a goat path into the 14,000-ft. mountains along the southern edge of the Hindu Kush, the fugitives took nothing with them but thin clothing, a little bread © and some dried mulberry © flour. For 40 days they | hid behind boulders and in © mountain caves. Each night it snowed; each day they saw Soviet planes bomb and strafe the valley below. The fatalities included 40 adults and about 70 children—20 5 having died from the bomb- ings and as many as 50 from the cold or hunger. Perhaps 1,200 refugees trekked for 27 days over seven high mountain ranges before reaching safety in a Paki- stani refugee camp. Some semblance of normal life has now returned to Dasht-e-Rivat. Farmers can be seen working the fields with wood- en plows; young men mix straw and mud to patch bomb holes. One sagging roof is Propped up by an unexploded Soviet bomb. But in villages like Jakdalag, 30 miles east of Kabul, the relentless assault upon civilians has taken its toll on the guerrillas.

Since bombs first began tearing the community apart three years ago, all its farmers and all but one of its 400 families have left. Rebels now sleep in blankets on the dirt floors amid mangled stoves and the carcasses of homes. They are forced to spend less time on training than on tending scant wheat crops or washing clothes. “I’ve told the freedom fighters to start cultivating and doing farm work,” sighs Mohammed Anwar, while making bread. “But it is difficult _... when mujahedin must do “this too.” f Yet members of the only remaining family, that of the village’s Muslim law judge, are uncompromising. Says Shababubu, the judge’s wife: “When the [Afghan] army came, they said, ‘You belong in America or Pakj- stan.’ I said, ‘No. We are Muslims. We will stay. You belong in the Soviet Union.’” Her brother-in- law Lolgul held the depart- ed villagers in special con- tempt: “All the village js afraid of bombardment Only a few stayed. Dirty people, fright. ened people left.” The insurgents are fired by a religious conviction that is equally immovable Prayer is routine; liquor is forbidden. Communism is often disparagingly linked to atheism. One aged nomad confessed to liking Americans because “they have a book,” the Bible. Often a rebel will cradle prayer beads in his hand while toting a Kalashnikov on his shoulder. Even rela- tively sophisticated guerrillas remain qui- etly optimistic. According to Farouq /Azam, political director of an alliance of relatively moderate guerrilla groups, the , rebels’ tenacious resistance has altered the geopolitical balance of power in the region: “Before the war, Pakistan was not able to get $500,000 [in Western aid]. Now it is not happy with $500 million.” The appraisal of Commander Abdul Haq is equally hopeful: ““We do not say we will destroy the entire Soviet army. But we can make trouble for them. If outside nations really push them, and if we continue fighting for a very long time, maybe the Soviet Union will change its mind.” That kind of conviction has won the rebels widespread support among their compatriots. The war is a sporadic thing in most of the country, and the guerrillas spend much of their time chatting over tea or working in the fields. As soon as bombs explode in their region, however, they can usually mobilize every suitable male. Since nearly all schools in the rural areas are closed—the government claims that guerrillas were killing teachers, and the guerrillas contend that the Soviets bombed some schools and ordered the government to close others—many guer- rilla recruits are teen-agers motivated by TW) hatred for the Shuravi (Soviets). FN he youths can prove valuable, and occasionally dangerous. Some have been recruited by KhAD, the Af- ghan secret police, to provide information on guerrilla activities. More frequently, they serve the mujahedin. Since they are allowed to cross Soviet checkpoints if they are unarmed, they can carry messages, procure supplies and cause some damage. Last year one ten-year-old reportedly Stole across Soviet lines and planted a mine between two enemy camps, one So- viet and one Afghan. When a Soviet sol- dier stepped on it the following day, his foot was blown off. His outraged compan- ions blamed their allies.

Nevertheless, Western diplomats in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad believe that the U.S. Government has refused to provide heavy artillery in deference to Pakistan’s wish that the fighting be limited. Since the rebels lack transporta- tion, heavy equipment and medicine, they must rely on resilience and re- sourcefulness. Their principal aim is to stem the tide of refugees. Along the exit route in the Panjshir Valley, for example, they check the papers of every would-be emigrant, turning back those without appropriate mu- jahedin documentation. In battle, the rebels specialize in bushwhacking tank columns, raiding army garri- sons, blowing up power lines and as- sassinating members of the KhAD. #7 Using Soviet land mines fished out of } the ground with wooden pitchforks, they destroyed at least twelve enemy tanks in the Panjshir Valley last year. “We destroy their tanks in such a way that they cannot find the pieces,” gloats Insurgent Strategist Mohammed om “Tt has a good ological effect.” See ie of the Panjshir Valley is unquestionably the charismatic com- mander Ahmad Shah Massoud. A former engineering student, Massoud, 29, has re- mained in Afghanistan and worked tire- lessly to galvanize support. He has man- aged to mobilize virtually ‘ all 100,000 inhabitants of the valley, while collecting his own taxes, running his own schools and organizing his own food-rationing scheme. He has even used captured Soviet trucks to establish daily bus service in the valley. Massoud is also prudent enough to avoid needless risks. He travels with four gun-wielding bodyguards and packs a S-mm automatic under his jacket. In or- der to elude the KhAD, he sleeps in a dif- ferent house each night. : The 75-mile-long valley is a monu- to his efforts. Around it are strewn the remains of 17 Soviet tanks, 29 trucks, dozen helicopters and planes and, guer- miles claim, 1,000 Soviet soldiers. Green ment Guerrillas summarily IME, JUNE 20, 1983 execute a self-professed deserter who had been expose Mujahedin special commandos in training Islamic flags mark the graves of 180 slain rebels. In March, however, Massoud unexpectedly reached a private, tempo- rary cease-fire with the Soviet military command in Kabul. Soviet troops with- drew from Rokha in the central Panjshir; they were allowed to maintain a base in Anawa provided they did not come into contact with locals. The agreement alarmed even some of Massoud’s admir- ers. Says Mohammed Anwar: “If there is no fighting in the Panjshir, it is bad for all Afghanistan. It means that there are more Soviet soldiers to go elsewhere.” Such dissension is the last thing that the already faction-ridden guerrilla forces need. As it is, a bitter vendetta separates the two most powerful guerrilla groups, the Hizbe-Islami (Islamic Party) and the Jamiat-I-Islami (Islamic Associa- tion). Both are composed of fundamental- 3) \", as Time - June 20, 1983 (Continued) ist Sunni Muslims, yet neither will join with the other. Thus, while the rebels guarantee safe passage to most captured government defectors (10,000 a year by one estimate), they continue to foil one another. Last fall, for example, the Hizbe troops confis- cated ammunition belonging to the Jamiat forces. Each side also accuses the other of harboring collaborators, and both may be right. Western in- telligence analysts claim that the brightest graduates of the Afghan military academy are sometimes sent to infiltrate guerrilla-held villages disguised as deserters. Meanwhile, the flood of refugees continues, even though the monthly rate has shrunk from a high of 120,000 during the war’s early stages, to 8,000 this year. Most of those who have fled the country live in squalid Pakistani camps, but find that their basic needs are met. Cush- ioned by international aid totaling $1.5 million a day, they are assured of steady food, shelter, medicine and a monthly cash stipend of around $3.80 per person. In addition there are schools for children, a rare luxu- ry in Afghanistan. Pakistani President Mohammed Zia al-Haq has repeatedly declared that the camps are only a temporary haven. Repa- triation, however, would require a negoti- ated political settlement, and that possibil- ity seems remote. Meanwhile, to millions of Afghans, subsistence in the camps seems preferable to misery at home. In that sense the cause of the mujahedin has weakened, though not decisively. “The So- viets would have to double or triple their forces to crush the rebels,”’ says one West- ern analyst with access to intelligence re- ports. So the war drags on, making the de- termination of the insurgents seem as forlorn as it is fierce. Back in Jakdalag, Shababubu, the judge’s wife, innocently looks forward to seeing her departed friends. “After Afghanistan’s liberation,” she says, “‘all the people will come back.” She will have a long wait. ie im d, during interrogation, as a government spy \f"

        "ocr_text": "Italian girl’s suicide may speed passing of old village ways By Marcia Kunstel Special to The Journal-Constitution FABRIZIA, Italy — Old ways die hard in this isolated town, shielded for centuries from change by the mountains and poverty of Italy’s deep south. The recent suicide of a 16-year-old girl, however, may speed their demise. Maria Maiolo killed herself two weeks ago rather than wed the 32-year-old laborer her ‘mother’ was forcing upon her. The girl saw no other way to escape the tradition of the arranged marriage. Now Daniele Domenico, for one, thinks the girl’s death will help nudge forward Fabrizia’s social clock. “People will start thinking more,” said Domenico, 35, a local construction contractor who knows the Maiolo family. aon people should make their own decisions,” he added in an interview here last week. Not all the people of Fabrizia are bound to the customs of earlier days, as is apparent in a stroll down the town’s streets. Short, round old women clothed in mourning, their bodies wrapped in shawls and violence by the parents,” Sadurny said. “The girls have no freedoms at all.” Miss Maiolo had nowhere to turn, no one to whom she could bring her problem, he said, and she apparently did not have the strength to continue resisting her mother. She took her life a few hours before her fiance was due to arrive in town to publish the legal notice of the marriage. “She was afraid to go through with it,” the priest said. Sadurny, whose calling keeps him in con- tact with many of Fabrizia’s citizens, said ar- ranged marriages are commonplace. But Salvatore Bava, the town's sindaco, or mayor, disagreed. “People didn’t know a thing like this could happen here,” he said. “There's no such thing as an arranged marriage. There used to be 100 years ago.” Interviewed in City Hall on-a recent Sun- day morning, Bava finally did acknowledge, though, that the practice may still be in force among the town’s contadini, or poor peasants. If that practice remains unchanged, how- ever, life in the village has not — particularly during Bava’'s five years as mayor. In the old quarter, where Miss Maiolo’s babushkas, still balance bundles of vegetables or laundry on their heads as they trudge through alleys too narrow for cars. Through the same streets, however, jeans-clad boys race their motorcycles, some- times accompanied by teenage girls wearing bright cotton slacks or even shorts, their lon hair blowing free in the wind. New ideas have been reaching this moun- tain village of 3,500 people, just as they have infiltrated other old towns of southern Italy via television and new roads. Perhaps it was the emerging contrasts that led to Maria Maiolo’s death: She could not have the new lifestyle of Fabrizia,; she would not live the old. The family was poor, according to the Rev. Romoaldo Vincenzo Sadurny, the priest who was to have performed the marriage of Miss Maiolo and her intended, Antonio La Rosa, a bricklayer who had left\\the area to work in a wealthier region of northern Italy. They were to have wed at the small Santa Maria Del Carmine church on Aug. 6, the girl’s 17th birthday. Miss Maiolo’s father was dead, Sadurny said, and her mother made a meager living family lives, tiny apartments still are piled atop and beside each other along narrow and sometimes steep alleyways. But the houses have plumbing now. And many of the streets are paved now, including the broad main ave- nues that carry Fabrizia’s traffic. There is a new school, as well as construction of new apartments along the fringes of town. Bava estimated he has brought more than $5 million in public funds to the town since he was elected in 1978. Besides making improvements, the money still goes toward replacing some of the structures devastated in a 1972 earthquake, in which 450 homes were destoyed. : ' The money has come from a variety of public sources, he said, including the national Fund for the South, an effort to bring the impoverished region closer to the living standards of the industrialized north. ‘Some who left for better jobs in Germany or Switzerland have returned home, he said, bringing with them new ideas. For example, he said, in the 1980 refer- endum the town voted in favor of legalizing divorce and abortion. “People are smarter now,” the mayor said. from the soil. Miss Maiolo left school when she was young to help. “The mother was trying to give her the best husband so she would have a good life,” said the priest, who nonetheless did not ap- prove of forcing the girl to marry against her will. Sadurny said Miss Maiolo rejected the marriage because of the age difference and because La Rosa was the brother of an uncle of Miss Maiolo. He said the prospective groom also was afflicted by a nervous system disorder. But her strong opposition during a two- year engagement was not generally known outside the household, he said, until the Sun- day afternoon she took her late father’s rifle and blasted herself in the stomach. He and others said Miss Maiolo had beg- ged her mother to relent. Her mother had re- fused. _ The priest said Miss Maiolo’'s mother even goi a legal certificate indicating that the girl was pregnant, so she could marry before the age of 18. However, a post mortem medi- cal examination by authorities showed her to be a virgin. “Girls (here) are victims of psychological Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 24, 1983 \f"

As many as 17 factions have entered 18 years of civil war- fare, which has jarred this disastrously Poor na- tion, where life expectancy was 39 years and average per capita income was $73 as of six years ago. | | The main split since Chad gained indepen- dence from|France in 1960 has been between the Arab-oriented, Moslem north and the Chris- tian and animist sogth. : Goukoun| and Habre both are of the north- ern Toubou tribe and both were prominent in the Front de Liberation Nationale du Tschad (Frolinat), which a US publication has described as “motivated by the mixture of rudimentary Marxism and pan-Arabism.” They arrived atFrolinat via different routes. Habre was the sonof a poor shepherd, educated at a French missin and then in Paris under scholarship. Goulouni is the son of a derde, who are the highest Toubou religious leaders, closely linked to Lbyan royalty in past years. . In 1971 Goukaini and Habre were among the guerrillas figtting the government of the late President Frincois (Ngarta) Tombalbaye, who was perceivel as endowing favored treat- ment on the souti and unfair taxes on north- erners. ' Habre split from the Frolinat in 1973 to butid his own armed band in the east around the time he gained repute as a ruthless guerrilla. He kid- naped a French coiple — he kept the woman far two years — and ececuted a French officer sent to negotiate her reease. ; Also at this tine Libya annexed a northern strip of Chad alorg its border, while maintain- ing close ties withFrolinat. It is not clear wheth- er Habre left in disgust over the Libyan move or whether he was forced out because of his own extremist tactics. Tombalbaye's assassination in 1975 brought a three-year power struggle, lulled briefly in a ceasefire when Habre was named prime minister {1 1978. More fighting in 1979 resulted in yet another coalition, this time with Goukoun! as president and Habre as defense minister. It did not las. War again broke out in the capital, where dozens of buildings stil! bear bul- let and grenade scars. : Libya intervened at the request of then-presi- dent Goukouni, and Habre fled tn late 1980. But last year he staged a comeback coup, after Lib- va had withdrawn troops. Boston Globe - August 12, 1983 \f"

By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News MASSAKORI, Chad — Cmdr. Sal- lah Hilli stopped to grab a handful of sand. Letting it sift through his fingers, he said: ‘“‘We are Chadians. The land is our mother and our fa- ther.” Hilli, whose allegiance is to President Hissene Habre in the es- calating civil war with Libyan-sup- ported rebels, is a wiry black man who heads the Chadian army bri- gade in Massakori. The city, which is almost 100 miles north of N’Djamena, is along the parched route linking the capital and Salal, on the government’s northern line of defense. Hilli and his men say they are confident that they can repel the rebels, led by former President Goukouni Oueddei, although the Chadian commander has only 35 soldiers. “We are ready to die,” said Hilli, whose garrison headquarters is a mud hut. A few hundred soldiers, most of them Zaireans serving in a non- combatant role, are stationed 80 miles to the north at the city of Moussoro. Only Hilli’s command and the force at Moussoro stand be- tween Salal and N'Djamena. Habre is making his stand at Salal, where France announced Sunday that 500 French paratroop- ers have been dispatched. France Dallas Morning News - has said that its troops are serving as trainers. Last week, the government troops now Stationed at Salal were forced out of Faya-Largeau, a key northern outpost at a desert oasis. The city had changed hands sev- eral times but ultimately fell to the rebels after continued raids by Lib- yan jets and a massive attack in- volving Libyan troops and tanks, Western diplomats in N'Djamena said. The government stronghold in the east is Abeche. Zairean and French troops also are stationed there. The route to Massakori, in re- cent years impassable because of summer floods, is dry now. Some millet grows, as does grass, but rain has been infrequent. The carcasses of cattle occasionally can be seen from the road linking N’Djamena and Massakori. Should Goukouni’s rebels ad- vance on the unfortified Massakori garrison, they will find a few, very ardent opponents. “I am ready to fight,” boasted Mohammad Al-Jadje, 15, who wore camouflage pants, a khaki green shirt and had a Kalashnikov as- sault rifle slung over his right shoulder. - Another of Hilli’s troops, 30- year-old Tchou Yaya, seemed equally as prepared for a show- down with the rebels. “If they come here,” he said, “we will push them back to their base where they came from.” The town that the garrison de- fends is large by Chadian stand- AFRICA a Faya-?

At dusk, women wrapped jn vi- vid robes, many wearing gold nose- rings, depart the market area on burros loaded with baskets and bags of goods. With its shops and tradesmen, Massakori is a mecca for travelers from the tiny, straw-hut villages along the route from N'Djamena. The only other sizable town along the 100-mile stretch is Assa- guet. Like N’Djamena and Massa- kori, the city is sealed, and trav- elers must presen apers to guards at the checkpoints before being allowed in or out. A Chadian truck driver said the people in the town fear the ad- vance of the Libyans and rebels. “They will kill the children and women,” said Ahmed Djiki Li Ka- bir, 23. But he also expressed his faith in the government, saying that he believed the Habre army would repulse any further attacks. August 16, 1983 (Also in Boston Globe) \f"

Everything else learned in the 18 days Chad has been an interna- tional headline, including that Lib- ya is providing air and ground sup- port of the rebels, is information supplied by government officials or Western diplomats. It is an unseen war. About 150 correspondents from around the world have clustered in this capital city, herding them- selves to the embassies and to the Chadian Ministry of Information to learn how the battle , One need only find a row of yel- low t taxis at rest to discover which official is briefing the jour- nalists. The government has not grant- ed réporters permission to go to the battle lines, much less made air transport available. Independent ground travel from here to the main fronts is either im- possible or very difficult. Chad is cursed with flooded roads in south- ern climes during the wet season, and the temperature in the Sahara desert in the north reaches: 140 de- grees Fahrenheit. ’ The government has attempted to control news coverage even here in the capital. « The only official who speaks is the information minister, except for President Hissene Habre’s two orations followed by. relatively short press conferences. Habre oth- erwise has been inaccessible. The press has been barred from the military airport and stopped from photographing planes unload- ing foreign military aid, even though diplomats of the supplying governments planted the idea with television crews. The government also censors outgoing news reports, although what gets sliced from a story one day may glide through on the next. Generally, information regard- ing military strategy such as troop movement or the number of sol- diers deployed at a specific place are likeliest candidates for censor- ing. Much depends on which censor happens to be on duty at ae public Telex office. Charged with sifting through the output of an international press corps, some censors scarcely — read or speak any Western lan- guages except French. Some will ask the reporter to translate select- ed passages, and others simply run their eyes over the copy and pre- tend they understand it. To their credit, the censors have not objected to stories containing information contrary to the gov- ernment line. For example, the ment spokesman disputed the first re— ports from Western diplomats that the rebels finally had taken the key oasis town of Faya- u. But the censors did not stop the'stories. The government does stage me- dia productions, especially ones that make good television footage. Every few days they have pa- raded captured soldiers before the press, identifying them as Libyans or Sudanese or native rebels. But they only let journalists pose ques- tions to a single prisoner, a man who said he was a Libyan pilot. The Western diplomatic corps : has been the steadiest source of in- formation, offering daily oe by an ambassador or political o cer. Under briefing rules, the spokesmen cannot be quoted by name nor identified by country. However, France, the United States and West Germany are the only Western nations with embassies in town, and the Germans have had no briefings Their tidbits come from Cha- dian contacts, from their own mili- tary forces working in the country. or from satellite surveillance. Their reports have proved to be good indicators of the direction the battle is taking. But the surest sign that Chad is at war is found in the Central Hos- pital here. Most of the injured are at the off-limits military hospital, but a couple of dozen patients are at Cen- tral Hospital umder the care of Dr. Rene Jacovini, who has permitted Press access. The men talk little, except to say they were victims of air or tank attack, they think, by Libyan planes and tanks. It is Dr. Jacovini, a French na- val doctor, who brings the war more gruesomely into focus. The burned men seem to have phospho- rus burns, he said, the type made by blasts of phosphorus bombs.

Soldiers of the third platoon of Bravo Company seemed to be ina good mood as one man employed a sophisticated tracker to pinpoint the sources of fire and others scanned the scrubby surroundings through their rifle sites or with their eyes in hopes of seeing the flash of a muzzle. They laughed when two visiting reporters flinched at the cracks of gunshots. “It’s the ones you don't hear that get you,” one said, dredg- ing up the cliche. The 10-minute hunt for the op- position paid off. Second Lt. Steve Sekellick took the tracker from a soldier to confirm the enemy posi- tion in a small, yellow house less than half a mile away. “I'm going to radio for author- ization,” he said, eliciting groans from his men and shouts of “Don't do it. Don't call, sir.” Sekellick had explained earlier that he can order return fire without getting approval if he be- lieves the lives of his men are in their outpost in a southeastern suburb of Beirut, but seldom are they the targets, the Marines said. . Even more seldom are they allowed to fire back, a restriction that grates on them increasingly. “Most days, we don’t even put our gear on,” one Marine said. None looked afraid or even concerned as bullets whizzed past. Instead, they were vi- danger. This time, however, he de- cided to ask. “Even when we're taking a lot of rounds, we have to go through this,” said Cpl.

In the 10 minutes Sekellick was away, the men spoke of the frustra- tion that they feel as they crouch every day in the dirt behind the sandbags as the bullets fly their way. “If we were on the offensive, we wouid go out with the Lebanese army and sweep them all away,” Anderson said. \"I don't mind dying in Lebanon, but I don’t want to die sitting around like this.”’ The warring right-wing Phalan- gists and the Mosiem Druse militia- men more often aim at each other and at Lebanese army forces than at the foreign peace-keeping troops.

        "ocr_text": "Lebanese flee homeland with great sorrow By Marcia Kunstel Special to The Journal-Constitution LARNACA, Cyprus At new Famagusta Inn, seven people from two different families have been boxed into one small room. They are glad to have a place to stay. They are among more than 13,000 refugees who have fled from the bombs of Lebanon in the last month and headed to this island resort town. For some refugees, leaving their homes and country has become almost routine. But that does not mean they like doing it. Nagi Salloun, 21, had to give up his third year of study abroad so that he could help his family in these troubled times. When he does finish school, Salloun wants to return to Beirut as a civil engineer. Even if the hostilities ended tomorrow, it still would be too late for Salloun to make classes this term at the University of Pitts- burgh. He and his parents and two sisters fled Bei- rut last week, after spending a large block of time in underground bomb shelters and after thinking hard about the two previous times their house was damaged in bombings. “We don’t want to leave our country. Our roots are here,” he said, Nonetheless, this is the fourth time they have felt compelled to leave Lebanon for safer territory. His 22-year-old sister Mona expressed misgivings about so many people leaving so often, If this continues, she said, Lebanon “will have no culture. Already it is disappearing.” The decision to go or to stay is always a difficult‘one, but it is harder than normal for the family of Labeed Hawwa. ‘| thought Beirut was safe. But it was like you see cities in the desert. It was a mirage. We thought the government had con- trol, but facts have shown they control nothing,’ — Lebanese native ee Hawwa was transferred to Kuwait for work 10 years ago, This year he decided to bring his family back home to Beirut, mainly so that his chil- dren could get what he believes is superior education at Lebanese schools. Hawwa sent his wife and three children back to Beirut in August, planning to join them there later. “I thought Beirut was safe,” he said. “But it was like you see cities in the desert. It was a mirage. We thought the government had con- trol, but facts have shown they control nothing.” When the fighting became more serious in recent days, Hawwa was concerned desperately and immediately began efforts to get his family out. “I have had no sleep for three nights,” he said, a few hours after he and his children, ages 5, 9 and 11, stepped off the boat in Larnaca and Settled into the new Famagusta Inn. Now he faces what he calls “the decision of my whole future.” “I have now to decide once and for all to go back to Beirut ang live or never go back at all,” Hawwa said, If he delays, Hawwa said, his eldest son never will be able to catch up with other stu- dents in Lebanese schools. Also, he believes that at the age of 43 he has few career options left, | and those will decrease as he gets older. | “The events push me to take immediate ac- | tion.” | Refugees like these two families have filled virtually every hotel room in Larnaca and even are spilling into Nicosia, about 35 miles away. They have prompted the start of passenger ferry service from Beirut to Larnaca, which in- cludes the hulking cruise ships that normally work the Greek isles. The port usually handles cargo only, not people. Those who do not wish to stay here for long have created a demand for more airline flights from the city’s small airport. Despite the inconvenience of tracking down | hotel space; long waits for taxis and frustrating | hours arranging trips at crowded travel agen- cies, many refugees feel lucky that they even can afford to leave the daily dangers and crises visited upon the Beirut area. “If you don’t have the money, you stay with the bombs,” said John Economou, the marketing director of the Hull Blyth Travel Agency in Limassol. He was brought to Larnaca to help field the crush of requests for travel arrange: ments, just as customs officers and airline company staff have been imported from other cities to help meet the needs of the refugees, The refugees are only one portion of the human influx at Larnaca. With the Beirut airport closed due to bomb- ing, Lebanese who were out of the country on business or vacation also find Larnaca the best, if not the only, way to get back home. “Some people have families in Lebanon, and they are worried,” said George Vassiliou, the manager of the Lordos Beach Hotel.

DAMASCUS, Syria — Walid Jumbiatt, the Lebanese Druze lead- er, said last night he will launcha “political’’ counterattack against American intervention in the fight- ing in Lebanon. Noting that Druze Moslem forces would be no match for the US Navy and Marines, he asked, “Who would be fool enough to de- clare war on everybody?” He spoke in an interview short- ly after hearing that US advisers had been present yesterday in the mountain town of Souk al-Gharb, aiding the Lebanese army during the protracted battle for control of its key position overlooking Beirut. His troops had been poised to capture the town when they were repelled by shelling from US vessels off the coast of Lebanon, according to Maj. Robert Jordan of the US Marines. Jumblatt, leader of the break- away Moslem sect trying to drive the government forces and Chris- tian militia from its mountain pow- er base, said his Syrian-backed party, the Progressive Socialist Party. will pursue unspecified countermeasures against the esca- lated American action. “We cannot challenge the Unit- ed States,\" said the tall, slender leader of the party, which is pre- dominantiy Druze. Jumblatt spoke of requesting an explanation of the American mili- tary presence in Souk al-Gharb from the US embassy here or in a wire to President Ronald Reagan. However, the Druze leader did not promise to call his forces out of- the fray. He has maintained throughout 17 days of fighting that Druze -nev- er intentionally fired on Marines stationed in Beirut as a peacekeep- ing force to back the Lebanese gov- ernment. But the Marines repeat- edly have been subjected to bar- rages of shelling from what Ameéri- can military spokesmen identify as Druze positions in the mountains. Also in the interview last night, Jumblatt claimed American and Lebanese government attacks have destroyed four hospitals in recent days, killing at least one civilian nurse. ms That could not be confirmed’:' He also said the Lebanese army and the Lebanese Forces, the miii- tia of the right-wing Christian Pha- Iangist Party. have lost 150: sol- diers in the fighting over Souk ‘al- Gharb.

        "ocr_text": " Right cab driver is a necessity in war-torn Beirut By Marcia Kunstel BEIRU Cox News Service A good taxi driver can be more valuable than bullet-proof vest here. In this divided city, where armed militia band guard their turf more jealously than New York stree gangs, having the wrong driver in the wrong sector ca get both the hack and his rider in deep trouble. Indeed, the story of the taxi drivers may reveal mor about Beirut than any political dissertation. For instance, a dispatcher at Radio Taxi may giv you one cabbie, learn your destination, then suddenl switch you to another. The other day, I wanted to go t the headquarters of the British peacekeeping force in ea Beirut — Christian Phalangist territory. After a quic shuffle of drivers, I finally ended up with a little white haired Christian. _ When I came back for another ride a few hours late my first driver was ready to go again — until, that is, heard.J was headed to the Cadmos Hotel along the wate front.” That's the heartland of the Amal, the Shiite Moslem militia. Radio Taxi sent me with a Druse driver, whos religion is an offshoot of the Moslem faith. For the mo ment, the Druse and Amal have a peace pact. A Druse driver was necessary another day when had to travel deep into the maze of Amal neighborhood leading out of Beirut toward the mountains to the south west. We were stopped by armed militiamen at imprompt roadblocks every couple of hundred yards. A Christiar probably could not have gotten through. A driver who is intimate with his city makes fo healthy passengers. One man cautioned me never to let a taxi drive ove a certain road, one parallel to the road we traversed anc higher: up the hill. He pointed to Lebanese army position above the other road, saying they — and the road — ofte were targets of warring factions. ene a driver for a whole day also can be hazard Cox News Service, unknown date in September 1983 My Christian driver, Ramaz, one day refused to go close to the headquarters of the leftist Druse political party, He would not even drive on the same street, and the second time I went there he parked two streets away, leaving me to walk the last eight blocks to the office. The scariest trip, however, was with the Druse driver Kamal, who happily took me and a colleague to the American peacekeeping force at the airport in west Beirut — Moslem country — then was visibly jolted when asked to drive us up to the Lebanese Defense Ministry in a Christian sector called Yarze. “Tam Druse,” he said. “It is not good for me to go there.” A hit of slow driving and deep thinking later, Kamal silently made up his mind to chance it and started toward Yarze without comment. The Druse are not only enemies of the Christians, they also are battling government troops right now in the mountains ringing Beirut. Our Druse driver easily could have been harassed by soldiers at the ministry while wait- ing for us to finish a press briefing. All morning, shells had sounded in the distance, becoming louder as we approached the ministry on a strangely empty road. — ‘When we unloaded at the ministry, the guards. mo- tioned for us to run cross the 20 yards of open space from the gate to the main entrance. We trotted along, but did not understand the urgency until, five minutes later, a. shell landed just beyond the’ paved entryway. Then another shattered the glass guard- house. As we ran down to the bomb shelter, I wondered at the fate of our driver in the parking lot. An hour or so later, when the soldiers said it might be safe, we ran across the shelled walkway to the remants of the guardhouse, hoping our driver was not only safe but ‘still there. We discovered him in another underground shelter, spattered with blood and anxious to leave as more shells dropped in the vicinity. He led a 10-yard dash to the taxi, careened through the parking lot and down the hill. Was he OK? “Don’t talk; I tell you later,” he said. He did add a breathless warning to keep the windows down, apparently to prevent shattering glass. I found out later that the soldiers had asked him to share their shelter, but several had gotten caught in the explosion of the guardhouse. He went back out to help bring them to safety, getting blood on his clothes but not getting hurt himself. A few minutes after telling of the episode, he was smiling again, explaining how he used to drive every- where during the 1975 war, before he was married and had a child. Now, Kamal said, he usually sticks. to jobs in Moslem west Beirut. \f"

        "ocr_text": " JOSEPH ALBRIGHT/Special PROFESSOR HUDLIN: Tour would excel ‘King Tut’ in worth and foster an interest in Greek heritage. if American professor has his say, ancient Greek art will tour U.S. By Marcia Kunstel Spe to The Journal-Constitution PAESTUM, Italy naked figure springs from a crude diving platform into a patch of blue water below. He is part of a spare, but elegant painting that was closed to the light of the world for nearly 2,500 years. Discovered only in 1968, “The Tomb of the Diver” is among the most revered of ancient Greek paintings. Now the tomb’s five graceful frescoes are candidates for viewing in the United States in an exhibit so massive ele it probably would have to be transporied by the U.S. avy. The logistics are complicated and far from arranged. No one is even certain whether the new Italian govern- ment will allow the ancient artifacts of Paestum to make such an arduous journey. ‘ But Edward E. Hudlin, a project organizer, believes ‘success would bring to America an exhibit rivaling the Egyptian “King Tut” show. To Hudlin, a philosophy professor at Southern Illinois University, the Paestum project is more important than Tut, which he described as artistic and beautiful but noth- ing new. “It didn’t impart new ideas,’ Hudlin said in an inter- view in Paestum. “Here the purpose of the exhibit itself is to educate. “These are the only examples of Greek frescoes in the world,” he added. “They may force a reassessment of our Greek heritage.’ One byproduct of this project, whether it ever culmi- nates in a U.S. exhibit, is the attention Hudlin and his col- leagues are bringing to this relatively little-known archa- ecological wonder. The Paestum site was only discovered in 1752, by workmen building a road through the then-swampy coast- land about 190 miles south of Rome. The main temple is acclaimed as the best preserved, most complete example of ancient Greek architecture. However, the city has not been fully excavated nor its findings fully interpreted and explained. St. Louis already has dibs on the exhibit Hudlin slowly is gathering around the project a corps scholars in archaeology, anthropology, ancient lan- y ages and other disciplines to further explore the treas- & _ures of Paestum. One example is the group of students and faculty from his university who arrived this month at the archa- eological site, which is surrounded by bountiful tomato -farms and seaside resorts favored by middle-class Italian families. The students will spend several weeks scavenging through the ruins, where the corners of unexcavated tombs literally jut out of the soil. But the force driving Hudlin is the prospect of crating up tons of limestone tombs — some prehistoric — and statues, pottery and other artifacts and hauling them to America for a traveling exhibit to major museums. In his home of St. Louis, the city government has given preliminary support in hopes of gaining cultural recognition and bringing a potential moneymaker to town. A delegation including the St. Louis city controller - was in Paestum this month for a conference that provided local officials and civic boosters the ammunition for fund raising. Hudlin has ae cetee that it will take $6 million Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 25, 1983 alipel : Mario Mello, the director of the Institute of Archaeol- ogy at the University of Salerno, said the show will be -hard to organize because of the size of the artifacts and the time span that must be covered to represent the life of the ancient city, which is believed to have existed from about 2000 B.C. to A.D. 500. “It is a very delicate matter,” said Mello, interviewed in the cool of pine trees shading his Paestum home. “There are many tombs, none so beautiful as. the diver, but they contribute to our understanding of the an- cient culture.” The tombs date from several periods, with the diver the sole frescoed burial vault ascribed to the days of Greek dominance. Besides tombs, the show would include artifacts from the temples and ancient houses that form the ruins. Italian minister not likely to oppose idea Mello, who has worked on Paestum for years and supports the exhibition, said local and regional officials have approved the idea. “I don’t believe the (national) minister of culture will oppose it,” he said, providing the appropriate guarantees’ of safety and security are attached. But the temporary export of art has become incres ingly controversial in Italy, with some art experts con- sensitive, irreplaceable artistic heritage. “The general feeling of the civil servants in the Ministry of Culture is that there has been too much lend- ing,” said Alan Dodds, the cultural attache at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. “They consider themselves guardians of the national patrimony. And I don’t blame them.” On the reverse of the issue, he noted, are the art ex- perts who see countless works sitting useless in the base- ments of museums or office buildings because there is no money to restore, exhibit and maintain them. Simply financing the security of art is a distressing problem in Italy, with an estimated 11,000 objects stolen out of the country every year, Dodds said. The loaning of art works to other countries generally is accompanied by restoration or by outright payment to the lending agency, which makes funds available for more Italian art projects. Florence art expert Luigi Belini has been quoted as backing the idea of loan programs. “The art can be restored, shared with others in a safe way, and we can make some money, too,” Belini said. \f"

Khaddam, 51, spoke in an inter- view after the cease-fire formally took effect in neighboring Leba- non. Less than 12 hours earlier he had announced the agreement to stop the fighting. during a brief press conference with Prince Ban- dar ibn Sultan of Saudia Arabia. Prince Bandar had been the chief mediator in the cease-fire talks. Khaddam said the Saudis share the view that the 1600 Marines should leave the peacekeeping posi- tions they have held in southern * Beirut for the last year. “This matter was not raised Boston Globe - September 27, 1983 (Also Philadelphia Inquirer) during the [cease-fire] discussion, although there is a common or joint conclusion between us and the Saudis that the Marines must depart,”\" said Khaddam. His con- tention regarding Saudi view could not be confirmed immediately here. Khaddam said he had not dis- cussed a Marine pullout with Americans involved in the cease fire talks. Staying in Lebanon will risk | even deeper American involve- ment, leading to ‘‘a Vietnamization of Lebanon,” he said, ‘‘which could require an even larger fighting force.”” The foreign minister spoke di- rectly of the Marines, but under questioning said he meant the en- tire multinational peacekeeping force, including British, French and Italian troops, should leave Beirut. i Khaddam, however, did not criticize American conduct in the last few days of hostilities in Leba- non, when US Marines and Navy vessles anchored off Beirut shelled the government opposition to de- fend the Lebanese army. : Khaddam would say little about what direction he expects the talks of the new Lebanese national rec- onciliation council to take, calling it an internal affair of Lebanon. However, he said changes in the government ‘“‘are natural’ to ex- pect. *“*The problem in the situation now in Lebanon is that the rule is not balanced,\" he said. As long as the government re- mains “in the hands of the Phalan- gist Party,’” he said, there will be an imbalance that will prevent pace and security in Lebanon. .- \f"

        "ocr_text": "In wake of truce, By Marcia Kunstel Speciat to The Inquirer DAMASCUS, Syria — Hours after a cease-fire took effect in Lebanon's Shouf Mountains, the Syrian foreign minister warned that the U.S. Ma- rines must withdraw from Lebanon immediately, \"for the sake of inter- national peace and security” and to prevent further American deaths. “We believe that for the sake of establishing peace, stability and se- curity in Lebanon and for the sake of international peace and Security, as well as for the sake of the security of the American citizens who are in the Marines, they must depart,” Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam said in an interview Monday. Western diplomats here said yes- terday that while Syria has frequent- ly criticized the U.S. role in Lebanon, Khaddaim’s was the first public call by a high-ranking Syrian official for the Marines to go home. “We believe they must depart im- mediately,” Khaddam said, “because The Marines’ presence, he warned, might lead to “a Vietnamization of Lebanon.\" If the Marines suffer fur- ther casualties, he said through an interpreter, “the U.S. administration will be compelled to send 10,000 oth- ers and hence it will sink in the region. And the American citizen will pay a lot of blood for an issue which is none of his concern.” In the interview, Khaddam en- gaged in none of the rhetoric about imperialist Western aggressors that fills the official and semi-official me- dia here. He did not even criticize the U.S. forces’ shelling of rebel posi- tions outside Beirut — even though some of those positions, according to both the Marines and the Lebanese government, were in Syrian-held ter- ritory. The Marines have declined to say whether they believed that Syri- ans or their Lebanese rebel allies were manning the posts at the time. Khaddam went so far as to insist that the U.S. forces had not aimed at any Syrian position. syria urges US, to pull Marines out their presence in Lebanon and the direct interference in the internal life in Lebanon and future of Leanon would lead to new complications.” He said the rest of the multination- al peace-keeping force — French, British’ and Italian troops — also | should leave. He did not, however, connect their withdrawal to that of the 50,000 to 60,000 Syrian troops now controlling most of northern and eastern Lebanon. Those troops, too, were initially sent in as peace-keepers — after the Lebanese civil war of 1975-76. In re- cent weeks, the Syrians have backed Lebanese rebels with arms, ammuni- lion, artillery support and advisers, although apparently not with com- bat troops. Khaddam, 51, has been foreign minister since 1970 and is considered part of President Hafez Assad’s inner circle. He spoke in a rare interview granted shortly after the Lebanese cease-fire that he had helped negoti- ate took effect. “Had the Americans shelled the Syrian positions, we would have im- mediately shelled the American posi- tions and certainly the casualties among the Marines would have been great,” he said, “because our soldiers are good: al aiming at targets.\" _ As for the possibility of withdraw- ing Syrian troops from Lebanon, the ‘foreign minister made it clear that - Israel would have to move out first. Before Syria would pull back its forces, he said, “the Israelis would have to withdraw from Lebanon and take along with them the agreement which they imposed, under the force of occupation, on Lebanon.” Khaddam would say little about what changes he expected in Leba- non's government, except to say that as long as it remains “in the hands of the Phalangist party,” it would be fatally off-balance. Lebanese President Amin Gemayel is a Phalangist, but some Syrian gov- ernment observers have said that they believe Syria remains open to The chief mediator in that cease- fire was a Saudi — Prince Bandar bin Sultan — and Khaddam said in the interview that the Saudis shared his view that the Marines should leave the peace-keeping positions they have held in southern Beirut for a year. “This matter was not raised during the [cease-fire] discussions, although there is a common or joint conclu- sion between us and the Saudis that the Marines must depart,” he said. Saudi Arabia is, the United States’ strongest ally in the Arab world, and if Khaddam was correct about the Saudi position it would put strong pressure on U.S. policy. But no Saudi officials were available here for com- _ ment; all had left Damascus right after the cease-fire talks. Khaddam said that he had not dis- cussed a Marine pullout with Ameri- cans involved in the cease-fire talks and that he did not expect the U.S. troops to leave anytime soon. his continued rule as long as other components of the government: are changed to reflect more accurately the population’s Muslim majority. During the interview, Khaddam also confirmed that Syria ordered some members of the Palestine Lib- eration Organization — mostly from Fatah, the dominant faction and the one headed by Yasir Arafat — to _leave the Bekaa Valley in Syrian- occupied eastern Lebanon late’ last week. The PLO guerrillas were sent ‘to the north of the country. Khaddam said the move was made -in response to complaints by ‘resi- dents who had been exposed te fac- tional PLO strife, including open fighting and the raising of road- blocks. wou? _ Others in the government assessed the PLO evacuation as a preventive measure to ensure that the cease-fire is not broken by zealous Palestinian fighters who want to topple the Leba- nese government.

        "ocr_text": "US, Syria to meet on differences By Marcia Kunstel Special to The Inquirer DAMASCUS, Syria — Secretary of State George P. Shultz will meet to- day in Washington with Syrian For- eign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam against a backdrop of increasingly bitter U.S-Syrian relations that some leading Syrians describe as the most hostile in decades. Affairs may not be so frayed as to result in severed diplomatic ties, as happened for a time after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, but both sides talk of a deep distrust that offers little hope for improvement anytime soon. A specific issue Shultz and Khad- dam are expected to address during their meeting today is their govern- ments’ differences over the course Lebanon's future should take now that a cease-fire has been put into effect. “During Reagan’s time the con- frontation between the two coun: tries has come up to the summit,” Syrian Cultural Affairs Minister Na- jah Attar said yesterday in an inter: view. She writes a weekly political column in a Damascus newspaper and is considered an important gov- ernment spokeswoman. “Every Arab is convinced the Is- raelis are expansionist, and the Unit- cd States is defending them,” said Attar, who has headed the ministry, which censors public entertainment, since 1976. “No Arab could imagine that Americans will take a positive step in this area.” Call for withdrawal For his part, Khaddam did not ease tensions Wednesday, when in a speech before the United Nations, he called for the immediate withdrawal of the multinational peace-keeping force from Lebanon and demanded that Israel be kicked out of the world organization. The call for Israel's expulsion from the U.N. was a “gratuitous” insult, the kind of statement that “makes the blood boil in the White House,” one Western source said here yesterday. Syria's connections to the Soviet Union, which supplies large amounts of weapons to the government of President Hafez Assad, is a continu- ing cause of aggravation to the Unit- ed States. So is a perception that Syrian poli- cy proceeds on two levels; Syria may state one goal publicly but is likely to move unannounced in another direc: tion, according Western observers, “Assad serves what he thinks are Syrian national interests,” said a knowledgeable Westerner. “But they have been counter to American in- lerests” in the region. In spite of such comments, West- erners here do not view Syria merely as a Soviet pawn, but rather as a proud, independent nation that works for Arab rather than Soviet goals, Those goals, of course, are diamet: rically opposed to the aims of the United States’ closest ally in the re: gion, Israel, which seized more than 700 square miles of Syrian territory in the Golan Heights during the 1967 and 1973 wars, Syrians cite a list of setbacks going back to the 1978 Camp David accords, | which were engineered by President Jimmy Carter, They say that al though Carter said he wanted a “comprehensive settlement” of Mid: dle Bast problems, he then pressed for a separate agreement beleeen Egypt and Israel, “Since then we have had a sort of doubt as 10 American policymakin,, The Americans did not fulfill their promise,” said a former Syrian offi cial who is still in close touch with developments here, but who asked not to be identified, \"yet Syrians con: tinued to deal with Americans with afl open mind,” More recently, Syria was angered by US. actions in the wake of Isracl’s invasion of Lebanon last year.

        "ocr_text": "Egypt reportedly holds talks with Syria in first contact since Arab rift By Marcia Kunstel Special to The Inquirer JERUSALEM — Syrian and Egyp- tian envoys have been holding talks for the last two months, high-rank- ing Israeli government Officials said yesterday. The contacts would be the first since the Arab bloc broke ties with Egypt for reaching an accord with Israel in the 1978 Camp David talks, and would come at a time of deterio- rating relations between Egypt and Israel. “We have had several reports that there are contacts now between the Syrians and Egyptians. There's quite a few contacts,” said David Kimche, director-general of Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “We believe them,” Kimche said of the reports. _ Kimche, who was a leading figure in the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence service, before he became chief ad- ministrative officer of the Foreign Ministry, said in an interview that the talks were on “the intelligence service level.” In Syria, that would mean that they were being conduct- ‘ed through the Mokhabbart — the military intelligence agency headed by Riffaat Assad, the influential brother of Syrian President Hafez Assad. An Israeli source said the meetings in Damascus had been going on for the last two or three months and were believed to be the first contact between the two countries since Egypt was booted out of the Arab diplomatic community for its rap- prochement with Israel. “We think it’s a link for political discussion,” the source said. He said the apparent thaw in relations be- tween Israel's most ardent enemy, Syria, and its former enemy, Egypt, has not alarmed Israeli leaders. Philadelphia Inquirer - October 12, 1983 Rumors that Syria and Egypt are making tentative moves toward re- establishing some form of relations have been circulating in the Middle East for several weeks. About two weeks ago a Western diplomat in Damascus said he found credible the talk of informal meet- ings between the two. He pointed to the worsening relations between Egypt and Israel since the September 1982 massacres of Palestinian civil- ians at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon. The massacres in Israeli-controlled territory prompted Egypt to withdraw its ambassador to Israel “for consultation.” [In Washington, a bipartisan group of 52 senators, led by Howard M. Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), announced that it had sent a letter to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak yesterday, urging Egypt to return its ambassa- dor to Israel and expressing “deep concern about the current status of relations” between Egypt and Israel, according to a United Press Interna- tional report.] Israeli newspapers have contained bitter commentary in the last week regarding Egypt's conduct, especial- ly since Mubarak told a group of American and Israeli leaders that they should not expect the return of the ambassador unless Israel freezes settlement in occupied lands and withdraws from Lebanon. In the interview yesterday. Kimche admitted that the Israelis were unhappy over current relations with Egypt. “We would like to have seen a much warmer peace than the cold peace we now have. We are very sorry about that. But let me say one thing, despite everything, there is peace,” Kimche said. ‘Mubarak, de- spite everything he is saying, is still swearing allegiance to Camp David, and so are we.” \f"

The nuclear warriors of the Army’s 56th Field Artillery are about to receive their first shipment of new Pershing 2 mis- siles, perhaps as early as Wednesday. This will be the second step in the U.S. deploy- ment that began last week with the basing of cruise missiles at Greenham Common in Great Britain. 4 At a local peace center downtown, ] graduate student Karin Schwenk, 26, talks about the need to keep demonstrating even after the missiles arrive, But she concedes: “It is really difficult for people to see how to gain influence.” The final political barriers in the way | of stationing new _ transcontinental Pershing 2 missiles in Germany will al- most certainly be lifted Tuesday afternoon in Bonn. The Bundestag, West Germany's lower house of parliament, is expected to ap- rove the ‘Meslavel loyment of the new missiles i a margin of about 60 votes in the 496- vote assembly. It will be a bitter party-line vote, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl carrying virtually every deputy in his ruling conservative coalition.

Over the last 10 months, Schmidt has been deserted by his own party members in their rush to embrace the German peace movement. - The thick forests and neat towns in southern West Germany are an unlikely setting for this country’s nuclear trauma. For 20 years Schwaebisch Gmuend has existed unobtrusively inside a ring of 108 Pershing 1 nuclear missiles. At least 18 are kept on 24-hour alert, ever ready to tear out of hidden woodland sites to blow up a piece of the enemy Warsaw Pact. Germans here have learned to coexist peacefully with the Pershing 1s. Now the American Pershing 1s are about to be replaced with a longer-range, more accurate model, the Pershing 2. It is not a popular move in Schwaebisch Gmuend. A poll two months ago showed 56 per- cent of the people in Schwaebisch Gmuend did not want the new missiles deployed in West Germany even if arms control ne- gotiations failed. Throughout West Germany, the com- ing of the Pershings and the prospect of cruise missiles by 1985 have generated fierce opposition. Some analysts have ques- tioned how long West Germany can remain committed to the Western alliance. Few people from this conservative, largely rural countryside have joined the protesters trying to stop the deployment of the Pershing 2s, When about 3,000 pacifists from around Germany blockaded the local Pershing 1 storage yard in September, their ranks included an estimated 50 to 100 local townspeople. There is little overt evidence of hos- tility as deployment day approaches. But the recent poll found 63 percent of the people surveyed supported the objectives of the peace movement. Seldom is an anti-nuke sign to be seen around this city of 60,000 people or in the hamlets. Local Officials in the town, which gave Christian Democrat Kohl a 60 per- cent majority in the last elections, do not oppose the missiles. The local newspaper, the Tages- post, has editorialized that the mis- siles are . However, the necessary Oe ete ee dae es Erich Roth, 28, is a native who as- tTibes the lack of more active protest to the Germans’ propensity for order. He also believes the time for pro- test has passed. “T don't like the missiles in princi- ple, but there’s not much you can do about it,” said Roth, who works in his family’s paint and wall covering store. “If they were going to engage against the missiles, they should have done it five or six years ago, or when the cruise was invented. It’s too late now.” The poll showed 53 percent of the ple contacted here in September Eatteved the Americans are not seri- ously interested in making the arms control talks successful. That kind of thinking has raised questions about whether the Germans will strike a more neutral stance in the East-West debate of the future. Roth gave voice to that attitude. “I think it would be helpful to drift a little more to neutral,” he said “I think it’s time the American govern- ment realizes Germany has grown independent again.” So far, all demonstrations around the Pershing 1 sites have been non- violent. But sources with access to intelligence information say there could well be terrorist attempts in me ee aimed at any site in West identified as affiliated with the Schwaebisch Gmuend is the head- uarters of the 56th Field Artillery the U.S. Army’s only Per- shing unit anywhere in the world.

Another vehicle carries the power station and computer control equip- ment. No official has said publicly where the first of the 108 planned Pershing 2s will be placed. But mili- tary sources have left no doubt that they will replace some of the 108 older Pershing models now in the hands of the 56th Artillery. The West German weekly maga- zine Stern recently cited tagon sources who said the first new nine Pershing 2 launchers and about a dozen Pershing 2 missiles will come here to Schwaebisch Gmuend.

        "ocr_text": "A divided Italy debates role as international peacemaker Haly's strategic position Nation’s long preoccupation with domestic affairs gets boot from Socialist leader By Marcia Kunstel cial to The Journal-Constitution . : ROME he Italian government is breaking away from decades of domestic political preoccupation and is straining to be come an international peacemaker. The recent public debate over whether to oe Italian troops from Lebanon shows how difficult the transition is. The desire to retain Italian influence in the Middle East is en by calls to keep Italian soldiers e. The government took no action in a Cabi- net meeting in early December, but in raising the possibility of an Italian withdrawal from the multinational peacekeeping force in Leba- pon, Italy drew world attention to itself. And it matters to the superpowers what course ly chooses, as it mattered last month when the Italian Parliament held a final debate on deploying U.S.-made NATO nuclear missiles in Sicily. The international spotlight shines stronger on Italy partly because the entire Mediterranean basin has regained strategic importance in recent years, according to Francesco Donofio, a Christian Democratic leader. “No doubt there is a growing awareness that geography puts our country in a more important role,” he said. “I don’t know that Italians would like to see our country involved to the degree it puts our soldiers in danger,” said Donofio, but playing the mediator “is appealing to the na- tionalistic feeling of the people.” ~ Moves into the world arena have quick- efed in the last several years. They have been set on a ferocious pace by Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, the Socialist who took office in August. In the last week of November, Craxi met with the president of Greece, the U.S. ambas- sador to the Geneva arms control talks, the president of Lebanon and the foreign minister of Czechoslovakia. That week Craxi also ventured into the Vatican for the first time as head of state to talk with Pope John Paul II about how to dampen escalating East-West hostilities. e got a formal invitation to visit Roma- nia to discuss the same thing, and he dashed off a zingy letter telling Soviet leader Yuri Rare ne Andropov to stop blaming the West for all the world’s problems. The rupture in the Geneva nuclear arms reduction talks is a preoccupation for Craxi. It led to the apparently unprecedented step toward a joint peace effort with the Vati- can and spurred the prime minister’s renewed gambit of working with the Soviet Union’s Warsaw Pact partners to reduce East-West friction. The leading Italian newspaper, Corriere Della Sera, said Craxi himself wants to medi- ate the missile issue “to embellish his own international image” and to bolster his posi- tion against the Italian Communist Party, which vies for the same leftist votes his So cialist Party seeks. The daily said Craxi also may travel to Hungary and East Germany in pursuit of superpower reconciliation. While Craxi flashes his Socialist creden- tials in dealing with Eastern Europe, he has not forgotten his Western base. “Italy has been a valuable member, not just a participating member, but a valuable member of the alliance,” said a Western diplomat here, referring to Italy’s role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. U.S. leaders are said to give Craxi much credit for keeping at a low level the Italian demonstrations against the U.S. deployment of Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Europe. He has kept the opposition “unbalanced, unfocused,” the diplomat said, by alternating his public oni: on missiles between a hard and a soft li “He’s rock solid on the big issues in pri- vate,” the diplomat said, “though he says pub- licly he’ll compromise.” Still, some of Craxi’s recent diplomatic overtures to the Soviets aroused ire in his own Parliament. For example, protests erupted when he had the Italian ambassador to the Soviet Union appear at a Nov. 7 military parade in Moscow. Western envoys have boycotted it since Russia’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. Craxi, who as head of the Socialist Party toppled four previous governments by with- drawing support, quickly dipped into interna- tional waters last summer after he achieved his long-held ambition of becoming prime But he fared poorly in efforts to mediate Craxi’s invitation to Druse leader Walid Jumblatt to visit Italy for talks was accepted and then canceled when Jumblatt found bet- ter things to do, such as traveling instead to. of former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kiss- in his book “White House Years,” in he said lengthy consultations in Italy were nearly useless.

We don’t have medicine. The hospital is very dirty. There is no oxygen at all,” said an angry young - woman in the throng of doctors ex- iting the dim, grimy corridors of Khartoum Hospital Saturday. The woman, the equivalent of a resident physician in the United States, said she earns the equiva- lent of $65 monthly as a public doc- tor. Senior specialists make about $260 a month. Patients must buy their own sur- gical cotton, hypodermic syringes and medicine, when it is available, the doctors said. Government subsidies for basic goods such as gasoline and sugar have been cut severely, and the Su- danese pound has been devalued several times. Both belt-tightening measures were demanded by the International Monetary Fund in re- turn for loans. Student protests of increasingly harsh political repression — such as the jailing of opposition leaders — and of deteriorating living Standards have turned into street -fights and even riots during the past two years, the most recent only a month ago. But Nimeiri is by no means with- out allies. After the air raid, Nimeiri said Egypt had sent troops to Sudan. The United States sent two AWACS sur- veillance planes to Egypt to bolster Sudan's air defenses to counter “outside aggression.” Sudan is viewed by Washington and Cairo as a strategic, pro-West- ern buffer on Egypt’s southeastern flank. The other nations strung across North Africa and extending down the horn are pro-Soviet. Their aim is protecting Sudan from destabilization by Ethiopia and especially by Libya, which last year promised to finance all revo- lutionary efforts in the region and to dispatch “suicide squads” to neighboring pro-Wéstern govern- ments. Last Friday, Nimeiri’s Sudanese Socialist Union, the nation’s only legal political party, rounded up about 50 truckloads of villagers from a town near Khartoum for a pro-government demonstration. Crying “long live Nimeiri, long live Sudan,” the raucus caravan wound through the capital’s Streets, waving two-foot swords in time to the thumping beat of tribal drums.

The southern tribes are steeped in the traditions of black Africa, in- cluding adherence to Christianity and spirit-worship, whiie north- erners have been oriented to the Arab Islamic Middle East for tens of centuries. But perhaps the bitterest mem- ory in the south is of Arab slave trading, plied at the expense of the black-skinned tribes in the south through the middle of the 19th cen- tury. In 1955, just two years after Su- dan gained independence from the joint control of Great Britain and Egypt, distrustful southerners in the Sudanese military mutinied and began a 17-year civil war. Nimeiri finally ended the overt hostilities with a compact signed in 1972 which created a federation giving the southern provinces semi-autonomy. Last year’s sudden institution of Islamic law, reviled in the south, had been preceded by an even more unpopular move. Nimeiri di- vided the south into smaller units of diluted influence and authority. That helped provoke a mutiny of southern troops last May, and they now are the base of the guerrilla fighters, Unlike the earlier civil war, leaders of this rebellion have not publicly demanded secession of the south. They want reforms, includ- ing an end to Nimeiri's reign. Maj. Gen. Babiker Abdel Rahim Pabiker, a leading military and po- litical figure, said in a recent inter- view that the regular troops are holding their own in the south. But he would not predict a military de- feat of the rebels. “With problems like that, mili- tary actions can never be a solu- tion,” he said. “Military actions can minimize their size or damage.” Dallas Morning News - March 25,1984 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Unrest Costing Sudanese, Outside Firms By Marcia Kunstel Newsday Special Correspondent Khartoum, Sudan — Moments after midnight on Feb. 2, guerrillas opened ‘ fire on the Chevron Qil Co.’s sleeping- barge 500 miles down river from the cap- ital, killing three workers and striking what may be their strongest blow in a resurgent civil war, Chevron quickly dismantled its drill- ing rigs, halting the development of oil fields that represented an $800-million investment. Today, Chevron and other major western companies here are tan- gled in a political struggle costing them and the desperately poor people of Sudan millions of dollars. Chevron reluctantly is preparing to resume, possibly next month, very small-scale seismic testing about 150 miles north of its original site, a spokes- man’said. The company will do so under government prodding, countered by threats of sabotage from rebels in the re- source-rich southern sector of this giant African nation. _ “We've never been in a position like this, where we're a strategic pawn be- tween two opposing forces,” said Olin L. Smith, director of government services for Chevron Oil Co. of Sudan. The company has been in Sudan for a decade.and as of January had drilled 77 wells, of which 36 are capable of produc- tion, Smith said. No one knows when or if more will be drilled, or if the 36 ever will be uncapped. There is no place to put the oil until completion of a pipeline to the Red Sea, which has also been stopped by the domestic unrest. Chevron is not the only foreign com- pany trapped by the violence. In another attack last month, on the Compagnie de Construction Internationale,.one man was killed and six hostages taken — four still are in rebel hands. The French firm has halted all work on the airport it was building in the south’s main city of Juba and on the 260-mile Jonglei Canal, de- signed to open up agricultural land by irrigation and marsh drainage. The Chevron incident has had particu- lar impact, not just because construction and development money has stopped flowing to Sudanese. “The real problem is psychological,” said a European diplomat here. “Oil represents a part of Sudan’s future. That’s a bad strike.” - Responsibility for the two raids was claimed by Anyanya Two, the successor to the Anyanya rebels who fought a 17- year insurrection until reconciliation with the Khartoum government in 1972. The new violence, a legacy of centur- ies of animosity between the Arab Isla- mic north and Christian and animist southerners, grows out of the recent re- districting in the south and the introduc- tion of Islamic law as thes country’s governing civil and criminal code. In the short run the rebels may be hurting their own people. Chevron, for example, had a $1-mil- . lion monthly payroll, two-thirds of which went to southern Sudanese, and was spending about $40,000 a month for local services, according to Smith. The company is now spending $6 million a month just to maintain a skeleton staff and to pay standby costs to contractors, but little goes to the Sudanese. Company officials are not saying how long they will hold on. ! Insurrectionists like John Garang, a Sudanese army colonel who is the prima- ry rebel leader, have said that little is lost-by the oil production cutback be- cause the expected government revenue of $1 million a day never filtered down to the people. a: In the long run, the guerrillas hope to - get better treatment for the region they believe has been neglected, even if that means pressuring President Gaafar Ni- meiry’s regime until it falls. They have threatened to halt economic develop- ment in the south and cut their territory off from the rest of the country until their demands are met. Newsday - March 29, 1984 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Rain gives advantage to Sudan guerrillas Christian rebels fight Moslem regime for control of southern part of nation SN “Red By Marcia Kunstel Speciai to The News JUBA, Sudan — The first rains since December spattered the sand Streets and grass huts in southern Sudan last week, a precursor of the torrents that will fortify black Christian guerrillas fighting the country’s Moslem, pro- Western regime. The rainy season will give rebel fighters two advantages: a military edge over government troops, who are unaccustomed to slogging through sod- den bush country, and a boost toward isolating their southern territory from the rest of Sudan, the largest nation in Africa. The city dwellers of Juba, the big- gest city in the south with 100,000 peo- ple, already are getting a sour taste of the guerrillas’ powers. A rebel raid on a boat in mid-Febru- ary killed an estimated 300 people and halted river traffic that normally trav-- els the milky White Nile River with ba- sic supplies from the north. Normally the boats come weekly, trailing barges loaded with sugar, grain, vegetable oil and building mate- rials, said Jacob Djadobe, the river traf- fic inspector. Prices have increased already, most notably of the staple sorghum, which is used to make bread. The conflict, less than a year old, is the resumption of hostilities ended in 1972 after 17 years of civil war. Once again, the southern black Christians are battling Islamic Arabs who run the government in Khartoum to the north. In the global tug of war, the United States has befriended the government of President Gaafar Nimeiri, so the reb- els have turned to radical Libya and Ethiopia for support. Liga United States has said the mili- 2 ackage to Nimeiri of $165 mil- Dallas Morning News ” Omdurman * Khartoum ENTRAL™ AFRICAN ZAIRE lion is not to be used for wrestling with domestic guerrillas, but for defending itself against outside aggression. The rebels are not seeking seces-_ sion, but have threatened to isolate the resource-laden south, The rainy season will enhance their chances, The rains wash out most and some- times all the land routes leading to pro- visions, so the twisting White Nile, which the guerrillas have shown they can control, becomes the main link to the outside. Telephone service does not exist in Juba, electricity is available in evening only, and the tiny airport is scheduled to be served thrice-weekly by Sudan Airways. With access to rebel areas cut off by the government, and communications throughout Sudan always poor, specif- ics of guerrilla success are difficult to gauge. But officials in the south scoff at the notion that the rebels can snatch the region from the government, much as they have kidnapped foreign mission- aries and workers of the Western com- panies trying to fashion economic de- velopment out of the bush. “] think they're losing wind. Their operations have inflicted no losses on the army,” said Caesar Loyalala Bayeh, the regional agriculture minister. “They have not caused any harm to anyone except poor civilians and expa- triots who cannot defend themselves.” A military spokesman estimated the army’s losses at a low 2 to 3 percent of those involved in any given skirmish, and said he thinks the rebels are “los- ing after their last attacks a month or two months ago.” The rebels, called Anyanya Two af- ter the southerners who fought the original civil war, have mounted no ac- tion in this part of the south. But their violent attacks further north have chased away Western com- panies engaged in major economic de- velopments. A senior military security officer from the Upper Nile region, who fought in the earlier war but has not mutinied this time, is bitterly critical of the government and of Chevron oil, one of the companies driven away by guerrilla raids. Southerners do not trust the govern- ment to share with them any economic benefit from Chevron’s oil production, he said, although the oil comes from under their own soil. The hostilities will not end until the company and the government agree to build a refinery in the south, he said. Chevron and the Nimeiri regime are jointly sponsoring a pipeline that will take oil — if oil development ever resumes — from southern wells to northern Port Sudan for export. One official of an international agency said about the rebels’ prospects: “In World War II the Russians said their best general is General Winter. The rebels might say their best general is General Rain.” - April 1, 1984 (Also in Newsday) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Libyans Raze Battle Site By Marcia Kunstel Newsday Special Correspondent Tripoli, Libya — The bullet-pocked walls of the apartment house where anti-Khadafy commandos died this week collapsed in a choking swirl of concrete dust last night under repeated assaults by a fleet of yellow bulldozers. “This isdone. . . to give a lesson to anyone who is going to try this game again,” said Hassan al Kassah, a member of the neighborhood Revolutionary People’s Committee. Government spokesmen now deny their original story about the fighting, which was that a band of terrorists had assaulted a barracks where Col. Moam- mar Khadafy, Libya’s leader, usually lives and works. In the latest version, the rebels were thwarted by se- curity officers, who then counter-attacked the apart- ment house when they learned that more terrorists were there. Demolition of the four-story building that was the focus of Tuesday’s fighting was part of a crackdown on anti-government activity. The Khadafy regime has barred Arabs from leav- ing the country to prevent the flight of suspects, ac- cording to a western diplomatic source, who described the action as highly unusual. And security forces yesterday issued a call for in- formation on three young men whose photographs and names were published in the state-run newspaper New Dawn and who were identified as part of the “terrorist” group involved in Tuesday’s siege. A pro-government demonstration drew about 1,000 slogan-chanting people yesterday morning. Most were students in green or beige military-style uniforms, brought by buses for the event. A few hun- dred were middle-aged or older. At the apartment-house demolition, Kassah said he had been involved in the assault, which he report- ed resulted in the death of eight suspected terrorists and the arrest of four others. Earlier reports indicated that as many as 20 per- sons were cornered in the building, and that all were killed except for two men captured alive. Other de- tails also remain unclear. Kassah, 36, said the people’s committee security forces had learned of the nest of terrorists in the apartment building last week. On Tuesday, at about 8 AM, the committee went to the building and asked the young men to surrender. They refused, Kassah said, and took women and children in neighboring apartments as hostages. Dur- ing negotiations, the suspects opened fire and the se- curity forces attacked with smoke bombs, pistols and automatic weapons, he said. | Kassah said no hostages, other civilians or security forces were hurt — although one government source close to Khadafy said several hostages were wounded - and diplomatic sources have given similar reports.

        "ocr_text": "afy plot suspect Libya says killed By Marcia Kunstel 0°: * Special to The Inquirer 3 2 ~ . TRIPOLI, Libya — Libyan forces have scored a major hit in their hunt for a band of armed dissidents by killing the leader of an apparent at- tempt to assassinate Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy, the government said yesterday. The official JANA news agency . Said marksmen of a Revolutionary ._People’s Committee, shooting from the ground late Saturday night, hit the young Libyan fugitive on the rooftop of a four-story building. The _™Man killed was identified as Wajdi Shwedi, a student about 24 years old. The shooting,occurred about half a . Mile from the apartment house where at least seven other key mem- bers of the underground movement were killed and five were arrested Tuesday shortly after loyalist troops bed ies the attack on Khadafy’s bar- racks. Western sources here said they be- lieved the dissident band to be seri- ously crippled, but not eliminated. That may explain why Khadafy did not appear at a demonstration yester- day by 10,000 to 15,c00 people who had gathered under a blazing sun to rally in support of his regime. Security forces of the revolution- ary committees, which run every- thing here from neighborhood af- fairs to utilities, received information from nearby residents that Shwedi was at an apartment building in central Tripoli, a govern- ment spokesman said. When the security forces sur- rounded the building, the spokes- man said, the suspect fired two shots into the air and then was shot by those on the ground. The spokesman said his shots may have been a warn- ing to comrades. Two bursts of gunfire, of fewer than a dozen shots each, were heard about 11:45 p.m. from a nearby hotel. Libyan Radio said Shwedi was “with companions,” but it did not say what happened to the others. On Thursday, the Libyan newspa- per New Dawn _ published photo- hs of three young men it said eet were wanfed in connection with the gang of dissidents. The government spokesmalh said yesterday that two of. them had been captured before Shwedi was killed: The‘government has been-describing the,dissidents as Muslim fundamentalists, similar to the extremists who killed Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and to those who have tried. to overthrow the Syrian government. - There have been several attempts on Khadafy’s life since he took over Libya in 1969 in a military coup, but the one on Tuesday came at a time of rising discontent, according to West- ern diplomats here. In recent months Khadafy has un- dertaken a further radicalization of his socialist government, proclaim- ing that private services such as beauty shops and bakeries would be- come public. Major industry and commercial operations already are nationalized or are run as coopera- tives. - 7 Khadafy also has reduced the availability of ‘so-called luxury goods, perhaps less from revolution- ary fervor than because weakening oil revenues have forced the curtail- ing of imports. _ “This will lead more and more peo- ple to pass from passivity to angri- ness with the regime,” one European here said. The_discovery of an organized un- derground — an internal opposition made up of Libyans, not exiles or foreigners — could lead to more vo- i discontent, another European said. But neither Said he believed that would translate into a mass move- ment against the Khadafy regime any time soon. The government still manages to turn out respectable-sized rallies ina short period of time, as it did yester- day on just two days’ notice. Thou- sands of people, about three-fourths of them under 30, walked or were ’ bused into the city for three hours of screaming pro-revolution, anti-reac-. tionary slogans. They then departed almost simul- taneously, as though dismissed from School. . Philadelphia Inquirer - May 14, 1984 (also in Newsday, Dallas Morning News) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Libya: Texas bank linked to rebels By Marcia Kunstel Special to The Globe TRIPOLI - Libya gave details yesterday of what it called a plot by the United States and Britain to in- filtrate Libya with a group of 20 terrorists who would destabilize the government through assassi- nations and attacks on key instal- lations. Justice Minister Mufta Kaebi said the Central Intelligence Agen- cy recruited the terrorists, many of whom have been killed or captured in an intense manhunt during the past week. The shootout in a downtown residential area last Tuesday, in which eight men were killed, brought to light the existence of an armed movement opposed to Col. Moammar Khadafy. Both the United States and Brit- ain have denied supporting the gunmen involved in Tuesday's fi hting, an allegation made by adafy the day after the attack. Kaebi also made the first official denial of a widely circulated story that the battle spun out of an as- sassination attempt on Khadafy. The authorities say they simply ~ learned where the men's sell ters were, told them to surrender, then returned fire when the terror- ists started shopting from their apartment. At a press conference yesterday Kaebi, who refused to answer ques- tions, gave details of what investi- gators said they found in the apart- ment and in the possession of oth- ers in the group who have been caught or killed since May 6. Most documentation was in Arabic, but Kaebi also showed a paper he said was from Texas American Bank in Burleson, Tex- as, and bore the name of a bank officer and an account balance of $12,287 as of September 1983. It was found on one of the rebels and supposedly showed his account status, the minister said. A small arsenal of pistols, hand grenades and submachine guns were there, along with neatly stacked piles of US dollars and Lib- yan dinars worth $80,000, he said. Kaebi alleged the CIA recruited the men in West Germany, the United States and the United King- dom, paid them, and trained them with British aid at a camp called Jebel Awlia near Khartoum, the capital of neighboring Sudan. The minister produced what he said was a list of objectives ob- tained from the killed or captured men, showing as targets key instal- lations such as radio and television stations, the airport, docks and meeting halls of the Peoples’ Com- mittees. Whatever the genesis of the un- derground movement, few seem to doubt a guerrilla band has been ac- tive in Tripoli, has had plans for major sabotage and has been the subject of a dragnet so intense that the usually bustling streets of Trip- oli still carried only modest traffic yesterday. For days after the incident, the military, the police and the well- armed civilian peoples committee militias commanded roadblocks peppering the capital's streets. On Wednesday night it took more than two hours to drive 16 miles in light traffic from the airport to a down- town hotel because of repeated se- curity checks. A European diplomat said the government had closed the borders to any Arabs who wished to leave the country, in a move to prevent the flight of suspects. On Thursday, the daily newspa- per New Dawn showed the hunt was still on, publishing the photo- graphs and names of three young Libyan men identified as Western- educated terrorists connected to the group broken up Tuesday. It said security officials were asking Libyans to report any information about them. On Thursday night, the government sent a graphic warning to opponents and anyone who might harbor them — the walls of the four-story apartment build- ing where the rebels had their apartment crashed in a choking swirl of dirt and concrete dust, un- der repeated assaults by bulldoz- ers. What happened at the building Tuesday morning remains the sub- ject of conflicting stories. Hassan al Kassah, a member of the neighbor- hood revolutionary peoples com- mittee and a supporter of the Khad- dafy regime, explained the govern- ment version of events. He said the peoples committee security forces had learned of a nest of terrorists in the apartment building several days earlier. A government spokesman said Friday that the information came from a known opposition leader who was killed May 6 shortly after stealing across the Tunisian border into Libya. On his body were found the names of opposition figures, their headquarters address and a list of assassination and bombing targets. Kassah said security teams went to the building Tuesday morning to confront the men, de- scribed as in their early and mid 20s, and asked them to surrender. They refused, Kassah said, and took women and children in neigh- boring apartments as hostages. A period of negotiation followed, but the suspects opened fire and the se- curity forces launched an attack with smoke bombs, pistols and automatic weapons, he said. He said no hostages, other civil- ians or security forces were injured, and no military personnel were in- volved. One government source close to Khadafy said, however, that several hostages were injured, and diplomatic sources have given unconfirmed. reports of additional injuries. The most prevalent unofficial version says 15 rebels stormed the military barracks where Khadafy often sleeps, works and receives visitors, killing a number of the elite, red beret military corps and shooting into the tent Khadafy uses. They fled after discovering Kha- dafy was not there, one diplomat said, although three were killed at the barracks. The rest holed up in: the apartment house about a mile away.

The agency mainly is a watchdog over countries that do not at pres- ent have the bomb, but it only goes where invited. For example, Pakistan and Israel both are IAEA members, but both are believed in some quarters to be working on building nuclear weap- ons. And both have denied the agency access to their most sensi- tive facilities. “The best thing you can compare us to is an external auditor,’ said Georges Delcoigne, the IAEA spokesman.

        "ocr_text": "eypt suspects Libya in blasts Mubarak comments as minesweepers assemble in Red Sea By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News CAIRO, Egypt — As a multina- tional task force of minesweepers begins to assemble in the Red Sea, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he suspected Libya was most likely responsible for the blasts, which have damaged at least 16 commerical ships. British warships were expected to pass through the Suez Canal Tuesday night, and U.S. minesweep- ing units were due in the Gulf of Suez Wednesday. Two French minesweepers and a support vessel were also en route to the Gulf of Suez, and Italy is considering send- ing help. A British diplomatic source said the United States and Britain will share minesweeping duties in the Gulf of Suez, with the four Royal Navy ships expected to begin work in the northern gulf by Wednesday. At a news conference, Mubarak said: “I believe the Libyans did it, but until now we are waiting to find a mine to confirm our suspicions.” Officials have focused their at- tention on a Libyan vessel, Ghat, which a shipping log shows passed through the Suez Canal on July 6, three days before the first explo- sion. The agent who kept the log at Port Tewfik, on the southern tip of the canal, said Monday that the Li- byan ship was a “roll-on roll-off” vessel used to transport about 500 new automobiles. The agent, Hussein El Shaffee, said the ship was Italian-made and was the last one in the north-to- south convoy to pass through the canal that day. It also is the last Li- byan ship that has navigated the canal, he said. British officials said that kind of ship is ideally suited for mine sow- ing. mA pretty typical way of laying mines is to weld a couple of railway lines in the hull ... and roll the mines off,” a British official said. The Egyptians have yet to admit that there are mines in the waters surrounding its lucrative Suez Canal, preferring to refer to myste- rious explosions. The problem was not made pub- lic until the insurance company Lloyd's of London confirmed that explosions had been damaging ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez. That is when the Egyptian gov- ernment made its appeal for help to the international community. A British diplomat said Monday that the delay could hamper the ef- fectiveness of the mine hunt. Ground mines, he said, the kind that are dumped off a ship and sink to the sea bottom, can become harder to detect with the passage of time. “If it is dropped in mud, it gets covered up and is more difficult to spot,” he said. The search for mines is not too dangerous, the diplomat said, espe- cially for the British ships with wooden hulls. They are unlikely to set off mines of the sort that are det- onated by magnetic attraction to metal ships. In less danger are the US. heli copters dragging sonar detectors at the end of a long line, which en ables detection in exceptiona}] deep water. — ake The recovery of the mines ries more danger, he said. It cowid be done through a variety of meth ods, from underwater vehicles te frogmen. ~“All options are available,” the naval expert said. Dallas Morning News - August 14, 1984 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Lrip on Troubled Waters By Marcia Kunstel Newsday Special Correspondent Aboard the El Tor — The ship’s bridge was illumined by the moon and the light of the chart desk, where Capt. Ahmed Souka pointed to small drawings newly pencilled onto the shipping maps that guide his route down the Gulf of Suez and across the Red Sea. Cartoon-like exploding boxes showed where suspicious objects had been sighted. “This tells that some ship saw a floating something. It could be an empty drum,” said Souka, captain of a ferry that this night carried 1,180 pas- sengers from Suez in Egypt to Jordan’s Aqaba. Two-thirds of the 17-hour trip is through waters believed to be infest- ed with unexploded mines. “We have passed that one three times, and nothing,” he said, resting his pencil on the drawing closest to the ship’s position. He stopped short of dismissing the possibility that the objects could be mines, like those which mysteriously have exploded and damaged 18 ships in these waters and farther down the Red Sea over the past month. He took the. sightings seriously enough to mark them on his charts as soon as the government radio stations —Continued on Page 15 —Continued from Page 7 in Saudia Arabia and Egypt tapped out warnings in Morse code. And the 41-year-old Egyptian commander has stationed extra crew members as daytime loo- kouts, demanding extra attention every time the ferry approaches a spot newly marked on the charts. “They’re under order to report any sighting immediately,” he told two reporters who joined his Tuesday overnight voyage. Although the Egyptian government has asked the American, British, French and Italian navies to help find and get rid of the mines menacing some of the world’s busiest shipping channels, the people on the El Tor seemed oblivious to danger. Most of them were laborers returning from vaca- tion to jobs in Iraq or Saudia Arabia and their over- riding concern was snatching a chair or a spot on deck to throw their blankets for the night. In the first- and second-class cabins, passengers tended to wailing babies or tried to forget jobs and babies and mines with a cold beer and loudspeaker seranades by Frank Sinatra and the Beatles. After a four-hour dinner, the “luxury” passengers settled into the lounge for tea and the nightly Egyp- tian television news. There was no visible reaction when the newscast turned to the crisis of mines in the waters they were sailing at that moment. Early in the trip Tuesday a man named Fuad watched the mountainous Egyptian horizon recede and told how he feared driving through winding mountain roads more than negotiating mined wa- ters in the El Tor. “ He was en route to his job as a microfilmer in- Kuwait with his wife and 3-year-old daughter, and expressed no fears for his family’s safety. “Our government has taken care of it,” he said of the mines. “The Americans and French have cleared the mines. I’m sure of it.” That was before the specialized mine hunting ships even had arrived at the gulf. ; At dawn yesterday, when a molten sun began its rise over the Red Sea, other undaunted sailors ap- peared on the water, from freighters and tankers to small fishing boats. The ships had been seen in the night over the El Tor’s radar, proving that the fer- ry was traveling in the main endangered lane that carries ships south down the Gulf of Suez, most of them from the vital shipping link, the Suez-Canal. Souka was less worried about the scars a mine would inflict on his vessel, a 300-footer weighing 4,607 tons, than on the emotional] tremors an ex- plosion would send through his passengers. Most of what he called “the accidents” have shaken the ships and broken glass, he said, but not damaged the hulls. “Of course I am worried about the ship and the passengers on the ship, the panic if we met sucha mine. Most of them are laborers and are not well- educated.” The crew’s weekly evacuation drill is more intense now, Souka said, and the inspection of lifeboats and safety equipment is made ever three days instead of once a week. “The crew, I try to keep them calm and stable,’ said the captain, who found the seas safe enough to bring along his own young son for a summer ride, Newsday - August 16, 1984 (Also in Dallas Morning News) \f"

The hunt got a boost Friday and Saturday, when four British mine- searching ships and four U‘S. anti- mine helicopters went into action. Military figures said they expect the expensive, specialized equip- ment to ply the gulf for weeks. Officials had said last week that the Navy oceanographic ship Hark- ness was on the hunt, but the ship has been exploring for mines as early as Aug. 4, and divers already have been used to examine suspi- cious objects spotted by the ship’s sonar gear. According to the insurance com- pany Lloyd’s of London, 18 ships have been damaged during amonth of mysterious explosions in the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea. One Military official said Saturday that 22 explosions have been tallied in the gulf and the adjacent Red Sea but that not all have damaged ships. Of the seven explosions that have damaged ships in the Gulf of Suez, five happened on the same day, July 28, and one on July 27, ac- cording to the Lloyd’s of London list, although some were not re- ported until the ships reached their destination ports. ' That raises the possibility that the mines have a time-delay mecha- nism similar to a time bomb, oOffi- Cials said. U.S. military sources also re- vealed the Navy has examined two damaged ships and determined they were subjected to external ex- Plosions. . “There was definitely something exploding in the water,” one mili- tary authority said. “Our initial con- Clusion is that the mines were from the (sea) bottom.” Mines can be dropped onto the sea floor, can be floaters tied to Moors or simply can float on the Surface.

A spokesman for the Salvage As- sociation, a world-renowned firm of ship damage appraisers, supported Egypt’s cautious approach. In a telephone interview from London Friday, he said his crews have examined about six of the ships and have found no physical proof of what — a mine or other- wise — caused the damage. “We have asked them (the ap- praisers) to determine the actual cause, but we have no information yet,” he said. “We would like to know ourselves.” Besides the U.S. military, other non-Egyptian military sources also seemed convinced mines are be- hind the explosions. “T’ve seen the damage reports for the boats,” one source said Satur- The Dallas Morning News Gay. “The damage is consistent with amine.” The mine hunt will not be easy - in the 170-mile-long gulf that con- tains some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. All ships enter- ing or exiting the south end of the Suez Canal must pass through the gulf, which carries local commer- cial traffic as well. ; Besides bearing oil oF mer- chandise, ships in this season carry thousands of Moslems on their an- nual pilgrimage to Mecca. “There are 100 ship movements a day in this area and everybody is chucking their garbage over the side,” one military source said. “An oil drum looks just like a mine.” Sonar equipment, which Sends out sound waves that bounce back a picture of what is on the s€4 bed, cannot always differentiate 4n oj] barrel from a coral reef, or ffom a mine.

Sea Stal- lion helicopters. “The helicopter is in irons, as it were,” said a U.S. mili- tary expert, explaining that choppers drag their sound-wave gear through the water and cannot turn quickly. He said the Egyptian navy is working the area to keep merchant ships at safe distances. Military sources from two coun- tries said their first aim is recover- ing a mine, so they can learn the best and safest ways to detonate them. They then can simulate the sound or magnetic field or pressure that would set off the mines if a ship passed over them. A mine explosion leaves no shrapnel, so there are no identify- ing bits to find in the sea. Even re- covering a mine will not assuredly reveal its owner.

Moammar Khadafy’s command as he inaugurated a $3-billion “man-made river” that could revolutionize life in his arid country as much as his 15 years of radical politics have done. “This is the true face of Libya, not terrorism,” Khadafy proclaimed to hundreds of foreign dignitaries and Libyans from area settlements. They had come to an isolated construction site, surrounded by miles of brown, flat and empty desert, for the ceremony officially opening the “great man-made river project” and unofficially beginning festivities for the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 1, 1969, revolution, which brought Khaddafy to power, An arch outlined in small white lights marked the camp’s main entry, and atop it sat a blown-up portrait of the leader. The “great man-made river” is two pipelines of steel-reinforced con- crete that eventually are planned to carry water from deep wells in the southeast up to the Mediterranean coastal cities of Sirte in the east and Benghazi in the west.

A:-Senior French diplomat in Tripoli ‘said the issue is “purely a commercial dispute” and has no relation to the explosions. Khwildi spoke in a polite two-hour inter- “view Wednesday at the six-story headquar- ‘ters of the General National Maritime blamed the CIA for the Ghat’s seizure. Personnel in the Libyan shipping com- pany heard the news that the French had detained the ship over a Voice of America Fadio broadcast, he said. But when Khwildi contacted the ship via radio-telephone, he ‘said, chief officer Mohamad Tata replied that the ship had not been seized. It was not until later that the French au- thorities took over the ship, Khwildi said, questioning how the VOA could broadcast the news item before it took place. The French entered and searched the vessel in violation of maritime regulations, he said, and demanded that all costs to Li- bya be repaid, including the cost of dam- ages to the shipping company reputation. “We are in a position to say the French made an aggression against our country” if they advanced on the Ghat because of the Red Sea mine mystery, he said. Turning to the controversy around the Ghat’s activities in the Gulf of Suez and Red Sea, Khwildi denied the vessel carried “ex- plosives.” When asked whether “arms and ammun- ition” were among its cargo, as has been re- ported, he did not answer directly. Khwildi said only that the ship held 1,500 tons of “general cargo.” The copy of the ship’s manifest he dis- played, however, said the Ghat had 1,500 Ss general cargo, of which 900 tons was Transport Corp.

Besides addressing the Aug. 21 seizure of — the Ghat at the port of Marseilles, Khwildi also spoke at length about why he believes the ship could not have sown the mines - that have damaged 18 vessels in the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea since July 9. His primary defense is that the Ghat is too old; too poorly equipped and inade- quately staffed to have performed what he said was a very technical military opera- tion. .Also, Khwildi said, the Egyptians are so suspicious of Libyans they never would have let a Libyan ship pass through the Suez Canal with explosives. “I think that Egypt has got a lot of prob- lems with us, and if we do something wrong, we cannot do it while the sun shines,” he said, referring not only to day- — light, but also to the close scrutiny of canal - authorities. Egyptian officials have singled out Li- bya as a likely culprit in the minings, and designated “IMCO 1.” The IMCO is the Intergovernmental Mar. itime Consultative Organization, a b of the United Nations that assigns classes. The “i” stands for “exp cargo. “do not think our vessel, the state and the state of the crew itself is capable c doing this thing,” Khwiidi said. The ship, a Finnish make, was ‘built in 1973 and “is nearly consumed,” he said. Maritime sources in Tripoli said the cap- tain of the Ghat, Sadek Mohamad, is a re- tired naval commander. Western military experts in Cairo ‘re- peatedly said mines are easy to make and easy to plant from a roll-on, roll-off ship like the Ghat, which has a hatch thatopens directly onto a dock fer easy access. Khwildi confirmed the Ghat is a roll-on, roll-off ship. In a related development, three Italian minesweepers and a support ship entered the Gulf of Suez Wednesday to help clear those waters of mines.

Khadafy maintains a socialist State theoretically run by a series of popular congresses without politi- cal parties, although most outside observers consider his the final word on key national decisions. The Libyan news media is government- comtrolled and the liberties prac- ticed in Morocco are unknown. “The two countries are the most different of the Arab world. They have nothing in common,” said a Western diplomat whose country has close relations with both north African nations. “The forces are moving now,” he said, foreseeing more realignments that could seriously unsettle the area. The practical effect of the ‘“‘un- ion,” as it is called in Libya, re- mains cloudy. The pact does leave Morocco and Libya free to follow their divergent political systems. “This is not a fusion. It is a un- ion, an arrangement of reason,” said a source close to the Morroccan diplomatic mission in Libya. “It is economic and cultural and political, in the development of common foreign poli a Libyans approve ‘unity’ pact By \"Sp The Aug. 13 pact between the heads of state calls each to respect the other’s territorial integrity ‘and. for joint actions in spheres of eco- nomics culture and foreign policy.

A former French protectorate, Morocco trades primarily with the West and has kept warm relations and strong security ties with the United States. A U.S. State Department spokes- man sent a clear message to Morocco after learning of the agree- ment: “We have seen no evidence that Khadafy is trying to modify his behavior, and we would obviously be concerned about any steps which would serve to legitimize his position in any way.” = The Moroccan close to dipig- matic circles agreed it is difficult to envision his nation and Libya de veloping a common policy regarg- ing the United States. ‘That is the question everyone is discussing,” he said. Still, Khadafy has made peace in- itiatives to the United States. He sent a message to President Reagan through Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, expressing a de- sire for better relaitons.

He created concentric circles of peoples congresses that theoreti- cally make all important decision, local and national. Control is widely considered to reside in the hands of a few, accord- ing to foreigners in Tripoli whose business is watching Libya func- tion.

The northern two-thirds of Su- dan claims Arabic extraction and are mostly Moslems, while the south holds primarily black Afri- cans who are Christians or spirit worshippers. Last month, Nimeiry seemed to wave an olive branch at the south- erners, and possibly at foreign de- tractors, in a speech in which he asked the rebels to come home to talk. The rebels did not respond. Sudan's key position between Li- bya and Marxist Ethiopia, which make it a buffer for Egypt, also make Nimeiry’s friendship a valued item in Washington. Sudan is wooed with political support and aid totaling nearly $250 million this year. But Sudan’s turn to extreme fun- damentalist Islam and handling of economic problems has raised some concern.

Feared Abducted in Sudan The attack and apparent abduc- tion took place between Sept. 4 and. Sept. 7, but the news did not get out until Sept. 11, a church spokesman, the Rev. Daniel Adwok, said, The priests had refused to abandon their river mission near Bentiu, 125 miles north of the White Nile River city of Malakal, despite pleas and warn- ings from the church that their posi- tion was becoming increasingly dangerous. “We asked everybody to report back to Malakal last February,” said Adwok. At that time, the missionaries ac- ceded to Bishop Vincent Mojwok’s re- quest, Adwok said. They left in March, shortly after a minor attack by rebels at Malakal and the devas- tating ambush of the Chevron Oil base camp in Bentiu, where three workers were killed and seven in- jured. But the three priests returned to Bentiu shortly after Easter, Ad- wok said, “Father Major doesn’t like to stay in Malakal,” Adwok said, “He wanted to stay among the people.” Trouble returned to the south about a year ago when President Gaafar Ni- meiry proclaimed Moslem law and took several other actions that stirred the barely submerged hostilities of the south. Nimeiry negotiated the end to the war in 1972. The southerners are predominantly Christian or tribal worshipers of spir- its, and Nimeiry’s power is based in the Moslem majority in the north. One church source said Chevron, which stopped all oil exploration after the February attack, has been keeping its equipment on church land, The company was targeted by guerrillas who felt the oil company furthered government discrimination toward the south. The rebels have complained southerners will not benefit from the oil unless a refinery is built here. . Newsday - September 16, 1984 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Egyptian paper suspects Libyan ship in gulf mining By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News CAIRO, Egypt — The semiofficial Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram made the most direct charge to date Tuesday against Libya as the force behind the Gulf of Suez and Red Sea explosions, saying “the finger of ac- cusation points strongly” at a Li- byan-owned ship. ~ Ina front-page news article, the newspaper repeated information al- the length of the Red Sea, finally re- turning to the canal on July 22 without stopping at any port. However, a--spokesman for Lioyd’s of London said in a tele. phone interview that it learned from an agent that the Ghat did stop at the port of Aseb in Ethiopia, It said the Ghat arrived off Aseb on July 10, entered the harbor July igandleftthe port July17, The Ghat's agent in Ethiopia i ready published in the Western press about the ship, but added an assertion that the Ghat’s civilian crew had been replaced with acrew from the Libyan Navy. Al Ahram said the details about the Ghat surfaced during the cur- rent multinational search for mines. Egypt, Britain and the United States are searching the Gulf of Suez and Red Sea for mines that are refused to give any information about the Ghat, including whether it ever arrived or what it carried to the port. Records in Cairo showed only that the Ghat had listed its des: tination at Aseb, but did not indi- cate whether the. ship. actually sailed the entire course, ‘ If a 1 single ship were responsible for sowing the mines, it would have had to have followed stich a course, Clusters of explosions have rocked believed to have damaged at least 18 commercial ships. Lloyd’s of London, which had re- ported that 19 vessels had been hit, said Tuesday that new information confirmed suspicions that a major explosion on the Liberian-owned Oceanic Energy was caused by a faulty boiler, not a mine. Al Ahram said the Ghat crossed the canal on July 6, then sailed _ through the gulf and on through ships in three locations: north of the Gulf of Suez just below the canal, in the southern gulf bay around oil drilling rigs and in the southern tip of the Red Sea. The records in Cairo also showed the Ghat was carrying a cargo that included arms and ammunition. Although Al Ahram did not cite such records, it claimed certain knowledge that Libya recently pur- chased sea mines from Italy. Dallas Morning News - September 22, 1984 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Apple Orchard Signals Libya’s Venture Into Social Engineering By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to The Blade HARIYAN, Libya — Bushy ap- ple trees in precise rows seem innocent harbingers of the new radical] phase into which Moammar Khaddafy is pushing his Libyan revo- lution. The green tree lines that break into the landscape’s drab monotony are among the many agricultural ex- periments that he hopes will carry his desert nation to self-sufficiency. But the orchards, 60 miles south of Tripoli, also hold a taste of some unsavory social engineering that the visionary, unpredictable and seem- ingly rejuvenated revolutionary lead- er has in mind. , THESE TREES are the product of forced labor. And the colonel now is talking about a full-scale population redis- tribution that would move “para- sites” from the cities to work more developing desert farmlands. — “Services should be given only to those who produce for society in these cities,\" he said in a recent Speech. “As far as the others are concerned, there is no need for their remaining in cities.” . . In speeches delivered during the celebration of the Sept. 1, 1969, coup that brought him to power 15 years ago he chastized Libyans for the filth invading streets and public places, bemoaned the reliance on foreign workers and demanded the abandon- ment of luxuries. “That anyone makes a revolution and then leaves it there is indeed stupidity,” Libya’s 42-year-old politi- cal guru said, pleading that he, per- sonally, is about to spirit Africa’s fourth largest nation into “a new Stage of struggle.” HIS PROBLEM is that a third of the 3.8 million population lives in Tripoli and 80 per cent in the coastal lowlands. The trouble was clear in the rural, semi-arid district of Ghariyan, where 3,000-foot mountains descend into rocky desert. One agricultural project begun in 1975 still has not found the 420 fami- lies needed to work its farms, even though land, new houses and other subsidies are given free, according to Mohammad Mussa, secretary of the General People’s Committee which administers the district. A similar project for family-run __ Sheep farms is being revamned. an administrator said, because Libyans would not submit themselves to life in the dry, drab countryside. “THE STATE has_ resorted to forced labor in the irrigated apple orchards. The 200,000 trees are tended by local students and soldiers and factory workers, assigned to work there without pay and in addi- tion to their regular duties. Another 400,000 trees are planned. “We believe that in projects that don’t need specialized training that all the people must do it,”” Mr. Mussa explains. The desert must bloom so Libya does not rely solely on oil sales, he says. Mr. Khaddafy called on Libyans to be self-sufficient ‘‘to liberate our needs from foreign control.” A great man-made river project, which Mr. Khaddafy proudly in- aucurated last month, will make more desert land arable by piping water from underground pools in the southeast up the desert and across the coast. There will be more farms to work. Most desert towns will be able to support industry. In one address Mr. Khaddafy en- visioned a “mobile revolutionary force” that would mobilize the trans- fer of people, schools, industry and other institutions to places where they are needed ‘‘according to a spe- cific program which we will set up for them.” THE QUESTION arises whether his government could withstand the repercussions that such change and deprivation might bring. The heart is gone from the once- lively souk, the old marketplace full of color and confusing bustle, the traditional signature of Arab cities. Today the sandy streets are quiet and most white-washed shops shut- tered. Even in the more modern re- tail sectors of Tripoli, boarded doors and windows face the streets. Colonel Khaddafy has replaced them with six modern state super- markets, one a five-story building resembling a K-Mart discount store with food aisles on the bottom floor. Tripoli residents wishing — fresh vegetables travel to the outskirts to private, impromptu roadside mar- kets where farmers spread their goods on blankets or tarpaulins. But discontent caused by such con- ditions is assuaged by spending on public services — housing, health care, education — made possible by billions of oil dollars. High-rise build- ings are sprouting everywhere. Marcia Kunstel is an American jour- nalist residing in Rome. covering events in the Middle East, Africa and Europe.

Khartoum, Sudan — All day and all night cars line the dirt roads stretching toward gas sta- tions. _ Taxi drivers say they sleep the night, waiting in lines, so they can start their work by 9 a.m. with a fresh, albeit small, ration of fuel. : The gasoline shortage i is the most recent twist to the continuing economic crisis in Sudan, where a vast pool of oil remains trapped underground and cannot be brought to market because rebels control the natural treasure chest. . The economic and political strains spawned by the insurrection have become a growing concern to the U.S. government, which sees this giant African nation as a pivotal friend whose stability is vital to the region. Chevron Oil resumed limited drilling in July, but has yet to return to the promising fields in southern Sudan, which a violent rebel attack forced the company to abandon in February. The southern unrest also forced shelving of the Jonglei Canal, de- vised to channel aap water and create more agri- cultural Iand. The dissidents say they want to force President Gaafar Nimeiry out of office, though few Sudanese or foreign observers here expect the rebels to score a military victory. But they might not be seeking that kind of victory. “They have a stranglehold on the government, but I don’t think the government knows it,” said a western source familiar with t the situation. “I don’t think the government cares.” The rebellion is stopping development of an in- come needed to help Sudan climb out of a deepening economic morass that includes a foreign debt near- ing $8 billion. Nevertheless, Nimeiry yesterday lifted a nation- al state of emergency five months after he imposed it, and cited achievements, “particularly in the field of prompt justice which effectively contributed to the curbing of corruption and freed society from destruc- tive sins.” He also suspended the martial law courts established under the April 29 decree. The decree and the courts prevented protests over such conditions as the hours spent in gasoline lines by making public protest illegal. The ban came after a series of strikes by judges, doctors, accoun- tants and others. Newsday - September 30, 1984 The president also invoked Islamic law a year ago in what the government contends is another force that has helped subdue social chaos by ban- ning liquor and instituting harsh punishment for crimes, including amputation of limbs for stealing cars. Nearly 70 percent of Sudan’s 22 million people are Moslems, and many welcomed the change to Is- lamic law. But large numbers of intellectuals and professionals say the new law is being applied with excess and abuse — no defense lawyers, too frequent and misapplication of harsh penalties, which have a public whipping of teen-age girls for petty theft. Nimeiry also must contend with repercussions in the predominantly non-Moslem, already rebellious south, “The way of implementing Sharia [Islamic Law] is too rapid. The society is too complex,” said Omar Garang Yak, who referred to how the changes were implemented in the north.. Yak, a dental surgeon from a southern province, spoke here last week at a ase commemorating the first year of Sharia aw. His criticism was rare in the government’s or- chestrated tribute to Sudan’s Islamization process. Yak confirmed that Sharia law has not been spread yet to the southern domain of Christians and animists, but warned it must never be introduced as abruptly as it was in the north. A member of the south’s Moslem minority, he argued that full Islamization there would destroy the area’s traditional cultural identity that spread from black Africa rather than from Moslem roots, “If they do that, the southerners will unite,” he said. “They will see the danger coming for them.” Others predict Islamization will lead to full re- newal of the 17-year war that ended in 1972. The southern rebels are said to have wide- spread sympathy in the region, though tribal ri- valries have kept the number of trained fighters to perhaps 3,000 to 5,000, out of a population of about five million. Leading them is Col. John Garang and a cadre of officers who defected from the Sudanese army last year, charging that the south was being blocked - from the economic benefits from the natural re- sources exploited there. Countries with a stake in Sudan’s stability, in- cluding Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United States, have reportedly been pressing Nimeiry to negotiate seriously with the dissidents in an effort to allow work to resume. For now, Chevron is drilling around Muglad, about 230 miles north of the site of a rebel attack that killed three non-Sudanese oil workers in February. “There’s no military solution to this,” said one knowledgeable source, predicting Garang’s soldiers can keep Sudan’s armed forces so tied up that Ni- meiry finally will be forced into talks. om Muglad might not be safe for Chevron, he sai “All it would take is two guys to go in and drop a mortar,” he said. “The United States learned in Vietnam that as long as you’ve got one North Viet- Namese carrying a flag that says liberation, you’ve got an insurgency.” \f"

        "ocr_text": " By Marcia Kunstel (0) 7 Newsday Special Correspondent 2 _ Rome — An Italian indictment filed yesterday describes an international plot behind the 1981 shooting of Pope John Paul Il. The indictment, handed down by an Italian magistrate, orders three Bulgarians and four Turks to stand trial on conspir- acy charges, and presents evidence that a second gunman fired at and wounded the Pope. “Tt must be held as cer- tain that a plot existed to kill the Pope,” the investi- 4 gating magistrate, Lario Martella, said upon re- leasing a summary of his ° 1,243-page indictment. | His document cinched a notch tighter the so- - called “Bulgarian connec- tion” to the May 1, 1981, attempted assassination. It officially charged that two former aides of the Bulgarian embassy and the local manager of the Bulgarian state airline had “terroristic aims” ful- filled by helping to planand execute the shooting of the Pope. A prosecutor had recommended charges in the case in a report earlier this year, but Martella goes much further, determining after a two-year investi- gation that sufficient evidence exists to bring the seven men to trial. Oral Celik ( Indicted in Pope ttack: Probe Cites. 2nd Gunman No trial date was set. The local manager of Balkanair, Sergei I. An- tonoy, 37, was implicated and has been in custody — now under house arrest — since Nov. 25, 1981. The validity of the “Bulgarian connection” may stand or fall with his fortunes in the upcoming trial, because the other two Bulgarians left Italy before authori- ties connected them to the crime. Early speculation was directed at possible Soviet backing of the Bulgarians. Asked about that yester- - day, Martella said investigating that issue “was not part of my job.” Martella’s big surprise was naming a second ~ ‘Turkish gunman, Oral Celik, 25, who the Italians believe also shot at and wounded the Pope that spring day in St. Peters Square. Celik had been mentioned in the prosecutor's report, spotted by American tourists running from St. Peter’s Square with a pistol in his hand just after the assassination attempt. Celik’s whereabouts are unknown. Until now, convicted Turkish terrorist Mehmet Ali Agca had been called the sole hit man. He is serving a life sentence for the shooting. Martella said confessions by Agca, film of the chaotic episode and a ballistics reconstruction of the event all point to a second gunman. His bullet struck the Pontiff’s left index finger and grazed his shoulder, Martella told reporters, The earlier prosecutor's report said the two were members of the same militant right-wing gang of Turks, called the Gray Wolves, and that Celik helped Agca escape in 1979 from a Turkish prison where he was being held on a murder charge. - Two other Turks indicted yesterday also sup- posedly are tied to the Gray Wolves, and both are in prison here, _ Musa Serdar Celebi, 28, is charged with helping organize and support the plot. Omer Bagci i, 38, is charged with crossing the Swiss border with the Browning 9-mm. pistol which he handed to Agca at a meeting in Milan, knowing Agca wanted the weapon to kill the Pope. The last Turk, Bekir Celenk, 45, is the apparent link between the Turks and the Bulgarians. Accord- ing to the indictment, he was the bag man who paid Celebi, Celik and Agca 8 million German marks (about 1.25 million dollars) to do the deed. The earlier prosecutors report cites Celenk as party to the “Turkish Mafia,” dealing drugs and arms through both countries. It said he arranged the first meeting in Sofia between Gray Wolves (Agea and Celik) and Bulgarian agents, where the deal was struck. Celenk is being detained in Bulgaria. The other two Bulgarians indicted are Todor S. Aivazov, 40, the former cashier at the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome, and Maj. Zhelyo Kolev Vasilev, 42, former secretary to the Bulgarian military atta- che. Both are at home in Sofia. The indictment charges both helped design the logistics of the attack, and participated in a “dress rehearsal” of the shooting. - Antonov, the Balkanair chief, was subjected to the same charges as the other two Bulgarians, but the indictment additionally alleges he was armed and waited at the square with an escape vehicle for gunmen Agea and Celik when the attack occured. All three Bulgarians have denied any involve- ment, and The Associated Press reported the state- run Bulgarian news agency denounced the indictment yesterday as “a political conspiracy.” Newsday - October 27, 1984 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Turkish Suspect Key in Pope Case By Marcia Kunstel lO Newsday Special Correspondent 27 Rome — The international conspiracy to‘mur- der Pope John Paul II, framed in an Italian in- dictment Friday, rests largely on the shaky testimony of convicted terrorist Mehmet Ali Agca — but there is another suspect whose tes- timony might buttress the prosecution’s case. He is Omer Mersan, 34, one of the shadowy Turks floating through a Balkan world of drugs and arms and right-wing militancy. Mersan cor- roborated important elements of Agca’s tale during interrogation in Italy last spring, accord- ing to a preliminary prosecution document leaked to the press in June. It is the testimony of Agea, the only man so far convicted in the shooting of the Pope, upon which much of Fri- day’s indictment is based. The preliminary document recommended that eight people, including Mersan, be charged. Friday, all but Mersan were. The indictments did not mention Mersan, and it is not known if he is in Italian custody. _..» There has been no explanation why. Mersan was not indicted along with the rest. Italian law allows suspects to get lighter sentences or even to escape penal measures if they serve as state’s witnesses. It is not known if Mersan will do so. The omission of Mersan as a defendant stunned attorney Guiseppe Consolo, who has been close to the investigation process as the lawyer for another suspect. He said Mersan was brought from West Ger- many to Italy during the investigation to be - questioned, but was released “and disappeared.” Consolo.is the attorney for Sergei Antonov, the only one of three Bulgarian defendants in custody and likely to be tried. Two more are in Bulgaria; the other four indicted are Turks. Of his own client, the former Rome manager of the Bulgarian state airline company, Consolo said the state simply has no evidence. ~ Much of the indictment revealed last week was based on confessions by the Turkish terror- ist Agca, who was convicted of the 1981 shoot- ing that wounded the Pontiff. Investigators admit Agca has lied, recanted tales and withdrawn accusations made through- out the two-year investigation into the shooting of the Pope. Consolo repeatedly has pointed to Agea’s contradictions in questioning his credi- bility, as have some Italian newspapers. Investigating Magistrate Ilario Martella said ‘Friday he feels certain of some evidence, but that other elements must be dug into further during the trial. The trial, not expected to begin until next year, will be “very difficult,” Martella said. He added, however, that he is convinced Agca told him some truths. After first claiming he alone planned and ex- ecuted the shooting, Agea finally spun his story of conspirators who joined their far-left and militant right-wing ideologies behind a scheme to assassinate the Pope. The two main groups he cited were Turks in- volved in his right-wing terrorist group called the Gray Wolves, and Bulgarian communist agents who paid the Turks and organized the scheme to kill the Pope. The theory is that the Bulgarians and their Soviet patrons wanted to eliminate Pope John Paul’s inspirational support of the Solidarity movement, which threatened the communist re- gime in his Polish homeland. : Martella said he believes without question that Agca knew the Bulgarians he fingered, who include two former envoys to the Bulgarian -embassy here, as well as Antonov from the air- line. They have denied knowing Agea. ~Agea described details of their habits, their hobbies and physical appearance that he could not have learned otherwise, Martella said. Also leading to the indictments, he said, were doubts about the Bulgarians’ alibis. Martella said the alibi witnesses gave “inconsistent” tes- eon that in some cases conflicted with the ibis Of the other suspects indicted, one Turkish friend admitted giving Agca the pistol he used to shoot the Pope, but said he did not know its intended use. The only other Turk in custody, a leaderof the Gray Wolves supposedly involved in the plot, is said to have denied everything Agea alleged. Newsday - October 29, 1984 \f"

Peter’s Square, Agea Late last month Martella indicted seven Turks and Bulgarians as accomplices, an act based mainly on information supplied by Agea. : Guiseppe Consolo, defense lawyer for Sergei Ivanov Antonov, the only Bulgarian in Italian custo- dy said he had not believed the government would pardon Agca, and was surprised to learn from the legal documents that the issue had been discussed with the terrorist. ; “They are going down the mad to giving him a pardon,” Consolo said, “How can they give a pardon to a person who is a professed killer and who has - continued to lie?” In a telephone interview this week, Martella would not say when a pardon first was discussed; or who raised the issue. While not speculating directly whether the pros- : | pect of clemency inspired Agca’s collaboration with authorities, Martella said Agca “affirmed during the | proceedings that the thought of clemency was in his mind,” : Martella hinted at questions remaining in his own mind, when he noted that Agca cannot request a pardon until after the trial of his supposed accom- plices “and, after a decision on whether Agca is tell- ing the truth is reached.” A spokesman for President Sandro Pertini simi- larly said: “It’s premature to say before the request is made and the case is considered,” Doubts about Agca spring from many sources. John Paul Il, Agca said he acted alone. He was quickly tried and convicted. But in the spring of 1982 he began talking about a plot anda raft of accomplices, Since then, Agea has been caught in numerous lies regarding the crime, admitting to telling dozens, In the 1,248-page indictment of the alleged ac- complices, Martella wrote that Agca had hoped to gain freedom under the “penitents” law, which was being debated by the Italian parliament at the time he began confessing. It grants sentence reductions to certain criminals who disclose information on their partners in crime, But Martella said Agca’s hopes had been “dis- appointed” by the law’s provisions excluding con- victs already under final sentence. That eliminated Agca, So he “pled his hope of regaining freedom sole- ly in. . . a presidential pardon,” Martella wrote. His collaboration as it relates to a pardon was a ‘key point in an interrogation last January, as re- counted in the indictment. Besides telling Agca an honest confession might be “evaluated positively” in a clemency decision, Martella also warned that making false accusations is acrime. — _ Such criminal lies would make it extremely diffi- cult for any arbiter of justice to recognize the “right to good offices which would let you regain your liber- ty, good offices which i in some manner you might appear to merit . Agea’s response indicated that the topic had been discussed before. _ Immediately after the May, 1981 attack on Pope T have followed with much attention what your honor has called to my mind,” he said, “and I am perfectly aware that if I had accused innocent per- sons as‘my accomplices in the attempt on the pope’s _ life, I would make myself responsible for the very serious crime of calumny and that would preclude for me any possibility of reacquiring my liberty with the provision of the pardon from the president of the republic of Italy.” Newsday - November 9, 1984 \f"

Unless prosecutors pull 4 surprise, the case will turn on Agea’s credibil- ity and how it links piles of detailed circumstantial evidence amassed by investigators. One prosecution theory behind the charges is that the Bulgarians, under the tutelage of Soviet KGB mentors, hired the Turks to kill the Pope, the first non-Italian pontiff in 455 years, because his inspiration emboldened dissidents in his native Poland. that the mouves asiae, action counts. In the Italian case, the star raconteur of what happened is Agca, who spun a tale that wavered and grew and retracted like a splotch of mercury, changing when investiga- tors caught him in a lie. THIS IS Agca’s latest version, pieced together from the 1,243-page indictment filed last month charging three Bulgarians and four Turks with complicity in the attack on the Pope: In 1979 and 1980, Agea, a fugitive from Turkish authorities under death sentence for a political murder, got help from Turkish associates, whom he described as mercenaries, smug- glers and gun-runners, most con- nected somehow to Agca’s right-wing terrorist gang, the Gray Wolves. ports and in the summer of 1980 dispatched him to see a fellow Turk, ° Bekir Celenk, in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria which is one of Celenk’s haunts in his shadowy international business deals. Celenk arranged a meeting with Todor Aivazov, a Bulgarian de- scribed by Agea as a member of the Bulgarian secret service, visiting _ Sofia from his post as an accountant Toledo Blade - IS. WHal . in the Bulgarian embassy in Rome. They discussed using the Gray Wolves for various acts of terrorism, including assassinating the Pope. ; At this or subsequent meetings was Agca’s good friend, Oral Celik, also in the Gray Wolves. A front man for the Gray Wolves, Musa Sedar. Celibi, sealed the deal in which Celenk was to transmit about $1.25 million to Agea, Celik and Celibi for the papal attack. The source of the money is unclear. Later, another Gray Wolves agent, Omer Bagci, brought to Italy and handed over to Agca the 9mm Browning pistol used in the assault on the Pope. UNTIL THE HIT on May 13, 1981, Agca free-wheeled through Europe and North Africa on cash he said - came from Turks and Bulgarians.

He said he fired on the Pope that ‘day and that Celik may have, Agea was captured in the throng of distraught pilgrims; Celik vanished. The documentation outlining the state’s case, as filed in the court here, shows reason to question» this tale: ' B Not a single additional witness supports Agea’s plot story. bm No witness confirms that any of the three Bulgarian SUEPS Ee ever even met Agca. b> The suspects deny VOlMeeHE except Celik, whose whereabouts are unknown, and Bagci, who admits he- brought Agea the gun but denies he knew its intended use. ® None of the three Bulgarians was placed by witnesses other than Agea at St. Peter’s on the day of the shooting or for dress rehearsals of the crime supposedly conducted there for three days earlier. Bm Agca repeatedly Se Ca Rs story. ; However. the indictment contains large amounts of circumstantial evi- dence to back up the case for the prosecution: ~~ The most vital supporting testi- mony is that three American tourists saw a man fleeing the scene, carry- ing a gun, moments after the Pope was shot.

Intriguing circumstances surround Agea’s decision to talk to Italian au- thorities. In July, 1981, nine weeks after the papal shooting, he was sentenced to: life in prison in a nation without parole. His right-wing terrorist friends did not spring him, as they had from a Turkish prison. FOR A YEAR Agca held that he acted alone. Then in May, 1982, he began talk- ing to Judge fIlario Martella, the magistrate assigned to further inves- tigate for signs of a conspiracy. At the moment that Agca started unravelling his tale, the Italian par- liament was debating what would be- come the ‘‘penitent’s” law, which of- fers reduced sentences to certain criminals who provide evidence against their partners in crime. The judge meticulously checked Agea’s story, uncovering repeated lies. Agca admitted to telling dozens, some of striking calculation. For example, he retracted a story that a Soviet diplomat aided him in Iran, a tale he said he devised to i intrigue the western press with the Bulgarian connection. It also was un- true, he said, that he knew first-hand about Antonov’s job at Balkan Air and about his apartment; he said he actually picked up descriptive de- tails from newspapers. Judge Martella wrote in the indict- ment that Agca hoped to gain free- dom. “in exchange for his total and immediate collaboration” under the “penitents’” law, but was disap- pointed when the law ultimately ex- cluded convicts already under final: sentence. That excluded Agca. But he continued to collaborate. The judge said Agea then placed his hope of regaining freedom solely in & pardon. They did discuss a pardon, the indictment shows. JUDGE Martella told Agca during. one of his last interrogations that final, honest confessions “might be evaluated positively’”’ in a clemency. decision. At the same time, he warned that continued lies would make clemency close to impossible. The judge, in a telephone in- terview, would not speculate on how much the prospect of freedom spur- . red Agca’s collaboration, although he did say that Agca “affirmed during the proceedings that the thought of clemency was in his mind.” Judge Martella, who made the as ‘cision to: bring to trial the accused, accomplices, hinted at questions re- maining in his own mind when he: pointed out that Agca cannot request a pardon until after the trial “and after a decision on whether Agca is telling the truth is reached.” Marcia Kunstel ts an American Jour- nalist residing in Ronie, covering events in the Middle East, Africa and Eurape.

Both Bulgarian and other knowl- edgeable sources refused to speak on Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lyubo- mir Shopov, called reports of forcible ee “a sheer fabrica- n.” ; . He said Bulgaria's “broadly demo- cratic laws” treat all citizens equally and guarantee each a right “to cheose for himself a name, and to change it if he so wishes.” Shopov also responded to a written question for an explanation of the roadblock. “As to the road conditions in Bul- garia,” he said, “difficulties in one settlement or another, be they lesser or more serious, are something nor- mal in winter.” Turks who refuse to change their the record, fearing government re- P They reported that the campaign was being carried out by a militia that barges into the Turks’ homes or enters their work places to take them to police stations and demand that they sign official name-change peti- tions. . They substitute Bulgarian names, such as Ivan Petrovich, for the dis- tinctive, often Islamic, names, such as Mehmet Ali Sukar, that identify the 700,000 Bulgarians of Turkish heritage. Government militias have cor- -doned off a 500-square-mile swath of mountainous border territory, names have been subjected to force, the sources said, ranging from slaps and punches to torture. “Although they want to assimilate the people, what they do alienates them,” said one source who is a citi- zen of Turkey and follows events here. “They tend to become what the Bulgarians are afraid of — a separate and hostile community.” The primary campaign area ex- tends from the south-<entral city of Plovdiv, the country’s second-largest city, east to the Turkish border and south to the border with Greece, where about 300,000 ethnic Turks are concentrated. Only a piece of this where ethnic Turks are reported to have physically fought the name- change campaign. Reports filtering out of the area set the number of deaths anywhere from 40, cited in Turkish newspa- pers, to 160, estimated by a resident. The figures cannot be confirmed, but these incidents confront Bulgaria's rigid communist regime with its first active resistance in decades.

In a statement released this week, a area is the isolated zone.

Also, name- change petitions used in three cities in the area were supplied to two Western reporters by people sympa- thetic to the minority. The most active resistance came in Momchilgrad, a city of about 29,500 people, where residents are reported to have physically fought the militia at least once last month. \f"

The plan to formally charge Agca, a Turkish terrorist convicted in Italy of being the trigger man in the 1981 papal attack, was an- nounced Wednesday by Jordan Or- ankov. He is the Bulgarian judi- cial investigator leading an inquiry in Sofia into whether the Bulgar- jans were involved in wrongdoing. ~~ Ormankov began investigating shortly after newspaper articles in- ‘dicated Agca had changed his origi- nal account that he acted alone in the shooting, implicating three Bul- garians and four Turks as accom-. plices, -Ormankov said only Agca will be tried as a result of his investigation, indicating he has cleared the three Bulgarians and found them falsely accused. “Agca will be tried . . . for sland- ering Bulgarian citizens, which is an offense detrimental not only to the Bulgarian citizens but to the Prue state,” he said.

Bulgaria has been accused by U.S. drug authorities and others of not cracking down on the drug ’ trade within its borders.

        "ocr_text": "By Marcia Kunstel Craxi said only that SDI “must be Gromyko ( Comes Up Dry on Italy Mission Newsday Special Corresponde Rome — Andrei Gromyko yesterday wound up his first official visit here in six years, a two-day effort, apparently fruitless, to persuade Italian leaders and Pope John Paul Il to oppose the U.S. “Star Wars” missile defense program. Gromyko’s session with the Pope yesterday morning lasted nearly two hours, twice the normal length of a pa- pal audience, but no details of sub- stance were offered when the two men emerged from the library of the Apos- tolic Palace. Gromyko simply told reporters it was a good meeting. Both men smiled and appeared cordial during picture- taking. Vatican spokesman Joaquin Na- varro said the talk centered on peace in the world and the situation of Cath- olies in the Soviet Union. Pope John Paul II has not taken a public position on President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initia- tive, or “Star Wars” research pro- gram, although the Pontifical Acade- my of Science recently provided him with a position paper on space weap- ons. Earlier this week, a source in the Soviet Embassy suggested the Pope would have powerful influence on the U.S. program if he took a public posi- tion against it. The militarization of space is one of Soviet Foreign Minister UPI/ Reuter Pope John Paul Il and Gromyko during Vatican encounter “three topics of US.-Soviet nuclear arms negotiations resuming in Gene- va in March. The Soviets are working to generate world pressure to force the Reagan administration to give up its space program. [The Soviet Union accused the Unit- ed States of undercutting hopes for success in the talks with “slanderous” charges of Soviet violations of past arms-control agreements, The Wash- ington Post reported. “The unsubstan- tiated and groundless verge in the White House ‘report’ have been cate- gorically rejected,” said a prepared statement. ] Gromyko admitted here Tuesday that he was hopeful Italian leaders would speak against “Star Wars.” But statements by both Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti and Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, after meetings with Gromyko, must have disappointed the visitor. inserted in the discussion” in Geneva, while Andreotti questioned whether research is even a negotiable issue. _ Andreotti acknowledged the three arms-talks topics are interrelated, as the Soviets have emphasized, but warned that this interrelationship “is a delicate instrument” that can be put to bad use if it stalls the talks. Last night a Soviet-Italian commu- nique was issued, supporting arms con- _trol and stating that negotiations ulti- mately should provide for “exclusively peaceful uses” of outer space. It did not mention the American program, and fell short of Gromyko’s objectives. _ John Paul did warn of the dangers of nuclear weapons in his Jan, 1 message for the churchs World Day of Peace, _and yesterday presented Gromyko a leather-bound, Russian translation of it as a gift. Gromyko gave the Pope a small la- quered box in honor of their second meeting. They first met here in 1979. While the Soviets are seeking help in stopping Star Wars, the Pontiffs agenda put priority on the problems of Catholics in the Soviet Union. The Soviets refused to grant Pope John Paul II entry to Lithuania, an area with many Catholics, when he proposed a trip last year. Gromyko was asked about a such papal visit after the meeting, and he said the matter “was not involved” in the talks. Newsday - February 28, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Small Soviet share of VET ee tee we African relief reported by U.N. recta IU) Special to The News GENEVA, Switzerland — The So-_ viet Union has donated only a tiny fraction of the food sent to African nations» wracked by famine, limit- ing its contributions to countries with ideologically sympathetic gov- ernments, according to a United Na- tions survey made public Sunday. The report is the first independ- ent documentation of the Soviets’ meager efforts to combat the devas- tating famine. Its publication coin- cides with a special U.N. meeting, beginning in Geneva Monday, where the wealthier nations of the world will be asked for nearly $1.5 billion in pledges of emergency aid for starving Africans. Until now, the U.S.S.R. bas given. or pledged to send 5,500 tons of rice to Ethiopia, Mozambique and Mauri- tania, all of which are either Marx- ist or leftist nations. The United States is the largest— contributor -in Africa, having al- ready sent or promised to ship nearly 2.4 million tons of food, ac- cording to the report compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organiza- tion. — : The , wheat, rice and coarse grains contributed by the United States are going to African nations spanning the ideological spectrum, from Marxist Ethiopia to Sudan, a fast American ally. The report buttresses remarks made last month by Vice President George Bush, who called the Soviet response “shocking.” Bush will bea key conference speaker Monday and is expected to repeat his pleas that the Soviets do more to help’, abate tHe African crisis. Bush arrived in Geneva Sunday Dallas Morning News - after visiting three of the horosst hit African nations, where he pledged additional aid. In a short arrival statement at the Geneva airport, the vice presi- dent previewed his speech to the conference. “Tll take to that conference a message that would try to encour- _. age every country, transcending id-- eology, to be supportive in this enormous human tragedy, in help- ing with that human tragedy that we have witnessed,” Bush said. Not only food is necessary. The new U.N. Office of Emergency Oper- ations in Africa has said urgent needs include seeds and fertilizer for planting new crops, medical supplies, water sources, transport and storage facilities and special ‘items such as tents and blankets for refugees. After the United States, the next largest donations have come from the European Economic Commu- nity. More than 1.5 million tons of cereal food has come from the group and from nine member coun- tries individually. Canada has contributed 200,000 tons and Australia and Japan each __ have promised more than 100,000. This report said the total pledges made so far to counteract the Afri- can crisis come to 5.1 million tons of food. But the FAO has assessed that this amount, combined with what the African nations are able to buy commercially, will still leave them about 2 million tons short of “needed imports. Plus, less than half the food aid promised to date has been deliv- ered, and the report said extraordi- nary measures will be needed in _ some cases to get the food to its des- tinations before it is too late. — March 11, 1985 (Also in Newsday) \f"

But. the campaign stopped when the vaccine ran out that month, Abdu said. Basta of UNICEF said there was vaccine in Khartoum, about 250 miles east. But the Sudan govern- ment, which scheduled vaccination teams for countryside visits, failed to get the vaccine to the camp. “They don’t have the flexibility and sometimes the foresight of being able to shift their vaccine ac- cording to the needs,” Basta said. In January, a large influx of new refugees arrived in El Obeid, bring- ing the measles with therm.

        "ocr_text": "Time running out for droughtstricken Sudan By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News KAJARAT, Sudan Ali Mohamad Habib rode a borrowed camel one hour through 105-degree heat to get here, because he heard the free sorghum from America would be passed around. It wasn’t. His family would have no food that night. “We had breakfast only,” he said in Kajarat, a village 200 miles south- west of Khartoum where Sudan's drought and creeping desert are suffocating life. The Habib family breakfast that day last week was a porridge of sor- ghum dampened with a broth of boiled leaves, seasoned with salt and pepper. Relief workers are warning that families like Habib’s soon may not be abie to scare up even a meager breakfast. Already an estimated 1.5 million Sudanese have fled their homes ina drought belt strapping Sudan from northeast to central west. Some are settling in refugee camps, some crowding larger villages with ex- tant water supplies and others con- tinue wandering in search of pas- ture. Starvation and other killing con- ditions will spread through Sudan by mid-summer, aid agencies predict, if food and medicine and money for water wells is not given soon. In the past few months unpubli- cized food demonstrations have erupted in half a dozen cities. Last week, three days of riots in Khar- toum, the capital, followed steep price increases for bread, gasoline und other staples. The price increases were caused by austerity measures President Gaafar Nimeiri implemented under pressure for economic reform from the United States and the Interna- tional Monetary Fund. Nimeiri left last week for Wash- ington and is scheduled to meet with President Reagan on Monday. Nimeiri also, is scheduled to hold talks with Secretary of State George Shultz, Defense Secretary CaSper Weinberger and Peter McPherson, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. In mid-March, Eric Witt, chief of food programs for AID, cabled a for- mal request to Washington that the United States give an additional 509,000 tons of sorghum and 125,000 tons of wheat to Sudan. ' Witt said, “If this request comes through, it gets us '!through Octo- ber,” harvest time in Sudan. _ It would require|an appropria- tion of about $140 million from the country that already is Sudan's larg- est benefactor. So far this year the United States has committed 815,000 tons of food to Sudan, the largest Af- rican country and the United States’ most strategically important Afri- can ally. ; . Washington had frozen $100 mil- lion of $250 million in aid ear- marked this year for Sudan pending economic reforms. After a visit to Sudan by Vice President George Bush earlier this month, $15 mil- lion was released. i ; Arthur Holcombe, an American who is resident representative of U.N. programs in Sudan, said all the food in stock and all the food promised will be gone in July. “We feel time definitely is run- ning out on this country,” he said in an interview in Khartoum. One relief worker warned that conditions in Sudan carry “explo- sive implications for the govern- ment itself.” Hoicombe said that if at least 425,000 metric tons of grain is not donated, Sudan's 23 million resi- dents face severe consequences. “It means that people will face extremely widespread mainutri- tion, that there will be a much higher rate of mortality than exists at the moment,” he said, estimating that already 750,000 to 1 million malnourished children will be “an early target” for death. “It will rival Ethiopia,” he said. _ Harvests have been weak for three dry seasons, but last year the drought meant disaster, ruining even the crops from big, mecha- nized farms in the east that nor- mally are flush with rains in the growing season. Such farms had supported the cities and troubled small farms in past years. Countrywide production was only 1.9 million tons last season, while Sudan's consumption require- ment is nearly 3.4 million tons. AID representative Witt said, “There's no reason to believe this year's harvest will be better.” Sudan also has become home for well more than 1 million refugees from Ethiopia, Chad, Zaire and Uganda, who fled war and famine battering their own countries. While the majority are supported in international refugee camps, hun- dreds of thousands simply have set- tled on the land in competition with native Sudanese for suste- nance. There is precious little to be found. The people of Kajarat, farmers and livestock keepers, agree that last season Was a total failure. More than a dozen men who gathered to Dallas Morning News - March 31, 1985 \ftalk to a Western journalist said none of them had acrop. They planted in May, in June and in July, they said. Each time seedlings emerged, but the rains stopped and the seedlings burned. “We have no seeds for this year,\" said Mohamad Madowi, the equiva- lent of police chief in the town he said holds 2,000 people. “Even if the rain comes, we have no seeds.” Now villagers depend on do- nated food and grain bought at in- flated market prices throughout the region, where small gum arabic trees and a few brown bush grasses are the only vegetation still compet- ing with spreading sand dunes. In Kajarat, sorghum costs 150 Su- danese pounds (about $50) for a 198- pound sack that last year cost 40 Su- danese pounds (or about $16 at the time, before the pound was de- valued). Already people are dying from hunger and complications. Haj Hamadi Imam, a village leader, said his niece died eight days ago “as a consequence of hun- ger, because of the long hunger.” Mohamad Biraima said he has lost two sons, ages 7 and 15, in the past month. Ali Mohamad Habib, the man who came to fetch free sorghum, said four in his family have died within the past two months in the town of Antatya, including his son,, his sister and two nephews. And they are dying e)sewhere. A survey team from the British pri- vate relief group Oxfam and from the U.N. Childrens Fund found a small settlement northwest of Ka- jarat where 12 out of 39 children had died in the nine days before the team arrived. “Others looked as if they would follow shortly,” said the report Dallas Morning News - March 31, 1985 (Continued) Time running out for drought’stricken Sudan dated Feb. 27. Farther west, in the town of Umm Badir, the team found 200 cases of typhoid, 20 of them fatal. Sudan's livestock is perishing, too, with an estimated 60 percent of more than 50 million cattle, goats, sheep and camels dead. In Kajarat, Habib said he has one donkey left of a stock that last year included 25 goats, five sheep and four donkeys. Some died, and some he sold to get money for food. Such are the conditions that gov- ernment officials and U.N. agencies related at a Geneva meeting earlier this month, when the case for dona- tions was put to wealthier coun- tries. A program of $339.2 million in food, medicine and water projects was described in the minutes of the meeting as “nothing short of a human survival strategy” in which there is ‘no padding of needs or margin for error.” Even small error can be crucial to Sudanese like Habib.

        "ocr_text": "Burkina Faso regime struggles to lift country out of poverty By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — The cloud that settles into this West African capital these days comes from the desert sand, filming a sea of mud-brick houses with powdery dust. People say the cloud comes more often now, sometimes in violent storms, a hazard of the two-year drought that itself is one more cloud over the vision of Burkina Faso's revolutionary government. The regime led by Capt. Thomas Sankara is trying to lift generations of numbing poverty off the coun- try’s 7 million people, using bootstrap tactics based in an ideo- logical hash that is part populist, part communist and all nationalist. But the drought has made re- forms even harder. People are hun- grier, thirstier and sicker than usual in this Colorado-size country where under normal conditions life expectancy is 42 years, per capita annual income is less than $200, and the illiteracy rate is 95 percent. The government is in the per- plexing position of begging for more and more foreign help while preaching the virtues of self-reli- ance and touting its independence from neocolonialism. The irony has a flip side, as West- ern governments such as the United States find themselves giv- ing record amounts of aid to a re- gime they don’t much like. ; This year, the United States is sending $37 million in aid to Burk- ina Faso, $32 million of it in food as- sistance. Last year, the country received $16.1 million in US. aid. “It's a desperately poor country,” said one Western diplomat. “They have knocked on everybody's door. They've tried to get whatever they can because they need it all.” Just in terms of food, Burkina Faso has a grain deficit of 200,000 tons, which is one-sixth of produc- tion in a normal year, according to relief agencies. Ai ‘ from the United States tink ponueges has required that emergency help be given in such crises, regardless of the recipient's The Dallas Morning News Under a Iaw devised by the local CDR and the village elders, the vil- lagers built 2-foot-tall ridges of dirt in a vast maze over fields that now are barren. When the rains come again, vil- lagers hope the water will not run off but be caught in the basins to nourish crops and feed the lower- ing water table. But government austerity and such efforts at self-propulsion can- not overcome the massive poverty born of history and a lack of mar- ketable natural resources. And whether the government ac- tions will be sufficient to attract Western aid after the drought crisis is a question, at least when it comes to U.S. dollars. “The United States has no basic economic or political strategic in- terest in Burkina Faso,\" U.S. Ambas- sador Leonard Neher said. Before the Sankara government) | Staged its violent coup in 1983, the United States was considering a 330 million development Now, the only long-term program in sight is a $1.9 million population control project. program. |: kara regime has produced som moves that run against both democ Tacy and capitalism. It was not just that the austere ism when they changed the coun. try’s name last August from Uppe Volta to Burkina Faso — “Republic of Upright People’ — on the first anniversary of the coup. that brought them to power. Nor does anyone accuse the San- kara government of the corruption or personal enrichment that has de- cayed the core of some other Afri- can governments. The 35-year-old Sankara not only scrapped the country’s name, he also sold the government's Mercedes-Benz limos in favor of small, black Renaults. And he cut the salaries of civil serv- ants and the military. But freedom of speech, espe- cially to criticize the government, is not tolerated. After a secret trial last summer, seven men were exe- cuted on charges of trying to over- throw the government. During the trial, the seven were not allowed de- fense counsel. That was an isolated case. But the government-run magazine lists weekly the names of persons fired or suspended from their jobs for ac- tions “‘against the revolution.” Sankara’s handling of the econ- omy is another thorn in the side of the West. He nationalized all the land, though individuals still may have title to structures upon it. Last year, he declared that citi- zens need not pay rent for their lodgings in 1985. Foreigners and commercial renters were ordered to pay their rental fees to the gov- ernment instead of the owners. Western sources question how Sankara expects investment money to be plowed into his country when investors cannot earn a return and fear further nationalization. Yet, the radical government here preaches some sentiments that would be compatible with President Reagan's world vision. “The problem here is that the people were just waiting for the government to go do everything for them,” said Capt. Pierre Quedraogo, head of the Committees for the De- fense of the Revolution, a govern- ment-sponsored hybrid of civic do- gooders and armed militia. “Now, they don’t wait. They do it for themselves,” he said. In every village the local chiefs were required to make a list of proj- ects, which then became part of a national development program. One example is in the village of You 120 miles north of the capital. Dallas Morning News - April 7, 1985 \f"

Thousands of rugged tribesmen, whose roaming lifestyle has weath- ered the ravages of the desert Har- mattan winds and burning west Af- rican sun, have been driven with their dwindling herds to the fringes of towns or to far-distant pastures by a two-year drought. When they return, they are likely to find strictures that will end their wanderings much as the American Indians were boxed into reservations when the Old West be- came the white man's domain. Policies similar to those in favor in Tahoua have been recommended across Africa’s Sub-Sahara zone, where leaders face tough choices about how to live on land that is in- creasingly turning to sand.

However, major papers were made available. The papers described the jolting change as necessary for the well- being of the stockmen, most of whom are from the Tuareg and Fu- lani tribes, and for regeneration of the land that officials say overgraz: ing has ruined. After the 1973 drought, the gov: ernment restocked the animals of the herdsmen, who number more than 1 million in the Niger popula. tion of 6.5 million.

In good years, some herder: have had as many as 1,000 cattle, ac cording to the Tahoua governor Maj. Tanja Mamadou. Perhaps the stockmen should settle down, have 10 cattle and also farm on a perma nent plot, he said in an interview. “These are difficult choices, bu one is obliged to make them,” hi said. “If there is no pasture, thert can be no livestock raising.” Some foreign observers questiot the equity and wisdom of restrict ing the nomads and semi-nomadi: people, who are of minority tribes, hold no government jobs of impor- tance and often are at odds with the military and with the farming com- munity on which their herds some- times encroach.

The migrants didn’t look as though they had been buying much, The You health officer, Idrissa Bellem, said the mi- grant children brought sicknesses from polio to men- ingitis to “illness of the head.” He said he had seen seven die from hunger. “Their nations’ hungry — legs swell. Their belly swells. Three days later they die,” he said.

        "ocr_text": "Sands of famine Burkina Faso seeks money, aid By Marcia Kunstel International Courier OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — The cloud that settles into this West African capital these days is an invasion of desert sand, filming a sea of mud- —brick houses with powdery dust. People say the cloud comes more often now and sometimes in violent storms, a hazard of the two-year drought that itself is one more cloud over the vision of Burkina Faso’s revolutionary government. The regime led by Capt. Thomas San- kara is trying to lift generations of numbing poverty off this country’s 7 million people with boot-strap tactics based in an ideological hash that is part populist, part communist and all natio- nalist. But drought has made the masses to be mobilized even hungrier, thirstier and sicker than usual. Under normal conditions, life expectancy is 42 years, per capita income less than $200 and illi- teracy a stunning 95 percent in this Colorado-sized country. Today, especially in distant northern villages, people are starving. Rimming the villages are refugees who lost crops and animals and came seeking charity from people who have little more than that. At one village all the migrant child- ren, without exception, suffer such incredibly distended bellies from mal- nutrition that they barely can walk. The government itself is in the per- plexing position of begging for more fo- reign help at the precise moment it pre- aches the virtues of self-reliance and touts a second independence, this one from the oppression of neo—colonialism. The irony has a flip side, as western governments like the United States find themselves giving record amounts of humanitarian aid to a regime they don’t much like. . This year the United States is sending $37 million in aid to Burkina Faso, $32 million of it in food assistance. Last year it gave $16.1 million. “They have knocked on everybody’s door,” said one Western diplomat. “They’ve tried to get whatever they can because they need it all.” Aid comes from the U.S. because Congress has mandated that the nation give emergency help in such crises, regardless of the recipient’s ideology. And the ideology behind the Sankara regime has produced some moves that would make both democratic and capitalistic blood run cold. It was not just that the austere young soldier—revolutionaries scrapped a ves- tige of French colonialists, when they changed the country’s name last August from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso on the first anniversary of their coup. The country’s new, African name is translated, “Republic of Upright Peo- ple,” which even critics agree is an apt symbol of this regime’s idealism. The 35-year-old Sankara not only sc- rapped the country’s name. He also got rid of the government’s Mercedes Benz limos in favor of small black Renaults. And he cut the salaries of both civil ser- vants and military. But freedom of speech, especially to crit.cize the government, is not tolera- ted. Last summer seven men were exe- cuted on charges of plotting to over- throw the government, after a secret trial in which they were not allowed offense counsel. That was an isolated case. But the government-run magazine lists weekly the people fired or suspended from their jobs for actions “against the revolu- tion.” Sankara’s handling of the economy is another thorn sticking the West. He na- tionalized all the land, though indivi- duals still may have title to structures upon it. Western sources questioned how San- kara ever expects investment money to be ploughed into his country when investors cannot earn a return and fear further nationalization. Yet, the radical government here pre- aches some sentiments that would edge nicely into U.S. President Ronald Rea- gan’s world vision. “The problem here is that the people were just waiting for the government to do everything for them,” said Capt. Pierre Ouedraogo, the head of the Com- mittees for the Defense of the Revolu- tion (CDR), a hybrid of civic do—gooders, cheer leaders and armed militia. “Now they don’t wait. They do it for themselves.” In every village the new CDRS and local chiefs were required to self—im- pose a list of achievements, which became part of a national development program. The government will supply technical help and cement. A reporter stumbled on an example in the village of You, 184 kilometers (120 miles) north of the capi- tal. Under a plan devised by the local CDR and the village elders, the villagers built two-foot-high ridges of dirt in a vast maze over fields that today are crusty and barren. When the rains finally come again, they hope the water will be caught in these basins to nourish new crops and feed the lowering water table. Government austerity and _ these efforts at self—propulsion cannot over- come the massive poverty born of his- tory and an almost total absence of mar- tekable natural resources. Whether they will be sufficient to at- tract western aid after the drought crisis is a question, too, at least when it comes to U.S. dollars. “The United States has no basic econ- omic or political or strategic interest in Burkina Faso,” U.S. Ambaassador Leon- ard Neher said in a recent interview. Before ther Sankara government staged its violent coup in 1983, the U.S. was considering a $30 million develop- ment program. Now the only long-term money is sight is for a $1 9 million popu- lation control project. International Courier contributor Marcia Kunstel returned recently from a trip to Africa.

        "ocr_text": "Older parties bracing themselves for Greens’ Italian political debut By Marcia Kunstel Special to The Journal-Constitution ROME — The country of Machi- avelli, choking auto emissions and the self-indulgent la dolce vita is hosting the debut of a new political force this month. The Greens have arrived in Italy. They don’t like any of the above. The Greens are on Sunday's bal- lots in thousands of municipal and regional races, and they have the big parties on edge. Like their namesakes in West Germany and like new political movements anywhere, the Greens say they embrace issues neglected or mentioned only in passing by tra- ditional parties. They are against nuclear arms and nuclear energy. for cleaning up the polluted Venice canals and Rome’s Tiber River. They want to stop the crush of autos in central cities, where exhaust furmes are eat- ing up 2,000-year-old relics, and block the smothering of grasslands with concrete. They favor recycling and bicycles. The Greens are advocates of “a good life,” rather than “the sweet life’” portrayed in the 1950s movie “La Dolce Vita,”” which hung an im- age of decadence on Italy. They are reluctant politicians, having only a group of ‘‘spokesmen” rather than a typical party bureau- cracy. They have no national plat- form and refuse even to call them- selves a party. They won’t be tagged officially as “‘left”” or ‘‘right,’” with one spokesman saying the Greens are better defined as being ‘‘elsewhere.”’ Another spokesman, Massimo Scalia of Rome, admitted the ma- jority of the Greens “have some ex- perience on the left,’” though not necessarily in organized politics. “We would like to think on a world scale, but act on a local scale,” said Scalia, explaining a bit of Greens philosophy. “‘No place is an island. The whole earth is con- nected.”’ Political analysts here have pre- dicted the Greens have the potential to attract as much as 10 percent of the eligible voters, which is a signif- icant chunk in a multiparty nation like Italy. Nobody here gets a ma- jority vote, with the two most popu- lar parties, the Christian Democrats and the Communists, weighing in at RESPECTED IN DEATH: Communist Party Secretary Enrico Berltlinguer. less than 34 percent each last elec- tion. The smaller parties typically draw 1.5 to 12 percent but can have disproportionate power as possible members of a governing coalition. Governments stand or fall on the support of the small parties. The old-line parties are taking the threat of the Greens so seriously that they are unabashedly dogging voters who might be tempted by the smiling sun symbol of the new guys. The Social Democrats have refo- cused their campaign theme from one on economic issues to “‘the qual- ity of life.” The Republicans are brushing off the green ivy in their party symbol, which they now say always has stood for environmental con- cerns. So that no one misses the message, their new campaign post- ers feature a big green heart. The Communist Party newspa- per L’Unita just threw a 10-day en- vironmental fair in the center of the ripe Tuscan hill country. And the Christian Democrats, besides pro- posing a new ecological philanthro- py. have proved their concern by publishing campaign leaflets on re- cycled paper. “The major parties, which had been previously deaf to ecological and environmental problems, are all running to paint thermselves green,” said Scalia, the Greens’ spokesman in Rome. The Christian Democrats (DC) and the Communists (PCI) have the most to lose to the Greens. For nearly 40 years the DC had been Italy’s dominant party, with the PCI edging a close second. In last year’s elections for the European Parliament the Commu- nists scraped up a lead for the first time in history. They got 33.3 per- cent of the vote to the Christian Democrats’ 33 percent. The PCI thus achieved the sor- Passo or surpassing in votes, which the conservative Christian Demo- crats long had warned could posi- tion the Communists to demand a place in the ruling coalition. But the 1984 election was for the European Parliament and so had no direct domestic effect. And Italians believe it was slightly skewed anyway, coming days after the sudden death of Communist Party Secretary Enrico Berlinguer. A charismatic figure respected even by his foes, his funeral drew more than a million mourners to Rome and probably a sympathy vote to his party. : Wit last years ‘“‘sorpasso”” a rather muddied phenomenon, it again, has become a central issue. The Christian Democrats and their coalition partners are raising the spectre of new instability should the PCI advance in the standings be- yond the DC, even though the May 12 election is only for local offices. The balance between them tee- ters on a wisp, less than half a per- centage point. And the maverick Greens may draw votes from any- where, considering that their envi- ronmental, almost apolitical thrust ignores ideological boundaries. A recent poll by the weekly magazine L’Espresso pointed up the uncertainty. Almost 36 percent of the Italians polled said they could not even guess how well the Greens would do. Scalia estimated his group has an audience of 15 percent of the voting population, but he calculated they might actually get 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent of the vote. “When we started we were very little, then we got to be little,’ he said. “‘Now we are a little bigger.’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 12, 1985 (+ Newsday and Dallas) \f"

The restrictions would mean cul- tural extinction for thousands of rugged nomads, whose roaming life- style has withstood ravages of the desert harmattan winds and West Africa's raging sun. THEY HAVE BEEN driven with decimated herds to the fringes of towns or to far-distant pastures by the two-year drought. When they return, they may find new laws drastically curtailing herd size, restricting cattle exports, and limiting grazing lands to a fraction of the present wide expanse. Similar policies have heen recom- mended across Africa’s Sahel, where people face diminishing choices for existence on land increasingly turn- ing to sand. At a “national debate” in Tahoua, Niger’s cattle capital, government officials from the local to the na- tional level expounded the new wis- dom: rein in the herders. They are mostly of the proud and feisty Tuareg and Fulani tribes, numbering more than one million in Niger’s population of 6.5 million. “It is indispensible to favor a pro- gressive sedentarization and integra- tion of the herdsmen in sites favor- able to agricultural activities,” said the paper presented by the ministry of planning. Selected papers were made avail- able from the closed conference, on which the government will base a J a” \\AFRICA — Blade Map new national policy. They described the jolting change as necessary both for the well-being of the stockmen and for the regeneration of the land that they say has been ruined by overgrazing. THE HERDSMAN who accused the government of trying to kill his people was one of the few tribesmen at the conference. He was quoted by Le Sahel, the government-controlled newspaper. “They tell us to destock and to cultivate the land. But where is this land?” asked another, questioning how the poor soil can support crops when it barely sustains pasture. After the 1973 drought, the gov- ernment restocked the herds. A livestock counselor in Tahoua department, one of Niger’s seven state-like districts, recommended that this time the herds not be re- plenished but be limited propor- tionally to family size. He proposed that each family be allowed five head of cattle per person. IN GOOD YEARS, some herders have had as many as 1,000 cattle, according to another official, Maj. Tanja Manadou, the prefect, or gov- ernor, of Tahoua district. Perhaps the nomadic stockman Should se down. ha 0 cattle and farm on a permanent plot, he said in an interview. “These are difficult choices, but one is obliged to make them,” he said. “If there is no pasture, there can be no livestock-raising.” Some outsiders question the ‘motivation and effectiveness of re- strictions. Both diplomats and relief workers in Niger say the nomads and semi- nomadic people are of minority tribes, hold no important govern- ment jobs, and are independent spir- its often at odds with the military regime and with the farming com. munity on which their herds some- times encroach. “Some say the best thing is to let these people be free, that they will be the best managers of the land,” one western diplomat noted.

They already are being “sedentarized.” In the village of [llela, for example, Tuaregs who lost their herds are living on the edge of towns, gardening and receiving peri- odic rations of sorghum grain.

        "ocr_text": "Vienna’s Close Escape Into the Past By Marcia Kunstel Newsday Special Correspondent 6 (x0 Vienna — Sweet strains of Viennese waltzes still drift through the dense greenery of a down- town park. The spring opera season is still a sellout, held in the 1860s French Renaissance opera house so ornate it could have been designed in a bakery. And the grand winter balls still draw crowds of the old and newly rich, who dance in brilliant gowns and black tie until 5 a.m., then cap the night with goulash and a beer. , The meeting here last week of Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko seemed to matter less to the Viennese than the opening of the annual musical celebration, the Vienna Festival. a Vienna is not caught in a time warp, but it has made a close escape. Once the seat of the grand Hapsburg Empire, which spread its mantle across most of present-day Eastern Europe, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of France and Italy, Vienna now governs only Austria, a domain smaller in size than the state of Maine. _ But the city of imperial royalty has accommodat- ed itself with grace to the shrinkage, as well as to a philosophical swing into a 20th Century socialist de- mocracy that today is sharing a bit of the wealth. Vienna still moves at an older pace, a city where food, music and sights are to be savored, al- ways slowly, But even at tempo largo, there are changes, In the woodsy Stadtpark (state park), where in warm weather a tuxedoed conductor daily leads musical tributes to waltz king Johann Strauss, old- timers linger in the security that their state pension check will sustain them every month. Viennese can wander through 800 parks pre- served across the city, bright splashes of green these spring days where lilacs spill over the bushes and breezes carry cooling mists from fountains. Should a toddler exit headfirst at the bottom of a ‘slide or tumble offa swing, parents can rely on medi- cal care that has been world-renowned since the 18th Century, and today is public property by virtue of national health insurance. Young families, regardless of their income, also enjoy the cushion of the kinderbeihilfe, or children’s allowance, a 1,000-schilling ($50) per month stipend for each child, Trade, industry (nationally owned) and a big dose of tourism have renewed the economy that the war left in shambles, enabling the government to extend a heavyweight safety net under its peo- ple. And the economy works well enough that they have plenty to buy. Thirty years of independence and neutrality, celebrated last week, have enabled Austria to main- tain its delicate position as an East-West crossroads. two statesmen had been invited to join the celebra- tion of Austria’s postwar autonomy, won only after a decade of four-power occupation, Their discussions led.to speculation that Vienna, as a neutral capital, could become the site of a summit meeting between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev later this year. ' Life here is a world away from that of Vienna’s. closest foreign neighbors in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The country is certainly less capitalistic than most of the West, but is without the political repres- sion and economic hardship of the East.

Perhaps in a related vein, a legacy not easily admitted is many Austrians’ readiness to align themselves with Nazi Germany in the war, a merger following years of open anti-Semitism here. Today an art show depicting dramatically chang- ing currents of Austrian artistic and intellectual life from 1870 to 1980 has raised controversy in Vienna. One room focuses on anti-Semitism publicly flaunted in political posters and tracts during the period, leading Theodore Herzl to the theory that a separate nation was the only answer for Jews. In the same time span Adolf Hitler worked here at the state theater, a young man who built his own philos- ophy of human perversity and hatred. “There has never been a show here on the Nazi era,” said a museum guide, “It is not something they talk about.” Possibly that unspoken legacy has led Austria to a perpetual act of atonement, becoming a sponge of central Europe, readily soaking up thousands who flee repression in their homelands. Austria has been a country of first asylum ever since it regairied its own independence, accepting practically anyone seeking refuge. ; Last year it accepted more than 1,000 Czechs and nearly as many from Hungary. An estimated 10 to 15 percent of the refugees never leave Austria, and many are assimilated into the parks and cafes and gingerbread buildings o Vienna, where jobs and housing are available, _ “If there weren't an Austria,” said one western diplomat, “I wonder sometimes what would have happened to all these people.” Newsday - May 20, 1985 (Also Atlanta Constitution) \f"

Beirut By Marcia Kunstel 2 | Newsday Special Correspondent Beirut — As ‘American television viewers watched, a crew member on the hijacked TWA jet stuck his blond head out the cockpit window, smiled wide and waved to reporters on the airport tarmac yesterday morning. In moments a gunman appeared in the same window frame and shot at the journalists. U.S. officials trying to track the slightest details of the seven-day crisis probably had to await the 7 p.m, television news to view this clue to the well-being of at least one of the American hostages and the mind-set of their militant Moslem captors. The United States is so hamstrung here that envoys an't get within spyglass distance of the Beirut airport, much less engage face-to-face either the Moslem captors or their mediators. The hostages and their keepers sit in Vest Beirut, while the small, official U.S. presence here onfines itself to the relative safety of East Beirut. The line between them is not crossed easily these days, espe- ially not by Americans. To keep up communications the U.S. government oc- asionally makes direct link by telephone, but more com- only filters its point-of-view through proxies such as he Algerians. At times the U.S. diplomatic force hears ibout developments in the crisis from the media. “You're telling me something I just haven't heard,” aid one diplomat, when asked late yesterday afternoon ibout the announcement that some hostages were sup- nosed to be at an “Airport meeting within a few hours. The U.S. delegation operates under siege conditions in two embassy buildings in Christian-controlled East Bei- rut. Guards shout and wave automatic weapons at pass- ing motorists who even hint at stopping, a response to car- bomb explosions that wrought mass death at the embassy and the U.S. Marine barracks in 1983. Almost no one without an embassy staff badge vets inside, including American reporters. In other countries Americans at least can reach the lobby of their embassy. The hostages, the extremists who hijacked them and the wore moderate Slilile leaders uf Ainal who ate iediai- ing for them all hold forth in West Beirut, the Moslem sector. One western diplomat said no official American per- sonnel have crossed into West Beirut since another, less serious, bombing at the American Embassy last Septem- ber. “That's part of the overall problem of trying to main- tain an embassy in a divided city,” he said. “We rarely go over to the west. We do it through local employees, and occasionally our contacts come over here.” Often is is impossible for anyone to cross, as hap- pened yesterday afternoon and night. The Green Line that separates west from east, Mos- lem from Christian, is a series of roadblocks making all but a few roads impassable between the two sectors. ’ Trailers from tractor-trailer rigs stretch sideways across some, and dirt mounds 20 feet high block other roads. One or more manned blockades may be opened when the two sides aren’t shooting at each other. But when the gunfire resumes, West and East Beirut are separate en- titles, enemies at war.

But in Christian East Beirut, the most important news of the day is the morning radio report of the death count and ferocity of fighting from the previous night.

For Renee Bachour the events o! the night are equally important They determine how many teen. agers risk venturing out to the YWCA vocational school, which she runs in one of the sector's hottest spots. The school is about a half. mile from the “green line” that di- vides Beirut’s warring factions. Beside it, sentries guard the bul- let-pocked office of Al Kataeb, the militant right-wing Christian party, and across Sassine Street an eternal’ flame burns atop a marble slab. There a bomb destroyed the Kataeb: headquarters in 1982 and killed 23 people, including Bashir Gemayel, the group's leader and president- elect of Lebanon. Remaining buildings are sand- bagged and gouged with battle scars, and square concrete barriers are insurance that no one can speed a bomb-laden car into Al Kataeb ter- ritory again. This is the street the 200 YWCA Students must walk, on the days they are motivated enough to come to class. “We have to get people used to working, studying, doing whatever they have to do, because we cannot wait for the war to end,” Mrs. Ba- chour said. “We're still going on as if there were no war.” Instilling motivation may be im- , possible. One mother, who identi- ' tied herself only as Frieda, said on of her children sometimes asks fo a future favor or goody, “if I com home from school.” He is not sur enough to say “when I come home.’ The YWCA school teaches basi courses in secretarial skills, inte rior decorating, hair dressing ani dressmaking, but perhaps the mos important concept drummed int young minds is the need to persis| under sometimes terrifying condi tions. As classes ended for the summe! last Friday, Mrs. Bachour was prouc to calculate her school was open 13: days this past year, although the target was 150 days. “IT think our school is the only one that had this attendance,” saic Mrs. Bachour. i The attendance record is mor remarkable when considering tha the students, both young womer and men, are a mix of Christian anc Moslem. “Here the YWCA is for every: body,” said Mrs. Bachour, a Leba: nese Christian. “We believe in one Beirut.” A few students come from the other side of the “green line” that cuts Beirut into Christian (eastern) and Moslem (western) sectors. Daily those from the Moslem side must pass the double checkpoints to get out of the west and into the east, except when the fighting has been so bad that the line shuts down. Gebeily, who owns the dress shop in East Beirut’s still thriving commercial district, certainly ex- pects his 20 employees to be on the job daily. On Friday the streets were jammed with a mix of cars, from Mercedes to the khaki green jeeps of the Christian militia. Yet Gebeily’s store had only a few customers browsing the racks of medium-priced to very expensive clothes. The previous night had been deadly along the “green line” — two dead and more than a dozen wounded — but the owner attribu- ted the lack of shoppers more to the hour. It was after noon. The banks and schools were closed, and many peo- ple routinely escape to the cooler -mountains for weekends or after- noons. \\The mountains are safer these days. Although most of Gebeily’s mer- chandise comes through the airport in West Beirut, he said he has not been on the other side of his city in three years. Another merchant, who used to live in the west, said he has not crossed in seven years. “There are Moslems who bring it over the ‘green line’,” he said, figur- ing it costs him about 5,000 Leba- nese pounds or $300 to get a small truck of goods less than 10 miles from the airport. War costs like that, added to the low value of the Lebanese pound, have inflated prices of most con- sumer goods, the people here say. Gebeily said women who used to buy six dresses in his shop now get three for the same price. And a woman told of a friend who no longer could take the anxi- ety of life in the center city, so sought a place in the mountains. She found something little better than a hovel, but the price was ex- orbitant. Asked why it was so high, the owner replied: “We are selling you peace here.” Dallas Morning News June 23, 1985 (Also in Newsday) \f"

A spokesman of 7 the group negotiating for the hijackers said the Israeli action would not bring freedom to any of the hostages from the American plane. “It will not be done by installments,” said the Amal militia’s information chief, Ali Ham- dan. “I don’t think it will be like we release two people and the Israelis release 31.” The hijackers are demanding release of about 760 | Lebanese, most of them Shiites, who are being = detained in Israel. Hamdan said a piecemeal trade-off would be outside Amal’s function as mediator for the hi- jackers of the TWA jetliner. “Our role is clear. They get the 40 and we get the 750,” he said, referring to the sets of prisoners in round numbers. (Israeli officials said the liberation of the 31 — 26 Shiites and five Sunni Moslems — was not intended as part of a deal with the sky pirates, who commandeered a TWA flight from Athens to Rome on June 14. But Israeli sources said it was intended to provide an opening to end the impasse in the 10-day-old hostage crisis, The Associated Press reported. [The Israeli plan was announced by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on CBS’ “Face the Na- tion.” Rabin, speaking from Tel Aviv, said the government had worked out an agreement with the International Red Cross, and that the Israeli Cabinet had approved it yesterday. [He said the release was not in reaction to the hijackers’ demands, but only in accordance with the “security situation in southern Leba- non.” [Sources in Jerusalem said Israel decided on the gesture to provide “a test case” for Nabih Berri, who agreed a week ago to negotiate on behalf of Shiite hijackers. The Israelis want to see if Berri is in control of the situation and to provide the United States with room to ma- neuver, said the sources.] AP Photo Prisoners walk about the grounds at Israel's Atlit military prison, which holds more than 700 Lebanese prisoners whose release is sought by Shiite militants holding 40 Americans hostage in Beirut.
