        "ocr_text": "Errors, caution, and incompetence delayed release By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service ABOARD THE CARTER PLANE TO GERMANY — Extracating the hos- tages, said Hamilton Jordan, was “like a Willie Moscone pool shark, where you have to hit the ball perfectly, and if you do, 10 balls fall into the pockets at the same time.” To another man who served high in Jimmy Carter's administration, it was more like an exquisitely complicated railroad bankruptcy in which the claim- ants refused to talk to each other. One participant in the negotiations marveled at the telephone bills that must have accumulated as lines were held open 24 hours a day between bank- ers in London, New York and Algiers. “I hope the banks are paying that one,” he said, AS RECONSTRUCTED from sources aboard the Air Force jetliner carrying Carter to Germany, the hostage crisis was prolonged by Iranian incompe- tence, instances of excessive caution by bank representatives and by a last- minute typographical error. From this perspective, embarrassing Carter was just an incidental bonus for Iran, not the main motive, Former White House aides said the Iranian factions reached an apparent concensus by early last September that the hostages were a net liability. Despite the distractions of the Iran- Iraq war, Iranian leaders seemed to have regarded the American election Nov, 4 as their target date for reaching a final bargain with the United States. “The war, along with their own inep- titude, lack of control and stupidity, prevented that,” one participant said. After missing that deadline, Iran de- cided on Algeria to serve as the main intermediary. It fell to Algeria to con- vince Iran that its original demands on the ex-shah’s fortune were impossible. THE NEXT DEADLINE agreed upon among most Iranian factions was Tues- day noon — the time of Ronald Reagan’s inauguration. That cutoff, too, was nearly missed. The Carter aides saw their deal slip- ping away at mid-morning Monday when the Bank of England received no instructions following Carter's 4 a.m. announcement that an agreement had been reached. ° “Everything was supposed to happen instantaneously, but for the next day, we were solving problem after prob- lem,” said one of the people who took part in the open-line conference calls across the Atlantic. As it turned out, the main holdup was what one ex-official called “‘a legitimate gripe” by the Iranian Central Bank over some proposed language in a banking transfer instruction. Lawyers for the group of American banks had drafted what the White House originally took to be a routine re- lease from liability allowing the banks to turn over frozen Iranian assets to an escrow account. Iranian representatives protested, saying it could be interpreted as barring Iran from pressing its money claims through arbitration. “THAT WAS NOT our intention,” a source said, “but at the time, there was so much mutual paranoia that it took a long time to work out.” Late Monday, Roger Brown, the London-based solicitor for the Iranian Central Bank, drafted a new form of re- lease, and it was accepted in Washing- ton. It was a simple order from the Ira- un © i American banks to move precise — amounts of Iranian deposits, along with interest, into the escrow account in the Bank of England, At 10 p.m, Monday, someone claiming to be an authority in Tehran approved Brown's draft, But in Washington, Treasury Secretary William Miller and White House counsel Lloyd Cutler had their doubts. “We said OK, send us the message, and we waited and waited, with noth- ing happening,” said a source. The order was supposed to be telexed in two seconds from Tehran to Brown's office in London. There, any typos were to be corrected on a master tape before the message would be once again sent from Tehran to the 12 American banks holding frozen assets. FOR NEARLY FOUR hours, no mes: sage came from Tehran. Then, as Miller and Cutler were approaching despair, a lawyer in London reported on the open line that a telex machine had “just burped.” Out came the bank transfer order, but it was full of garbled words, Had this been any normal banking transaction, the banks would have insisted on delay- ing until the order was letter perfect. Worst of all, the code number was incorrect at the beginning of the trans- fer message, and by now, Carter had less than nine hours left in office. “With the help of the secretary of Treasury, the banks took courage in their hands and went ahead and com- pleted the transfers into the escrow ac- count,” said one negotiator. Indeed, Miller ordered the banks at 3:45 a.m. Tuesday to make the transfer when they failed to agree on their own. Carter, up all night, telephoned Secre- tary of State Edmund Muskie at one point shortly after dawn, ordering him to get an immediate message to a Bank of England representative. Carter wanted the man to know he was per- sonally responsible, in Carter’s opinion, for keeping the hostages in captivity 15 minutes longer than necessary. THE BANK OF ENGLAND had to certify that $7.977 billion had been deposited in its escrow account. Be: cause this had to be done by telephone between London and Algiers and then painstakingly verified, the process took ‘from 6:45 a.m, to 8:04 a.m. Iran was informed two minutes later that all the banking preparations were in place. Still, the hostages were not moved to the airport immediately. Gary Sick, a navy captain assigned to the National Security Council, sat in the White House cradling two telephones, one to U.S. intelligence monitors and the other to military officials preparing - to receive the hostages. Every few minutes it was up to Sick to tell Carter where the hostages were. Sick telephoned Carter once as he was dressing for the inauguration, then again as Carter was having ceremonial coffee in the Blue Room with Ronald Reagan. AS CARTER RODE in the final motorcade up Pennsylvania Avenue, Sick radioed to say the hostages were still on the ground. When Carter reached a holding room in the Capitol, Sick called again to say nothing had happened despite a rustle of news bulle- tins, Carter’s motorcade had just pulled away from the Capitol toward Andrews Air Force Base when Sick radioed that the plane carrying hostages had left Tehran’s airport. It was 12:33 p.m. Atlanta Constitution - January 22, 1981 \f"

        "ocr_text": " U.S. nuclear plan targets Soviet ‘regime’ By Joseph Albright Cox News Service WASHINGTON — The current American nu- clear war plan stresses the possibility of a U.S. counterstrike aimed at eliminating the “or- gans” of Soviet communist party control inside Russia as an alternative to blasting traditional targets like cities and factories. This refinement of U.S. nuclear targeting doe- trine was described Monday in the annual re- port of the Defense Department, released with outgoing Defense Secrerary Harold Brown's name on the cover. Although prepared by the former administration, the plan will remain in effect as one of President Reagan's nuclear “op- tions” unless he chooses to cancel it. Brown said the latest U.S. targeting strategy assumes that Soviet leaders value “preservation of the regime” at least as highly as the survival of the Russian civilian population. “We must, and do, include options to target or- gans of Soviet political and military leadership and control,” Brown wrote, “A clear U.S. ability - to destroy them poses a marked challenge to the essence of the Soviet system and thus contrib- utes to deterrence.” Brown said this option was one of the features approved by President Carter last August as part of his still-classitied Presidential Directive 59, which outlined a comprehensive “counter- vailing strategy” for deterring “limited” as well as all-out nuclear wars, No details were made available on what kind of targets would have to be destroyed to carry ~ out a counter-regime strike. The list presum- ably includes communist party offices, regional KGB headquarters, police computer networks and Kremlin command-and-control centers. ah said the Pentagon can envision “many scenarios” in which it would be prudent to let the Russian “supreme command” survive to play a role in terminating hostilities. “Posses- sion of a capability is not tantamount to exercis- ing it,\" the report observed. He said that in the early years of nuclear weaponry, the United States relied on a threat of “massive retaliation” against Russian cities to head off Russian aggression. As Russia gained parity in nuclear weapons, threats to de- stroy Russian cities lost their’ utility, forcing U.S. defense planners to devise a succession of “flexible” targeting strategies aimed at various military and economic targets — i now polit- ical control centers. The report made clear that even i so-called “limited” nuclear exchange between the two su- perpowers would be enormously destructive. It estimated that a Russian attack directed solely on the 1,054 American ICBM silos would kill be- tween 2 million and 22 million people within 30 days. An American effort to destroy aK political control mechanisms would no doubt cause at least as many Russian civilian casualties, since in many cases the, key centers are in or near cities. However, no estimate of collateral a alties was available. The report did say that a “massive” nuclear exchange involving a broad range of military and economic targets would kill from 20 million to 165 million Americans and from 23 million to 100 million Russians. Brown said nothing in the new strategy sug: gests that nuclear war is an instrument for achieving American foreign policy goals. “It is ota first-strike strategy,” he said.

        "ocr_text": " Sia 6 we By Joseph Albright Cox News Service ABOARD THE U.SS. IOWA — When they mothballed Adm. Willia (Bull) Halsey’s battleship, they capped her guns but left the gunnery range finder set for 5,300 yards. Twenty-three years ago, the old gray warship was given a once-ove with Cosmoline grease and left to floa in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Bu the Navy never really gave up on her Every couple of years, a crew fro) the Navy’s inactive ships maintenance detachment blasted off the rust fro the hull with a watergun. Then paint ers sprayed the ship’s exterior wit 800 gallons of a special rust-resisting gray paint called formula 123. And now, word has come from De fense Secretary Caspar Weinberge that the USS Iowa will be revamped a a cost of more than $250 million and sent back to sea. Congress willing, the launching will occur in about 1984. The chief of the civilian painting crew, retired Navy steward John H Price, 65, wasn’t even surprised “When you've been around the Nav for 45 years, nothing surprises you,’ said Price, who served on one of the destroyers that escorted the Iowa dur ing World War II. Price was standing amidships, worn hard hat on his head, when the nominal skipper of the mothballed Iowa, Navy Capt. Thomas Vojtek, ar rived Friday with about 20 photogra phers and reporters. Ordinarily, all the hatches are her mitically sealed, and dehumidifiers are kept running 24 hours a day t¢ keep the atmosphere inside the ship a a desert-like humidity of 30 percent But for this occasion, the hatche were opened and outsiders were al lowed to wander for an hour through out the 887-foot-long ship Halsey used as his flagship during the Japanes surrender in Tokyo Bay in 1945. For this landlubber, it was a little like opening a pharoah’s tomb. Inside the No. 1 turret for the ship’s 16-inch guns, mattresses were still stacked on the bunks for some of the 79 gunners who would be inside when the Iowa skipper declared a wartime “condition three’’ alert. Still taped to a bulkhead was an Oct. 28, 1956 order signed by Lt. Cmdr. J.M. Mason that “all special weapons projectiles must be sighted hourly and the status of their security entered in the security log.” In the chart house, a navigator’s compartment just off the captain’s bridge, someone had left out on the map table a copy of “Complete List of Lights and Maritime Aids, Corrected to Jan. 1, 1957.” On the chart house shelves was an encyclopedia-size set of ocean maps, including the 1954 edition of “Sailing Directions for Northern U-S.S.R.,” published by the Office of the Secre- tary of the Navy. In the corner of the compartment was a green filing cabi- net full of duty rosters from the mid- 1950s. On top of a control panel someone had stowed a logbook. It was not what they made war movies about, but the stuff of the real Navy. A typical pen- ciled entry from March 3, 1956, read: “Main control requests permission to slow 10 knots. Permission granted.” At that time, the ship was berthed in Norfolk, Va., and was mainly used for training. By Navy legend, the Iowa is the only ship in the American fleet equipped with a bathtub. It was installed, ac- cording to Vojtek, to provide for the comfort of President Franklin D. Roo- sevelt, whom the Iowa took across the Atlantic in 1943 for the Tehran Con- ference with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. The white porcelain tub was dust- As1 covered but none the worse for wear in a corner of the quarters normally used by the captain. A cheap-looking plastic sofa was the only adornment of the compartment where Roosevelt slept. According to a hand-lettered plaque several decks down in the No. 3 boiler room, the Iowa was “decommissioned at 1939 Hours on 19 February 1958.” Before they sealed the ship, Phila- delphia Navy Yard crews spent months Cosmolining the guns, turbine blades and gears. They wired tags to every gauge and instrument with instructions on what fuses and wires would need replacing if the ship was recommissioned. The wiring, brass fittings and painted surfaces were simply left alone. Some of the paint hangs like orange peels from the bulkheads, but there were few rust spots, thanks to the dehumidifiers. In the fire control room, where the guns were aimed, the brass control switches gleamed under the TV lights. Despite the Iowa’s notable state of preservation, it won’t be simple bring- ing her up to the standards of the modern fleet. The guns, boilers, tur- bines and superstructure will stay. Most of the rest — including miles of electrical wiring, all the navigatior and communications gear, the aiming system for the guns — will have to be replaced. “Everything is done electronically now,” said Cmdr. Gilbert Moyers, the Navy yard administrative officer, sur- veying the 1950s computer that used to direct the ship’s 2,700 pound, high explosive shells to targets up to 23 miles away. On the aft deck, the Navy plans to install launchers for Tomahawk cruise missiles, capable of landing nu- clear or high-explosive warheads on targets more than 250 miles away. The refitted ship also will have shorter-range Harpoon missiles as well as a “close-in missile system” designed to defend the ship against the various anti-ship weapons devised by the Soviet Navy during the past three decades. The refitting may be assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where the Iowa has been floating since 1958, and where she was built in 1940-42. How- = Nie ee ‘a ever, Weinberger has not decided which shipyard will get the work. The Iowa is among three ships — two battleships and a small aircraft carrier — which Weinberger proposed last week to refit as part of his $33 billion program for “rearming Amer- ica.” Under his plan the carrier Oris- kany and battleship New Jersey are to come out of mothballs starting this year, with the Iowa to follow a year later. The idea of recommissioning battle- ships is dearest to the hearts of the Marine Corps, which wants the pin- point accuracy of their big 16-inchers to support amphibious landings. The Navy boosts the idea, too, with an eye to supporting the Rapid Deployment Force in some future battle in the Middle East. But approval by Congress is by no means guaranteed. Sen. Gary Hart (D- Colo.) took to the Senate floor to at- tack the Navy’s whole shipbuilding program, which stresses construction of big, expensive nuclear-powered carriers and cruisers. In his speech, Hart also criticized the idea of refitting battleships, saying the Marines could get more fire sup- port if the Navy chose to outfit some smaller ships now in mothballs. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said refitting the Iowa and New Jersey might make sense on an interim basis, but only if the Navy can solve its manpower problems. “Right now, they are 20,000 petty officers short,” Nunn said. “They still are not getting enough trainable peo- ple in the Navy. If they can’t man those ships, it’s a foolish expenditure.” Halsey is not around to testify on the question. He died in 1959, the year after the Iowa was decommissioned. Her glory days came before the days of Russian anti-ship missiles, when Halsey, commander of the 3rd Fleet, led his carrier task force in destroying the Japanese fleet at the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944.

Hinckley had been prescribed Valium to calm his nerves as part of his psychiat- ric treatment, Ruff said he had been told. “This is not a man with a clean re- Continued from Page 1, cord,” sald the prosecutor, nm Hinckley had been arrested last at al airport for possessing _ weapons and 50 rounds of ammu- on, IN A CRYPTIC reference, Rutt told the court It was “appropriate to note\" that then-President Jimmy Carter was in Nashville on the day Hinckley was arrested after an airport metal detector alerted marshals to the weapons in his suitcase. That gun charge later was dis- posed of when Hinckley forfelted a $62.50 collateral, Ruff said. Four days after his three guns were confiscate, Hinckley bought a “new ,\" according to Ruff, In January 198), he Ubught stil another, Ruff said. The courtroom interchange did not make clear which weapon was used in the shooting of President Reagan at 2:25 p.m, Monday as he emerged from a side exit of the Washington Hilton Hotel onto a Connecticut Avenue side- walk. Before the hearing, FBI spokes: man Roger Young described the weapon as a“,22-caliber Rohm, a rela- tively cheap gun usually referred to as a Saturday night special.” HINCKLEY'S court-appointed attor- ney did not dispute Ruft’s recitation ex- cept to note that Hinckley did not skip ball in the Tennessee gun case, Throughout the hearing Hinckley, clad in navy blue FBI-supplied coveralls, an- swered “Yes, sir,” and “No, sit” in a polite voice as the magistrate questioned him under oath about his fi- nances to determine whether the court should appoint a lawyer for him, The defendant said he had no job, no bank accounts and no interest in build: ings or real estate, “Could you pay a lawyer $1,000 as a down payment toward your defense?” Burnett asked, “No, sir,” Hinckley replied, Wilhite, flanking him at the defense table, interrupted to note that Hinckley “has some stock in his name in a closely held corporation, However, he does not know how much and he does not have control over it,” THE ONLY OTHER utterance from the defendant came when Burnett asked him to describe his automobile. “It's a 1977 Volare,” Hinckley sald. Ruff did not challenge Hinckley's ac- count, but noted that his father “is pres: ident of a corporation in Colorado and may indeed be in possession of substan- tial assets.” The senior Hinckley is chief executive of the Vanderbilt Energy Corp,, an oil and gas exploration company headquartered in Denver, Even so, Burnett said the defendant qualified under the law for court-ap- pointed counsel at least until the next preliminary hearing, which he set for 10. a.m, Thursday, Hinckley was being held at a Marine facility at Quantico, Va., south of Wash- ington, and was to undergo psychiatric testing later today to help determine his competency to stand trial, U.S, Attor- ney Charles F.C, Ruff said, A preliminary hearing before federal magistrate Arthur Burnett was set for 10.a.m, EST Thursday, Custody of Hinckley was formally transferred from the F’BI to U.S, Bureau of Prisons, Burnett sald he would enter a formal order today setting out condi- tions for the psychiatric screening, Dayton Daily News - INSTEAD OF BEING sent to the Dis trict of Columbia Jall, Hinckley was re- manded to the custody of the FBI, which will keep him in custody at the Marine site, This unusual of a defendant was agreed to for reagons after prosecutors agreed that the FBI custo- dians would not question Hinckley. At the close of the hearing, the magistrate ordered Hinckley to give the FBI a sample of his handwriting, Even before the preliminary hearing, Hinck- ley had given agents samples of his hair, blood and urine, Wilhite told the magistrate, Hinckley was charged with two felony complaints, ONE WAS THAT HE “knowingly and courtroom with a stark white celling and barely space for the two jammed: together tables for the tient and prosecution, THE ONLY MEMBERS of the public allowed inside the room were 22 report. rs who had been selected as a pool, Ap- proximately 50-newsmen had been Waiting in the lobby of the U.S, District Court building for four hours before the midnight arraignment began, So concerned were officials to avold a repetition of the Lee Harvey Oswald af- fair after the shooting of President Kennedy in Dallas in 1963 that cleaning women, court officers and reporters were herded out of the building's outer lobby and conducted through a metal detector before being allowed into the courtroom.

The hospital Paramedic Roberto Hernandez, who happened to be leaving the emergency emtrance when the limousine arrived, says Reagan staggered from the limou- sine. “By the look on his face — he was so pale — I thought he was having a heart attack,” recalis the 26-year-old paramedic. With a Secret Service agent support- img each arm, the President shuffied siowly about 45 feet imto the hospitai lobby. Then he began to collapse. ““The President’s eyes rolied back and his knees buckled amd he started to fall.” Hernandez said. He grabbed the President's legs and helped the agents carry him about 100 feet to code room SA, an adwanced trauma unit. Hernandez recalis ome agent telling a aoctor, “We don’t think he has been hit- Wwe think he may hawe broken a rib when we pushed him into the car.” The Paramedic noticed a littic blood on Rea- gZan’s mose and heard hirm complain, ‘*‘I can’t breathe.\"* = Dr. William O'Neill, a surgical intern im the emergency room has told one imterviewer the President’s blood pres- sure had dropped to 78.

JOSEPH GIORDANO. who had just finishe@ a gali-bladder operation, was talking with another patient when he heard his name being paged with unusual fervor. “*¥ had mo idea at all who the patient was until I got to the operating room.”* says Giordano, a 1967 graduate of Jef- ferson Medical College in Philadelphia. “*“¥ looked down and there he was.”\" Giordano. head of the hospital’s trauma team, found Reagan’s biocod pressure was already building back to a mormal level of 120. He had not gone imto shock, as it turned out. But because of breathing problems, Giordano in- serted a tube into Reagan’s chest. The President’s blood spurted from his chest, relieving pressure on his col- lapsed ieft lung. It was replaced by a transfusion. It took Giordano about 214 hours to make a six-inch horizontal incision near Reagan’s left nipple, stop the bleeding and remove the bullet from imside the lung- Reagan lost 3.7 quarts of biocod, about two-thirds of the blood in his body. “Busimess as usual Simce Lee Harvey Oswald’s act in Dallas 18 years ago, the federal fpovern- ment, the police, the press and even for- eigen notables have learned how to react with macabre efficiency to American assassination attempts.

The incident was classified as a per- sonnel error, not an equipment fault. By thén, the backup diesel study was just getting started. Two months later, Savannah River Plant suffered its third loss of offsite electrical power in 27 years. On Dee. 5, 1979, a tractor pulling a bushhog mower sliced into a downed South Carolina Electric and Gas Company line in North Augusta, 8.C., 20 miles beyond the plant boundary. One of the two dedicated power lines to the plant was knocked out by a cascading short circuit. At that point, the other dedicated line should have taken over the load, But a repairman had switched it off for half an hour to fix a power pole. The plant has its own coal-fired electrical genérating station that stays on all the time, producing about one-half of the power needed to run the whole plant. But, like New York City during the 1965 East Coast power blackout, the plant lacked an automatic mechanism to “shed the load” from its least important operations.

But Gen. Richard Ellis, commander of the Air Force’s Strategic Air Command, has opposed the B-1 because he con- tends Congress will not keep funding both the B-1 and the Stealth bomber. Ellis has sought a “stretched,” or lengthened, version of the F-111 fighter-bomber as an interim replace- ment for the B-52 until the Stealth bombers are ready. The trade journal Aviation Week & Space Technology said this week that effectiveness in reducing the radar pro- file of future warplanes. One of these items was described as “high temperature magnetic absorber materials.” SEVERAL OUTSIDE radar experts, who declined to be identified, said this means the Air Force apparently is plan- ning to replace certain metal sections of an airplane's outer skin with a mag- netic, ceramic-like material similar to a substance commonly used in household months, according to the notice. It said the radar-absorbing parts could be used either on a new ‘high technology bomber” or on a new “advanced tacti- cal fighter.” Sharon Jones, a spokeswoman for the 1,000-person Wright-Patterson labora- officials “can’t say for — the new devices will be used Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger “may in fact be leaning’ toward selec- tion of the Stealth bomber rather than the B-]. But this choice would involve “a delicate matter of politics” for the Reagan administration, the magazine said. It quoted one high-level Pentagon official as saying: “It tells the Republi- can leadership in Congress that they were wrong, and that Jimmy Carter’s effort to go to a Stealth bomber instead of the B-1 was not politics at election time but a sound military decision to take advantage of advanced technology and save some money.” The materia) is believed to be some form of ferrite, a chemical compound of - fron oxide and one or more other metal oxides.

Eielped Create As Well as Destroy INuclear Reactor By Joseph Albright Cox News Service WASHINGTON ~ The United States has helped France become a nuclear Sugar Daddy to Iraq through little-known transfers of nuclear tech- nology and highly enriched uranium fuel. So when Israeli pilots in American warplanes leveled the French-built re- actor in Iraq last Sunday, it was a case of one form of American technology destroying another. France manufactured Iraq's Osirak reactor with a special kind of fuel plates patented 23 years ago by an American nuclear physicist working for the U.S, Atomic Energy Commis- sion, What made the plates special was their shaping with aluminum alloyed with bomb-grade uranium — uranium that had been painstakingly purified until it contained 93 percent of the rare uranium-235 isotope. Uranium- 235 is the material that splits to make a chain reaction. France got more from America than this critical design feature, For more than 4 decade it also has been buying 93 percent-enriched uranium to | run a dozen research reactors in In 1975, Iraqi revolutionary council leader Saddam Hussein took a liking to one of these French reactors, called Osiris, during his tour of the French nuclear research complex at Saclay, 10 miles southeast of Paris, After se- cret negotiations with French Pre- mier Jacques Chirac, the Iraqi leader contracted to buy one just like Osiris, along with about 254 pounds of highly enriched uranium fuel. The Iraqi reac- tor was named Osirak. Osiris was then operating on 93 per- cent pure uranium that had been pro- duced by the U.S. government's enrichment plant near Portsmouth, Ohio, according to export records at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commis- sion. Since 1975, the Portsmouth plant has shipped 1,703 pounds of 93 percent enriched uranium to fuel Osiris and other research reactors in France, NRC records show. Neal Moore, a senior licensing offi- cial at the NRC, acknowleged that American exports of highly enriched uranium may have indirectly contrib- uted to France's ability to export nu- clear technology to third countries — even though France is barred by con- tract from reexporting any American uranium. America’s indirect patronage of French nuclear exports can be traced One stating vont was Oct. 14, 1952, when Eugene Wigner, an American nuclear physicist who had helped de- velop the World War II atomic bomb, applied for a secret patent on a new kind of research reactor. That was during the heyday of the Eisenhower administration's “Atoms for Peace” program, aimed at pro- moting exports of peaceful nuclear reactor technology to dozens of coun- tries in Europe and elsewhere, . Sal Ceja, an international programs officer at the U.S. Department of En- ergy, said a quick search turned up no record that France was ever formally licensed to use the Wigner patent. (The 1958 patent expired in 1975 and had never been on file in France.) Instead, he said, files show that the US. government made the details of the Idaho reactor available to all countries without restrictions at a 1955 international conference in Swit- zerland on peaceful uses of atomic energy. In 1956 Eisenhower authorized sales of enriched uranium abroad, but specified initially that it could not be enriched to more than 20 percent 0 uranium-235, At that par, the urani- Eisenhower relaxed that restriction slightly about 1960, allowing France and other allies to buy tiny quantities Of 93 percent uranium, President Ken- nedy lifted the restriction another notch in 1961 to let France buy about 15 pounds of the highly purified mate- tal, The Osiris reactor was finished in 1965, It was the largest of a dozcn French research reactors that used highly enriched uranium, machines with melodic names such as Minerve, Rapsodie, Harmonie, Pagase, Siloette. Through the late 1960s and early 19703, exports of highly enriched ura- nium gradually increased to about 300 pounds a year, At the start of the Jimmy Carter administration in 1977, officials wor- ried about possible proliferation of nu- clear weapons considered cutting off the exports of highly enriched urani- um to France, After a six-month hi- atus, Carter authorized a resumption of exports, along with a fresh policy Statement urging France to shift its reactors gradually to a lower grade of uranium, Officials at the NRC and the US, Department of Energy said they were confident no American enriched ura- nium has been diverted to Iraq, al- though they haven't tried to account for all the shipments, Palm en a June 14, 1981 \f"

For more than a decade, the gun control debate in the United States has been bogged down over such issues as registration and confiscation of weapons and the question of the people's right to bear arms. Much of the controversy resulted from a lack of basic information about what type of guns are actually used in crimes, where and how criminals obtain their weapons and the way these guns move through our society. Por the £ these key manner, 7 2 . = ide irst time, this series attempts to provi facts in a comprehensive and intelligible Our reportin into the weaponry of c g effort led us in a a Amer ican crime, the inner workings of the Legitimate gun industry and the murky world of gun smugglers. Using the Freedom of Information Act, we obtained government computer t imprinted with detailed descriptions oF 14,268 handguns which had been cowtiscated by police and federal agents. We hired a Cn eniting Firm to process 250,000 blips of information pred tapes —~ thereby creating an unprecedented tle of criminal handguns. \f It showed that the overwhelming weapon of choice among both street criminals and assassins is a class of short-barreled handguns known as \"Snubbies.\" Joseph Albright, a two-time winner of the Sigma Delta Chi award for Washington reporting, initiated the series, working full time on it from late June until early September. In time, the Cox reporting team came to include three other reporters from the Washington Bureau: Andrew Alexander, Cheryl Arvidson and Henry Eason. The New York Times and The Washington Post both have published editorials praising our work. Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of \"The Washington Reporters,\" wrote of this series in a recent article: \"It is devastating. It is also the most sophisticated piece of investi ; : : have ever seen.\" gative journalism I Andrew J. Glass Bureau Chief December 1981 \f<“SNUBBIES”’ the handguns criminals prefer The Snub-Nosed Killers FONAgUNS In America First in a series By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — With their slen- der butts and cute little muzzles, they look like toys. One flick on the trig- ger and out barks one-third of an ounce of lead at 735 miles per hour, shaped to plow a mushroom cavity into someone’s gut. They are the snub-nosed killers: a sub-species of feather-light, extra- short handguns that are inaccurate beyond the range of a card table. As home-defense devices, they are less humane than electric stun guns, less reliable than full-sized pistols, and probably less effective than shot- guns or German shepherd dogs. Their advantage is they leave no unsightly bulges when they are con- cealed. Thus police detectives carry them in arm holsters. Store owners hide them in their belts. Mothers pack them in purses, occasionally using them to drive off muggers. As this series of articles will show, tion cost of $39.95, ranked crime g gun ond és involved in snub-nosed guns — both cheap and expensive, domestic and _ foreign made — also have proven to be the overwhelming weapon of choice among modern criminals. Indeed, evi- dence from Atlanta, Miami and 16 other cities indicates that two out of every three handguns used in mur- ders, rapes, robberies and muggings were ‘“snubbies’” — handguns with barrels protruding no more than three inches beyond the cylinder. Short-barreled guns also run through the history of American assassinations. A search of historical records showed that since 1835, 10 out of 15 assassins and would-be assassins have chosen extra-small pistols in their assaults on presidents and other political figures. This series of articles was prepared by four members of the Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau: Joseph Albright, Andrew Alex- ander, Cheryl Arvidson and Henry Eason. Also contributing were Tom Elias in California and Jack Knarr and Phil Stanford of the Miami News. Researchers: Diane Danielek, Janice Johnson and Helen McMaster. (Hsin = This gun was used in the attempted See of President Reagan. It is the number one crime Ci ae) ek Salat =] it is also the cheapest of the top 15 uns currently being made. \"4 The starting point for these articles is a 12-inch reel of vinyl computer tape imprinted with detailed descrip- tions of 14,268 crime guns. The guns were seized by police and federal agents in street crimes in 18 metro- politan areas during the first nine months of 1979. The records were funneled into a Treasury Department computer when local police depart- ments called Washington to have the guns traced back to their manufac- turer by contacting the department’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Fire- arms, known as ATF. Under the Freedom of Information Act, The Cox Newspapers obtained a copy of the tape, after con- fidential information on the identities of retail gun dealers and gun purchasers had been elec- (1d al (Stem ‘1itin Rate) l6to = \ftronically blocked out. A team of reporters and re- searchers then sorted the traced guns by makers and models, with the aid of American Management Systems, a computer con- sulting firm. Once assembled, the 250,000 blips of informa- tion disclosed in unprece- dented detail what kinds of handguns are instruments of crime, where they come from and how long they have been in circulation. To complete this intelli- gence report on the weap- onry of American crime, reporters also examined 20,000 gun manufacturing and importing records and conducted 75 on-the-record interviews with foreign gun manufacturers, wholesal- ers, dealers, illegal gun smugglers, law  enforce- ment authorities, legisla- tors and pro- and anti-gun lobbyists. It proved impossible to extend the study to cover shctgun and rifle crimes, since nearly all the trace requests involved  hand- guns. In any event, national Justice Department crime surveys indicate handguns account for more than three-fourths of all gun murders and assaults as well as more than 90 per- cent of all robberies in which a gun was used. In describing various handguns, these _ articles refer to both pistols and re- volvers. A pistol is a hand- gun whose chamber is inte- gral with the barrel. A revolver is a handgun with a cylinder containing multiple chambers that can be discharged in succes- sion. The official records dis- closed that: e The country’s leading crime instrument was a short-barreled, .22-caliber revolver assembled by the German-owned RG _ Indus- tries Inc. of Miami. The company assembles’ the guns from sets of parts shipped from its German affiliate, Roehm GmbH. One out of every seven handguns seized by police in street crime cases was a Roehm-origin gun; one out of twelve was a Roehm .22- caliber model. RG Indus- tries’ fastest seller, a 2- inch-barrel .22 revolver called the RG 14, was the type of gun the FBI said was fired by John H. Hinckley Jr., accused of at- tempting to assassinate President Reagan last March. The gun retails for $39.95. (The Roehm GmbH gun firm described in this story has no connection with a larger and better known German company, also called Roehm GmbH, which manufactures plas- tics and pharmaceutical supplies.) © Contrary to popular impression, most street guns are not cheap, low- caliber, foreign-origin “Saturday Night Specials.” Of the 15 leading crime Chiefs Special as a police “back-up” weapon. It also sells the gun to civilians through sporting goods dealers. In 1979, one out of five crime guns recovered by police was some kind of a Smith & Wesson. One of 17 was a Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special or one of its virtually identical variants. The Chiefs Special, which is less than half the weight of the traditional Colt six- shooter, sells for $170 to $240. © Both the RG Industries .22 and the Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special are exam- ples of snub-nosed guns that are statistically more prone to crime than aver- age handguns. About 4 per- cent of the handguns in cir- culation are Roehm-origin .22s, but they represented 7.9 percent of the handguns 6 The country’s leading crime instru- ment was a short-barreled, .22 caliber revolver assembled by the German- owned RG Industries Inc. of Miami.gg guns reviewed in The Journal-Constitution Wash- ington Bureau _ analysis, only two — the Roehm .22 and the Tanfoglio .25 Titan — fit that exact descrip- tion. Ten of the 15 leading crime guns were made in America out of U.S. gun parts. Of the American- made guns, seven were made by Smith & Wesson, Colt and Charter Arms, all makers of high-quality, relatively expensive guns. Seven of the 15 crime retailed for less than $100. The eight others range from $117 to $330. Ten of the 15 had a bullet size of .38 or .357 caliber; the rest were smaller. e The second-ranking crime instrument was the snub-nosed, American- made, Smith & Wesson .38 caliber Chiefs Special. As the country’s leading hand- gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson advertises the traced by police at crime scenes. Similarly, Smith & Wesson Chiefs Specials make up no more than 3 percent of the stockpile of handguns in the United States. But Chiefs Specials were traced in 5.9 percent of the 14,268 handgun- related crimes. © One of 20 crime guns is a palm-sized, .25-caliber, automatic pistol — _ the Titan — selling for less than $75. The leading source is a pair of factories in Brescia, Italy, owned by Giuseppe Tanfoglio and his four children. Pistol parts from those factories are assembled into guns by two Miami assembly plants, Firearms Import & Export Corp. and Excam Ince. Virtually identical .25 palm pistols also are made by half a dozen American companies, including Raven Arms of Industry, Calif., Bauer Firearms of Fraser, Mich., and Sterling Arms of Lockport, N.Y. e Guns manufactured by Sturm, Ruger & Co., a firm that specializes in long-bar- reled target and hunting pistols, are much less prone to become involved in crimes than average hand- guns. In 1979, the company sold 16 percent of all hand- guns throughout the United States — roughly the same market share it has held for two decades. Yet, only 3 percent of the handguns recovered at crime scenes in 1979 were MRugers. Company president William Ruger said his firm “does not make small pocket ros- coes,” slang for pistol Asked why, he said: “Partly it was that I thought they were contro versial and partly because I saw no sporting purpose in them.” e Recently purchased guns are more likely to be used as crime instruments than older guns. An ATF tabulation shows 18 percent of the crime guns traced in © 1979 were a year old or less. The next largest cate- gory was_ two-year-old guns, representing 10 per- cent of the crime guns. After that, the percentages trailed off year by year — 6 percent of the crime guns were eight years old, 4 per— cent nine years old. It was almost as if guns had a2 kind of radioactive half-life as crime weapons. AL though most crime guns were new, one murder weapon in Miami was 2 1918 Colt .45, and one Atlanta robber used a 1917 Smith & Wesson .32.

Yea \fmurders, robberies and assaults were these light- framed ‘‘snubbies.”’ The Victims The attempted assassina- tion of Ronald Reagan will be recorded in history, but not so the names of Brett Rushing, Sondra Spearman, L.S. Spencer and Fenwick Langlanais. All four were killed within a short period before and after the Rea- gan shooting, each a victim of the same type of hand- gun allegedly aimed at the president — a Roehm RG 14. Rushing, 34, died March 28, 1981, after being shot in his Memphis, Tenn., home. His wife was critically wounded. Police held Rush- ing’s cousin, Mark Franklin Farrow, 27, in the prison ward at the hospital. A witness said during dinner, Rushing asked Far- row to pass the biscuits, and Farrow then threw a biscuit at Rushing, ex- claiming, ‘I’m tired of you making derogatory re- marks about me.” A short time later, Rush- ing was dead, killed by a single shot in the right side. Ms. Spearman, 28, of Tampa, Fla., also died March 28. She was shot in the face with a RG 14 dur- ing an argument with a neighbor. Police arrested the neighbor, Paulette Parks, 31, and charged her with first degree murder. Spencer, 41, of Austin, Texas, was shot to death May 10 by his common-law wife, who apparently mis- took him for a_ burglar. Spencer was trying to open the door of the house when he was killed. Police said Maud Nicely yelled, but when Spencer did not re- spond, she fired a Roehm RG 14 through the door. The bullet struck Spencer in the chest. Langlanais, 67, of Port Arthur, Texas, died May 24 when he was struck in the chest by one of three shots fired from a Roehm RG 14. Police said the shooting occurred during a domestic quarrel at his home. The History Small, easily concealed handguns have been an American institution for a century. Through the years, they have been called “last chance guns,” “suicide spe- cials,” “Lilliput pistols,” “belly guns,” “ghetto guns” and “the ace in the hole.” Only since the mid-1950s have they been called Saturday Night Specials, a Mame said to have been coined by Detroit police to describe the weekend traf- fic in cheap guns from Ohio. The first was the single- shot percussion pistol, the Philadelphia Derringer, introduced in the 1820s by Henry Deringer.

No other manufacturer’s gun was so frequently found at crime scenes. AS a result of worldwide publici- ty turned on the Roehm RG 14, which the government says was used in the Reagan assassination at- tempt last March, the Roehm family says it has decided to scale down production and sales of its least-ex- pensive guns. Guenther Roehm, a principal offi- cer and stockholder in Roehm GmbH and a part-owner of RG In- dustries Inc. of Miami, which as- sembles the cheap handguns, said that continuing to make revolvers such as the RG 14 “is not good for us.”’ In the first interview granted by any official of the company in more than a decade, Roehm said he is concerned about what he called ‘‘an image problem’’ — one that might give Roehm GmbH a bad name with its machine tool clients and with customers interested in the more expensive handguns that Roehm also sells. Roehm is a tall, patrician figure who, at 56, has the polished man- ners of a European diplomat. He speaks English accurately, but halt- Ely: and was interviewed with ec of his export manager, Karl He is descended from generations of industrialists in Zella Mehlis Suhl, in what is now East Germany After World War II, he recalled, the Roehm family’s factories were in ruins. The “Americans picked us cause they were not interested ¢, have good companies with high level of production in the East Zone (under Soviet control). So they say take your technical people alon with you.’...So0 weca - 1 5 i me to a cam in Heidenheim (near Sontheim), and the Americans gave us f we looked around and .. ood. 12 oe a small room and we sta ing our oa again.” The old customers so to Roehm, ‘joined ‘by ‘new ‘custome ers. Some Americans came in the 1950s and interested the Roehms in manufacturing inexpensive hana- guns for the market in the United States. It was a good market. Then, as Roehm explainea, when the gun control movement gainea strength in the United States and cheap exports were banned in 1968, the Roehms became involved in Producing some handgun parts here Which were added to other parts in Florida to make complete handguns that could be sold legally in Ameri- ca, “So what you want to know,” Roehm said, anticipating the ques- tion, ‘tis do we go into this cheap business or do we intend to go the other way? “‘We want to go in the other way. I have been (to Florida) four weeks ago and I explained to my .people there, I want to make better guns, guns I can sell in five, six, eight years in the same way, good guns. We change the finish. We made more precision in the parts and so on. Sometimes the Americans want to go in another way. We want to go in this way, making better guns.”’ “We are satisfied with a small part of the business. We want to make good guns because our main business is with (drill) chucks and we don’t want to have a bad name with that.... Our image in this country is good and we have a good image in our main line (of tools) all over the world,” he said. To emphasize his point, he ges- tured to a glass display case in his Gun housings, not yet bl Sontheim Roehm plant office containing higher-quality pis- tols that Roehm also makes. They were moderately expensive hand- guns, such as .357 and .44 Mag- nums, priced out of the reach of the average street hoodlum in the Unit- ed States. Roehm would not say directly how he felt about one of the guns made by Roehm and RG allegedly being used to shoot President Rea- gan, but export manager Mack re- sponded. “Yes, we heard about it. Sorry for it,’’ Mack said. He elaborated, ‘‘This man could have attacked the President with a bomb or a knife or anything... . Somebody can make crimes with anything. Of course, it’s easier to use a gun for crime.’’ Mack said he assumes that ‘‘Most of the guns we make are just used for protection,’’ but added, “It can be that also some guns are also used for crime.”’ Cox News Service \fAssassins have always favored small, snub-nosed guns Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Down through American history, the weapons used by 10 of 15 assassins and would-be assassins of political figures have been among the most readily concealable variety of pistols then available. Here, compiled from records at a half-dozen archives, are the 10 instances when small pistols were used: ™ President Andrew Jackson was in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol when an assailant, Richard Lawrence, fired two shots and missed on Jan. 30, 1835. Lawrence fired two pocket-sized percussion pistols, which he with- drew from his inside coat pocket. ™ President Abraham Lincoln was murdered in Ford’s Theater in Washington on April 14, 1865. The assailant, John Wilkes Booth, fired a .44-cal. cap-and-ball Derringer measuring 5%, inches long. ™ President William McKinley was assassinated on Sept. 6, 1901, as he was about to shake hands with Leon Czologosz in Buffalo, N.Y. Czologosz shot him with a short- barreled .32-cal. Iver Johnson revolver. — President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt escaped as- sassination on Feb. 15, 1933, while riding in an open car in Miami. The assailant, Giuseppe Zangara, fired a .32-cal. revolver. The gun, made by the U.S. Revolver Co. had a 5- inch barrel. ™ Sen. Huey Long (D-La.) was assassinated in the rotunda of the Lousiana State Capitol on Sept. 8, 1935. The murderer, Carl Austin Weiss, used a small .32-cal. Brown- ing automatic pistol. ™ Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was fatally wounded ina Los Angeles hotel on June 5, 1968, the night of the 1968 California primary. Sirhan Sirhan, the assailant, fired a snub-nosed .22-cal. Iver Johnson revolver with a 2.5-inch barrel. — Gov. George Wallace of Alabama was wounded while campaigning at a Laurel, Md., shopping center on May 15, 1972. His attacker, Arthur Bremer, fired a snub- nosed Charter Arms .38-cal. Undercover revolver with a 2- inch barrel. — President Gerald Ford escaped injury on Sept. 22, 1975, when Sara Jane Moore fired a shot as Ford was leaving a San Francisco hotel. Her gun was a .32-cal. Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special with a 2-inch barrel. ™ San Francisco Mayor George Moscone was mur- dered in his office on Nov. 27, 1978. The assailant, former city supervisor Dan White, fired a .32-cal. Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special with a 2-inch barrel. - President Ronald Reagan survived an attempted assassin’s bullet outside a Washington hotel on March 30. 1981. The gun the FBI said was taken from the accused attacker, John W. Hinckley Jr., was a .22-cal. RG 14 revolver with a 2-inch barrel assembled from German- made parts by the Miami-based RG Industries Inc. Following are five other cases involving other types of assassination weapons: - President James Garfield was shot in the back ata train station in Washington on July 2, 1881, and died the following September. The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, fired a .44-cal. British Bulldog, a heavy-framed revolver of unknown barrel length. ™ Former President Theodore Roosevelt was shot and seriously wounded while campaigning for the presi- dency in Milwaukee on Oct. 14, 1912. The assailant, John Schrank, fired a heavy-framed .38-cal. Colt revolver that was built on a .44-cal. frame. The barrel length is unknown and the gun has been lost. ™ President Harry Truman escaped death on Nov. 1, 1950, when two Puerto Rican nationalists, Griselio Torre- sola and Oscar Collazo, shot their way into the Blair House in Washington, where Truman was living while the White House was being renovated. The guns taken from the attackers were a German Luger pistol and a Walter P-38 pistol, both full-sized handguns. ™ President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a motorcade in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. The attacker, Lee Harvey Oswald, fired a mail-order Mann- licher-Carcano rifle from the window of the Texas School Book Depository. President Gerald Ford escaped assassination on Sept. 5, 1975, in Sacramento when Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme aimed a pistol at him as Ford reached out to shake her hand. The gun was a full-sized Colt 1911 Army model .45-cal. automatic pistol, which she had secreted under her flowing dress. — Joseph Albright Leading sources of handguns 1979 (na) Dam G) lee oe MOTE: VYhese 10 companies scoounted for 2,788,776 of the 2.178, 374 hamigune soli in 19379 -in the State Handguns Market eokd — U.S. shere 458,207 21% 356,827 18% 204,517 9% 186,333 3% 179,034 138,633 793,165 .

(Ri \fThere’s plenty of protit potential Piimil $39.95 sun JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service There was a good deal of profit in the $39.95 gun that has been identified by federal officials as the one used to shoot President Ronald Reagan. By piecing together information from U-S. Customs documents, wholesale gun catalogs and the files of a 1972 lawsuit, it is possible to make this unofficial estimate: ™ RG Industries Inc., the plant at 2485 NW 20th St., Miami, that assembled the RG 14 .22 caliber revolver allegedly used in the assassina- tion attempt, earned a gross profit (before corpo- rate income taxes) of about $6 per gun. Scott Wholesale of Indian Trail, N.C., which bought the gun from RG Industries on July 27, 1979, added a markup of about $9 when it re- sold it to a retail dealer, Rocky’s Pawn Shop in Dallas. Rocky’s Pawn Shop added another mark- up of about $12 when it sold the gun to accused assailant John W. Hinckley Jr. The pawn shop bought the gun from the wholesaler on Oct. 11, 1979, and sold it to Hinckley on Oct. 13, 1980. The federal government collected Cus- toms duties and excise taxes of about $2.50 on the gun. On top of that, the government stood to collect an undetermined amount — perhaps as much as $10 — from income taxes on the gross profits of gun assembler, wholesaler and dealer. Only one component in a RG 14 revolver is American-made. That is an arc-shaped frame that fits inside the plastic handle grips and connects the barrel, trigge™ and cylinder. RG Industries bought the frame from South- ern Die Casting, 3500 NW 58th St., Miami. It was made by pouring 4 molten alloy called Zamak No. 5, which is 95 per cent zinc, into a form. Once Dingram shows the perts that make up the .22 caliber AG 14 handgun cooled and transported to RG Industries, the frame was painted by an assembly worker to look like blued steel. Nine years ago, one of the metal frames cost RG Industries 43 cents. With inflation, the price has gone up to about $1. The 31 other parts, which were made of steel, arrived in a set from West Germany aboard a ship. The sets — packed 1,000 per crate — were shipped to Miami by Roehm GmbH, a tool and gun factory in Sontheim, West Germany, whose West German owners are also the sole stockhold- ers in RG Industries. A parts set for this model gun had a value of $7.15 in 1980, RG Industries’ Customs documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show. That figure includes customs duty and presumably, a profit for Roehm GmbH. ° - ae renee cost a assembling one RG 14 in iami can be roughly estimated at $3 gun, including overhead. at $3 to $4 per When RG Industries sells a small lot of for example, 25 RG 14s to a retail sporting goods store, it charges $23.27 a gun — meaning its profit is about $11 per gun. But when it sells larg- ero & Wholesale jobber such as Scott Whole- . S reportedl $6 profit for Ra Es edly about $18, hence the dustries. About 90 people work at RG Ind ustries, some on machine tools and some on guns, commercial sources report. Most are said to earn little more than the $3.60-an-hour minimum wage. The com- rene 5 gross sales are reported to be $12 million a In 1979, the plant assembled 175,000 pistols and revolvers, according to commercial sources. In the first quarter of 1980, production was up to a rate of 220,000 a year. . ° \f These Light-Frame Handguns, Products Of Smith & Wesson (right) And Charter Arms, Are About Three Times As Crime-Prone As Heavier Pistols Two short guns vie for pocket space Chiefs Special and Undercover: Weapons coveted by Discriminating Thugs This is the second in a six-part series. By Joseph Albright Washington Bureau SPRINGFIELD, Mass. — Few outside the gun business have heard about the arms race between the Chiefs Special, a palm-sized .38 revolver made by the long-established Smith & Wesson Co., and a look-alike weapon called the Undercover, made by the up-and-coming Charter Arms Corp. Yet the collateral damage includes: e Alabama Goy. George Wallace, shot and paralyzed with an Undercover in 1972. e President Gerald Ford, nearly assassinated by a Chiefs Special in 1975. (Sara Jane Moore pulled the trigger but missed.) e San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, murdered with a Chiefs Special in 1978. e Ex-Beatle John Lennon, shot and killed with an Under- cover in 1980. @ Washington cardiologist Dr. Michael Halberstam, mur- dered with a Chiefs Special in 1980. Some Chiefs Specials and Undercovers were originally sold to civilians in gun shops with no more paperwork than any other handgun. But most, say the presidents of both companies, were sold either to police departments for detectives, or to individual uni- formed officers who wanted the tiny, hard-hitting guns as “backups” for their service revolvers. As it turned out, the qualities that appealed to law-abiders have also turned the Chiefs Special and the Undercover into Cadillacs of crime guns, coveted by discriminating thugs who would prefer not to use poorly made, small-caliber “Saturday Night Specials.” In 1979, 5.9 percent of all handguns recovered in violent crimes in Atlanta, Miami and 16 other cities were Smith & Wesson Chiefs Specials, according to a computer analysis of federal gun-tracing records by Cox Newspapers. Carrying the numbers one step further, there is reason to believe the Chiefs Special in civilian hands is about three times as crime-prone 2s a typical handgun. Here is the chain of statistical evidence suggesting that Chiefs Special has a higher-than-normal crime rate: Add up the serial numbers that the company has assim cials: roughly 1.5 million since 1950, no more than one which are still in police hands. Divide the remaining 1! in civilian hands by the total U.S. stockpile of about civilian-owned handguns. Result: Only about 2 pere civilian-owned handguns are Chiefs Specials, but volved in 5.9 percent of violent crimes. Applying the same technique, the Charter cover is also about three times as crime-prome 2 handgun. There are about 600,000 Undercovers = With one-third in police hands, those in civiliam B= only 0.8 percent of the total civilian handgun \fPercent of handguns recovered in violent crimes were Undercovers. Smith & Wesson president James L. Oberg was asked why the com- pany sells small handguns, in light of studies by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms showing the prevalence of short- barreled guns as crime instruments. Oberg replied: ‘I sell the guns that the market is demanding. We don’t have any category for people who are going to keep a weapon in be drawer, but we know they Oo.” Some of his friends have told him they are reluctant to keep full-sized handguns in their homes, Oberg ex- plained. When asked how Smith & Wes- son determines its “product mix’’ of standard and short-barreled hand- guns, Oberg said: “I would have to say that we are focusing on dollars more than anything else. Most of our motivation of what we do here is to supply doNars to our stock- holders. For us, a great deal of the motivation is to run a profitable company.”’ After the interview, Oberg mailed a revised version of that statement: ‘‘Our purpose is to satis- fy the needs of our customers with products which emphasize quality, safety and service. Our mix also has to consider producing an adequate return for our shareholders.”’ Guenter W. Bachmann, a Smith & Wesson vice president, said the company has no way of knowing whether small handguns such as its Chiefs Special are more likely to be used in crimes than larger hand- guns. ‘‘Let’s face it, they are all con- cealable,”’ he said. At the Charter Arms plant in Stratford, Conn., company presi- dent David Ecker said he feels “pretty sick’’ whenever he hears that a Charter Arms Undercover has been found at a crime scene. “I know I felt a great sigh of re- lief on hearing that our product wasn't used (in the attempted assas- sination of President Reagan),”’ said Ecker. “I do not like to see any of our products used in that way.” One of the roots of the rivalry over the high-class, short-barreled gun market was a decision by New York City police in the late 1940s to arm women Officers with an exper- imental light-framed revolver. Since then, the rivalry has been fed by two unrelated factors. One was that the basic patents for sma)}} handguns expired in the 19th centu- ry, leaving a small arms manufac- turer virtually no protection against Plagiarism in gun designs. The Other was the rioting that spread from Watts to Harlem to Detroit in the mid-1960s, generating a huge market for ‘‘self-defense’’ hand- guns. In January 1949, a story in the Springfield, Mass., Union recorded a decision by Smith & Wesson, the city’s second-largest employer, to begin production of a new ‘‘so- called light-frame revolver” for po- licewomen in New York. “The New York police girls carry these guns in shoulder holsters which outwardly appear to be shoulder bags,’’ the newspaper re- ported. “‘The light-frame weapon is widely popular among _ sporting clubs and shooting ranges.”’ The new version weighed only 19 ounces. Its butt was as skinny as an umbrella handle. The cylinder was drilled for only five .38 cartridges Since it wasn’t big enough around for six holes. With its 2-inch barrel, the gun was only 6.5 inches long. It fired with a kick that left the wrist tingling. The Colt Firearms Division had been selling policemen a _ similar- && I would have to say that we are focusing on dollars more than any- thing else —James Oberg, Smith & Wesson73 looking, slightly heavier .38 snub- nosed revolver called the Detective Special since 1927. For the civilian sector, Colt sold limited numbers of a comparable snub-nosed gun it called the Bankers Special. And Smith & Wesson was al- ready marketing a rival called the Terrier. A 1952 company catalog said, ‘This little gun is to be found In a great many homes where it represents a unit of protection for the citizen and his family.” It looked like the gun developed for the New York policewomen, but it wasn't as sturdy. The Smith & Wesson sales force broadened the horizons of the po- licewomen’s revolver by introduc- ing it at a 1950 conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Colorado Springs. As part of the promotion, police dele- gates were asked to vote on a name for the gun. “When the votes were counted, the most commonly suggested and appropriate name was the .38 Chiefs Special,\" Smith & Wesson historian Roy Jinks has written. The name was officially adopted.”’ The Chiefs Special was a small sideline for Smith & Wesson, the nation S leading pistol manufactur- er. Little effort was made to push snub-nosed gun sales to civilians. At the same time, Colt was content to sell its Detective Special largely to policemen. There was an unfulfilled demand, and by 1963 Douglas McClennahan realized it. McClennahan, a young draftsman who had worked at Colt Industries and three other Connecti- cut gun factories, set out to design a competing snub-nosed gun. In late 1964 he displayed his first proto- type to a few gun columnists at a National Rifle Association conven- tion in Los Angeles. It was to become the basis of Charter Arms, a new company 75 miles down the Connecticut River valley from Smith & Wesson. Ini- tially, its only product was a snub- nosed .38 revolver weighing three ounces less than the Chiefs Special. At $55, it was $17 cheaper than any snub-nosed gun in the Smith & Wesson arsenal. In a press release to gun writers, Charter Arms explained that the purpose of the ‘Undercover’ was to satisfy a need on the part of ‘‘all law enforcement officers and homeowners.” “The new (Undercover) was well received,” a writer for Guns & Ammo magazine recalled later. “Even fussy handgunners were soon admiring and buying the all- steel compact.” Charter Arms picked a fortuitous time to enter into the gun market. As Ecker, the company president, recalled: ‘‘You had a terrific civil rights problem, with riots all across the country. There was a terrific boom in firearms sales. So any fire- arm that was being manufactured or imported was being sold.”’ William B. Gunn, then Smith & Wesson’s president, decided he could not ignore the new Under- cover. A clipping from Gunsport Maga- zine, found in the military history collection of the Smithsonian Insti- tution, describes how the country’s No. 1 handgun manufacturer react- ed: “Back at the Springfield ranch, the S & W ramrods took a dim view of the business they were losing and decided to sew up the commer- cial market again by _ hustling through another production run of 18,000 new Chiefs Specials. Anoth- er source said it was three runs of ,000 each ....” ae Gunsport writer, Jan Steven- son, quoted a Smith & Wesson offi- cial as saying: ‘“‘It’s true, we ed making Chiefs Specials again, an we're putting them on the market we can.”’ as voday, Senith & Wesson declines to give out production TUres ‘or its snub-nosed guns. But from @ look at the pattern of serial num- bers assigned to Smith & Wesson \flight-frame guns, it is obvious that the company boosted its production of Chiefs Specials in the years after the Undercover came to market. A chart of serial numbers pub- lished in Jinks’ ‘‘History of Smith & Wesson,” a glossy volume for gun fanciers, indicates that the factory assigned an average of 39,000 serial numbers a year to light-frame re- volvers, principally the Chiefs Spe- cial, in the 1950s and 1960s. Lennon In a 12-month period ending in 1970, the company used 100,000 light-frame serial numbers. After that, light-frame serial numbers were assigned at the rate of at least 75,000 a year. Enter the magnum Another escalation in the snub- nosed arms race occurred in March 1968 when Smith & Wesson intro- duced an even more awesome weapon: the world’s smallest .357 magnum revolver. Smith & Wesson had been selling heavy, long-barreled .357 magnums since 1935, when it managed the publicity coup of presenting the first model to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. A newspaper clipping of the time proclaimed that film stars Gary Cooper, Clark Gable and Fran- chot Tone were also among the owners of ‘‘the Big Bertha of the handgun field.” A .357 magnum cartridge is one- eighth inch longer than a standard .38 special bullet, although they are virtually the same diameter. The magnum contains enough extra gunpowder to exert 40,000 foot-pounds of pressure on the bul- let, instead of 17,000 foot-pounds for a normal policeman’s bullet. That means a .357 magnum can blast through a wall and still kill someone. Smith & Wesson began efforts to shrink the frame of .357 magnum guns in 1954, at the suggestion of Bill Jordan, then a marksman with the U.S. Border Patrol. “Until this date ... no company had ever attempted to perfect a small frame for this cartridge,”’ wrote company historian Jinks. The result was the Smith & Wes- son Combat Magnum, a medium- framed revolver with a standard 4- inch barrel. Jordan, appearing on the 1955 television show ‘You Asked For It,’? held up the gun and called it “the answer to a peace of- ficer’s dream.”’ “ After what Jinks has described as considerable encouragement from Plainclothes law enforcement per- sonnel,” the company designed an even smaller .357 magnum during the 1960s. When it was offered to the public in the 1968 catalog, this 31-ounce miniature cannon was fit- ted with a 2.5-inch barrel, a round- ed butt fur easy concealment quick-draw sights. s Ford The competition responds Back at Charter Arms, McClen- nahan and Ecker devised what amounted to a counter-escalation — the Charter Arms .44 Special Bull- dog. It was 11 ounces lighter than the miniature Smith & Wesson Combat Magnum, although the di- mensions were about the same. It fired a bigger bullet, but one not fast enough to be classified aS ? magnum. In a glowing review for the mag- azine Guns & Ammo, pistol connoiS- seur Clair Rees said the Charter Arms Bulldog .44 “threw 60 per cent more lead’ than ordinary 38 caliber handguns. . “The new gun,” Rees wrote, ‘‘aP\"' pealed instantly to many pistoleers who had a need for a relatively small, easily concealed revolver but. who lacked faith in the perform ance of .38 speci erious nociaiwee Pecial loads for $s A Cox Newspa mpy : pers co hat analysis of £2un records found Pe- only about 0.2 f gun b: -4 per cent O were covered in rimes Chart: 1979 street c da only Arms Bulldogs —,“@ombat Magnums.

New York’s “son of Sa™ ter \f2 Top U.S. snub-nosed gun makers Smith & Wesson OWNER: Since 1965, it has been a subsidiary of Bangor-Punta, a holding company formed in 1964 through the merger of the Maine- based Bangor & Aroostook Railroad and the Punta Allegre Sugar Corp., once an owner of sugar plantations in Cuba. Bangor Punta also makes Piper airplanes, powerboats and cement. The largest Bangor Punta shareholders are James E. Stewart, a Minneapolis businessman who owns 21 percent of the common stock, and Count Ferdinant Graf von Galen, a West German private banker who owns 13 percent. FINANCES: In 1980, Smith & Wesson sales rose to $124 million, of which $93 million was from the sale of handguns of all sizes. Smith & Wesson’s pre-tax profit margin was 17.9 percent — the highest of any Bangor-Punta division. MANAGEMENT: The Smith & Wesson president is James L. Oberg, 63, a tall, silver-haired metalurgist who last year earned $147,600. He is a graduate of Lehigh University and a senior vice president of Bangor Punta. PRODUCTION: 617,425 handguns in 1979, of which 159,218 were exported and the rest were sold on the U.S. market. Of those produced for U.S. and foreign markets, 224,994 were .38 Specials, including standard police revolvers and Chiefs Specials. Another 220,129 were .357 magnums. Other products include ammunition, chemical Mace, knives and night vision devices. The company has 2,500 employees in a Springfield, Mass., factory designed in 1948 with 8-foot-thick foundations to absorb the shock of bombs or earthquakes. Below the plant are subterranean chambers in which workers could continue pistol making even after an attack. VIEWS: It is the only leading company in the handgun industry on record as favoring any gun-control laws. David Wallace, board chairman of Bangor-Punta, reiterated to stockholders in May: “Some means of keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally unbalanced, the alcohol or drug affected, or criminally disposed peo- ple must be found. We continue to believe that a federal gun-owners licensing law, together with mandatory sentencing of people who use firearms committing a crime, would give the best answer.” Smith & Wesson James Oberg President \fCharter Arms OWNER: David Ecker, 48, one of the original investors, became the majority owner three years ago when he bought out the de- signer of the Undercover revolver, Douglas McClennahan. Ecker, who collects guns as a hobby, says he has been interested in guns since he made zip-guns out of car aerials when he was a teen-ager in New York City. He served in the Air Force and attended the University of Wyoming on the GI Bill. Before joining Charter Arms full-time in 1967, he was a postage meter salesman for Pitney- Bowes. On his office wall is an autographed photograph of Presi- dent Ronald Reagan, to whom he had made a campaign contribu- tion. Another photo shows Ecker and his pregnant wife at a night- club, flanked by four bare-breasted cocktail waitresses. FINANCES: Ecker says the company goal is to earn 15 percent profit after taxes, ‘““but we don’t always make that.” As a privately held company, it has not published sales or profit figures. MANAGEMENT: Ecker is president. A corporate biography says Ecker’s forte has been “organizing Charter’s marketing strategy and building the product line.” The vice president for manufactur- ing is Bob Mailoux, formerly a tool designer for Winchester, Avco and other firms. PRODUCTION: 67,259 handguns in 1979, of which 53,540 were -38 Undercovers and 3,860 were .44 Bulldogs. About 200 metal workers, parts assemblers, inspectors and others turn out the guns at a one-story warehouse and factory in Stratford, Conn. Ecker says. he is hoping to move the company to a Southern state with ‘‘a better business climate”’ next year. VIEWS: Ecker takes a dim view of most gun control legislation, although he would support harsh justice for those using guns in crimes. “‘As far as I am concerned, you have a kangaroo court and the next day you put him away,” he said. He believes people in certain cultures have a “‘propensity to kill’? with whatever weapon is available. Charter Arms president David Ecker \fSaul Eig sold Americans the sun-toters Model T The Snub-Nosed Killers Handguns In America Third in a six-part series By Joseph Albright and Henry Eason . Washington Bureau MIAMI — About 2.5 million of the smallest, least expensive and most crime-prone guns in American can be traced to the ingenuity of a for- mer gun importer named Saul Eig, who is now in retirement, savoring his art collection in a $350,- 000 home here. Understanding the snub-nosed gun phenome- non in America requires understanding Eig, the Henry Ford of the $14.95 revolver. There were “snubbies” on the market before Eig. But he has done as much as anyone else to make small handguns available to the masses. Always working within the law, he has imported about 1.5 million guns on his own and then helped create another enterprise that has assembled 1.1 million more guns from imported components, most or them after he left it. Tapped up in his former career are ques- tions: Where P a did low-priced handguns come from? How were they mark i eted? What is the background of RG Industries Inc., the Miami gun plant that assembled the revolve Ronald Reagan? r used in the shooting of Eig, in his 50s, cut his last gun deal seven years ago, then retired. Consider the marks Eig notched on American gun commerce: ° From 1956 to 1968, one out of every 10 guns sold in the United States was iraported and distributed by corporations carrying Eig’s name: Like @ latter-day Sam Colt, he imprinted the name “EIG” on the handles of thousands of these. Others carried German or Italian factory brand names. Before 1968, Fig ranked among the two or three leading gun importers in the country. © In 1968, Congress passed a law aimed at banning imports of cheap small handguns. The bill drafters did not reckon with Eig’s ability to exploit a loophole. He and three West Germans created a Company in Miami to import sets of handgun parts and attach them to 43-cent American-made frames © make revolvers that could not be imported. The Miami News The Miami News . i ig’ imported This .22 caliber revolver bearing Eig s name was imp to the U.S. by Eig before 1968 \fIt was the first plant in the country devoted solely to assembling foreign- made gun parts. The plant, RG In- dustries Inc., is now the third-rank- ing U.S. handgun supplier in the country. Recalls Guenther Roehm, one of its founders: “Eig came to us and said: ‘Now I have some problems, I can’t import any more. So you have to assemble these (guns) in Miami near me.” ” © From 1968 to 1974, Eig worked as an officer of or consultant to three other Miami companies formed to assemble handguns out of imported gun parts. Even as a consultant, he was a go-getter. In 1972 he wrote a gun factory in Italy, pleading that it is ‘fof utmost importance” that the factory produce “‘large quantities” of a new model revolver “‘in order to avoid losing orders.” Eig has never been one to trumpet his commercial achievements. Since he began importing guns in 1956, his name could be found in only one news- paper article. That was 12 years ago. In it he told his interviewer, ‘‘We don’t want publicity.” He has not become more talkative lately. A Cox Newspapers reporter visited Eig’s home in the posh Miami enclave of Coconut Grove in a vain bid to gain an interview. On a second visit, a reporter succeeded in talking briefly with Eig outside his home. “I’ve been out of that business for over 10 years, and I have nothing to say about it ... We sold the business in 1970, and I haven’t had anything to do with it since,” Eig said. Still, Eig’s role in the postwar gun business can be traced in some detail through 15,000 pages of handwritten gun sales ledgers maintained by Eig bookkeepers from 1956 through 1971. The documents were obtained by Cox Newspapers through a Freedom of In- formation Act filing with the Treasury Department. The department’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms took custody of Eig’s 65 looseleaf binders full of records when he went out of the gun business. “‘We use the Eig records almost every day,”’ said a bureau agent, ex- plaining they are consulied whenever a police department seeks to trace the serial number of a gun of the type Eig imported. Other insights into the postwar cheap-gun boom came from Guenther Roehm, a principal of a West German tool and gun company that once was Eig's main gun supplier. Roehm is now also vice president and a one-third stockholder in RG Industries in Miami. Roehm, 56, said during an interview in West Germany that he and his fami- ly began manufacturing blank-firing starter pistols and revolvers at a factory in Sontheim in 1951. The blank guns were a small sideline to the family’s four-decade-old ma- chine tool business, Roehm GmbH, which specialized in making steel chucks for clamping drill bits. (The Roehm GmbH company de- scribed throughout this story has no connection with a larger and better- known German company, also called Roehm GmbH, which manufactures plastics and pharmaceutical supplies.) In the mid-1950s, some U.S. soldiers in Germany purchased Roehm starter pistols and brought them back to the United States. As a result, in 1955 or 1956, a U.S. merchant appeared at the factory to examine the Roehm line of starter guns. “He said, ‘Hah, you could manufac- ture a (live ammunition) revolver for me,’” recalled Roehm. “We said, ‘We have never done that before — what is your opinion of how to do that?’ He said, ‘OK, you would take this Part and that part, just take the Parts you use to make a starter gun and make a (live ammunition) revolver with it.’ ” Another Roehm executive, export GG Eig came to us and Said...

Eig, who up to then had been a dealer in knives and scissors, distrib- uted guns under the name Eig Cutlery Inc. Records show he made his first €un sale in April 1956. Among the earliest customers of Eig » identified the Cutlery and its affiliate, The Eig Corp. were Vick’s Swap of Tampa, Fla., Liberal Loan of San Antonio, Texas, Star Brokers of Albany, Ga., Uncle Jake’s Pawn of Dallas, Roberts Sport- ing of Atlanta and National Gun Traders of Miami. . It was a fairly typical slice of the Eig clientele for the next dozen years: pawn shops, hardware stores, big city gun shops, gun wholesalers. The 12-ounce winner Eig’s first and biggest selling gun was called a Roehm 10 revolver. One weighed just 12 ounces — less than 4 third the heft of an old-time Colt six- shooter. The plastic handle was about as big around as the top of a soft drink bottle and its barrel measured only 2.5 inches long. Roehm 10s usually re tailed for $14.95. The Roehm 10 was not famous for its reliability. In a 1971 test for the Treasury, officials of the H.P. White Laboratory in Bel Air, Md., found that a Roehm 10 misfired 371 times 11 2,100 pulls of the trigger. Another stage of the test was to drop each revolver to the ground fivé times from waist level, making sure it landed upside down on its hammer. The object was to measure whether 4 - | can’t import any more. hese (guns) in Miami near oehm Gmbh revolver had a reliable safety mech- anism to prevent the hammer from striking the firing pin and firing a bul- let by accident. The Roehm 10 fired the first time it was dropped. Along with some more expensive gun models made by other manufacturers, the Roehm 10 was recorded as failing the “thammer-droP test.” A sampling of Eig’s gun records indicates that the two corporations bearing his name imported betwee? 1.4 and 1.6 million handguns betwee” 1956 and 1971. About one-third of these were made by Roehm Grher which also sola i i TQ OO its handpuns vo large-volume importers in New and California. The coming of the 1968 8U” oe act spelled curtains for some 8\" Porters. B Eig- On Oct. 1, 1968 — 22 “ays lee became effective — Fig 4 \fWest German gun suppliers joined to incorporate RG Industries Inc., for the purpose of “‘carrying on the trade and business of manufacturer of tools and firearms,’’ Florida incorporation Papers filed in Tallahassee show. The stock was divided equally among three West Germans, who 13 years later are still reported by com- mercial sources to be the sole owners of RG Industries. They are Guenther Roehm, his brother Heinrich Roehm, now 71, and Heinrich’s nephew, Hein- rich Peter Roehm, now 43. Eig, who was listed as a director, helped set up a plant for RG Industries around the corner from his own wholesale gun warehouse in Miami. The site of the RG Industries assembly plant in Miami was purchased from the Pentacostal Holiness Church of Coconut Grove for $45,000 in 1968. Early in 1970, Eig told the Roehms he had lost interest in the gun business. “*He said, ‘I’m not interested any more in business. I’ve worked enough, I am going to stop it,’ ” recalled Guen- ther Roehm. At the same time, Eig notified his main Italian gun distributor, Giuseppe Tanfoglio, that he was dropping his exclusive franchise to distribute Tanfoglio Titans, a .25-caliber palm Pistol, throughout the United States. Bereft of Eig’s participation, the Roehm family resolved to hire other local managers to keep RG Industries rolling. And they did. RG Industries assem- bled 1.1 million small pistols and re- volvers between 197] and 1979, an average of 122,000 a year, company records filed with the Treasury show. Most were RG 14s, the gun used in the shooting of Reagan. RG Industries also imports about 30,000 or so already assembled revolv- ers from Roehm. The U.S. government allows this because they are larger guns with long enough barrels to be classified as sporting weapons. Since 1978, RG Industries has been operated day-to-day by William Kirk, who worked as controller of a refin- ishing company and president of a tire tread company before entering the gun business. Kirk, 36, has a master’s de- gree in business from the University of Illinois. Kirk has steadfastly declined to an- swer any questions about the company. When reporters appeared at the front gate of the RG Industries plant following the Reagan assassina- tion attempt, Kirk locked the gate and sent workers out through a rear exit. “faG Industries as- sembled 1.1 million small pistols and revolvers be- tween 1971 and 1979... Most were RG 14s, the gun used in the shooting of Reagan. 97 Only once has an outsider pene- trated the two-story, windowless, beige stucco warehouse where the guns are assembled. And that was through trickery. In 1976, Steven Brill, a free-lance writer, showed up at the factory claiming to be the owner of a large sporting goods store near New York City. Brill reported in a Harpers’ arti- cle how chief salesman Bruce Savane gave him a sales talk on the merits of the RG 14, calling it ‘a popular night- stand model.” “If your store is anywhere near a ghetto area, these ought to sell real well,” Savane was quoted as saying in Brill’s account. “This is most assuredly a ghetto gun.” Brill also described a tour through a high-ceilinged gray room in which four men and two women Sat at sepa- rate tables, “each adding a different part to a gun frame and passing it down to the next person.” Savane, who no longer works at RG Industries, said recently: “If the opera- tion is the same as it was the years I was there, they are totally within the law — totally within the law.” As for his encounter with Brill, Sa- vane said: ‘“‘That was probably, to me, the worst example of yellow journal- ism I’ve ever seen in my whole life... Just about everything I said was totally twisted. In fact some of the things I think were just embellished on to the point where they were not even true.” New frames for old Even after Eig sold out in 1970, he kept his hands in the gun business. His friend, Al Bernkrant, president of Firearms Import and Export Corp., to whom Eig had sold his remaining gun inventory, signed Eig up as a $24,000-a-year consultant. It was in this role that Eig wrote Tanfoglio in April 1972 to press for “large quanti- ties’? of a new .22-caliber revolver called the T18. Eig’s letter, disclosed in a 1975 court battle between two Miami gun assem- bly plants, revealed how Eig handled a problem that had arisen in Bernkrant’s Miami assembly plant. Eig explained to Tanfoglio that the cylinders of the T18s had a tendency to fall out of the frames of the re- volver. To fix this, Eig went on, Fire- arms Import and Export was ordering 5,000 new frames from a U.S. supplier. “*‘As soon as these frames are re- ceived, we will stop working on the old bad frames and will start working on the new frames altogether with your new (parts) groups,” Eig wrote. “We will leave the remaining 2,500 of the old frames for completion at a later time when we need work for our. operators. Right now, it is of the ut- most importance that we start to pro- duce T18 revolvers in large quantities in order to avoid losing orders.” In late 1974, Eig branched out in still another direction, incorporating a company called Excam Inc., and offer- ing himself as a foreign trade consult- ant to the Tanfoglio family. But after checking around, he decided the plan “was not practicable,” mainly because of troubles obtaining product liability insurance, as his lawyer would later explain in court papers. After that, Eig retired for good. Another Miami gun distributor, Sid- hey G. Davies, who still sees Eig from time to time, said, “He collects good art, and I suspect he is a major contrib- utor to arts’ organizations.” \fFrom live-bait salesman to firearms titam The Snub-Nosed Killers Handguns In America Fourth of a series By Joseph Albright Washington Bureau MIAMI — Twenty-six years ago, Al Bernkrant left behind his live bait and gun repair store in upstate New York and moved to Miami. With his wife, Bea, and his father, Jack, he opened a small downtown gun store called National Gun Traders. The family no longer runs a gun shop. These days, Al Bernkrant is a trustee of Florida International University and a director of the Central Bank and Trust Co. in Miami. His wife and father have portfolios of Dade County real-estate in- vestments. The Bernkrants have built a mom- and-pop conglomerate that makes or im- ports two-thirds as many handguns as are manufactured by venerable Colt Industries. Last year, commercial sources report, the family company registered $50 million in total sales, with guns their most lucrative line. Their high-volume, perfectly legal business stems in part from being one of two U.S. assemblers of the .25-caliber Titan, a small pistol made of Italian components that emerged as the fifth leading crime gun in America, ac- cording to a Cox Newspaper analysis of handguns involved in street crimes in 1979. The Bernkrants are among the big winners in a ferocious, dimly understood struggle for a piece of the U.S. snub- nosed gun market. They also sell larger handguns, rifles, shotguns, ammunition, handcuffs, tear-gas dispensers, holsters and binoculars. Aside from assembling and import- ing guns through a subsidiary called Firearms Import & Export Corp., the Bernkrants’ company is also the largest wholesale distributor of rifles, shotguns and handguns in the Southeast. Last year, the company changed its name from Southern Gun Distributors Inc. to Southern General Diversified Inc. For diversi- fication, it manufactures lawn fur- niture and retails children’s clothing.

He said if he wanted to, he could easily make cheaper handguns using all-U.S. components. But he said the company continues to Tely on German or Italian gun sup- Pliers mainly because their gun components come with certificates at- testing that each one has been safely tested in a German or Italian govern- ment test-firing range. These foreign government ‘“proof- test” certificates can be valuable as evidence in any product liability suit that might be filed by a gun customer in this country, Bernkrant said. _Beyond that, Bernkrant would not discuss the history of his company’s involvement in gun manufacturing, saying that his brother M.C. “Murph” Bernkrant was in charge of the Fire- arms Import & Export subsidiary. Bernkrant said Murph, who is a for- mer dental supply salesman, was too busy to be interviewed. A glimpse at empire An unpublicized 1975 lawsuit in- volving the Bernkrants provides a rare glimpse inside the handgun assembly business. The case — a civil suit be- tween Bernkrant’s company and some rivals in the gun business — was Settled out of court in 1976, but the records exist to paint a picture of cousin against cousin, friend against friend, in a battle for the small gun market as well as the ties between U.S. assemblers of concealable hand- guns and their foreign parts suppliers. The court case centered around a -25-caliber palm pistol called the Titan, which is still being made and ranks among the leading crime guns in the United States. Firearms Import & Ex- port was assembling the Titan from kits of parts that in 1972 cost the company $6.62 a set. The parts were made and sent to Miami by Fabbrica D’Armi Tanfoglio Giuseppe, a small arms factory owned by Giuseppe Tanfoglio in the northern Italian mountain city of Brescia. In the early 1970s, Titans retailed in U.S. gun stores for less than $25. About that time, Firearms Import & Export (or FIE as it is known in the gun business) was the chief — if not the only — U.S. distributor of Titans. But in late 1974, Bernkrant heard that two men who had been on a co *s payroll — one a cousin an rate a fend ~ were about to cut into his exclusive distributorship by going into business distributing Titans. In 1975, FIE filed a $10.5 million civil lawsuit in Miami charging the two men with misappropriating secret business information. Named as one of the defendants were Milton Koss, Al Bernkrant’s cousin, who had been an employee of the company for four years. The other defendant was Saul Eig, a one-time giant in the small handgun market, who in 1971 was brought aboard FIE as a consultant by his friend Bernkrant after Eig shut down his own Miami gun assembling busi- ness and sold the inventory to Bernkrant. Bernkrant charged that Eig and Koss had conspired to relieve him of an exclusive distributorship of Tanfoglio guns. The dispute began in September 1974 when Eig asked to be released from his employment agreement, in which he promised not to work for a ‘The records painta picture of cousin against cousin, friend against friend, in a battle for the small gun market .. .77 competing gun company, and Bernk- reed. raRerakrant contended in his suit that before the employment agreement ended, Eig had formed a company called Excam Inc., “for the express purpose of entering a competing business.” With “confidential knowledge of (FIE’s) costs and price lists,” Eig and Koss were able to sell Tanfoglio hand- guns at lower prices than those of FIE “for the sole purpose of injuring and destroying (FIE’s) business,” Bernk- rant said. In his answering documents, Eig denied violating his employment agreement with Bernkrant and said it had been terminated before the Excam Inc. sales began. An international feud Bernkrant’s lawsuit also sought damages from the two gun factories in northern Italy run by Giuseppe Tanfo- glio and his children. The Tanfoglios challenged the law- suit, claiming that the Bernkrants had cost the Italians thousands of dollars by persuading them to build more and more facilities to make guns — and then slashing the orders. In the counter-complaint, the Italian gun parts manufacturer vividly de- scribed the extremes to which both Bernkrant and the Tanfoglios went to keep the handguns rolling off U.S. assembly lines. “The Tanfoglios accommodated FIE in every respect, modifying the design of existing models, designing and producing new models, and increasing production ... with the result that eventually at least 90 percent of the output ... constituted production for the U.S. market, all for FIE,” the Tanfoglios said in the counter- complaint. . Before the Bernkrants started buy- ing gun parts about 1970, there was only one small Tanfoglio gun factory in the northern Italian mountains. To fill FIE’s escalating orders for gun parts sets, Tanfoglio doubled its size, hired more workers and put in auto- matic machines. In 1971, the Tanfoglio family said it also “built and equipped a new modern factory approximately eight miles dis- tant from Giuseppe Tanfoglio’s, for the sole purpose of satisfying the continu- ous demands ... for increased production.”’ The Tanfoglio family was turning out enough parts for FIE to assemble 1,800 Titans per month in 1970. By early 1972, FIE production was up to 10,000 Titans a month. Bernkrant also played a dominant role in Giuseppe Tanfoglio’s decision to produce sets of parts for a snub- nosed .22-caliber revolver called the T18 — the gun the Italians claimed would cost them thousands of dollars when Bernkrant rolled back on his orders. Federal firearms experts said the T18, which is no longer made, bore a remarkable resemblance to the RG 14 — the type of gun John W. Hinckley Jr. is accused of firing at President Ronald Reagan. The RG 14 was then — and still is — assembled in Miami cut - Se rineid-miade Parts by RG ustries Inc., a compan i to found. pany Eig helped This is how the T18 Originated, as described in the Tanfoglio counter- complaint: About March 1970, Bernkrant for- warded to Giuseppe Tanfoglio a short- barreled revolver “that had been pur- chased on the open market.” Bernk- rant asked Tanfoglio to “design him a competing model ... representing to Giuseppe Tanfoglio that such a model would be an excellent seller.” The Tanfoglios tooled up to make T18 sets and turned out 42,000 sets of parts. But then the Florida legislature intervened. In August 1972, the Tanfoglios re- ceived a terse cable from Miami asking them to cease making parts for the T18 as well as other .22- and .32- \fcaliber revolvers. Sets for the Titan and a .38-caliber Derringer were to stay in production for another 30 days. “Legislative situation bad,’’ ex- plained the cable. It was signed SOU- GUNCO, the cable signature of FIE. As W.E. Ethier, FIE’s general man- ager, spelled out in a follow-up letter, the Florida legislature had banned the assembly of pistols and revolvers using imported parts. “We have engaged a lawyer to try to reverse this law in court,” he wrote. “If we are not successful, we intend to assemble the pistols and revolvers in a nearby state.” True to Ethier’s letter, FIE hop- scotched to Georgia immediately. Manufacturing records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showed that between October and December 1972, the company assem- bled 5,350 pistols and 1,900 revolvers at a new assembly plant in Valdosta, Ga. Later, Florida courts ruled that the state law against gun parts assemblers was unconstitutional. FIE promptly shut down the Valdosta plant and moved all its operations back to Miami. Allis calm again Calm was restored to the Miami gun assembly business in mid-1976 just as Judge Thomas Edison Lee was prepar- ing to hold a jury trial on the Bernk- rant suit. The parties settled out of court on undisclosed terms. Since then, the Tanfoglio factories have been even busier turning out gun parts. For now, the company has to satisfy the orders of two U.S. distribu- tors of Tanfoglio guns instead of one. One of the distributors is Excam Inc., which operates out of a small warehouse next to a railroad yard in Hialeah. Federal records show that Bernk- rant’s cousin, Koss, remains its presi- dent, although Eig no longer is in- volved. Listed as vice president and secretary are Giuseppe Tanfoglio and his daughter, Mary Tanfoglio, the proprietors of the Italian factories that make parts assembled into guns by Excam. The other U.S. distributor for the Tanfoglio guns is none other than Al Bernkrant’s gun assembly subsidiary in Opa-locka — FIE. The Tanfoglio .25-caliber Titan, which analysis showed was 5th leading crime gun \fGummakers defend gun law loophole JUDITH GAINES Cox News Service ‘‘Murph” Bernkrant is a gunmaker angered by all the talk about banning the importation of gun parts. He searches for an argument and finds a parallel in the at- tacks of a guard dog. “If you’re training a dog for guard duty, you proba- bly antagonize him by waving something at him — like oes said Bernkrant, who runs Firearms Import & xport Corp. in Opa-locka. “If the Tdou e not overly bright, he’ll attack the stick. But if he’s very clever, he’ll go for the throat of the person that’s antagonizing him,” Bernkrant said. “The press and the 500,000 vulture lawyers preying on the American public have been going after the stick in- stead of the person — attacking the weapon instead of the criminal.” Bernkrant’s firm assembles handguns from _ for- eign-made parts.

Let me draw a parallel for you. In the 1920s, they outlawed liquor. Who got liquor? Organized crime. If somebody wants anything bad enough, they’re going to get it.”’ As Kirk spoke, the sounds of Latin voices and hum- ming machinery filtered through the walls separating his office from the gun factory. Among the models of guns produced by this factory is the $39.95 Roehm 14 — the type of gun allegedly used in the attempted as- sassination of President Reagan. Bernkrant, whose brother Al Bernkrant built the family’s gun empire, also is angry about the task force recommendation. On the walls of his office hang pis- tols, rifles, shotguns, powder horns, antique revolvers, a clock made from the butt of a sawed-off rifle — and a medieval map of Brescia, Italy. “The Italian town Napoleon bought his arms from,”’’ Bernkrant explained. The town, in the mountains of northern Italy, also is the home of two factories that produce parts for the Titan, which Bernkrant’s firm assembles. If imported handgun parts were prohibited, Bernk- rant said, his firm would not stop making cheap hand- guns. ““We’d make the parts in-house or subcontract to a domestic manufacturer. We would reduce the variety pore we have. The cost would be about the same,” he said. “We could charge more if it would make the feder- al government and the press happy,’’ Bernkrant con- tinued. ‘“‘But we feel like we’re marketing a safe, de- pendable product at a price the average guy — who al- ready barely makes it on his budget — can afford.” . “They want to ban cheap parts because they think this means poor quality,” said Kirk. ‘‘I’ve read reports that say RG guns, when they drop, they shatter they fall to pieces. We’ve never had one do that. Just be- cuuee it’s less expensive does not mean it’s poor quali- y. _ 4 tour of Bernkrant’s gun factory revealed a large, windowless, cement-walled assembly area. Several smaller rooms and alcoves branched off from the main area. Signs in bright red letters identified the ‘“‘parts room, bluing room” and ““shooting room.” About 60 employes worked quietly — cleaning, sol- dering, dying frames, cylinders, barrels and erie ad- justing the calibration, retouching parts to cover nicks, assembling, then testing, the final product. Neither Kirk nor Bernkrant denies that their weap- ons sometimes end up in . : i the hands of criminals. But, as Kirk said, ‘““You have to balance that with the social worth of what we’re trying to accomplish.” The press and the 500,000 vulture lawyers preying on the American public have been. . . attacking the weapon instead of the criminal \fDeadly Odyssey: From Miami via Ohio to Queens The Snub-Nosed Killers Handguns In America Fifth in a series By Andrew Alexander Washington Bureau NEW YORK — It was Aug. 4, 1980, a balmy night in a normally peaceful Queens neighborhood, as three young Puerto Ricans quietly slip- ped into the small liquor store. Sensing trouble, In Sook Han instinctively inched behind the cash register near the front door. She and her husband, Sool Sook Han, both Korean immigrants, had been spared from crime in the four years since they opened their store. But their fortune turned this night as one of the men started behind the counter toward Mrs. Han. Hearing his wife’s protests, Han emerged from the rear. He got only about 10 paces betore he was shot twice in the chest with a short-barreled .38-caliber Arminius Titan Tiger revolver. It was a weapon which a Consti- tution Washington Bureau analysis lists as the 14th leading gun used in crime in America. The trio fled, leaving Mrs. Han kneeling over her husband, sobbing and screaming for help as his life — and their dreams — quickly faded. The gun had made an 8,000-mile trek before it killed Sool Sook Han. Its parts were produced at the Weihrauch Armen Co. in West Germany. They were assembled in the Miami area by Firearms Import & Export Corp., part of the thriving Bernkrant gun enterprises. It was then given the brand name of “Arminius Titan Tiger” and sold by Southern Gun Distributors, another Bernkrant company in Miami, to a federally licensed firearms dealer in Ohio. He, in turn, sold it to a man who transported it to Brooklyn, where it was illegally sold on the street for a huge profit. Idelfonso C. Cuevas lives 400 miles away from Queens in Youngstown, Ohio. He has never even heard of In Sook Han. But federal law enforcement officials say the gun that killed her hus- band would not have come to New York if it were not for “Junior” Cuevas. Cuevas hardly fits a bad-guy description. Father of three. Home- owner. Steady $25,000-a-year job at a General Motors assembly plant in nearby Lordstown. A soft-spoken, 37-year-old “confessed Christian” wha loves his country and proudly proclaims, “I have always obeyed the law.” Korean immigrant In Sook Han (above) at her liquor store in Queens where her husband was killed last year with a gun that was brought to the New York area and sold by Idelfonso “Junior” Cuevas (right), a black- market gun trafficker from Youngstown, Ohio. For Junior Cuevas, getting caught was the furthest thing from his mind when he got involved in gun trafficking about three years ago. It was all ‘‘very innocent,” he recalled. “I never knew what I was getting into.” \fHowever during an 18-month period beginning in early 1979, Cuevas turned to crime — unwittingly, he Says — as a black market gun trafficker who single-handedly trans- Ported more than 700 handguns to Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods that are among America’s toughest urban badlands. Through gun traces, federal agents have been able to establish that no less than four of his smuggled guns subse- quently were used in five homicides, 15 were used in armed robberies, 10 in shootings, and five were recovered during narcotics arrests. Another 114 were seized a year ago when agents arrested Cuevas and several others, abruptly halting their lucrative gunrunning ring. But more than 500 remain in circulation in New York, a city that recorded 1,814 homi- cides in 1980 and another 706 during the first five months of this year — the vast majority involving guns. . To federal officials, the Cuevas case IS a typical example of an illegal, often bloody, migration of guns across state lines — a traffic fueled by easy profits and marked by predictably tragic end- ings. It is also typical, they say, be- cause seemingly model citizens like Cuevas so frequently play Key roles in the proliferation of illegal guns. The case also illustrates another, more troubling, fact about the nation’s underground gun trade: Those individ- uals responsible for putting guns into the hands of criminals stand a good chance of escaping serious punish- ment, even if they’re caught. That was the outcome of the Cuevas case. For Junior Cuevas, getting caught was the farthest thing from his mind when he first got involved in gun traf- ficking about three years a89- It was all “very innocent,” he re- called at his Youngstown home. I never knew what I was getting into.” He had been visiting relatives in New York, something he did about once a month, when he was introduced to a friend named David Gonzales. The conversation turned to crime and where New Yorkers could purchase guns for protection. . New York has one of the nation’s toughest gun control laws. Under the statute, guns cannot be purchased without a license. Obtaining the li- cense can take a year or longer and is based strictly on an applicant’s need eapon. The effect has been to further re- strict the availability of legally sold firearms in New York at a time when demand is increasing. Thus, New Yorkers turn to so-called “supplier States,” where loose laws make pur- chasing guns as easy as buying a six- pack of beer. Ohio is such a state: Unlimited num- bers of firearms can be bought on the spot simply by showing a driver’s li- cense and signing a statement saying the purchaser is not a felon, a drug addict or a dishonorably discharged veteran. The information is not verified. There is no waiting period. Cuevas knew a source of cheap handguns that he could take to New York, where Gonzales and another man could sell them. And so when he returned to Youngs- town he went to see a quiet young man named Dale G. Clark. Clark, who worked with Cuevas at the GM Lordstown plant, was a feder- ally licensed gun dealer — one of about 186,000 in the nation — who sold firearms part time out of his home in the small town of Columbiana. &6 We went out to see Clark and ask him a few questions and what we found just blew our minds. 43 —Federal firearms agent “Ee came to see me and just said he needed guns ... He never told me what he wanted them for, recalls Clark, now 35. “It started out with one or two, then three or four, and then it just started getting bigger and bigger.” The wholesale trade Mostly, Cuevas wanted Arminius Titan Tiger .38-caliber revolvers, the same kind used to kill Sool Sook Han. (The Titan Tiger is a 2-inch-barrel re- volver that weighs slightly more than the .25-caliber Titan pistol. Both are assembled by the Bernkrant family’s Firearms Import and Export Corp.) “I bought them by the lot,” Clark recalled, mostly through Southern Gun Distributors or The Village Trading Post, another wholesaler in nearby Oak Hill, Ohio. “The dealer’s cost nor- mally was somewhere over $70. But I was getting them for around $59 or $60 because I got a discount on every order of 12 or more. And, you see, [ was buying like 50 or 60 or 75 at a time.” Periodically, Cuevas would show up at Clark’s home, load the boxes of new guns into his car and make the eight- hour drive to New York, where he delivered them to Gonzales or another man. They would give Cuevas large amounts of cash, which he would take back to Ohio for Clark as payment for the next shipment. Business was good for everyone. Clark, by his own account, was making a profit of about $12 per gun. Cuevas said he was being paid about $10 for each gun he transported. And once the guns were resold on the streets of New York, federal agents say, they brought anywhere from $225 to $320 — a markup of more than 500 percent. But what was good for the gun ring was not good for New York. Some of the guns began turning up in crimes. Through serial numbers on each weapon they were traced by po- lice to the wholesalers, who informed the authorities they had been sold to Clark. In early December of 1979, an undercover agent working for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms — acting on an inform- ant’s tip that a gun ring was operating in Brooklyn — bought a .38-caliber Titan Tiger for $225 from an acquaint- ance of Gonzales. A quick trace of the gun’s serial number revealed it had been part of a shipment of 107 Titan Tigers that Cuevas had purchased from Clark in Ohio just three days before. Four months later, an Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms undercover agent in Brooklyn bought another Titan Tiger. It, too, was soon traced and found to be one of 180 revolvers Cuevas had purchased from Clark the previous month. ‘““By this time the link was too strong,” recalls another agent involved in the case. ‘‘We went out to see Clark and ask him a few questions, and what we found just blew our minds.” Clark readily admitted selling hun- dreds of guns to Cuevas and volun- tarily disclosed the sales Slips. It was all legal, he argued, because Cuevas had signed the federal forms required with each purchase. But that was not quite the case. Clark had failed to file what are known as “multiple sales reports” — Postcards that must be sent to local Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms offices every time a dealer sells more than one gun to the same person within a five- day period. “To tell the truth, I forgot all about it,’ Clark says. His omission provided agents with the key for cracking the ring. They warned Clark he could be prosecuted for failing to file the re- ports. And they hinted they were con- Sidering charges of conspiracy to transport firearms across state lines — a federal crime — even though Clark insisted he had never known where \fCuevas was taking the guns. Unsettled by these possible legal consequences, Clark says he agreed to begin clandestine cooperation with the federal agents. The finale came within a matter of weeks. Closing the ring At about 3 a.m. on Sunday, June 1, 1980, Cuevas loaded 114 handguns into his new Mercury Bobcat and began the long trip to New York. By transporting such large quanti- ties of firearms, he recalls, he became concerned he might unknowingly be violating some gun laws. He was tem- porarily put at ease, he said, when Clark gave him a photocopy of his dealer’s license. “I thought I was just like a registered agent acting for Clark,”’ he said. But still, Cuevas recalls, he remained suspicious all was not right and, as an added assurance, he remembers he in- sisted Clark accompany him on this trip. And so together, they departed. They were not alone. Unknown to Cuevas, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents tracked him from above in a small four-seat aircraft. To his car, they had attached a small “bird dog” transmitting device that enabled the agents to follow in unmarked cars. At about 11:30 a.m., Cuevas’ car was abruptly forced to a halt by several others on a highway ramp leading to Brooklyn. Federal agents with shot- guns and drawn pistols leaped out and ordered him to freeze. ‘*At first, I thought it was a rob- bery,”’ he recalls. “I didn’t think I was doing anything illegal.” Several agents frisked him while others busily took inventory of the 114 firearms: 89 .38-caliber Titan Tigers and 25 new .25-caliber Raven pistols. Cuevas was arrested and subsequently charged with conspiracy to deal in firearms without a license and with illegal interstate transport of guns. Clark was frisked and handcuffed in what one agent later described as a “fabricated arrest ... to protect him because he was cooperating with us.” Later that day Cuevas, too, agreed to cooperate. Accompanied by an undercover agent, he went through with the deliv- ery to Gonzales, who was arrested as he reached to remove one of the guns from the car. Gonzales subsequently was charged with conspiracy and with receiving guns illegally transported interstate. Two other Brooklyn men — Her- nando Rua and Samuel Barreto — also were later charged with being part of the conspiracy by dealing in firearms without a license. The gun ring had finally been broken. The open circle An insidious dimension of illegal gunrunning is that the weapons go on killing long after the trafficking has been stopped. Consider what happened after the Cuevas ring was broken: ® Several weeks later, an argument broke out in the basement of a Man- hattan apartment building between 59-year-old Juan Colon and a 30-year- old woman. Colon, who had a previous conviction on a firearms charge, pulled out one of the .38-caliber Titan Tigers Cuevas had transported to New York and killed her. He then placed the gun to his temple and committed suicide. The woman left behind a young daughter who police say has since been placed in a foster home. ® About six weeks later, Sool Sook Han was gunned down in his liquor store. He left a modest insurance policy, but Mrs. Han says it was barely enough to help care for their four chil- dren. ‘My English bad. Now I must work all the time,” she says. ~What can I do?’”’ Three men — Waldemar Vega, Jose Antonio Brito and Orlando Ramirez — subsequently were charged with second degree murder. but were allowed by prosecutors to plead guilty to a lesser charge of man- slaughter. They are awaiting sentenc- ing and could each receive a sentence of five to 15 years in prison. e The following January. 18-year- old Luis Conception started quarreling with a man in a small store in a Puerto Rican neighborhood in Brooklyn, only a block from where an undercover agent had purchased one of Cuevas’ guns. Several minutes later, Concep- tion was dead of a bullet to the chest, fired from yet another of the guns Cuevas had hauled from Ohio. e Several months later, a death in Queens. Macelino Reyes, 25, got into an argument in a bar. The other man left and quickly reappeared carrying one of Cuevas’ Titan Tigers. He killed Reyes with a single shot to the chest. But these are only the deaths. Federal authorities say they suspect perhaps scores of other people have been wounded with the guns Cuevas brought to New York. Victims like 26- year-old Evelyn Gonzales. “We were in a bar just having a good time when this guy came up be- — hind me and said, ‘Hey, let me show you something,” she recalls. As she turned around, he fired once into her belly and again into her right wrist, shattering the bone and paralyzing her lower arm. “The guy got one year,’ she said. “Can you handle that? One year! I’m bitter. They always get off. Always. The people that shoot the guns, and the people that bring them here.” In the Cuevas case, she is almost right. The maximum penalty for willfully failing to file multiple sales reports is five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Dale Clark, who sold hundreds of guns to Cuevas without filing the reports, Was permitted voluntarily to relin- quish his dealer’s license. No charges were sought because the government could not prove his omission was willful. David Gonzales received a sentence of three years. His attorney feels that would have been suspended were it not for a previous narcotics conviction. As part of an arrangement with Prosecutors, Samuel Barreto pleaded guilty to one of the charges against him and received five years probation. Hernando Rua, the other defendant charged with unlicensed firearms sell- ing, also pleaded guilty but did not ap- pear for his sentencing and a warrant has been issued for his arrest. And Idelfonso “Junior” Cuevas was permitted by prosecutors to plead guilty to one of the counts against him and received a $10,000 fine and six months in prison. However, the judge suspended the jail term and replaced it with five years probation after Cuevas’ attorney argued he was “at best an agent or courier ... and was not at any time in the business of sell- ing firearms.” Besides, said the attorney, Cuevas cooperated fully with the authorities immediately after being arrested. Several months ago, at Cuevas’ home in Youngstown, a reporter in- formed him that some of the guns he had transported had been used in murders. “JT wouldn’t be surprised,’”’ he said, somewhat dispassionately, as he sat on his porch sipping orange soda. But as the conversation continued. the news began to trouble him. ‘Is there any proof of that?” Be asked. ‘‘If there were, I would feel very bad?” After all, he said, the only reason be took the guns to New York was = help people protect themselves. \flobby’s firepower oots down control bills By Cheryl] Arvidson Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — It comes as no surprise to find the gun lobby loudly opposing proposals that would im- pose restrictions on shotguns and rifles, require regis- tration or confiscation of firearms or limit availability of the quality handgun. But the 2-million-member National Rifle Associa- tion also is on the front line defending the inaccurate, often poorly made small handgun — a stand seemingly inconsistent with its 110-year history of promoting fire- arms safety, marksmanship and hunting. This strident opposition to handgun control has effectively eliminated any chance for national legislation to restrict small handguns, probably for years to come. The National Rifle Association, with a $30 million- plus annual budget, is the richest and most influential pro-gun organization in the country, and it is also the most moderate of the three groups that constitute the The Snub-Nosed Killers Handguns In America gun lobby. Headquartered in Washington, the NRA has a lobbying branch which spends another $4 million a year to stop any attempt at gun control, even the most modest. Operating from its own Washington office building, which includes a gun museum and target range, the NRA successfully orchestrates the scenario year after year: Gun control bills are introduced, talked about briefly and left to die in subcommittees because they just can’t be passed in the House or Senate. “I don’t think I’ve got a snowball’s chance in hell to pass it. Congress is just too conservative,” said Rep. Marty Russo, D-Ill, about a bill he’s been introducing since 1976 to prohibit the sale and manufacture of small handguns. cheap or expensive, by setting length restrictions on pistols and revolvers. “Tf the president getting shot and the pope getting shot doesn’t rattle these guys, nothing will.” The NRA defends the snub-nosed handgun as part of its overall goal of preserving the right of citizens to keep and bear arms “] think that there is room for compromise,” Neal Knox, executive director of the NRA’s lobbyist Institute for Legislative Action, says: “There are a lot of gun laws on the books Id like to get rid of. 'm willing to compromise away some of those.” The NRA’s top priority is passage of a bill that would weaken or eliminate many of the federal gun statutes now on the books. The McClure-Volkmer bill, named for Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., and Sen. ‘The handgun isa symbol... It would be the same if it were a rifle’ — Rep. John Ashbrook James McClure, D-Idaho, is being pro- moted by the NRA as getting govern- ment off the backs of law-abiding gun owners and gun dealers. Even though certain provisions cause concern to federal law enforcement officials, the bill has a good chance of passing. “The handgun is a symbol,” says Rep. John Ashbrook, R-Ohio, one of two congressmen on the NRA’s board of directors. “It’s a firearm. It would be the same thing if it were a rifle. The motives, intentions and past records of those who want to take away the handgun are not trusted by those who own the handguns.” The guns of violence The NRA is just as opposed to clos- ing a loophole in the 1968 Gun Control Act that, while banning imported handguns, allows foreign parts for Saturday Night Specials to be im- ported and put onto U.S.-made frames as it is to more drastic legislation — offered by Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. — to ban Saturday Night Specials and re- quire a waiting period and police check before any handgun purchase. As a result, critics claim, the gun lobby has so muddied the water that a rational policy cannot be debated, let alone adopted, at a national level. “The NRA, unlike any other group in the country, has just made mince- meat of the legislative process,’ said Sanford Horwitt, a consultant to the National Coalition to Ban Handguns and a former aide to Rep. (now federal judge) Abner Mikva whose work for gun control won him the lasting hate of the NRA. “You can’t get any kind of reasona- ble public policy on anything having to do with handguns, which is clearly a problem in this country, because this group refuses to deal with anything that begins to approach a reasonable public policy,” Horwitt continued. “Because they have taken this extre- mist position on handguns, it has ended all discussions of it in the legis- lative arena. It’s more than being single-minded. It’s almost no-minded.” With federal channels closed, gun- \fEditorial__ mossene 1 dsaraanrecs Handguns! Stop Asn control advocates are coming to be- lieve that local actions — such as a tough anti-gun ordinance recently passed in Morton Grove, Ill. — may offer their best hope of restricting deadly handguns. Fixing the blame Although the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has found in a succession of gun tracing studies that most guns used in violent crime had barrel lengths of three inches or less, the NRA sees no link between small guns and crime. “They’re trying to blame the gun for the crime, and they’re trying to prohibit all guns,” said Knox, discuss- ing the attack on the small handgun. “There is no evidence whatsoever that the population of guns, small or large, has any effect on crime. No evidence. The advocates of legislation have the burden of proof on them to show that what they advocate would impact ad- versely on about half the households of the United States, they have the bur- den of proving that it’s going to work.” Russo, a former states attorney for Cook County, I1l., doubts handgun- control measures would stop the hard- ened criminal, but he is convinced that getting rid of small handguns would stop “the heat of passion type situa- tion, the argument, the spontaneous situation.” “There is no other reason why a small, concealable handgun is made in society except to shoot someone,” Russo said. “The reason it is made THE INTRODUCTION OF STATE LAWS Gun magazines keep tabs on legislation and affecting gun owners. issues small is so no one knows you’ve got it on you. With my bill, anyone could buy a gun and keep one at home, it would just be a larger size. It would make your pocket sag a little bit, it would stick out of your trousers. Somebody would see it.” “I’ve shot bears with handguns with a three-inch barrel,” said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the other member of Congress on the board of directors of the NRA, when asked why the NRA defends the small handgun. “When I hunt elk, I carry a small .22 automatic to shoot grouse for the pot or finish off elk.” “Td like to sell tickets to the con- frontation, and I’d also like to bet on the bear,’”’ answered Horwitt. ‘‘The fact is no one goes around shooting bears with a three- or four-inch hand- gun. It just isn’t done. If we’re down to that as to why someone refuses to sup- port a ban on handguns, we’re down to some pretty flaky people.” Knox, asked the “redeeming social value” of a small handgun, cites his wife’s Smith & Wesson Bodyguard which he gave her for Mother’s Day in 1958. “I’ve carried my wife’s ... gun with me many a mile while hunting as @ second gun,” he said. “I’ve carried & with me while fishing. I’ve carried & with me while flying because I Gd all my flying out in Arizona. ama thats some rough country, and 2 person who doesn’t prepare himself - .. is makime & mistake.” Knox, who as chie® NRA lebiysst earns $63,000 a year. calls the small \fGeedeun “the best possible gun’ for “Im the case of a small gun, you can Gave that thing concealed right near the door, in a book where it’s not vis- ible to your neighbors coming in. They'll think you’re a little bit strange if you’ve got a shotgun sitting in the corner by the door. A shotgun by the door, loaded, in my estimation is far more hazardous from an accidental standpoint than is a handgun in a nice, small place of concealment.” Gun supporters also say a small gun is easier for women to shoot and that the poor can afford a Saturday Night Special but not the better-made — and more costly — “snubbies’ and full- sized handguns. “T represent a very large number of poor and unfortunate constituents who can’t afford big, fancy, high-priced handguns but want a gun because they live in high crime areas. I seen no rea- son why, because of price, firearms ownership should be just a prerogative of the wealthy,” said Dingell, whose district includes an industrial section of Detroit. “Looking at it from a racial stand- point,’’ said Ashbrook, ‘‘the handgun is the only defensive weapon a poor per- son can afford. You’d think poor blacks, as victims of crime, would want handgun control, but they don’t.” “Blacks had handguns solely for de- fense more than any other group,”’ ob- served Knox. When a reporter points out that blacks also are the victims of more handgun crimes, Knox said that is not because of the guns but because “blacks commit more crimes against blacks.” That reasoning is not upheld by the Congressional Black Caucus, which consistently votes as a bloc against the gun lobby. The ‘gutless’ profiteers With the exception of revenues re- ceived from advertising in its three magazines, the NRA has little associa- tion with gun manufacturers. Ashbrook said he respects one domestic gun manufacturer, Bill Ruger, who heads Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc., of Southport, Conn., but consid- ers most other manufacturers to be “gutless” profiteers. “IT get a feeling they think if all the guns they sold were banned, they’d just sell them to the Iranians or some- thing,’’ Ashbrook said. Ashbrook said the NRA is not in business to front for the gun manufac- turers, and it functions solely to repre- sent those who consider gun owner- ship a “fundamental freedom.” ““It’s a people issue, a grass-roots issue,’”’ Ashbrook said. “The NRA is only powerful because it speaks for people.”’ He ticked off four reasons for the NRA’s success: “‘They have a limited area, they know what they want to do, they know where their friends are, and they know what laws they want to change and they do it.” Money and strong citizen support explain both the NRA’s power and the trouble encountered by anti-gun groups such as Handgun Control Inc., and the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. NRA members will contribute money when asked, write lots of let- ters and make telephone calls to their congressmen or senators to protest re- strictive legislation or government regulations, and they turn out in large, vociferous numbers at rallies or public meetings where gun control is being discussed. The NRA’s budget is 30 times larger than that of Horwitt’s Na- tional Coalition to Ban Handguns. Some anti-gun lobbyists contend the power of the NRA is overrated, but the group’s reputation is so formidable that whether the power is real be- comes almost irrelevant. A House staf member recalls lobby- ing congressmen on gun-control legis- lation and citing public opinion polls showing a majority of Americans in favor of handgun control, only to have the members respond, “It doesn’t mat- ter. If they (the gun lobby) only control 2 or 3 percent of the vote in my district, that’s enough because the margin (of victory) is only 5 or 6 percent.” One has to go back almost 10 years, to the Senate in 1972, to find a gun- control measure approved by either house of Congress. That bill, outlaw- ing domestically produced Saturday Night Specials, died for lack of action in the House, and the Senate has not considered a piece of gun-control legis- lation since. In the House, the closest gun-control advocates came was in 1976 when Russo, then a freshman, got the House ‘If (Reagan) getting shot doesn’t rattle these guys, nothing will’ — Rep. Marty Russo “They have never had a preprinted postcard campaign, at least in recent years,’’ Horwitt said. ‘“‘The letters are almost always typed or handwritten individually. They have developed an apparatus where they can crank out a tremendous amount of mail, which is evidence to a lot of legislators that the NRA really does have a sizable constit- uency that feels strongly about the issue.”’ “They’ll vote on this issue,’ said a former 2ide in the Carter White House. “T daresay there’s no issue on which you and I would vote, no one issue alone. That’s what makes these groups strong.” Judiciary Committee to approve, 18- 14, his proposal to outlaw the conceal- able handgun, only to watch the NRA swing into action and change enough votes to defeat the same proposal, 17- 16, a week later. Russo believes much of the NRA’s strength comes from its ability to con- vince members that “as soon as they take the handguns, the next thing is your shotguns, then the next thing you know, the Russians will come and you won’t have any way of defending yourselves.”’ “They portray, inaccurately I think, every issue as if the question is whether or not Mrs. Jones who lives in \frural Florida is going to be able to have her gun to protect herself from the nightrider,” said Richard Davis, who was the Treasury Department official overseeing the Bureau of Alco- hol, Tobacco and Firearms in the Carter years. The NRA and other pro-gun groups often do raise the confiscation spectre in their mailings. Anti-gun groups point to this in criticizing the NRA for misrepresentation and distortion, but Knox says that confiscation is exactly what handgun control is all about. The confiscation argument sells well among gun owners because of a basic distrust of government. “Tf we only thought this (handgun control) was an honest effort to do this and nothing more, we might agree,” Ashbrook said. Pressed on the rising incidence of violent crime, gun advocates turn the discussion to attempts to punish the law-abiding citizens instead of altering a system of justice that goes soft on criminals. “Any gun owner digs in when he sees what is done to the average crimi- nal,” Ashbrook said. The militants arise At one point, in the early to mid- 1970s, the National Rifle Association seemed willing to compromise a little on handguns. A past president, retired Maj. Gen. Maxwell Rich, even pro- posed selling the NRA headquarters building in Washington and moving to Colorado, devoting the organization more to sport shooting and wilderness preservation than high-dealing politics. But at about the same time, two militant pro-gun organizations, the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms and Gun Owners of America, were formed, pushing into the background the sporting side of the gun issue and going for pure tion was overturned on appeal, and later the charges against him were dropped. The NRA publishes three hunting and shooting magazines, and the Insti- tute for Legislative Action distributes legislative news and opinion in a sepa- rate publication called Report from Washington. Its campaign arm, the NRA Political Victory Fund, reported spending $1.1 million in the 1979-80 campaign, and the NRA takes credit for ousting half a 66 ! daresay there’s no issue on which you and | would vote, no one issue alone. That’s what makes these groups strong.33 —Carter White House aide politics. The emergence of these rivals strengthened the resolve of hard-liners within the NRA to remain the leading pro-gun political force and brought the organization to internal war at a 1977 convention in Cincinnati. Knox, one of the instigators of the 1977 coup, would become the NRA’s chief lobbyist seven months later. Rich was ousted as chief executive officer, his place taken by the current NRA president, Harlon Carter, 67, a former head of the U.S. Border Patrol. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that when Carter was 17, he shot and killed a young Mexican in Laredo, Texas, but his murder convic- dozen liberal Democrats in the Senate on the issue of gun control alone. The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms of Belle- vue, Wash., and Gun Owners of America, which operates out of Cali- fornia, focus heavily on political cam- paigns, leaving most of the congres- sional lobbying to the broader-based and better-financed NRA. The Citizens Committee, with a $1 million budget, has one full-time lobbyist in Washington and produces a newsletter, Point Blank. Gun Owners of America, with an even smaller budget, works mainly to defeat anti- gun candidates and rarely lobbies in Washington. \f NRA forees agency to letup on gun iaws reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says the agency has “tempered” its enforcement of the nation’s gun laws because of criticism from the National Rifle Association. Bureau director G.R. Dickerson, inter- viewed before his agency was targeted for probable elimination by the Reagan administra- tion, said the agency has changed some of its law enforcement tactics either in response to NRA criticism or for fear of giving. the power- ful gun lobby more ammunition. Dickerson began revising the agency’s gun law procedures shortly after he took over as head of the Treasury Department agency in 1979. At the time, the agency was being criticized for investigations of gun dealers that the NRA called “harassment of law-abiding citizens.” And the agency was still stinging from a vote in Congress to cut off funds to implement some proposed gun tracing regula- 4ions that the NRA charged were tantamount to national gun registration. Although denying that any investigations were terminated because of NRA interference, Dickerson said, “It’s true that I put constraints on initiating investigations because I wanted to make damn sure ‘that the cases that we have are quality eases. That was partly in response (to NRA criticism) making a lot-of little cases where we were going to get criticism and where we were going to go through this debili- type of argument.” Initially, Dickerson’s personal approval was needed before bureau agents could investi- gate a gun dealer. “I just wanted to make sure that those investigations of dealers were (of) dealers who really were involved in some type of criminal conspiracy, really were involved in the criminal element or providing guns for criminal use,” the director explained. a - The policy has since been modified to allow the special agent in charge of a metropolitan area to approve a preliminary investigation, but rosecution of a gun dealer requires the ap- proval of the bureau’s regional director. Dickerson said these requirements have limited the agency’s investigations of gun deal- ers to cases “where I can show a criminal con- Spiracy and that type of thing, not just those who make some technical violations.” : “I will admit there are certain times when I feel hampered,” he said. _ _AS an example of how things have changed, Dickerson recalled a 1970-75 agency offensive in South Carolina, which at the time was a major source of crime guns smuggled to other states. The federal effort resulted in passage of a state law requiring better identification for woriad ns purchasers and imposing a waiting ice i rs ane mee felons. can determine that purchase “...I think we documented in those days nana like 40,000 guns out of South Ca- amd to New York City, and the bureau did sumetite and did take criminal action against ‘one re like 30 or 40 dealers.

The bureau ao ee oe iantoncement Administration have ground in Miami such a program off the “Some of our people have h f d ro tha that would arouse the ire of the NRA, but oD fg other hand, I say that I think there’s a justi- lable action,” Dickerson said, because of ona dee People being killed in Miami narcot- \fMONDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1981 The Washington Post AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER Ban the ‘Snubbies’ ESTERDAY’S Outlook section contained an analysis by Cox Newspaper reporter Joseph Al- bright that suggests a way out of the sterile—and murderous—deadlock over whether to control hand- guns. Mr. Albright and his colleagues looked behind the familiar slogans in the hope that the facts would provide clues to a more useful approach. They found one. After analyzing records of 14,000 guns used in street crimes, they discovered that the one character- istic most of these guns had in common was not the low quality, low price or foreign origin that charac- terizes the so-called Saturday Night Special. Rather, 11 of the 15 handguns most often used in the com- mission of murder, armed robbery and other street crimes had snub-nosed barrels of 2.5 inches or less. That is, the most attractive feature from the crimi- nal’s viewpoint was—not surprisingly—concealabil- ity. The short-barreled gun also turns out to be the weapon of choice for assassins. According to Mr. Al- bright, 10 of the 15 assassination attempts on major American political figures since 1835 involved the most concealable type of handgun available at the time. Included in the list are the attacks on Presi- dents Lincoln, Roosevelt, Ford and Reagan. “Snubbies,” as they are called, are frequently ex- pensive and of relatively high quality. But regard- less of the price, their short barrels mean inaccuracy at anything beyond point-blank range. They should therefore be of little interest to legitimate hunters, hobbyists and target-shooters. The favorite argument of those who oppose hand- gun control is that banning or registering guns would disarm only law-abiding citizens. The argu- ment has been raging for years with no agreement in sight. Mr. Albright’s findings suggest that there is a way selectively to disarm criminals—by banning the “snubbies,” their weapon of choice. Those who feel safer with a gun in the bedside table or next to the cash register can continue to keep one there. There is no need that it be very small. But the gun that slips into pocket or purse as easily as a wallet could—and should—he outlawed. \fTHE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1981 ARTHUR OCHS SULZBERGER, Publisher @ A.M.

PRIMIS, V.P., Advertising ‘Snubbies’ on the Streets Gun enthusiasts typically argue that limiting guns in order to fight crime would also limit them for legitimate use — hunting, target shooting and self- defense. An article excerpted in The Washington Post suggests a compromise: don’t restrict all guns, just those most often used in crime. Those, it turns out, are the short-barreled hand- guns known as ‘‘snubbies,’’ according to a study by Joseph Albright, a reporter for Cox Newspapers, and a research team. They used a computer to analyze 14,000 handguns confiscated from street criminals during the first nine months of 1979. The analysis showed that 11 of the 15 handguns most often used in crimes had snub-nosed barrels measuring 2.5 inches or less, suggesting that crimi- mals acquiring guns are most interested in conceal- ability, even more than cost: prices of the most popu- lear criminal guns ranged up to $330. Snubbies are favorite weapons of assassins. They were used to shoot at Presidents Ford and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as well as at Senator Robert Kennedy, Gov. George Wallace, Mayor George Mos- cone of San Francisco and John Lennon, the former Beatle. The attack on President Reagan last March was with the best-selling snubbie, the .22 caliber Roehm RG14. It’s also important to realize how the snubbie is not used. Because it is accurate only at extremely short range, it is not used for hunting or target shoot- ing. Its poor accuracy also limits its usefulness for home protection. In fact, unless you’re a police un- dercover agent, it is hard to think of any good legal use for a snubbie. In 1934, Mr. Albright points out, Congress passed a law severely restricting “‘gangster-type weapons’”’ machine guns, automatic rifles, sawed-off shotguns. In the same spirit, and without in any way jeopardiz- ing the freedom of true gun enthusiasts, Congress could now restrict “‘street-crime type weapons’? — snubbies — as well. \fCox reporting team wins award for series on handgun role in crime Cox Mews Service WASHINGTON — Joseph Albright and Chery! Arvidson, re- porters for the Washington bureau of Cox Newspapers, won the 38th annual Raymond J. Clapper Memorial Award for their series entitled ““The Snub-Nosed Killers: Handguns in America.” The reporters, using previously unpublished documentation, showed that the weapons most often used in U-S. violent crime are snub-nosed handguns of all makes and prices, not just the cheap pistols commonly called “Saturday night specials.” James Coates and Bill Neikirk of the Chicago Tribune won the second-place award for a series entitled “Rearming Ameri- ca,\"' about the nation’s effort to increase its military strength. The awards were accompanied by checks of $1,500 for first prize and $500 for second. Raymond J.

        "ocr_text": "Skull, crossbones flies jauntily again on high seas me mot By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT ; Cox News Service WASHINGTON — The American flagship S.S. Santa Isabel was just easing out of a har- bor on the western coast of Colombia at 6 p.m. last Feb. 11 when it was beset by one of the growing hazards of modern sea travel: Gun- toting buccaneers. As the ship steamed away from the port of Buenaventura, a stowaway suddenly popped dut of his hiding place and pulled out a gun in an effort to rob the crew and passengers. There was a skirmish. One crewman was shot in the arm. But the thief lost his cool and leaped overboard. The next thing the crew of the Delta Lines ship knew, a high-speed pirate launch swooped up behind the Santa Isabel and picked up the stowaway. The captain radioed to shore for assistance. But, as a diplomat re- counted the incident, “Port authorities report that they were unable to locate the launch.”’ | ‘EHAT’S THE WAY IT goes these days on ‘certain stretches of the high seas. Off parts of |Asia, West Africa and South America, modern- ‘da¥# Blackbeards are increasingly plying ‘coastal waters like the Barbary pirates of the 1 800s and the Phoenician marauders who used to terrorize the eastern Mediterranean in 2000 BC. | The passengers on the Santa Isabel were luckier than some. Exactly one year earlier, ithe British ship Icelu was boarded by pirates las it waited in the Pacific Ocean to enter the same Colombian port. Attacking in five motorboats, the pirates, earlier this year that they remain 20-25 miles outside the two ports because of the danger of Piracy.

The report cited instances in which ships have independently hired local tribesmen armed with bows and arrows, adding: “These are not proper but ships employing them have not been attacked.” m The threat in Freetown, according to the re- port, is robbers using dugout canoes equipped with high-powered outboard motors. The dug- outs are said to lurk under the bows of con- tainer ships waiting for an opportunity to slip on board. Insurance investigators recommended that ship owners insert thick sheets of plywood between the container doors and the cargo to deter casual thieves. THE MARITIME BUREAU’S report said the normal security guards for hire in Freetown “are generally unreliable and in many cases are little better than thieves.” The problem of 20th century piracy is not widely realized outside the maritime industry because most of the heists have been sporadic, small and covered by insurance. The most dramatic incident was a carrying automatic weapons, overcame the 20 crewmembers and made off with $100,000 worth of what a diplomat called “sophisticated navigational equipment and other supplies.”’ The boatswain of the Ice/ju was seriously — before the pirates roared off to ety PIRACY HAS NEVER been a atin stamped out throughout the world. But in the last five years the Jolly Roger phenomenon has soared, to the alarm of oil companies, imsurance agents, outmanned coastal police, and even harried drug smugglers who work Caribbean waters. Six weeks ago, the U.S. Maritime Adminis- tration broadcast a warning to all U-S. flag steamship operators to “use caution” when passing through the Strait of Malacca between Singapore and Indonesia ‘‘because of several recent attacks on vessels by pirates.”” The American warning said: ‘““Singapore ma- rine police have reported that the pirates used fast motorboats to pull alongside vessels tran- siting the Phillips Channel and then used grap- pling hooks to board the vessels. The crews were held up at knifepoint or gunpoint and robbed of money and valuables. ... Vessels at- tacked have included a 90,900-ton tanker making 12 knots. The attacks were reported to have occurred between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. local time.” EXXON, SHELL, MOBIL and British Pe- troleum have all acknowledged that their tankers have been hit by pirate attacks in the Strait of Malacca within the last year. Among multimillion-dollar a) swindle ‘in which an underwritin of London & syndicate at Lloyds was forced to pay $52.5 million to the Shell Oil In early 1980, the Liberian- tanker a sank off the poy eo os supposedly carrying a cargo of oil from Ku- wait to Europe. But evidence came to light that the Salem had been deliberately sunk by her own crew to hide the fact that nearly all her cargo of 196,000 tons of oil, valued at $56 million, had been covertly off-loaded at the South African port of Durban. SOUTH AFRICA LATER agreed to pay Shell $30 million for the oil it had seized in defiance of an Arab oil embargo. But Shell sued Lloyds, and a London high court ordered the insurer to repay Shell for the oil’s full value. Some modern buccaneer could probably compose a ditty about the irony of insurance men in their three-button suits conferring in Wall Street skyscrapers about the evils of Piracy in the underdeveloped world. In the 17th century, according to the Ency- clopaedia Britannica, pirates made New York their hangout “and the notorious Capt. Wil- liam Kidd was regarded as one of the city’s leading citizens.” The encyclopaedia reports that it was Capt. Kidd who donated the block and tackle with which the historic Trinity Church, a Wall Street landmark, was first built.

The Phillips Channel, through which more than ee ships pass each year, is an exten- sion of the Malacca Strait, through which oil ships aa virtually forced to pass on their route between the oil-exporting Persian Gulf and Japan. The Phillips Channel is five miles long poe less than one mile wide at its narrowest int. One oil company executive told the Reuters news agency that armed guards could not be aboard oil tankers because “‘any shoot- ing with a full load of oil cargo is not an ac- ceptable risk.’ One hazard is that a ship under pirate attack might run aground or collide with another ship in the channel dotted with small islands and narrow gaps. = IF SUCH A COLLISION occurred, a major oil spill fouling wie: coasts of Indonesia and represented t the General Council of British Shippers in London have pressed for assistance with authorities in Singapore, who have in turn a to Inter- pol.

Mr. Albright and his colleagues looked behind the familiar slogans in the hope that the facts would provide clues to a more useful approach. They found one. After analyzing records of 14,000 guns used in street crimes, they discovered that the one character- istic most of these guns had in common was not the low quality, low price or foreign origin that charac- terizes the so-called Saturday Night Special. Rather, 11 of the 15 handguns most often used in the com- mission of murder, armed robbery and other street crimes had snub-nosed barrels of 2.5 inches or less. That is, the most attractive feature from the crimi- nal’s viewpoint was—not surprisingly—concealabil- ity. The short-barreled gun also turns out to be the weapon of choice for assassins. According to Mr. Al- bright, 10 of the 15 assassination attempts on major American political figures since 1835 involved the most concealable type of handgun available at the time. Included in the list are the attacks on Presi- dents Lincoln, Roosevelt, Ford and Reagan. “Snubbies,” as they are called, are frequently ex- pensive and of relatively high quality. But regard- less of the price, their short barrels mean inaccuracy at anything beyond point-blank range. They should therefore be of little interest to legitimate hunters, hobbyists and target-shooters. The favorite argument of those who oppose hand- gun control is that banning or registering guns would disarm only law-abiding citizens. The argu- ment has been raging for years with no agreement in sight. Mr. Albright’s findings suggest that there is a way selectively to disarm criminals—by banning the “snubbies,” their weapon of choice. Those who feel safer with a gun in the bedside table or next to the cash register can continue to keep one there. There is no need that it be very small. But the gun that slips into pocket or purse as easily as a wallet could—and should—he outlawed. \f"

PRIMIS, V.P., Advertising ‘Snubbies’ on the Streets Gun enthusiasts typically argue that limiting guns in order to fight crime would also limit them for legitimate use — hunting, target shooting and self- defense. An article excerpted in The Washington Post suggests a compromise: don’t restrict all guns, just those most often used in crime. Those, it turns out, are the short-barreled hand- guns known as ‘‘snubbies,’’ according to a study by Joseph Albright, a reporter for Cox Newspapers, and a research team. They used a computer to analyze 14,000 handguns confiscated from street criminals during the first nine months of 1979. The analysis showed that 11 of the 15 handguns most often used in crimes had snub-nosed barrels measuring 2.5 inches or less, suggesting that crimi- mals acquiring guns are most interested in conceal- ability, even more than cost: prices of the most popu- lear criminal guns ranged up to $330. Snubbies are favorite weapons of assassins. They were used to shoot at Presidents Ford and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as well as at Senator Robert Kennedy, Gov. George Wallace, Mayor George Mos- cone of San Francisco and John Lennon, the former Beatle. The attack on President Reagan last March was with the best-selling snubbie, the .22 caliber Roehm RG14. It’s also important to realize how the snubbie is not used. Because it is accurate only at extremely short range, it is not used for hunting or target shoot- ing. Its poor accuracy also limits its usefulness for home protection. In fact, unless you’re a police un- dercover agent, it is hard to think of any good legal use for a snubbie. In 1934, Mr. Albright points out, Congress passed a law severely restricting “‘gangster-type weapons’”’ machine guns, automatic rifles, sawed-off shotguns. In the same spirit, and without in any way jeopardiz- ing the freedom of true gun enthusiasts, Congress could now restrict “‘street-crime type weapons’? — snubbies — as well. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Xpanding bu By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — In the last dec- ade, the handgun has become a more powerful instrument in civilian hands due to the widespread marketing of high-velocity bulléts which expand in- side the body like *“*dum-dum” slugs. Evidence of the awesome stopping power of the new generation of bullets has been compiled by the U.S. Army Ballistics Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. The work is part of a little-known $90,000 research project for the Justice De- Partment aimed at helping police de- Partments choose handgun cartridges with more power to deliver an in- capacitating shock if a policeman is under attack. In.the process, the Army researchers have documented a significant, little- known escalation in the firepower that commercial ammunition makers have been making available to civilians. USING HIGH-SPEED X-ray cam- eras, the Army researchers have found that new types of commercial .38- caliber cartridges rip holes four inches in diameter in blocks of experimental gelatin. Gelatin blocks are considered the best means of approximating the size of the temporary wound cavity the bullet would inflict in human flesh. The largest “‘wound tracks\" were measured with light-weight, high-ve- ban on the wartime use of dum-dums, limiting themselves to fully-jecketed - military bullets. — The same ban was never meant to apply to civilian ammunition. And for decades, hunters have used hollow- point rifle bullets because of their stopping power. ‘ But until the 1960s, ammunition manufacturers saw no reason to sell civilian handgun bullets that were de- signed to mushroom on impact. Dr. William Bruchey, the Army re- searcher who conducted the test fir- ings of commercial handgun billets, said in an interview that a small Indiana firm, Super Vel Cartridge Co., Started the trend among manufactur- ers toward expanding handgun bullets in the late 1960s. ‘“*“SUPER VEL MADE everyone aware that by decreasing the mass of the bullet and increasing the velocity, you couid increase its effectiveness,” Bruchey said. Dave Hetzler, a senior editor of the magazine Guns & Ammo, confirmed that Remington, Winchester and other established bullet manufacturers “jumped on the bandwagon in about a six-month period in the early 1970s .. . primarily because of the great success (Super Vel) enjoyed.”* The Super Vel expanding bullet was the brainchild of Lee Jurras, an asphalt salesman and gun enthusiast who later locity bullets that were engineered to deform and expand on impact. Most of these so-called “high-performance” bullets had hollow points. Since the late 1960s, all the major cartridge manufacturers have intro- duced bullets of this sort along with their traditional lines of slower, non- expanding slugs. Harry Hampton, executive director of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute, said: ‘‘It is no secret that the popularity of hotter cartridges across the board has been increasing. Last year, consumers spent $425 million to buy shotgun, rifle and hand- gun ammunition. There are no reliable figures on what proportion was spent on handgun bullets. nor on what frac- .tion of handgun bullets were of the ex- _ panding variety.~ HAMPTON SAID high-velocity hollow-point bullets ‘‘cause an extremely damaging wound, no doubt about it.\"\" Their principal attraction, he said, is to police departments and handgun hunters. He said the manu- facturers have no means to limit the distribution of the bullets to police forces because of the complexities of the ammunition marketing network throughout the country. Although the new hollow points are designed to expand, they are not in- tended to shatter. In that respect they became a contributing editor of So/dier of Fortune magazine. ; His former associate, J.D. Jones of Bloomingdale, Ohio, recalls: “‘Initially, Lee and I were just a couple of experi- menters interested in increasing the performance of handgun ammunition. The bullet had a very soft core and was thinly jacketed. Prior to that time, no one was interested in getting hand- gun ammunition to expand.” The Super Vel Cartridge Co., which Jurras ran in Shelbyville, Ind., was closed by a 1974 IRS tax lien for non- Payment of $304,612 in excise taxes. The Super Vel cartridge is not cur- rently being marketed, even though the company is in the hands of new owners who hope to revive its sales next year. REACHED AT A MARINA at Key - West, Fla., where he was working, Jurras said: “‘I was just a country boy from the Midwest... . I’ve got no com- plaints. I made a lot of money and I made available something that was needed.”’ Jurras said he set out in the 1950s to design a bullet that would increase the performance of the .38-caliber snub- nosed revolver. He said he sold his bul- lets to “‘whoever wanted them” — civilians, police departments, federal law enforcement agencies. Medica! experts are divided on whether the new expanding handgun ts pul more power in differ from the much rarer exploding bullets such as the Devastator rounds John Hinckley Jr. allegedly used in his assault on President Reagan last March. No major ammunition manu- facturer has madé exploding bullets for civilian use. Craddock R. Goins, curator of mili- tary history at the Smithsonian Insti- tution, said the modern expanding handgun slug is “basically the same type of buliet’’ as the dum-dum bullet made for the British .303 rifle nearly a century ago. : The bullet took its name from an industrial town near Calcutta, India, where the British operated an ammu- nition factory in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 1890s, the superin- tendent of the Dum-Dum Arsenal, Capt. Bertie Clay. invented a bullet with a soft metal core that would mushroom outward through a slit in the hard metal jacket of the bullet. IAN V. HOGG, A British military historian, said dum-dums were “first used to horrible effect’’ by the British Army in routing Arab forces in the Sudan at the Battle of Omdurman in is98. Asa result, in 1899 an international disarmament conference at The Hague adopted a convention outlawing any bullets ‘“‘which expand or flatten easily in the human body.” Ever since, armies of all nations have observed a bullets have actually been respo for extra deaths. There is wides; agreement that they do apply a powerful initial shock to the thereby knocking down the more rapidly. ; Dr. Madhira D. Ram, a surgeon whe handied 500 gunshot cases at mo Sinai Hospital in “Cleveland in e 1970s, said the deforming bullets pete duce more serious injuries and prob- ably more deaths because they. pro- duce more tissue damage.” BUT DR. VINCENT DiMaio, chief medical examiner of San Antonio, Texas, said he found no “obvious in- crease in lethality\"’ when he studied 75 Texas gunshot deaths that involved high-velocity hollow-point handgun bullets. In what may be the most exhaustive study on the subject, experts assem bled by the University of Colorado ported to the Denver City Council in 1975 that a wound to the stomach is twice as likely to be fatal if inflicted by a high-speed expanding bullet as by a conventional bullet of the same caliber. : Dr. Robert Stivers, chief medical examiner of Fulton County, Ga.. said expanding bullets may actually kill fewer people since they tend to stop short without penetrating as many organs as conventional handgun am- munition.

Joe Penton, a spokesman for the Army's ma- eriel development and readiness command, con- irmed ‘that officials at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md., will attempt to discover whether the vapor trails were caused b conditions or some peculiarity with the new nerve gas shells. “It does not mean the shells were leaking,” Penton said. , Dr. Saul Hormats, the former director of the Army's chemical systems laboratory and now an opponent of further nerve gas production, said in a telephone interview: “I must say | am flabber- gasted, It sounds like a real’problem, a very seri- ous problem.” ni) Hormats was in charge of the lab in the late 1960s, while researchers there were designing the shells, He retired in 1973, seven years before the vapor trails were observed, An Army spokesman, Ma} Jeff Samuel, said the first new nerve gas shells are scheduled to be produced in 1984, about'a year after the new study is due to be finished. “We will, of course, not produce something that we thought was ~ jacking,” Samuel said, The notice to contractors said \"a vapor trail of unknown origin\" was observed after a test shell, containing harmless simulant chemicals, was fired, “Identification of the vapor trail is re- quired,” the notice said, It specified that the con- tractor must have a secret security clearance and expertise in chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. Army sources said the vapor trails were no- ticed about one year ago in tests of an eight-inch nerve gas shell held at an undisclosed Army base under the auspices of the Army's training and doctrine command. These so-called operational tests involved regular artillery units, rather than the research and development experts who had earlier certified the shells as safe, Some Army research officials have reported: ly discounted these tests, saying that some sol- diers were upset at having to fire the simulated nerve gas shells, Spokesman Samuel said the Army has no plans to produce nerve gas shells of that size until at least the late 1980s, Until then, Samuel said, the Army plans to concentrate on manufacturing a version with a two-inch smaller diameter, known as the 155- millimeter howitzer. Army officials said reports on the operational tests on the 155-millimeter round do not mention vapor trails. Miami News - March 31, 1982 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Giant Warheads Soviet Answer to MX? By Joseph Albright Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Within the Penta- gon, policy-makers are considering the awesome prospect that the Soviet Union may be pushed into building enormous 100-megaton thermonuclear warheads to counter the latest American MX deploy- ment scheme. “That is a real worry,” said a ranking official, who nevertheless is inclined to favor the new Reagan administration roposal to cluster 100 MX missiles in a relatively small area of 10 to 15 square miles. “It creates great uncertainties for the other side,” the official said. adopt a design that was considered but rejected by American designers some years ago. A 100-megaton warhead — 6,666 time§ as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb — would burst with a fireball 5 miles in diameter that was hotter than a Star. If it went off a few miles above the ground, it would flatten everything below within a 16-mile radius. If exploded closer to the ground, the devastation would be worse because it would kick up a massive cloud of le- thal fallout that would spread in a cigat-shaped oval more than 500 miles ‘long. “I don’t know what it would be like,” said one Defense Department consul- tant who has worked on nuclear wea- pons effects for 30 years. “It would be the biggest thing anyone has ever done.” In any event, he said, a 100- megaton explosion in Nevada would not be large enough to harm people in Los Angeles 250 miles to the west. Sources said the “Dense Pack” pro- al is undergoing urgent reviews the Office of the Secretary of Défense, the Air Force and outside think tanks. One of the key issues will be calculating how the Soviets are likely to respond. ‘Hast week, President Reagan was reported to have signed a directive to the Pentagon calling for a full analysis of the proposal by Sept. 15 so he can make a final MX basing decision by Oet,.1. One feature under considera- tion is some kind of anti-ballistic mis- sile defense network that would guard the densely packed MX silos from So- viet missiles. Theoretically, the advantage of clus- tering the silos close together is that the first incoming enemy warhead would ex- plode with enough heat and radiation to destroy other nearby enemy warheads following just behind it. This process of mutual annihilation among warheads is known as fratricide. The MX close-spac- ing proposal is called “Dense Pack.” Its clearest drawback, the official said, is that the Soviets may well conclude that the only way to attack the silo cluster is to send a smaller number of very large warheads, éach aiming to wipe out half a dozen MX silos in one burst. Sources in the Pentagon and on Capitol ‘The prospect of encouraging devel- opment of very large Soviet warueads was a ‘factor that weighed against “Dense Pack” when it arose briefly for consideration during the Carter administration. William Perry, former undersecre- tary of defense under Carter, said Fri- day that his “biggest concern” about closely spaced MX silos is that the Soviets may choose to deploy bigger warheads. “In theory, if you build the warheads large enough, it is obvious you may be able to use one warhead to attack several silos simultaneously,” he said. Perry, now an investment banker in San Franciso, said he has been invited to the Pentagon for a briefing on “Dense Pack\"’ next week. He said he plans to question officials closely on whether the proposed system could cope with much bigger warheads. Officials said no one can be sure how many American MX silos could be knocked out by a single 100-mega- ton, detonation. One reason is that scientists suspect that under some cir- cumstances, the destructive power of a very large blast may be magnified by a little-known phenomenon involv- ing the interaction of blast and light. As one expert explained it, the area directly beneath a nuclear air-burst would. be heated almost instantly by the fast-traveling light waves, called thermal radiation. The result would be a billowing cloud of hot dust called a pre-shock thermal layer. A few seconds later, the main shock waves would arrive. At that point, the | shoek wave and the dust cloud would interact in ways that scientists cannot accurately predict in the absence of résumed atmospheric nuclear testing. Hill said the main site under considera- tion for the MX cluster is Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., a tract of government-owned desert where there are few close neigh- bors to object. For that reason, “Dense Pack” is viewed among administration officials as more politically acceptable than the circulating MX race track plan championed by the Carter administra- tion. The world has never experienced a 100-megaton explosion. But both Ameri- can and Soviet nuclear weapons laborato- ries are thought to be capable of creating one. Richard Garwin, an IBM researcher However, some experts believe the omen of the shock wave and the dust cloud would result in a “boosted” e n, thereby widening the circle in. which an American missile silo would be destroyed. ‘This.effect was described in guard- atone in The Effects of Nuclear ms, a handbook issued in 1977 by the Defense and Energy departments. It Said that, under some circum- stances, an explosion can cause an i “pressure waveform” giving -t0-“considerably greater” dam- age ‘than that anticipated by normal eptine to a Pentagon official, Union has amassed a gre ate backlog of scientific informa- n the precise effects of very nut ear blasts.

That, he said, would be compact enough to ride on top of one of the Soviet Union’s already deployed SS-18 heavy missiles. One SS-18 now carries eight to 10 warheads, each powerful enough to erase a single American mis- sile silo. Another weapons designer, still work- ing for the government, said the Soviet Union could “probably” manufacture a workable 100-megaton warhead for the §S-18. To do so, he said, the Soviets would Turn to WARHEADS, Al2 Some American experts now say that if the Russians had used more uranium 235 in the device, it probably could have reached 100 megatons. Other experts have speculated that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ac- tually hoped to achieve a 100-megaton blast but the weapon generated less power than planned. The United States has tested wea- pons of at least 20 megatons. In 1954,a 15-megaton device vaporized much of Bikini Atoll in the Pacific and severe- ly contaminated a 7,000-square-mile area with high levels of fallout. The largest weapons in the current American military inventory are the 9-megaton warheads on top of aging Titan intercontinental missiles. In the 1950s, the Air Force also had a supply of 24-megaton bombs for its B-52 bombers, but these are thought to have been retired. Nearly two decades ago, the Ken- nedy administration laid out the Min- uteman missile fields in the Central Plains with 5-mile spacing. A main consideration, according to one source, was keeping the missiles far enough apart so that one Soviet war- head could not destroy two silos. At one int, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara is said to have asked aides to calculate how large a weapon it would take to destroy two Minutemen 5 miles apart. Informed sources said he was told it would take “a@ 1-gigaton warhead.”’ One gigaton is 1,000 megatons. Last week, one American weapons expert was asked whether it is now possible to make a_ 1,000-megaton warhead to knock out perhaps dozens of clustered MX silos. The expert, still in government, t for a moment. “I would have to think about how to arrange the ma- terials so that it doesn’t all blow apart too soon,” he said. He said he could not rule out the possibility. If a gigaton-bomb could be de- signed, he said, it might be no larger than the heaviest payloads carried by the American Saturn rockets that car- ry the space shuttle into orbit.

        "ocr_text": "Panel sets Fed policy on money JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — In _ 1911, American economist Irving Fisher demonstrated that if a nation dou- bled its money supply, it would also double its prices. Using what he called ‘‘econometrics,”’ Fisher put forward the idea that booms and busts were caused by too much or too little money. Fisher’s notion helped explain why the country had been going through a half-century of random events which periodically drained the banking system, causing banks to run short of funds. The results were national “money panics,” the last turning into a national depression in 1907. They kept recurring because the country’s total supply of money was inelastic. When Congress created the Fed- eral Reserve System in 1913, it was quite deliberately making the money supply stretchable. The Fed was given the job of balancing the economy’s capacity to produce against the money available for spending. An independent Fed was placed in charge of the nation’s money during the Great Depression. Congress also created the Federal Open Market Committee as the Fed’s supreme policy council. It would consist of the seven Wash- ington-based governors of the Fed- eral Reserve Board plus a revolving panel of five presidents chosen from among the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Treasury secre- tary, previously ex-officio chairman of the Fed, no longer was invited to policy meetings.

For it is up to the Open Market Committee to manage this country’s dealings with foreign central banks as well as the domestic money sup- ply. After that, members will open 19 identical copies of a secret green notebook summing up staff projec- tions on the American economy. One chart will lay out the probable impact of three “‘options’’ for future Fed policy: Option A calling for faster growth in the nation’s money supply; Option B requiring steady growth; and Option C meaning slower growth. The implications of each option will be spelled out in two columns of figures labeled “unemployment” and “price index.’’ These numbers are consider so secret that they will not be released for five years. Associated Press Volcker: suggests consensus An hour or so later, the talk will get around to what they should do in coming months about the money supply. They will open another se- cret notebook, this one blue, that spells out what each of the options would mean in the rate of money growth and _ short-term - interest. One by one, the 19 central bankers will raise their hands for recogni- tion. Each will talk for up to five min- utes. The others will keep notes. Then chairman Paul Volcker will suggest in a gravelly voice what he sees as the consensus. Then it’s time to vote. In one of the oddities of their meetings, all 19 will talk but only 12 will be eligible to vote. There are eight permanent voting members — the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board plus the president of the New ‘York Federal Reserve Bank, the system’s biggest regional reserve bank. The other four votes rotate among the 11 remaining re- gional Fed presidents. How the Fed creates, destroys money WASHINGTON — Once central bankers establish money growth targets, their helpers on the Federal Reserve Board staff must tinker with the quantity of reserves in the nation’s 15,000 commercial banks to keep money growing at the pre- determined rate. It is not an easy trick. The public makes sudden, unpredictable changes in its demands to hold and spend money. Last year, for instance, the Fed was caught by surprise when so much money rushed into high-inter- est money market mutual funds and out of checking accounts. This year, it was surprised again when Americans made a collective decision to hold extraordinary amounts of money in low interest NOW accounts or no _ interest checking accounts. - In keeping with the Federal Open Market Committee’s votes, money is created or destroyed by a dozen staff members working in suite 835 of the New York Federal Reserve bank, a few blocks from Wall Street. Each morning at 11:15, the senior staff member in New York confers by telephone with the Fed’s senior staff in Washington. Then the New York Fed buys or sells government securities in the financial markets. It only takes a few telephone calls to create a billion dollars. This, in simplified form, is how it works: About 11:30 a.m., the trading desk of the New York Fed calls upa list of dealers in government securi- ties and buys $100 million worth of outstanding Treasury bills. Assume that it buys them all from the Wall Street investment house Salomon Brothers. The New York Fed pays for the Treasury bills by writing a check. As the country’s central bank, it can create a liability on itself with- out having money to start with. Sa- lomon Brothers deposits the Fed check in its checking account at, say, the Chase Manhattan Bank. Chase Manhattan increases the balance in Salomon Brothers’ checking account by $100 million. At the same time, Chase sends the check to the New York Fed for col- lection. A $100 mitlion credit is en- tered in Chase’s ‘‘treserve account” there. Already the nation’s money sup- ply has jumped by the $100 million now in Salomon Brothers’ bank ac- count. That is just the start of the ‘“*money multiplier’’ effect. A reserve account at the Fed is a commercial bank’s license from the government to create more money. In round figures, a bank is required to hold $l in its Fed reserve account for every $10 dollars in customer deposits. Chase, therefore, needs only $10 million in reserves to back up the extra $100 million now in Salomon Brothers’ checking account. Thus Chase immediately has $90 million in ‘“‘excess reserves.’’ Chase wastes little time in trying to put the ‘‘ex- cess”’ to work. Say General Motors Corp. wants to borrow money. Chase is now able to grant the loan. This it does by increasing GM’s checking ac- count by $90 million. So far, noth- ing has happened to Chase’s reserve account at the Fed. But GM has a loanand the country has an extra $90 million in its bloodstream. Now the money really starts multiplying. GM writes checks to pay bills. Say it writes 90 checks for $1 million apiece and they are soon deposited in 90 banks around the country. As these are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, Chase Manhattan’s reserve account at the Fed is whittled down by $90 mil- lion, eliminating all its ‘‘excess re- serves.’’ But at the same time, 90 other banks suddenly find them- selves with reserves to spare. Say one of the $1 million checks from Chase is deposited in Firestone Rubber’s checking account in At- lanta.

        "ocr_text": "Panel sets Fed policy on money JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — In _ 1911, American economist Irving Fisher demonstrated that if a nation dou- bled its money supply, it would also double its prices. Using what he called ‘‘econometrics,”’ Fisher put forward the idea that booms and busts were caused by too much or too little money. Fisher’s notion helped explain why the country had been going through a half-century of random events which periodically drained the banking system, causing banks to run short of funds. The results were national “money panics,” the last turning into a national depression in 1907. They kept recurring because the country’s total supply of money was inelastic. When Congress created the Fed- eral Reserve System in 1913, it was quite deliberately making the money supply stretchable. The Fed was given the job of balancing the economy’s capacity to produce against the money available for spending. An independent Fed was placed in charge of the nation’s money during the Great Depression. Congress also created the Federal Open Market Committee as the Fed’s supreme policy council. It would consist of the seven Wash- ington-based governors of the Fed- eral Reserve Board plus a revolving panel of five presidents chosen from among the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Treasury secre- tary, previously ex-officio chairman of the Fed, no longer was invited to policy meetings. This week, the 19 central bank- ers who attend committee meetings will filter into Washington for their most.critical meeting of the year. They not only must set goals for money growth and short-term in- terest rates that will have a lot to do with the Vigor of the economy during the 1982 congressional ‘elec- tions. They also will take a prelimi- nary yote on how much money should expand during 1983. Toward the start of their meet- ing, they will be briefed by a staff expert on how the dollar is trading.. For it is up to the Open Market Committee to manage this country’s dealings with foreign central banks as well as the domestic money sup- ply. After that, members will open 19 identical copies of a secret green notebook summing up staff projec- tions on the American economy. One chart will lay out the probable impact of three “‘options’’ for future Fed policy: Option A calling for faster growth in the nation’s money supply; Option B requiring steady growth; and Option C meaning slower growth. The implications of each option will be spelled out in two columns of figures labeled “unemployment” and “price index.’’ These numbers are consider so secret that they will not be released for five years. Associated Press Volcker: suggests consensus An hour or so later, the talk will get around to what they should do in coming months about the money supply. They will open another se- cret notebook, this one blue, that spells out what each of the options would mean in the rate of money growth and _ short-term - interest. One by one, the 19 central bankers will raise their hands for recogni- tion. Each will talk for up to five min- utes. The others will keep notes. Then chairman Paul Volcker will suggest in a gravelly voice what he sees as the consensus. Then it’s time to vote. In one of the oddities of their meetings, all 19 will talk but only 12 will be eligible to vote. There are eight permanent voting members — the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board plus the president of the New ‘York Federal Reserve Bank, the system’s biggest regional reserve bank. The other four votes rotate among the 11 remaining re- gional Fed presidents. How the Fed creates, destroys money WASHINGTON — Once central bankers establish money growth targets, their helpers on the Federal Reserve Board staff must tinker with the quantity of reserves in the nation’s 15,000 commercial banks to keep money growing at the pre- determined rate. It is not an easy trick. The public makes sudden, unpredictable changes in its demands to hold and spend money. Last year, for instance, the Fed was caught by surprise when so much money rushed into high-inter- est money market mutual funds and out of checking accounts. This year, it was surprised again when Americans made a collective decision to hold extraordinary amounts of money in low interest NOW accounts or no _ interest checking accounts. - In keeping with the Federal Open Market Committee’s votes, money is created or destroyed by a dozen staff members working in suite 835 of the New York Federal Reserve bank, a few blocks from Wall Street. Each morning at 11:15, the senior staff member in New York confers by telephone with the Fed’s senior staff in Washington. Then the New York Fed buys or sells government securities in the financial markets. It only takes a few telephone calls to create a billion dollars. This, in simplified form, is how it works: About 11:30 a.m., the trading desk of the New York Fed calls upa list of dealers in government securi- ties and buys $100 million worth of outstanding Treasury bills. Assume that it buys them all from the Wall Street investment house Salomon Brothers. The New York Fed pays for the Treasury bills by writing a check. As the country’s central bank, it can create a liability on itself with- out having money to start with. Sa- lomon Brothers deposits the Fed check in its checking account at, say, the Chase Manhattan Bank. Chase Manhattan increases the balance in Salomon Brothers’ checking account by $100 million. At the same time, Chase sends the check to the New York Fed for col- lection. A $100 mitlion credit is en- tered in Chase’s ‘‘treserve account” there. Already the nation’s money sup- ply has jumped by the $100 million now in Salomon Brothers’ bank ac- count. That is just the start of the ‘“*money multiplier’’ effect. A reserve account at the Fed is a commercial bank’s license from the government to create more money. In round figures, a bank is required to hold $l in its Fed reserve account for every $10 dollars in customer deposits. Chase, therefore, needs only $10 million in reserves to back up the extra $100 million now in Salomon Brothers’ checking account. Thus Chase immediately has $90 million in ‘“‘excess reserves.’’ Chase wastes little time in trying to put the ‘‘ex- cess”’ to work. Say General Motors Corp. wants to borrow money. Chase is now able to grant the loan. This it does by increasing GM’s checking ac- count by $90 million. So far, noth- ing has happened to Chase’s reserve account at the Fed. But GM has a loanand the country has an extra $90 million in its bloodstream. Now the money really starts multiplying. GM writes checks to pay bills. Say it writes 90 checks for $1 million apiece and they are soon deposited in 90 banks around the country. As these are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, Chase Manhattan’s reserve account at the Fed is whittled down by $90 mil- lion, eliminating all its ‘‘excess re- serves.’’ But at the same time, 90 other banks suddenly find them- selves with reserves to spare. Say one of the $1 million checks from Chase is deposited in Firestone Rubber’s checking account in At- lanta. That bank’s deposits are up by $1 million, and that means the country’s money supply has go#e up another $1 million. When that check clears through the Federal Reserve system, the At- lanta bank will have an extra $1 million in its reserve account. But it needs only $100,000 to back up the new deposit. The other $900,000 are “excess reserves.”’ As a result, the bank will smile the next time someone walks off the street to take out a car loan. The process of creating new money con- tinues through dozens of stages until all banks in the system have worked out their surplus in re- serves. - In the end, a full billion will have been materialized. If the Federal Reserve wants to destroy a billion dollars, it sells $100 million in government securi- ties. And the money multiplier ef- fect works in reverse. — Joseph Albright \f"

        "ocr_text": "The Money Magicians ‘April bulge’ scared Fed managers @ Second of a series on con- trolling America’s money supply. JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Back in the spring of 1981, when 2 million tewer people were unemployed, the country’s 19 central bankers were so petrified about inflation that the risk of starting a recession seemed Hiinor. To varying degrees, they were all for tight money. ‘‘Each of us has be- come a little more inured to the hardships of fighting inflation,” said Federal Reserve Board gover- nor Henry C. Wallich in an inter- view. “Somebody who might have said a couple of years ago that 10 per cent interest is excessively high will now say 15 per cent may not be excessive. ... Everyone has had to shift his standards a little.” It was against this backdrop that the 19 central bankers on the Feder- al Open Market Committee received their first reports that the country’s money supply was growing out of control. It later turned out that this “April bulge” in the money supply was to some extent an illusion caused by a faulty statistical adjust- ment. But by the time they realized it, they had begun performing acts of monetary magic to tighten money even further. It turned out, to their suprise, to be black magic. For a look at how this happened, Cox News Service has been granted exclusive access to 150 daily inter- nal messages from the Federal Re- serve Board headquarters to the 19 central bankers last year. In allow- ing an outsider to study these tele- grams for the first time, Fed chair- man Paul Volcker specified that the messages could be paraphrased but not quoted directly. A Cox reporter also reviewed the policy decision records of the Fed- eral Open Market Committee, which are published six weeks after each meeting, and interviewed six of the seven Federal Reserve Board governors. At the March 31, 1981, meeting of the Open Market Committee, senior staff economist Jim Kichline threw out the observation that the economy — then just beginning to recover from the short 1980 reces- Federal Reserve Board The view from the marble hall into the Fed's boardroom sion — was losing its upward mo- mentum. Although car sales had surged re- cently, it was probably because of rebates, and they were about to end. In the nation’s factories, the average work week fell by 36 min- utes in February after three months of diminishing gains. Kichline said that when things started getting sluggish later in the year, there probably would be a “small increase” in the unemploy- ment rate. His bosses, the central bankers, took turns picking apart his fore- cast that the economy was about to turn flat. All but one who spoke “thought a stronger performance was more likely than a weaker one,” according to a staff summary of the meeting. In other words, in- flation was still the dominant spec- ter, not recession. In their key vote at the end of the meeting, they decided to set their short-term target for “5.5 per cent or a: little less’ of growth in the “basic” money supply through June. It was a 10 to 1 vote for moder- ately tight money. Wallich, the dis- senter, thought it was not tight enough. “In light of the. recent strength of economic activity, he believed that policy had not been as restrictive as supposed,” stated the meeting record. Right after each meeting of the central bankers, it is up to the staff of the Federal Reserve Board to cal- culate the “‘path\"’ on which money is supposed to grow each week in order hit the committee’s “targets.” A six-member staff of young Fed economists, called the projections unit, finishes an arcane estimate each Friday morning on whether the money supply is actually hold- ing close to its pre-set “path.” They start with the reports on commercial bank deposits that are rushed into Washington each week by the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. Then they apply seasonal adjustment factors that are sup- posed to smooth out holiday buying, tax and Social Security payments and dozens of other other short- term fluctuations in the money growth pattern. At noon on April 10, 1981, the central bankers were informed by an internal message from Federal Reserve Board headquarters that the figures reaching the projections unit suggested a stronger rate of growth in money than had been forecast a week earlier. Despite the apparent upturn, that day’s internal message reported that money was sticking close to the path. In a bland aside, the message no- tified the 19 committee members that the Fed staff had just adopted a new statistical technique for sea- sonally adjusting the incoming money numbers. According to the message, the new technique raised the question of whether the “‘path” for commer- cial bank reserves should be ‘“re- vised upward a bit” — meaning that, for the moment, money should be allowed to grow slightly faster. On April 15, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker flew to Kansas State University to make a flinty anti-inflation speech stress- ing the need to slow the momentum of big wage settlements and big price increases. “With restrained monetary and fiscal policies, that will happen,” said Volcker. “It seems to me both in the individual and the national interest for it to happen sooner rather than later.” Back in Washington, the projec- tions unit turned more pessimistic on April 17. The unit told Stephen Axilrod, the self-effacing Fed staff director for monetary and financial policy, that money seemed to be growing much faster than antici- pated. Volcker is thought to have heard the news that morning from Axilrod. Calculations by the staff that cir- culated among Federal Reserve Board governors showed basic money supply was zooming at the rate of about 25 per cent in April. That was about four times as high as the 5.5 per cent growth limit voted at the last open market com- mittee meeting. Axilrod says the money supply really wasn’t growing that fast in April, despite the calculations. “That was probably, looking after the fact, overstated a bit be- cause the seasonal factor was wrong,” he said in an interview. “It (the seasonal adjustment factor) did not allow enough for people’s need to gather cash for the April tax pay- ments.” With hindsight, Federal Reserve Board member Nancy Teeters agrees: ‘“‘April gets terribly messed up because of the whole tax situa- tion. April is the month of final pay- ments and declarations and refunds. And with the frequent changes in law that we've been having the past 20 years, April is always a surprise to us.” @ TOMORROW: ‘We too dead.’ killed it \f"

During May 1981, they administered five hard whacks to the monetary system, internal Federal Re- serve Board messages reviewed by Cox News Service show. The money supply, which they thought was growing wild in April, seddenly started contracting. “We killed it too dead,” said Federal Reserve Board governor Henry Wallich in a recent interview. By that he did not mean to acknowledge that critics are right in saying the Fed caused the current reces- sion. He simply meant the money explosion was stop- ped abruptly rather than gradually. When the Fed administered the whacks, the nation- al economy was still rebounding from the short 1980 recession. Federal Open Market Committee members were afraid that if money kept growing rapidly the fi- nancial markets would conclude that inflation was about to go double digit again. In early May, an internal message from Fed head- quarters notified the central bankers that it would try to inject $10 billion to $12 billion of temporary reserves _ to cover the needs of the banking system in the next — two days, The Fed’s New York trading desk prepared to do so through its normal mechanism of buying U.S government securities. , ‘The next day, a Wednesday, the daily telegram from Fed headquarters reported that the trading desk had been unable to inject enough reserves because se- curity dealers could not muster enough collateral to back the huge volume of trades. That night, bankers across the country, needing to day back up loans they had already made, were forced to borrow a record $8 billion in temporary reserves from the 12 Federal Reserve banks. Wall Street bond traders, confronted by the twin prospects of rising short-term rates and yawning fu: - ture federal deficits, stopped buying. On May 1, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker learned that the money supply appeared to be growing much too fast. Months later, it turned out the staff formula’for ap- ' plying seasonal adjustment factors to raw money sup- ply numbers was out of kilter. It tended to make April's growth seem steeper than it really was, Volcker, not knowing this, decided to administer the first whack, He authorized a $250 million lowerin of the “path” that the Fed uses to determine how muc reserves it will add to the banking system. One dollar in bank reserves can back up about $10 in checking ‘account deposits. Taking account of this “money multiplier” effect, Volcker was personally pre- venting the creation of $2.5 billion. A second, more powerful whack was delivered May 4, when the Federal Reserve Board voted to raise the “discount rate.” It meant the big banks’ cost of bor- rowing went from 16 per cent to 18:per cent. The same most banks raised their prime rate to 19 per cent. Much later, the Reagan Administration wou!d come to criticize the Fed for tightening too abruptly. But at the time, the administration was all for it, saying the interest rate increase would not harm the economy in coming months. As May unfolded, internal Federal Reserve Board messages show the Fed lowered the “path” three more times. The net effect: another $4 billion disappeared from the national money supply.

        "ocr_text": "The Money Magicians 1979 money supply decision: blamed for today’s recession @ Last of a series on: controlling America’s money supply. JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service 7 WASHINGTON — It was late in the afternoon of March 15, 1976, when the money sorcerers of the Fed- eral Reserve System first considered moving the coun- try toward the free-floating short term interest rates that now are being accused of starting the current re- cession. That was the origin of the momentous October 1979 decision by the Fed to control bank reserves while letting interest rates bob up and down with market de- mand. Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker an- nounced the new practice at a late night news confer- ence Oct. 6, saying it would “‘curb speculative excesses in financial, foreign exchange and commodity markets, and thereby . . . dampen inflationary forces.” Rightly or wrongly, Volcker and the new control procedures are emerging as a scapegoat for the coun- try’s subsequent roller coaster ride into a deep reces- sion. Minutes of that secret 1976 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee show that Volcker, then the recently named president of the New York Federal Re- serve Bank, was skeptical of the newfangled controls he would later embrace. Volcker did confess to some “intellectual sympa- thy” for the suggestion that the Fed should treat the flow of new reserves to the banking system as its main valve for regulating the country’s money supply. But Volcker said his staff thought the new mecha- nism would prove “less reliable’ than the Fed's time- honored practice of tightly controlling changes in short-term interest rates. Under the plan advanced by four of his colleagues, the Fed would raise or lower bank reserves while letting short-term interest rates fluctuate within wider limits. Volcker was named chairman of the Fed in Aanat 1979 by President Carter. Two months later, he and his colleagues voted in the plan. Since then, inflation has lessened drastically. But-in the same two years, unemployment has veered up from 5.8 per cent to 9.5 per cent. Within the last month, political apostles on the left and right, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), have both called on the Fed to:fe- scind its 1979 decision. i Treasury Secretary Donald Regan has let it be known that the Reagan Administration is studying whether to ask Congress to restrict or remove athe Fed's independence. Regan also volunteered to interviewers that the Fed’s abrupt cutoff in money growth last year was the proximate cause of the recession. It was a switch ‘for Regan. When the Fed moved to tighten money in May 1981, Regan reacted: ‘‘While we may be feeling a little whiplash from it, we must realize that some jolting ef- fects are necessary.” What, then, are the lessons of the last two years of erratic money growth? Perhaps the clearest is that the Fed, under pressure from the Reagan administration, tightened the money supply too abruptly in April 1981. As a consequence, the Fed inadvertently caused an explosive oscillation. in the country’s economic cycle. That does not necessarily mean the October 1979 control mechanism should be junked in favor of a-re- turn to pegging short-term interest rates. It may fust mean the Fed should apply its controls more gradually, to allow more time to observe whether an apparent money bulge is merely a statistical glitch. Whatever happens, no one should expect esilicel ue from some new money control mechanism. No doubt the Fed could have improved its techniques last year, but money policy isn’t everything. : \f"

She is a spot-welding robot, one of a genera- tion of computer-brained automatons that are pushing the world into a new industrial revolution with unforeseeable implications for employment, efficiency and world trade. The trend toward ro- bot-operated workplaces is well established in Japanese industry and is spreading to the United States and Europe. In this Nissan Motor Co. car assembly line of the future near Tokyo, Junko and 15 fellow robots turn out semi-finished Datsun car bodies every 40 seconds. Nearby, a crew of three Japanese mainte- nance men and a foreman sit in comfortable chairs around a TV monitor. They are the only human workers in sight, although elsewhere in the plant 5,000 other hu- mans are busy assembling door panels, attaching wheels and performing other conventional autoworkers’ jobs. What is happening here is about to be dupli- cated at a new Datsun pickup truck factory that Nissan is completing near Nashville, Tenn. By the time the $660 million Tennessee plant cranks up next August, Nissan plans to employ 2,600 Ameri- can workers and 176 robots in one of the most highly automated automotive assembly lines in the world. Here at Nissan’s Zama car plant, the former welders who now oversee the robots have assigned each one a female name and even a personality.

Another placard taped on her side denotes her official name: Rebot Number 16. “One robot can play the role of approximately 1.7 human beings,” says Nissan executive Kinic! Tamura, who helped introduce the first American- made robots into Japanese factories 14 years ago. Since then, Nissan has installed about 1,000 robots in its factories, some made by Kawasaki under a license from Connecticut-based Unimation Inc. and others made entirely by Japanese companies. A typical welding robot costs $50,000. Robots work both day and night shifts, stopping only while their human supervisors take lunch and coffee breaks. Usually, they don’t wear out for at least 10 years. Nissan’s robot welders are programmed to perform between 10 and 20 spot welds on each passing car body. The job requures more than rote repetition since two-door, four-door and station wagon models roll down the same assembly line. As each car advances toward the robots, its serial number passes in front of a TV camera. The image is forwarded to the robots’ computer con- trol mechanisms. With the computerized instruc- tions, a robot “knows” where the welds should be spotted for each body style. For spot welding work, robots are far cheaper than Nissan’s human workers, who earn an aver- Cox News Service many spot welds on a new Datsun in Japan In Japan, Even the Robots Have Names age of $13,185 a year plus another $2,900 a year in fringe benefits. The Nissan unit of the Japan Automobile Workers Union did not object much when manage- ment began installing the robots a decade ago. With worldwide Datsun sates growing by 15 per- cent a year, the Japanese car industry confronted a shortage of skilled welders. At the Zama plant, employment rolls were growing through all the years the robots were being introduced. In the last few years, Zama has stopped in- creasing its payroll as the worldwide recession has hit Japanese car sales as well. Lately, the Nissan autoworkers union has begun raising questions about company plans to automate other shops. Among Japanese autoworkers unions, the is- sue so far has remained muted, however, because Japanese workers are virtually never laid off un- der the country’s system of informal lifetime job guarantees and seniority-based wages. Stronger opposition to robots has been voiced by Sohyo, the left-wing union of teachers and blue- collar workers affiliated with the Japanese Social- ist Party. In a recent report, Sohyo warned that the spread of “robotics” eventually will cause wide- spread job losses, Other alarms have been sounded by unions of postal, telecommunications and elec- trical machine workers. The semi-governmental Japan Institute of La- bor reported last month that for the first time many Japanese steel, shipbuilding and heavy ma- chinery companies plan to cut back their hiring of new high school graduates by 60 to 90 percent. The institute ascribed the shortage of new unskilled jobs to Japan’s recession and “increased automation of factories and offices.” While high school graduates were facing rejections, the insti- tute said that technical college graduates were in increasing demand in the computer, biotechnology and new materials technology fields. Faced with growing questions about the impli- cations of robots, the government's Ministry of Turn to JUNKO, FFI6 Junko From FF1 Labor disclosed plans this fall to seek budget increases to offset “‘possible negative employment effect due to the rapid spread of industrial robots.” Watching Junko in action is en- thralling and a bit scary. She looks more like a gun turret than a movie- land humanoid. When each car body reaches her station, she jerks into ac- tion, her motions induced by her inter- nal hydraulic pumps. Her computer brain and control mechanisms are packed into a control head the size of a medium suitcase. Protruding from one end is a single mechanical arm which can swing in all directions and can telescope from one to four feet in length. Her mechan- ical wrist holds the welding torch. Tamura, general manager of one of Nissan’s engineering departments, says robots were installed mainly be- cause “welding is very severe work for human beings, especially for Japa- nese. who are not so big.”’ Along with the primary objective of improving the work environment, he lists “stable quality of production” as a second goal. Cost-cutting — or “‘im- proving productivity,” as Tamura puts it — is the company’s objective number three. So far, only about 5 percent of the total work at the Zama plant — mainly welding and painting — _has been assigned to robots. _ Nissan plans to go slow in increas- ing the robot population in its Japa- nese factories. ‘“‘We have to think of employment too,” says Tamura. At the new Tennessee truck plant, about 10 percent of the work initially will be assigned to robots which wiil stamp, weld and paint. Nissan be- lieves the tasks assigned to the Ameri- can factory are inherently more sus- ceptible to automation since it will be more of a final assembly plant than a full-fledged truck manufacturing unit. At first, about 38 percent of the parts in the Tennessee-made Datsun trucks will be bought from American manufacturers and the rest imported from Japan. A Nissan spokesman said the proportion of American-made parts would rise above 50 percent “as soon as possible.”’ Palm Beach Post - December 5, 1982 \f"

But Fitzsimmons said he sometimes worries at night about whether, in reality, the international safeguards are tight eneugh to detect a plutonium theft if one were pulled off throtgh collusion between the company that runs the plant ani the government agency that inspects it. “TI aways think about that,” said Fitzsimmons, a Brit- ish citizm. “‘If the government and the operator of the fa- cility got together, I don’t know.” The IAEA figures that eight kilograms of dissolved plutoniun is a “significant quantity” — the magic portion from whith it may be possible to make one bomb. By the agency’s estimates, it would take only one to three w to convert the Tokai-type plutonium solution into plutosium metal bomb components. The Japanese government spends more money than any other country on research into conventional nuclear power, intluding reactors, reprocessing, nuclear safety and civilian nuclear-waste disposal. Japan outspends the haa States government by $200 million a year in this ‘ie : And Koisumi exemplifies the nuclear sophisticates who have grown up with Japan’s peaceful nuclear pro- gram. | At 50, he has a doctorate in plutonium chemistry from Hol University, an advanced degree in nuclear chemistry m Iowa State University and a year of ex- perience handling plutonium in an exchange program at the U.S. government’s Hanford nuclear complex in Wash- ington state. He has Visited the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico three times. He has also toured the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Argonne Na- tional Laboratory in Illinois, the half-completed Barnwell nuclear reprocessing plant in South Carolina and the Windscale reprocessing plant in Britain.

Koisumi, receiving a reporter in a conference: room decorated by an exquisite Japanese flower arrangement, displayed a photograph of some plutonium in liquid form that the plant had extracted from waste-contaminated nu- clear fuel. In a photograph, a laboratory beaker of this juice of nuclear nightmares looks like minty-green mouthwash. See ATOM, Page 9-A JOSEPH ALBRIGHT. Japanese technicians at work inside control room of Fugen nuclear reactor, an experimental unit tials almost as impressive. Both Japanese and foreign ex- researchers technological capability to weapons already,” said Junnosuke Kishida, chief editorial writer of Asahi Shimbun, Japan’s leading newspaper. “If a decision is ever made that Japan has to have nuclear weapons, we could have them in three months or so.” Masao Segawa, president of the quasi-governmental nuclear company that runs the Tokai reprocess- ing plant, agreed that Japan might be able to make a bomb in three months. But to develop and train a military force to deliver such weapons accurately “would take three nae at least,” Segawa said. A US. government official in Washington estimated it would take the Japanese “all of 20 seconds” to decide how to make a bomb and organize an industrial team to build it. Japan could probably skip the stage of making crude atomic weapons and move directly to advanced hydrogen warheads and long-range rockets to deliver them. Researchers at the University of Osaka have report- edly developed sophisticated computer codes to predict how droplets of super-heavy hydrogen might behave in a hypothetical “inertial confinement fusion” reactor. The codes are part of Japan’s $165 million-a-year nu- clear fusion research program. But computer codes for hydrogen fusion research are inherently adaptable for de- signing hydrogen bombs, an American official in Washing- ton noted Japan is also well on the way to perfecting an accu- rate long-range rocket to launch peaceful satellites. Theoretically, the same rocket could also deliver hydrogen warheads on distant targets. Last August, the Japanese space agency disclosed that it had successfully tested a sophisticated inertial guidance system to allow rockets to fly along a predeter- ' mined course. The agency said the guidance system will be installed in Japan’s next-generation rocket,.the H-1A, now due to be launched in 1985. Atlanta Constitut on - December 20, But popular opinion is still dominated by the horror of nuclear weapons born at Hiroshima. : As long as Japan retains a alliance with the nuclear-armed United States, only a few conservatives and retired military officers are likely to make a case for nuclear f an orce. Mpeltetin acoteues ion in opinion polls, poll- sters for the newspaper Asahi Shimbun found in March 1981 that 71 percent of Japanese men and women be- lieved it would never be nuclear arms. Another 16 percent of respondents disa- greed, saying nuclear arms would be However, similar polls last year found that Japanese adults supported nuclear energy for power generation by a margin of 55 percent to 29 percent. ' Hideaki Kase, director of a think-tank called the Japan Center for the Study of Security Affairs, is one of the few Japanese intellectuals who openly call for a nuclear-armed Japan. He acknowledges that his views represent a tiny minority. “It would stabilize the region,” said Kase in an inter- view. “It is unfair and unrealistic for us to expect the United States to risk its cities to save the Japanese.” William Clark Jr., the second-ranking US. diplomat in Tokyo, said in an interview that Japanese “‘defense peo- ple, many of them, think the option (to develop nuclear weapons) should be there” in case the U.S.-Japanese al- liance ever fell a A supply of plutonium from a reprocessing plant inevitably keeps open a nuclear-weapons option that would otherwise be unavailable. But that was not why the plant was built. The plant has always been viewed as a logical exten- sion of Japan’s blossoming civilian nuclear-power pro- gram, which began in 1956 after President Eisenhower’s Atoms For Peace project. Like nuclear power enthusiasts in the United States and Europe, the Japanese wanted to make their nuclear . plants more economical by recycling the aaa they created. 1982 \f"
