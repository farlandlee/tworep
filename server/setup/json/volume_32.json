        "ocr_text": "REFUGEE ACCOUNTS Serbs store arms in Kosovo towns By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Morina Border Point, Albania hildren’s games of hide-and-seek at the 17 November Primary School over the border in Prizren have given way to a more deadly competition: the Yugoslav army has clois- tered troops and arms there to save them from NATO bomb attacks, according to refugees who arrived here Saturday. Throughout the city that, in the last two days, has disgorged thousands of ethnic Albanians, the Serb mil- itary has hidden troops, camouflaged tanks and secreted civilian trucks laden with arms and ammunition, the refu- gees said. Over the past week, refugees from other towns and villages also have spoken of tanks and troops being shel- tered in homes and schools, as the NATO bombing campaign has intensified. They have ' described widespread military trenching works, mostly undertaken by young ethnic Albanian men pulled from their families and forced to build defenses. Should NATO undertake to clear a safe zone or enclave in Kosovo, especially once its Apache attack helicopters are opera- tional, this southernmost part of Yugosla- via is a likely first target. A‘ cross-section of refugees in the new surge of exiles described districts of Prizren, a municipal area of more than 100,000 people, as being virtually emptied of civilians in recent days as more troops entered the city. Life has become increas- ingly difficult, they said, with diminished food! supplies and harassing troops and police especially on the lookout for young men to draft for work gangs over the past two weeks. More than 18,000 refugees crossed this border Friday and Saturday, and another 10,000 from the Prizren area had been expected to move into Macedonia. Among refugees interviewed here, sev- eral cited the 17 November Primary School, named for the day that partisan fighters liberated Prizren from the Nazis in World War II, as a makeshift arms depot put off-limits to local people. “I saw soldiers and ammunition in this school,” said Shefkat Haliti, 34, who lives about half a mile from the school. “There were trucks covered with plastic sheets. They aren't military trucks but trucks taken from the people. There were boxes of ammunition in the trucks.” Bekim Saramat, 24, who crossed into Albania on Saturday afternoon with his pregnant wife and a younger brother, said the school and many other civilian properties have been taken over by Yugoslav armed forces. “They put sandbags in front of the school and in the road so no one can get through,” he said. “I live near the Palace of Culture, and they are there too. There is a tank there. It’s in the road with sandbags around it. They put old carpets on top of the tank.” Saramat listed factories now housing troops and supplies as Printex, a printing plant, Communa, a shoe factory, Perlonka, a textile factory, and a fourth called Ss. He said a storehouse formerly used for humanitarian supplies of the Catholic Relief Services has been emptied, with the goods given to police, and is now being used to house tanks and military supplies. “They want to protect it,” Saramat said. “If NATO comes in, maybe they will need SANTIAGO LYON / Associated Press Hard road to safety: An elderly ethnic Albanian refugee suffering from exhaus- tion is helped across the Morina border crossing into Albania on Saturday. More than 600,000 have left Kosovo since the start of NATO air strikes on March 24. it.” Another factory called Pharmokoz, apparently a former pharmaceuticals plant, was described by several refugees as a military base and arms depot. It also was said to contain artillery units that in earlier weeks fired on positions of the Kos- ovo Liberation Army. Others said trucks, either civilian or military in camouflage, have been driven to the outer residential areas of Prizren and parked in narrow streets lined with houses in an effort to hide them. There also wére multiple reports of eth- nic Albanians being driven out of their homes, which were turned into shelters for small groups of soldiers or paramilitary troops.

And there’s no disguising that they live in tents on stony ground. But Kosovar refugees lucky enough to stay at the cut- ting edge “Arab camp” are treated to a bounty of luxuries inconceivable till now in the des- olate domain of refugee life. They have hot chicken stew for lunch and electricity in every tent. Some sleep on metal-spring beds. Their field hospital soon _ will boast a full-scale operating theater. And on Monday afternoon, five J trucks loaded with gravel waited on the edge of the narrow, pot- holed road bordering the camp to deal with the mud problem that » will reappear when the hot, dry weather gives way to summer _ storms. The managers of the so-called Arab camp are relative newcom- ers to the world of big-time inter- national humanitarian aid. But the oil-rich United Arab Emir- ates, which runs the camp, is - building a show-stopper on what - was idle farmland just three weeks ago. Col. Obaid Ketbi, commander of the military half of the opera- _ tion carried out in tandem with Cox Newspape ng tent. the UAE Red Crescent Society, summed up the attitude in an interview: “We have an open budget for this mission.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 4, 1999 > Oil-rich UAE opens aid pipeline Dozens of refugee cars park daily outside the fence ringing the camp on the southern out- skirts of Kukes, and scores of newly arrived Kosovar Albanian exiles routinely sit on the grass awaiting word that there is room for them. “We are told these are the best conditions here in this camp. We heard it is run by Muslim peo- ple,” said Nasar Veliu, 25, who was moving his extended family of 15 people into one of the mas- sive UAE tents. The tents mea- sure at least 30 feet by 18 feet and can sleep 40. The fact that this latest of Bal- kan tragedies has engulfed a pre- dominantly Muslim population may have helped attract the UAE funding and support, although Ketbi said only that his country saw a need and responded. The tent set aside for use as a mosque is not the only element differentiating this Arab camp from the Greek, Italian or other camps blossoming on swaths of undeveloped land around Kukes. The camps commonly are known by the country or organization that finances and manages the setup of tents, latrines, food ser- vice and other logistics of emer- gency living. The Arab camp will be the big- gest. It now has about 400 tents holding an estimated 5,000 refu- gees, and those numbers are expected to double, Ketbi said. All services are provided or contracted by the UAE, while other camps normally link ser- vices from agencies such as the World Food Program and Medecins du Monde, the France-based Doctors of the World. “We are trying to manage 100 percent by our own people,” said Ketbi. “We try to provide every- thing from the UAE government and from our volunteers.” Dr. Saeed Bloushi, chief physi- cian at the field hospital, has up to 200 in-patient beds in tents. With justifiable pride he described his facility as “becom- ing a tertiary referral center for the region,” meaning it is treat- ing patients from other camps as well as local Albanians sent from the Kukes hospital. The operating theater and radiology lab are expected to arrive any day — as is the first set of Kosovar Albanian twins, he = said. The doctor is comforted by the four camp generators that keep his lights and new, state-of- _ the-art equipment on line. Perhaps the most lavish and ultimately most utilitarian 1 expenditure is the airstrip that is \"sx expected to receive the first C-130 loaded with UAE supplies this week.

Until now, the UAE has flown supplies from Abu Dhabi and from Europe to the Albanian capital, Tirana, then sent them to Kukes via four UAE military helicopters. Increased NATO use of the Tirana airport led the UAE to build up the old Albanian mili- tary airstrip about a mile from the Arab camp, Ketbi said. C- 130s will fly there directly. The packed and graded air- strip is 950 meters long, or about half a mile, said Lt. Col. Paolo Fregosi, the Italian in charge of troops in the NATO humanitarian aid mission. NATO troops already are based at the airfield and will run it. Radar and an imported control tower are yet to be installed, but when they are, the strip will be able to handle more traffic than a couple C-130s and NATO helicop- ters every day, Fregosi said. NATO troops plan to build a staging area to house refugees who will be flown out as part of the effort to clear the increas- ingly tense border area of the 100,000 refugees who could be vulnerable targets, he said. After that, he suggested, the field could be used by NATO for other purposes he would not specify. “It’s for humanitarian pur- poses for the moment,” Fregosi said. “The future is in the hands of God.” \f"

        "ocr_text": "Demoralized escapees say Serbs on unchecked rampage By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Morina Border Point, Alba- nia — Chilling stories of killings, brutality and destruction poured out of refugees who arrived here nonstop Tuesday from Kosovo. -The tales of cold-blooded shootings and armed robberies, if true, invoke a picture of a new level of barbarity in the Serbian campaign to erase the ethnic Albanian population from Kosovo. “They made the drivers get out of the tractors and they executed them. They took my son, and four meters away from his father and mother they killed him. They killed my son,” said Hodit Aslemi, 59. Villagers from Zrze, who had harbored hundreds of displaced people in recent weeks, said Serb troops evicted the entire town of about 3,000 people Tuesday and trashed their homes. Arriving refugees came from four geographic areas, including about 2,000 who had been camp- ing in the mountains for several weeks, said Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency. “There were reports of widespread abductions and kid- nappings of men, and eyewitness reports of executions.” About 7,400 Kosovo Albanians crossed into Albania in the maaan macioonn | > OTirana ‘Staff ‘stream of refugees between noon and 9 p.m. local time. In another development, “closure or Wilkinson said the movement of the camps in Kukes” is “under active discussion” by relief organizations. No decision had been made by Tuesday night, but he stressed the Albanian gov- ernment has shown “growing anx- iety” over the 100,000 refugees in Kukes, many of whom live outside the camps. The closure of camps would mean fast, mandatory removal of at least 35,000 refugees, a move the refugee agency has been try- ing to avoid in favor of convincing the Kosovars to shift voluntarily to areas in the Albanian interior safer from cross-border conflict. Wilkinson had no details on how the refugees might be forced to leave. Aslemi said the shooting of his 27-year-old son happened Sunday night, as his convoy of about 200 tractors was trying to leave Koso- vo. He said he did not know how many men were shot when the Serb forces demanded they get down from their tractors. Aslemi said the Serbs also sep- arated his 83-year-old father-in- law from the family and left him sitting alone, without food or water, in the middle of a field. It took the convoy from Sunday until Tuesday night to get to safe- ty, said Aslemi, who sat with his sister atop blankets and other goods his family hauled away on their tractor-drawn cart. “Until we crossed the border we did not cry,” he said, as he and his sister sat atop the remnants of their lives and wept. “Everything is over in Kosovo.” For the first time in weeks, ref- ugees seemed overwhelmed . by despair of ever returning to nor- mal life in their homes. Until now, a buoyant spirit of hope has prevailed. At a holding tent on the Kukes square where hundreds of refu- gees would spend the night, 56- year-old Nuhi Kolgeci expressed feelings that NATO had betrayed the Kosovo people by failing. to stop the Serbs. “There are tanks all over my village. Why don’t they bomb them?” Kolgeci asked. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 5, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "APACHE CRASH Second copter loss raises doubts By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Rinas Air Base, Albania — In the dead of night, over the rugged mountainous terrain of northern ia, the Apache helicopters under the command of Lt. Gen. John W. Hendrix, a Georgia native, were on a Ilow-flying rehearsal mission Wednesday when one of them crashed in a burning heap. 'The two aviators aboard Chief Warrant Officer 3 David Gibbs and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Kevin Reichert — were killed. _It was the second crash in 10 days for the helicopter force that had been depicted in some quar- ters as the end-all force in the war against Serbs in Kosovo. Mil- itary officials said the crash may have been caused by a rotor hit- ting a power line or a tree. ‘Before the Apaches have fired a+single public shot at enemy farces in Yugoslavia, they have battled a series of troubles. Muddy ground and absence of support troops delayed for weeks the anticipated arrival of the heli- copters. Besides the two crashed helicopters, a third Apache was knocked out of commission, at least temporarily, by a hard land- ing in northern Italy even before the first of 24 helicopters arrived on the Albanian border April 21. Wednesday, frustration became tragedy. “On behalf of Lt. Gen. Hendrix and the soldiers of Task Force Hawk, I would like to express our deepest sympathy and sincerest condolences to the families and loved ones of the pilots,” Hen- drix’s spokesman told journalists waiting at the gate to the airfield. When the Apaches will finally go into combat is now unclear. On Wednesday, Hendrix’s spokes- man imsisted that the second Apache crash would not delay the “timeline” for the first mission. But then came word from the FiIRrsTt Vs.

Wesley Clark. And then Clark will tell Hendrix to launch the first Apache mission when he is ready. . The big mission headache belongs to Hendrix, a 57-year-old general and Georgia Tech gradu- ate from Statesville. Hendrix, a Vietnam veteran, was the demanding boss of the 3rd Infantry Division (Mecha- nized) at Fort Stewart from 1996 to 1997, following a stint as a commander at Fort Benning. He inherited the Apaches of the 11th Aviation Regiment last year when he was handed one of the Army ’s prime jobs: command- ing the Army’s V Corps in Ger- many, which includes two divi- sions of heavy M1A1 battle tanks. In the last 18 months, while he commanded V Corps, Hendrix has pushed his Apache pilots through six major Combined Air Operations exercises and one bat- tle command exercise. When he got the assignment March 26 to bring his Apaches to the Balkans, he immediately ordered them back to a firing range for more gunnery training. Although Apaches were designed to team up with advancing tank columns, going in low and hard to sweep away enemy armored units to allow ground troops to surge forward behind them, military officials never indicated any plans to put them in Kosovo with ground troops. That strategy suggests that the remaining 22 Apaches would be used to blast Serb forces with the most lethal anti-armored weapon in the American arsenal without risking the inevitable casualties of ground warfare. Hendrix’s first Apache crashed April 26, reportedly when it hit an air pocket descending over a ridge and clipped a rotor blade on an obstacle. A team of accident investigators sent from Fort Rucker, Ala., to analyze the first crash will stay to investigate Wednesday’s crash. In the first crash, the pilots were lucky and so was Hendrix. He said “aggressive” night training missions with live ord- nance on board were necessary to make his crews ready for war. Indeed, by Wednesday, Task Force Hawk had shaken off the embarrassment of that crash, and the training was back on track. An Army spokesman, Lt. Col. ad Ane said the second crashe pache was i a full combat load of aiedeiewee — eight Hellfire laser-guided anti- tank missiles and 38 rockets hanging under the fuselage.

        "ocr_text": "Refugees flood into Albania Hundreds were forced out of villages By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Morina Border Point, Albania — Tractors brought the first of the new wave of Kosovo refugees Saturday. Packed tight with people and bags, the carts began arriving around 8 a.m. and numbered as many as 200. The caravan broke three days of relative border calm and began a stream of refugees that continued unrelieved all day and into the night, adding about 7,500 to the estimated 700,000 Kosovo Albanians already made refugees in a nearly seven- week campaign of ethnic cleansing, according to aid officials. Saturday’s arrivals came largely in groups, each with a different story, all underscored by fear. The tractor caravan carried villag- ers from around Pec in western Kos- ovo. Some reported shooting assaults drove them out of their houses in recent days, while others said they simply had been told to leave. -These ethnic Albanians from an array of villages had been gathered they said Serb police and military formed them into a long convoy Fri- day and sent them packing. There were reports that scores of men were taken from their families just before departure. One who was returned after being separated was Fatmir Husaj, 33, who told of calling over his wife to say goodbye as he was put against the wall of a school with more than 100 other men. She came and they talked for an hour. “Some police told her to get up and leave with the baby, and then they released me, too,” he said, weeping. “As I was walking away they said I was saved only because of my wife and child.” As for the others? “Nobody can say what happened to them,” said Husaj. The second segment of Saturday’s new wave began around 11:30 a.m. These refugees came in cars. They traveled not so far, less than 30 miles from the southern Kosovo city of Djakovica. They told of no trouble en route, yet many arrived shaking and in tears, apparently after ty in which the were — DAVID GUTTENFELDER / Associated Press Kosovo refugees hold out their hands for high-nutrition biscuits that were distributed from an aid truck Saturday at a camp in Kukes, Albania. afraid to leave, yet just as frightened of staying. Several in the carloads of refugees said fighting broke out Friday night between Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas or self-armed civilians and Serb soldiers, and the quarter of town called Cabrat was in flames. “First they burned the houses, and then they shot from tanks,” said Vyolica Gjarra, a 43-year-old mother. The KLA’s Kosova Press agency also reported heavy fighting over the past two days in Djakovica but gave no further details nor casualties. By late afternoon, another big group was walking over the border, having been carried in six buses, courtesy of Serb police, from the cen- Kosovo to the town of Zhur just north of the border. Mehti Avdullaliu, 58, said Serb police came Friday night to the houses of Obelic, another village where people from around the area had been gathered in past weeks when driven out of their homes. The police said buses would arrive Satur- day and the people would have to leave, he said. “Every day, they have gotten us outside and told us we would go. Then they would turn us back,” said Avdullaliu. “For a month we have wanted to come.” This time they did come, and the man said he was relieved. ‘Finally we are 100 percent safe,” TIM OCKENDEN / Associated Press Tents, lined up at a refugee camp in Macedonia, are among the supplies that a burgeoning “disaster industry” provides to relief agencies.

David Tompkins keep watch over the pulse of the Task By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT American-Statesman Intemational Staff TASK FORCE HAWE, Albania — During World War II, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower sometimes waited for carrier pigeons to bring battle dis- patches from the front lines. During the Gulf War, Gen. Nor- man Schwarzkopf often got news from the battle faster on CNN than from his own military communications. Today, Lt. Gen. John Hendrix, commander of Task Force Hawk troops in Albania, has tools of mili- tary communication that his prede- cessors could scarcely dream of. And as he still prepares for a pos- sible strike into Kosovo with Apache tank-killing helicopters, the top U.S. commander is not the only benefi- ciary of the military’s great Internet leap forward. Now even the 25-year-old captains working under Hendrix can call upa classified bulletin board on their laptops that gives them immediate access to operational orders and intelligence. Or they can whip offa quick e-mail to their spouses or their bill collec- tors, using an unclassified military Internet system called NIPRNET. “The average captain here has more Internet power in his or her hands than a general did in the desert in Desert Storm,” said Army Maj. Doug Wolfe, 35, of Catasauqua, Pa., who is deputy communications officer of Task Force Hawk. Except for the 24 Apache gunships Force Hawk’s operations in Albania. The technology allows military personnel to communicate in the field. and an assortment of artillery rocket launchers, perhaps the most potent weapon the Army has airlifted into Albania are 200 laptop computers and a plethora of associated com- munications gear. For every 25 of Hendrix’s soldiers, there is one government-supplied laptop. All 200 have Ethernet cards or similar devices so that they can be hooked together in a military-wide Local Area Network. Many, if not most, of the Army’s current laptops have been bought off-the-shelf from companies such as Motorola Inc., IBM Corp., RCA, Mi- cron, Gateway, and Dell Computer Corp. The same is true of other ae gear being used “Army units in the field have been - about eight to 10 years behind the civilian industry,” said Lt. Col. Karla Torrez, 41, of Cocoa Beach, Fia., the commander of the 32nd Signal Bat- talion from Darmstadt, Germany. “Weare alwaysevolving, justas they are.” In purchasing laptops for troops in the field, the Army deliberately does not require any particular brand name. Instead, it has been taking bids for standard laptops with some typeofa Pentium chip, plusatleast32 megabytes of memory. Some of these “tactical” laptops use Windows NT 4.0 as their operat- ing system while others use Win- dows 95, Windows 98, UNIX or Linux. “Actually, I think there is also one Austin American-Statesman - May 22, 1999 > Computers help military do battle Apple out here,” said Wolfe. When Hendrix first wakes up each morning inside his camouflage-netted headquarters, he can immediately sit in front of his own dedicated computer and fire off an e-mail to anyone in the world. He can choose from two e- mail systems installed in his laptop — one for “secure” messages and one for “unsecure.” Once Hendrix walks over to his command office, he has access to another dedicated computer, this one also plugged into both secure and unsecure Internet networks. If Hendrix wants to dispatch a secret military message, he could log onto the military’s worldwide SIPRNET (Secure Internet Proto- col Network) system. This would allow him to send even highly secret information al- most instantly on a network de- signed to foil eavesdroppers. Using SIPRNET, he also can check for any overnight secret traffic from his superiors in Italy, Brussels and Washington. Among his subordinates, Hen- drix is also known to bea devotee of management through secure video teleconferencing. After morning chow, Hendrix normally calls a transcontinental staffmeeting via secure VTC (video teleconferencing.) Hendrix sits in front of a VTC terminal — a laptop equipped with a microphone anda small camera trained on his face. Back at his rear headquarters in Germany and other selected points around the world, there are similar VTC terminals for various gener- als, admirals and perhaps some civilians who have been granted the right to participate in daily Task Force Hawk planning meetings. enemy Austin American-Statesman - May 22, 1999 (Continued) Later in the day, there is often a second and a third video teleconference. At least one of these regular meetings-by-video is a top secret discussion run by Hendrix’s G-2 (intelligence) section that presum- ably includes the latest satellite imagery and other data on what is happening in Yugoslavia and per- haps elsewhere. This intelligence video telecon- ference takes place on an even more secure military communica- tions network that is known here by its acronym, JWICCS. Though military communica- tions have improved dramatically in the past decade, everything isn’t perfect here. The big challenge is trying to overcome the mountains of Albania, which sometimes make it difficult for commanders to reach the low-flying Apaches and their support helicopters as they scoot through the valleys leading toward Kosovo, “The mountain terrain has caused problems here that we’ve always talked about when we teach doctrine to Army units,” said Col. Torrez of the 32nd Signal Battalion. “But to experience it, you really recognize the challenge that a lot of our systems cannot get over the mountains. And satellites become more of a requirement than a luxury.” Of the technological advances of the past decade that permitted the army to multiply its “connectivity,” the most impor- tant was the widespread adoption of digital technology for satellite communications, as well as a data-sending method called “packet switching.” “We have transferred from ana- log technology —analog systems — to digital systems and packet switching,” Torrez said. “Packet-switching assigns time slots to the transfer of data and does it continuously,” Torrez said. “The basic analog telephone circuitry was: ‘I gave you 16 channels on a group. Once you dialed and seized achannel, nooneelse could have it, whether you used it or not.’ “With packet-switching and dig- ital technology, wecan giveagroup of computers a channel to do packet-switching on, and they will get a lot more information transferred.” \f"

        "ocr_text": "Hobson asks about Apaches > He leads a group with pointed questions for Clinton about the use of attack helicopters. By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE RINAS AIR BASE, Albania — Frustration over the fact Apache helicopters have not been used in the war in Kosovo surfaced Sat- urday among members of Con- gress on a two-day tour of NATO military installations and refu- gee camps in the Balkans. “Why did they bring them (the Apaches) in here?’’ asked Rep. David L. Hobson, R-Springfield, who led the 11-member delega- tion. “I would have preferred that he (President Clinton) didn’t take any option off the table. “When you are engaged ina war, you need to use all the com- ponents available to you,” said House minority whip David E. Bonior D-Mich., the fanking Democrat in the delegation. : Less than a week ago, Clinton- said the Apache’s mission of attacking Serbian positions in Kosovo was being reassigned to the Air Force’s A-10 attack planes. The president said the low-flying Apaches would be too vulnerable to shoulder-carried missiles fired by Serbian gun- ners. Hobson’s delegation met witha half-dozen Apache pilots from a squadron that lost two comrades in a training crash two weeks ago. Afterwards, Hobson said: “‘I’ve talked to them, and they are pre- pared to do the mission. And I think they should do it if the time and mis- he would not “second guess” Clinton. But he added: “I clearly think it is impor- tant to ve all the compo- ‘nents available to youasa threat to an enemy. The fact that they are here, ready and trained, is something that Milosevic ought to understand and consid- er. More important, it is some- thing that his troops that are dug in ought to consider.”’ “The Apache was designed to fight, essentially, World War III in Europe, versus the finest anti- aircraft systems the Soviets can manufacture,’’ said Capt. Mark Arden, a pilot and the adjutant of the Apache unit. “So for us to act as if the Apache is not able to deal with threats out here I think is to dis- count the abilities of the Apache.’’ Hobson, chairman of the House . military construction subcom- mittee, said he has been told it has cost roughly $700 million to deploy and train the Apache task force of roughly 5,000 troops. The congressional delegation spent an hour at the Army camp next to the air strip at Rinas Air Base, and the rest of the day with ~ U.S. Air Force and NATO officers assigned to cope with the more than 400,000 Kosovar refugees in Albania. “There is a very serious water problem in all these refugee camps,”’ Hobson, after a briefing by refugee aid officials.

        "ocr_text": "As refugees come and go, scores of people are attempting to document for a war- crimes tribunal the ‘horrors that continue - to go on in Kosovo. By Marcia Kunstel KUKES, Albania — Fora week, refugee Filip Kolgjeraj sat every day outside the tent that was his hospital ward, smoking cigarettes and wait- ing to get back the use of hands and feet swollen like a grotesque Popeye caricature. He also talked to two sets - of human rights investigators, > supplying details of the beat- ‘ ings he said Serb police sys- tematically applied with a rub- ber wand as they questioned him for three days outside the _ Kosovo city of Prizren. The 43-year-old Kosovar Albanian is a candidate to be- come a witness at war crimes trials already being planned for when the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia ends. Kolgjeraj, however, has disappeared. Much improved, he walked out of the field hospital of a refugee camp on May 6 and melted into the tens of thou- sands of Kosovars swamping this city. The mobility of the refugee population is one reason pros- ecutions will be tough. The refugees tell their stories and then scatter. No one is keep- . ing track of where they go. Yet scores of people are trying to document the terror that continues to unfold within Yugoslavia’s embattled Koso- _ .vo province. They can only « hope witnesses they identify will rise from the massive shuffle of refugee life. “We're looking for the en- - tire story. We hope that (war - crimes) prosecution is the end result,” said Rufus Dawkins, an investigator with the Orga- nization for Security and Coop- . eration in Europe. His team of 75 monitors is in Albania to support me or- ' sponsibility is documenting ' the myriad reports of human rights violations among the 700,000 ethnic Albanian refu- -gees who have been driven out of the province. Such groups as Medecins --du Monde (Doctors of the World), Physicians for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch and Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) are compiling dossiers. ; The latter group recently finished its own study that as- __serted the Kosovars have been - forcibly deported from Yugo- » slavia under a systematic and pre-planned policy. “The crimes committed qualify as war crimes and crimes against humanity,” the report charged. Investigators from the Hague tribunal on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, the body that will try any charges brought, also have been here to assess potential cases. But the tribunal has been widely criticized for its wan record in prosecuting cases that have arisen since Yugosla- via began violently splitting apart in 1991. Out of 89 people indicted, just one has been convicted and is serving a sentence, ac- cording to the tribunal’s infor- mation service. Another plead- ed guilty but has yet to be sen- tenced, while five found guilty are appealing the verdicts. Perhaps that is why so many humanitarian groups are so intensely trying to preserve a record while events are fresh and people are still around. “We may talk to 25 or 30 people about an incident. We don’t deal with third- or fourth- hand information,” said the OSCE’s Mr. Dawkins, who is from Killeen, Texas. He said OSCE monitors are law-enforcement profes- sionals with extensive training in witness protection and hu- hts. Patrick Brook, head of the mission here, said forcible eviction and theft are the fore- most acts reported, followed by beatings, rapes and killings. “We've got to get the plac- es, the names, dates, time and, if possible, the identification of the units concerned,” he said. Investigators look for mul- tiple, corroborating witnesses to make an overwhelming case. The doctors who sit at the border to treat emergencies and who staff refugee camp clinics are another source of evidence. “We are very aware and conscious to be alert and to record as accurately and pre- cisely as possible what has happened,” said Dr. Jean Fran- cois Viel, medical coordinator of Medecins du Monde. “Who is injured? Do they know the person who beat them? We try to be very organized about this.” Each day, the doctors’ re- ports are sent to the group’s Paris headquarters, which ulti- mately will decide what to for- ward to the tribunal. Sometimes, the doctors find evidence of more compli- cated crimes than shootings or sexual abuse. This past week, for exam- ple, Dr. Viel said the doctors saw signs that Serb authorities had systematically emptied out a major hospital in Prizren. They had the patients as proof. “We could describe the ward cleared by the people we saw coming over the border. It was a very systematic clearing of the hospital. One day, it was the psychiatric ward; another, the infectious ward,” he said. A4-year-old girl, for exam- ple, was brought across to Al- bania having received four days of antibiotic treatment for meningitis. She should have had another eight days but Wanted: Witnesses for the prosecution was forced to leave the hospi- tal and the country, Dr. Viel said. Doctors. nurses and phar- macists from the hospital also were expelled. The United Na- tions High Commissioner for Refugees reported that the ref- ugees said they were plucked from the hospital floor, driven to the border and told to leave. They did not have a chance to notify relatives, much less gather personal possessions, they said. Does clearing out a hospi- tal qualify as a crime against humanity or violation of the Geneva Convention, which are among offenses the Hague tri- bunal is mandated to prose- cute? The lawyers will have to decide. There still remains the question of whether reports from doctors or investigators are hard enough evidence to make a case. “You need the people as witnesses. It will be very diffi- cult to trace them,” said Stafaan DeWolf of Medecins Sans Frontieres. His group is not, for now, forwarding information to the Hague tribunal but has collect- ed its documentation for a broader historic record. It also wants to mobilize international pressure now on the Yugoslav central government to put an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. “We defined this as repeat- ed, systematic abuse, not iso- lated cases,” said Mr. DeWolf. “It was an outcry of our frus- tration as well.” a Marcia Kunstel is Beijing bu- reau chief for Cox Newspapers.

        "ocr_text": "Yugoslav peace deal hits snag Serbs delay signing, later shell refugee-packed Albanian town By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Blace, Macedonia — The 3- day-old Kosovo peace settle- ment hung in the balance after a delegation of senior Yugoslav generals balked Saturday at signing a detailed military with- drawal plan drawn up by NATO. Hours after the meeting broke up, Serb forces shelled a northern Albanian border town crowded with refugees. One person was killed and several were injured. Talks were to resume this morning at the border town of Kumanovo, the site of a NATO air base in Macedonia. Tanjug, the state-run Yugoslav news agency, quoted unnamed sources who said an agreement might be signed today. Meanwhile, NATO jets pounded Serb targets Saturday, angering Russian officials who helped broker the peace deal. NATO officials tried to put a favorable spin on the Yugoslav delegation’s overnight delay in signing the so-called “military- technical agreement,” which the allies regard as one of the most crucial steps before peace can begin to take hold. British Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, a NATO spokesman, said Saturday’s talks had been “constructive” and “positive.” “Each point of the military technical agreement has been discussed word by word, line by. line and sentence by sentence,”. he said. “What we now have is a full understanding on both sides. Clifford said Saturday. “They are going over every page. It is extremely important that this is gotten right, Both sides need to understand what is meant by the words.” After five hours of discussions, members of the Yugoslav delegation left in cars about 5:30 p.m. and returned across the border to use secure telephone lines to consult with officials in Belgrade about a “few points of detail,” NATO officials said, without giving more information. Despite the apparent imminence of a peace deal, NATO kept up the bombing of Yugoslavia on Saturday — an act that allied diplomats said riled Russia so much that Moscow delayed a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the foreign ministers of seven other coun- tries, including Russia. The meeting had been planned for Bonn today. German officials said Albright, Rus- sian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and their counterparts from the six most powerful industrial democracies were now expected to meet Monday to draft a United Nations Security Council resolution approving the peacekeeping mission for Kosovo and put- ting the Serbian province under interna- tional civil administration so that recon- struction can begin. As soon as Yugoslavia inactivates and withdraws air defense radars, missiles and | anti-aircraft artillery from Serbia, and low- flying allied aircraft can see that Serbian forces are actually starting to move out of Kosovo, the alliance will halt the bombing, NATO officials said. But they noted that probably would not happen before this evening, and that Monday was probably the earliest that peacekeepers would be ready to start moving in. “One thing we have learned about Presi- dent Milosevic is that we cannot take his word on anything,” NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said, explaining why the allied attacks continued Saturday — including one air bar- rage just 12 miles from the peace meeting. “We are determined to put Belgrade to the test.” Serbian forces were still engaged Satur- day in “intense” fighting with ethnic Alba- nian rebel soldiers of the Kosovo Liberation Army on the border between Albania and Kosovo, Shea said. NATO forces concen- trated most of the bombing Saturday on Ser- bian units in that area, attacking tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery pieces, mortar positions and fortified troop positions. Russia was insisting that Ivanov would not attend the foreign ministers’ meeting in Bonn until the bombing stopped, according to one diplomat here. Russia apparently also failed to take up an invitation to send an observer to Saturday’s talks on the Macedonia-Yugoslavia border, which pro- ceeded without the Russians, Without revealing specifics contained in the document presented Saturday, NATO officials said it snells out. amone other things, how and when Serbian troops are to leave Kosovo, the routes NATO troops are to use to enter the province, and the NATO troops and equipment to be used in main- taining peace there. It also requires the Yugoslav army to remove the land mines with which they have seeded the province, according to a NATO official. And unlike the military annex to the peace accord that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, this document is a separate military agreement that goes into effect as soon as it is signed. NATO reserved the right to resume bomb- ing if the Serbian forces fail in any way to abide by the agreement. Two sedans carrying the Yugoslav offi- cials arrived here two hours late for their 9 a.m. appointment with the NATO command- ers. The delay came when the Yugoslav del- egation, waiting across the border less than one-half mile away, raised questions with a NATO official about several details of the meeting, including their insistence that the modest roadside cafe NATO had leased for the meeting was not in a sufficiently neutral zone. Worried that this was an attempt to post- pone Saturday’s signing, NATO officials immediately solved the problems “at the ee levels,” alliance spokesman ‘Clifford said, Ignoring the hundreds of reporters wait- ing outside, the Yugoslav officials then entered the restaurant, near the site where railway cars had only recently disgorged some 60,000 dispirited Albanians who had been evicted from Kosovo by Serbian forces. Once inside, the Yugoslav delegation sat on one side of a U-shaped table across from Jackson, who is British, and two top NATO officials, including one American officer. The four brigade commanders from Italy, France, Germany and Great Britain sat behind the men and were joined by at least 20 other NATO officials. The meeting was put together so hastily that the place cards were. blank for the Yugoslav delegation because Belgrade was unable to confirm who would represent the Yugoslav military. As they read the document line by line on the green-covered tables, representatives of the two sides regularly excused themselves to walk out of the restaurant and use secure walkie-talkies to call headquarters. First a Serbian general, then Jackson himself, strode out of the hilltop cafe to speak in pri- vate about matters of interpretation and translations. The occasion marked the most humiliat- ing defeat for Yugoslavia under Milosevic’s leadership. It was 12 years ago in Kosovo that Milosevic gave the speech that pro- pelled him to power, asserting that no one again would harm the Serbs, who had become a minority in the province, Since this is a military agreement, Milosevic is not required to sign the docu- ment, allowing NATO to avoid further nego- tiations with the Yugoslav leader, who was indicted for war crimes last month by an nternationa trib na Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 6, 1999 \f"

NATO offi- cials said Yugoslav military uders Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 7, 1999 had agreed to only six of the 20 conditions in the six-page document, which lays out conditions for the withdrawal of Serb military and police units from Kosovo. “If they do not sign the documents in their entirety, the air campaign continues,” said Maj. Trey Cate, a spokesman for the American delega- tion to the talks. It was not immediately clear whether the Yugoslavs’ reluctance to sign was a Stalling tactic. The snag in the Kumanovo talks came as a sur- prise because the Serbian Parliament had approved the peace settlement Thursday. When the talks on implementing the settlement began Saturday, NATO officials assumed Yugo- slav military commanders would quickly sign the agreement specifying the timetable and routes for the rapid withdrawal of their forces. But shortly after the talks resumed Sunday morning, problems became apparent. Col. Car- mine di Pascale, head of the Italian delegation, reported “all kinds of problems.” Then Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who brokered the peace plan,‘ abruptly canceled a planned trip to discuss it with Chinese leaders in Beijing amid speculation he might be asked to resume his negotiating role. NATO and other allied officials said late Sun- day that the Yugoslav military commanders raised a number of objections to the agreement.

        "ocr_text": "Shelling of village Blaming Serb gunners, border residents worry their nation will be drawn into the fighting. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Jazince, Macedonia — Monday was the latest of many dark days for refugee Xhemil Ismani, who woke up with his bags packed to go home to Kosovo. First, he heard on BBC radio that NATO’s negotiations with Yugoslav gener- als to end the fighting in Kosovo had col- lapsed overnight. Then he discovered that the war had expanded to breach his safe haven in Macedonia, with the shelling of the village of Jazince from the Serb-held province of Kosovo. “T think they have some few last bombs to spend. They know this is a war they are losing. Now they are trying to destroy everything that is Albanian — the houses, the people, the children, everything,” said Ismani, 41, an English teacher who had come to see whether friends had made it safely through the attack. He is living a few miles down the road in Tetovo, where a family has given him refuge. The assault on Macedonia was a rarity. Yugoslavia’s Serb-controlled military forces have repeatedly attacked positions next door in Albania where the rebel Kos- ovo Liberation Army is quartered. But Yugoslavia has tried not to fray its rela- tions with Macedonia, which has absorbed nearly a quarter-million of Kosovo’s eth- nic Albanian refugees. Whether the attack was an outburst by rogue Serb soldiers or a calculated mes- sage related to the collapse of peace talks, the two events happened almost simulta- neously early Monday. Ismani was among a score or more of people drawn to Jazince, a normally sub- dued rural village, Monday afternoon to gawk at the holes in roofs, shrapnel- pocked walls and two-foot-wide dents in the earth made by the ordnance that Macedonian police believe was fired from a Serb military outpost just over the bor- der. No injuries were reported, though several houses were hit. Ismani had hoped the talks would make it safe for him to go home to the Kosovo town of Urosevac within days. He was frustrated at seeing his return aborted. Macedonian villagers in Jazince, mean- while, were fretting that they might have to become refugees, too. “Tf I had a chance, I would find a safer place for my children,” said Mustafa Abdiseljam, 56, whose red tile roof was disfigured by a blackened hole about a yard in diameter. Fortunately for his fam- ily of 12, the explosive blew into an unoc- cupied second-floor sitting room. He believes the failure of the talks was related to the attack on his village, largely populated by ethnic Albanians. It is a simple place where horses draw hay carts down narrow brick streets and many peo- ple make do without indoor plumbing. “There was a demand to stop the war in Kosovo. The next thing we know, Macedo- nian villages are being bombed,” said Abdiseljam, who showed journalists the sitting room where wooden roof beams had crashed onto floor cushions. Intricate needle-point renditions of flower bouquets were intact on the walls. He refused to say where his family would sleep Monday night. “I’m afraid Serb forces will come here and massacre my family,” he said. Other villagers and refugees said this is just one more example of how the Serb- dominated Yugoslav leadership and widens fears Jazince, Macedonia, villager Mus- tafa Abdiseljam stands beneath his damaged roof after shells flew across the bor- der from Kos- ovo early on Monday. For- tunately for his family of 12, the attack hit an unoccupied second-floor sitting room. “I'm afraid Serb forces will come here and massacre my family,” he said. JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Stafy Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic can never be trusted. They voiced doubts that Yugoslavia would live up to any agreement and fears that Macedonia could be drawn into fighting. “We think the Serbs are lying. Even if they sign a [peace] document, they will do the same things,” said Enver Tusha, whose family has been staying in a house next door to Abdiseljam’s. His family ran outside when the first explosion hit, and Tusha said he saw the explosives arrive in a low arc from the direction of the Yugo- slav military outpost. Besim Nesimi, commander of the bor- der police in Jazince, said all evidence points to the Serbs launching the attack, but he refused to detail the evidence.

        "ocr_text": "Bombing may end today if pullout As diplomats agree on a U.N. resolution, NATO and Serb commanders discuss the withdrawal. By Joseph Albright and Bob Deans Palm Beach Post Staff Writers KUMANOVO, Macedonia — An end to bombing in Kosovo got closer Tuesday as diplomats in Germany agreed to the language of a U.N. Security Council reso- lution mapping out the road to peace. Afterward, senior NATO and Yugoslav commanders resumed talks late Tuesday on a Serb pull- out from Kosovo, hours after British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson led the NATO delegation into a large camouflaged tent at a NATO base on this border out- post, where they sat down with senior Yugoslav commanders. As momentum for peace mounted, NATO was preparing to pause its 11-week bombing campaign as soon as Serb forces begin to withdraw. That could happen as early as today, de- pending on the outcome of the military talks. About 17,000 NATO troops were poised to pour into Kosovo on short notice as the lead ele- ments to a larger peacekeeping force. Pentagon spokesman Ken- neth Bacon said Serb vehicles had begun to assemble, appar- b ently in preparation for a pullout. “There are a number of indi- cations that the Serbs plan: to withdraw,” Bacon told Pentagon reporters, citing “signs that they are mobilizing vehicles and other means to transport people out.” President Clinton cautiously hailed the developments, but in- sisted that NATO airstrikes | would continue until the alliance could verify through aerial ob- servation that Serb forces were beginning to withdraw along one or more of three specific routes leading out Searching of Kosovo. BUS. looks for T he best way to apolo- flurry of ac- gize to China for embassy bomb- ay was ing. STORY, 9A triggered ——______. by agree- ment over the language on a U.N. Security Council resolution reached among the United States, Russia and six other major powers — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — earlier Tuesday in Cologne, Germany. The Security Council re viewed the resolution and was expected to approve it as early.as today, or as soon as NATO bombing ends. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday's agree ment cleared ie way for fant Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 9, tivity Tues) A}, talks aimed at nailing down the details under which Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugosla- via, would begin pulling out troops from Kosovo. “Unless he is totally tone deaf, he should be getting the message that it:is time to withdraw,” Al- brights ‘said at a news conference in Cologne. “The regime in Bel- grade should stop shilly-shallying around.” Draft satisfies a key demand The draft U.N. resolution sat- isfies one of NATO’s key de- mands by calling for the complete withdrawal of Yugoslav troops and Serb police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo. International peacekeepers will enter the province and safeguard the re- be of hundreds of thousands of nic Albanian refugees who lh ¥é fred the province. The reso- jalso says that all countries slipuld cooperate with the U.N. war ‘erimes tribunal, which has inplicted Milosevic. - The resolution was meant to build on and codify a peace aprecnient accepted Thursday by ilosevic after it was presented to him in Belgrade by the Euro- pean Union's envoy to the Bal- kans, Finnish President Martti tisaari and by Russia’s Balkans envoy Victor Chernomyrdin. ' The resolution approved Thesday by the top diplomats from the so-called Group of Eight includes the Ahtisaari- Chernomyrdin accord as an an- nex. That enabled the United States and Russia to agree to lan- guage that doesn’t specify that the peacekeeping force would be led by NATO — language Mos- cow opposed. The annex, howev- er, specifies that the security force would have “essential NATO participation” and would operate under “unified control and command.” That means the peacekeeping force will be a NATO operation, Albright said. “We got what we came for,” she said. “We have made very clear that this has a NATO core and that NATO will be the mili- tary leader.” Said Albright, “Obviously, there will be a NATO commander .. whatever other forces come in will then be integrated with that.” Her Russian counterpart, for- eign minister Igor Ivanov, said Moscow was not fully on board with the composition of the force or the circumstances under which Russian troops might be a part of it. “Any agreement is a compro- mise,” said Ivanov. “The resolu- tion settles the principles, the foundations. And we have now to work out the format and the mandate, which are tied to this international presence for securi- ty.” Albright dispatched her dep- uty, Strobe Talbott, to Moscow for immediate talks today aimed at resolving that. Clinton said that Russian troops, should they participate in the peacekeeping force, would not be commanded by NATO. “T don’t expect that to hap- pen,” said Clinton, shortly after a 15-minute telephone call to Rus- sian President Boris Yeltsin. “But I do expect that there will be an acceptable level of coordination, the way we worked it out in Bosnia.” Russia has several hundred troops participating in the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, which borders Kosovo. Formally, the Russian troops don’t report up the NATO chain of command. Instead, the Rus- sians operate in a sector con- trolled by U.S. forces, and the Russians and Americans work in close cooperation there. Despite the movement to- ward peace, NATO pressed its airstrikes into the early hours of this morning after sharply ratch- eting up attacks Monday night and early Tuesday. Bacon said that NATO was prepared to pause the air cam- paign promptly, once the alliance verifies through aerial observa- tion that Serb forces have begun pulling out. After that happens, Bacon said, the North Atlantic Council, NATO's political arm, would re- view the details of the withdrawal and vote on whether to direct Secretary-General Javier Solana to order a pause in the bombing. Simultaneously, Solana would order that the Kosovo peace- keeping force, or KFOR, begin moving into the province from neighboring Macedonia. 17,000 NATO troops ready As of Tuesday, there were roughly 17,000 NATO forces — chiefly British and French — in Macedonia, prepared to move out on short notice. Those forces would make up the vanguard of what would eventually be a 48,000 troop force, 7,000 of which would be Ameri- cans. The first U.S. forces to enter Kosovo would be 1,900 Marines from the 26th Marine Expedi- tionary Unit, which was afloat in the Aegean Sea Tuesday, and 1,700 Army troops in Albania, Bacon said. The Army forces would in- clude light infantry from the 82nd Airborne Division, a half dozen Apache attack helicopters and a contingent of light armored vehi- cles and tanks from the Ist Ar- mored Division. Those forces would travel by land and air from Albania to neighboring Macedonia before marrying up with the Marines to deploy to Kosovo, Bacon said. The Marines are standing by to unload in Greece and travel by land to Macedonia. 1999 \f"

Beginning a withdrawal ia Kosovo will trigger a stop to NATO’s bombing campaign. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Kumanovo, Macedonia — After with- standing 77 days of high-tech bombing by the world’s most powerful military alliance, Yugoslavia signed a pact Wednesday clear: ing the way for Serb forces to begin with- drawing from war-ravaged Kosovo. Serb troops could begin withdrawing from Kosovo as soon as today, and the NATO bombing could be suspended shortly afterward. Thousands of alliance peace- keepers are prepared to cross the border to begin occupying Kosovo. “The war has ended,” Yugoslav Col. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic told reporters in Macedonia, after five days of on-again, off- again talks between Yugoslav and NATO military leaders in a camouflaged tent at this French military base near the Kosovo border. NATO ambassadors quickly approved the deal at a late-night meeting in Brussels, Belgium, Secretary-General Javier Solana said, The alliance will suspend the bombing as soon as Yugoslav troops begin to with- draw, he said, AND IN LIVING: Buyer’s Edge - Weekend | at Home President Clinton remained cautious, calling the agreement “another important step toward achieving our objectives in Kosovo.” Speaking in Bethesda, Md., he also warned NATO will “watch carefully” to make sure the forces leave Kosovo peace- fully according to the agreed timetable. “If the Serbs live up to what they have signed, this will end the killing and begin the peace,” U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters. The United Nations Security Council is expected to consider a resolution authoriz- ing the NATO incursion within the next day.

Within three days of the first troop movement into Kosovo, con- voys of relief workers are to fol- low in the armed peackeepers’ tracks, hauling thousands of tons of ready-to-eat meals for the almost half-million ethnic Koso- var Albanians still subsisting inside Kosovo. The more than 800,000 Kosovar exiles who have taken refuge in Albania, Macedonia and else- where were expected to begin fil- tering back within hours or days, despite a last-minute “education” campaign by the United Nations refugee agency aimed at postpon- ing their return until conditions in Kosovo are safer. Jackson alerted British journal- ists several days ago that mem- bers of the British Airborne Engi- neers regiment and other British paratroopers are likely to enter Kosovo within the first 12 hours of a peace deal. Their first job will be to clear mines and obstacles from a Yugo- slav bridge and tunnel complex near the town of Kacanik, about 15 miles inside the Kosovo border along the main road to Pristina. Right behind them, thousands of Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit also were ready to move forward in helicop- ters, trucks and armored personnel carriers into preas- signed peacekeeping positions inside Kosovo. But the vague wording of Jack- son’s comments after the talks left open the possibility that the NATO entry into Kosovo will pro- ceed at a somewhat slower pace than the alliance first envisioned. The military-to-military agree- ment, signed Wednesday after 40 hours of excruciating talks over five days, signals an impending end to Europe’s worst episode of ethnic repression in half a century. “It is tragic that intransigence has made it necessary for the international community to resort to air strikes in order to reach a settlement,” said Jackson as he announced NATO had finally obtained the signatures of two Yugoslav generals on a document promising prompt withdrawal from Kosovo. “However, NATO’s resolve in conducting a sustained air cam- paign has finally achieved this agreement,” he said. The Yugoslav delegate who stood facing jqurnalists on this temporary NATO airbase man- aged to put forward an air of Steadfast bluster after signing what amounted to near-total capitulation. “The agreement on peace means that the war ended,” said Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 10, Marjanovic, the deputy chief of the Yugoslav Army general staff. “Tt also means that the policy of peace prevailed, the policy of peace which is conducted by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and President [Slobodan] Milosevic.” Once NATO’s civilian chief has confirmed the “initial” Yugoslav withdrawal, “then he will direct suspension of the air strikes,” Jackson said. Left deliberately vague in Jack- son’s announcement was the exact timing of the NATO troops’ advance into Kosovo, and whether the alliance can begin pacifying the war-ravaged province while Yugoslav troops are still making their way to the border. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the main task lay in returning the refugees home. The British are expected to lead the way for NATO’s peacekeeping force, securing the high ground along a main roadway from Mace- donia into southern Kosovo. “There is now a huge job to be done as the Serb forces go out, the international forces go in and we get the refugees home. We have made a pledge to the refugees that they will go home and we will deliver on that,” Blair said. Delnie Vehopi, 24, who left part of his family in Kosovo, said “it’s not that easy to believe it.” 1999 (Continued) \f"

After the British engineers have cleared mines and _ barricades from the main road into the pro- vincial capital, Pristina, the ini- tial column of Western peace-' keepers is likely to surge across the border on Sunday. That first NATO occupation column may be 1,000 vehicles long. That, at least, is the scenario provided late Thursday by NATO liaison officers to Canadian journalists. Jackson warned KLA com- manders that it would be “foolish in the extreme” to fire on with- drawing Serbs or take other ac- tions that would impede their de- parture from Kosovo. Jackson said retreating Yugo- slav forces “are being coopera- tive” in providing NATO officers maps showing the locations of minefields and booby traps. And he said he had received a report that Yugoslav experts were re- moving explosives from a bridge and tunnel complex at Kacanic, on the road to Pristina, which had been designed to block any north- ward invasion through Kosovo. U.S. muscle Whenever the first column of peacekeepers moves forward, the United States will be providing only about 15 percent of the troops — but most of the combat punch.

        "ocr_text": "FEARING THE FUTURE Refugees, soldiers apprehensive about days to come in Kosovo By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS - Skopje, Macedonia — The radio announcer was saying that refugees like Ismet Blakgori will be going home to Kosovo soon. But Blakgori, who was stretched out on a blanket with his grandbaby by his tent on Thursday, was not so sure. “On the news they said we would be going home soon, but we don’t trust it,” said the S0- year-old ethnic Albanian. “We think this time might be different, but we still don’t trust it.” On another outskirt of town, paratroops of America’s elite 82nd Airborne Division were idling outside their own hot tents at Camp Able Sentry on Thursday. And like Blakgori and his fel- low refugees at the Stenkovec camp, many of them were less than euphoric over the deal NATO finally clinched with Yugo- slavia on Wednesday night to stop the latest of the ugly Balkan conflicts. Some of the troops openly voiced skepticism about what lies ahead as they try to secure Kos- ovo so families like the Blakgoris can return safely, “T am not too happy, to tell you the truth,” said Sgt. John New- land, 27, of Fayetteville, N.C, Sit- ting among a group who had shed their flak jackets in favor of brown T-shirts and camouflage pants, he said the troops of the 82nd Airborne Division didn’t sign up for service as the world’s policemen. “It’s like Bosnia,” he said. “They make a plan to get out, but it is not possible to get out because without you the fighting is going to start all over again.” Clearly, some Kosovo Albanian refugees and some newly arrived U.S. soldiers are enthusiastic about how the coming weeks will unfold. But other people in both camps spoke with hesitation and worry, if not outright pessimism. At another tent in the Stenk- ovec refugee camp, Naile and Bahnie Zhieqi, who married brothers now working in Italy, enjoy a vastly better situation than the thousands of women whose husbands were separated from them and now are missing. But they are still fearful about what comes next. A complication is that their homes in Podjevo were burned down. “We don’t have our husbands. We don't have our houses. How will we survive?” said Naile Zhie- qi, 31, who has three children. At Camp Able Sentry, Spec. Christopher Miller, 21, of Elizabe- thton, Tenn., wasn’t worried about survival, but he did express concerns. He said American sol- diers were never trained for this kind of duty. “Tt will be a trying experience,” said Miller. “Previously when one of us saw a Serb soldier, we could regard him as an enemy contact. Now we have to wonder whether it is just a soldier who has gotten lost.” The physical hazards of Kosovo were troubling to both refugees and troops. “I don’t hope to be back this year, because they destroyed everything. We don’t have a home anymore. We don’t have a place to sleep,” said Haxhi Ibrahimi, 52, of Pushkosova, a village out- side of the Kosovo capital, Pristina. Ibrahimi spoke of the mines both refugees and military think are planted around Kosovo. He also feared the possibility of booby traps left in the homes, barns or wells of ethnic Albanians. To the military, such dangers are simply a way of life. What raises more concern is how effec- tively the peacekeeper troops will be able to defend themselves. “It is pretty stupid we are com- ing down here,” said Spc. Nathan Poppenga, 20, of Centerville, $.D. “We train for hostile situations. And when we get deployed, we spend all our time peacekeeping. Basically, we have to wait for them to shoot. By then it may be too late.” Back at the Blakgori tent, a cavernous structure housing 13 people, Ismet’s brother Idriz stayed tuned to the radio. He also talked about the fami- ly’s two years of bad experiences that he said began after another brother was beaten by Serbian police and died. He had heard that everything was stolen from his home, Nonetheless, said his brother, Ismet, “If the NATO troops are there and clear the mines, then we will go. It’s better in my house, even if I have nothing, than it is here,” PATHS TO PEACE: A CLOSER LOOK Siting rs ZONE 3 ete Podujevo .

By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE ABLE SENTRY BASE, Macedo- nia — The international peace- keeping operation in Kosovo * finally got underway today, as » British and French forces took - off to begin clearing the way fora * force that will eventually build to _ 60,000. . ‘The NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) — led by six American - Apache attack helicopters — * went ahead despite Russian * troops’ surprising arrival in the » provincial capital Pristina hours - earlier. . “Poacelebratory crowd of thou- ‘ sands of jubilant ethnic Serbs, - troop transports and tanks carry- » ing hundreds of Russian troops from SFOR in Bosnia paraded through downtown Pristina, ‘reassuring the war-ravaged prov- '- ince’s ethnic Serb population . that they would be secure during coe NATO peacekeeping opera- ‘tion. Earlier in the day, Russian - Prime Minister Igor Ivanov gave - assurances to the Clinton White aeeee 8404 eo House that the convoy of some 50 vehicles, which left their peace- keeping mission in Bosnia unex- pectedly to head into Yugoslavia — but not yet into Kosovo — would not enter the southern Serb province before NATO did. Interviewed on CNN about an hour after their entry, Ivanov said the troops had arrived “unfortunately” and that they had been ordered to leave Koso- vo. “The reasons for this are being determined. They have been ordered to leave Kosovo immedi- ately and to await further orders,” Ivanov said. Though clearly embarrassing on a diplomatic level, the move- ment by the Russian troops — traditional allies of the Serbs — did not immediately appear to force any change in NATO’s schedule for British and French troops waiting in Macedonia on Kosovo’s southern border. A column of 18 helicopters, including 12 troop-carrying Chi- nooks, took off from this make- shift airbase near the Kosovo border just before daybreak. Their first task, according to NATO commanders, will be to clear a 20-killometer path north into war-ravaged Kosovo prov- ince of landmines and other explosives so that the remaining peacekeepers and humanitarian aid groups can follow. The plans to enter Kosovo early today never seemed to be in jeoprady, despite the earlier arrival of Russian troops in Pris- tina. German television monitored from Skopje showed thousands of Kosovar Serbs cheering in the streets and waving the Yugoslav flag and shouting, “Russia! Rus- sia!” in anticipation of the arrival of the Russian troops. The ethnic Serbs also burned an | American flag to show their dis- satisfaction with the NATO alli- ance. In Washington, officials said they had been reassured by Rus- sia that its troops would not be deployed in Kosovo ahead of the international peacekeeping force, known as KFOR. Upon arriving in Macedonia to visit Kosovar refugees and NATO troops, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was sur- prised when she learned of the Russian troop movements. She ordered Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had just left Moscow, to return to try and revive his talks with Russian counterparts about the status of a force of up to 10,000 Russian troops within the 50,000-strong peacekeeping force that is essen- tially run by NATO.

        "ocr_text": "First look finds hiding Kosovars, burning houses en ae CAMP ABLE SENTRY, Macedonia — It was just after daybreak Saturday, and from the cockpit of his Apache heli- copter, U.S. Army Capt. Vincent Torza could see what looked like “shanty- towns” hidden deep in the wooded mountains of Kosovo. On another pass through these crag- gy crests near the border, Torza could see the stillsmoldering ruins of a Koso- var village. “It seemed like the inside of the houses had been gone through and wrecked,” said Torza, 29, of Hartford, Conn, It was the very first glimpse that a member of the soon-to-be 50,000 inter- national peacekeepers has had of the carnage that Yugoslav forces, Serb po- lice and paramilitary gangs have wrought in Kosovo province during the past 11 weeks as NATO warplanes bombed Yugoslavia. Torza and his wingman, Chief War- rant Officer James Risler, 32, of River Falls, Wis,, are expected to be followed into Kosovo today by the first of the American troops. The 26th Marine Ex- peditionary Unit and members of the 82nd Airborne — the guard troops for the Apache helicopters — spent most of Saturday awaiting those orders. A good many could be seen standing in line for their laundry. Or polishing their rifles. Or enjoying long lunches in the chow hall inside this NATO support base near the Skopje airport. Or sitting under trees, trying to escape the sun, Torza’s day was a little different. Ashe skimmed along above the main highway toward Pristina, he found first- hand evidence that Serb forces are with- drawing as British and French troops push north along the main highway to the provincial capital Pristina, “They weren't smiling and waving at us, but they were definitely complying,” said Torza, who flew one of the six Apaches NATO sent in to fly shotgun for British infantry units that NATO had as- signed to make the first push into Koso- vo. The other six Apaches accompanied the French troops, Torza didn't fully realize it at the time, but his sighting of “shantytowns” in the mountains may help resolve a nagging question of the Kosovo crisis: Whatever happened to hundreds of thousands of allegedly “missing” Kosovar refugees still inside the province? At least some of them inhabit the mountaintop “shantytowns” in the woods that Torza described after seeing clustered “shanties” made of plastic and corrugated metal “Later in the day, we saw numerous small children and families coming out of the woods and waving to us as we were flying over them,” Torza said. He was also witness to some of the havoc Serb forces are wreaking as they pull out of Kosovo. Not long after dawn, Torza noticed a plume of black smoke rising from a set- tlement in the mountains about 10 miles southwest of the Kosovo town of Urose- vac. The town was so small it had no name on Torza’s maps, “Initially, we heard a report on the radio of aire in that village,” Torza said. “Then we heard a report of possible mortar or artillery fire being launched.” As the helicopter first skimmed over the village, Torza and Risler didn't see anything. Then they saw smoke, and discovered five houses afire, They at least saw 30 troops and a couple of armored personnel carriers in side the village, not far from the growing flames of houses set fire not more than a halt-hour before their arrival, Risler said. “We were kind of shocked to see that,” he said, Palm Beach Post - June 13, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "WAR’S EMOTIONAL AFTERMATH Forgive, forget terror? Never, Albanians declare By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Skopje, Macedonia — Serbs are load- ing up their families and fleeing Kosovo in fear of facing their old neighbors, the Kosovar Albanians, who are about to return from camps in Macedonia wrapped in righteous anger and the road dust of NATO tanks. The Serbs may be wise to leave. The Balkan ethnic pendulum is beginning its inevitable backward swing. The ethnic Albanians of Kosovo are in no mood to be forgiving, not after the weeks and months of terror they passed, not after the degrading, violent treatment $0 many say they suffered, or after losses like grandfathers shot and babies dying on the tear-stained roadways of exile. “Our neighbors are Serbian police and paramilitary,” said Isof Ibrahimi, 20, speaking of his village near Pristina, the provincial capital of Kosovo, “They came to us masked, but we know their names. We know where they live.” The [brahimis are in no hurry to leave their tent camp and get home to what they believe is only a shell of a house, and to the memories of the burning bod- ies they said they saw from the window of the train that took them away. Whenever they do get back, they don’t want those Serb neighbors to be in town. “They did very bad things. There is no place for them anymore,” said Ibrahimi. “In our neighborhood, no. Maybe in another place.” The Albanians and Serbs are people with different languages, different cus- toms, generally different religions. Their bitter rivalry over Kosovo goes back a long way, both groups insist. Killings and rapes have haunted fami- lies on both sides of this ethnic divide for centuries, More recently, the Kosovo Lib- eration Army hardly had been fighting a small-scale battle for independence before the Serb hammer came down. That is when today’s ethnic Albanians became the latest victims in this long- playing conflict. The campaign began several days before NATO bombs started to fall on Yugoslavia and continued in an erratic, inexplicable pattern that sent tens of thousand of refugees flooding out of the country one day, then none the next. Of 1.8 million ethnic Albanians — who made up 90 percent of Kosovo’s population — at least 800,000 now are refugees and an estimated 500,00 are internally displaced. Early stories of simple expulsion gave way to tales of terror. Then satellite photos showed what seemed to be fresh mass graves, and air reconnaissance films documented scores of torched villages. The most eloquent images were the distraught faces and haggard bodies of the refugees them- selves as they crossed the borders of Kosovo into Macedonia and Albania. Many had been on the run for days or weeks, living in mountains on what they carried or could scavenge from houses they raided under cover of darkness. They saw their homes destroyed by Serb grenades, their cattle slaughtered and even their children put to death. How can Hodit Aslemi forget the sight of a Serb shooting his son, not 15 feet from where the 59-year-old sat in the tractor that would carry the survivors of his family to safety? How will Ferhat Halimi look at kis hand and fail to remember the last touch of his daughter-in-law, who ran to;him for help when a Serb soldier ordered her down from her tractor cart, everyone assumed to be raped? She was clutching” Halimi’s hand when the angry soldier ran a line of bullets down her spine. How will Ahmed Byqmeti be able to face going home? At the urging of his eld- erly parents, he left them, his brother and sister-in-law at home — and now he has had no word for two months. He expects the worst, blames himself for surviving. “There is little hope,” he said. “I am sorry. ” How will the children of Haqif and Ilmija Alili grow up? The oldest is 7, the baby 4 months, so none will remember much about the harrowing four-day jour- ney out of Kosovo. They won't remember much of the harsh life in a tent, where Mrs. Alili, 27, bemoans her inability to keep her children clean or clear up her baby’s vivid heat rash. They never will know their father’s cousin who was killed by Serbs, but surely they will hear about him. And not for a long time are these Kosovar Alba- nian children likely to rub shoulders with any Serbs — not, said their mother, if she can help it. { 4 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 13, 1999 \f"

The troops were among NATO’s first wave. Control of Pristina unclear By Marcia Kunstel Palm Beach Post Staff Writer PRISTINA, Yugoslavia — What began as NATO’s exuberant liberation of Kosovo Sat- urday turned into a dangerously edgy coex- istence here with Russian troops and Serb forces. While NATO and Russian generals were negotiating at the city airport to clarify com- mand control of Pristina, automatic weapons fire periodically erupted around the city, and burning buildings still smoldered both in this provincial capital and its outskirts. NATO clearly was not in charge. Not only had the nearly 300 Russian troops dug in Sat- urday night at the airport NATO planned to take as its own headquarters, but armed Yu- goslav soldiers and Serb police were making conspicuous patrols around Pristina’s streets. President Bill Clinton and Russian Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin were expected to tackle the “ Yeltsin authorized early entry of troops into Kosovo 14A “ Those who thought an air war couldn't succeed were wrong IN OPINION question personally in a telephone conversa- tion today, in hopes they can make more progress than envoys who once again on Sat- urday failed to resolve the issue of exactly what Russia’s peacekeeping role should be. At least 100 additional Russian troops were expected to move into Kosovo soon from nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to the Associated Press. Serb forces are not required to depart this central sector of Kosovo for several days yet, Palm Beach Post - June 13, 1999 >  Violence will not be tolerated, ee ee Prec ‘ but any NATO troops expecting to dominate this territory were sorely disappointed. Indeed, the juxtaposition of NATO and Yugoslav forces was jarring.. The incoming NATO convoy met Serb tanks and trucks moving in the opposite direction — apparently on their way out of Kosovo,— and the Serb soldiers gleefully smiled and flashed their three-fingered “V” for victory sign. At one intersection, a NATO tank was the staunch sentry on one corner, while a Serb tank was an equally solid presence on an- other. Small Serb military convoys appeared to be leaving in accor- dance with the Military-Technical Agreement (MTA) under which Yugoslavia agreed to pull all its forces out of Kosovo within 11 days. U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO com- mander, has since said that the Serb pullout may take 3-4 weeks. FRENCH SECTOR -s Mitrovica ITALIAN == SECTOR __-- ~ BRITIS at ~SE In Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called the first neeting between British and aussian forces at Pristina’s air- ort “cordial.” Details to be worked out “It’s a coordinated occupation right now and the final details are going to be worked out,” Shelton old reporters, adding that there would be 800 NATO troops in the area by nightfall. British Lt. Gen. Sir Michael lackson, the NATO commander whose troops had been talking for jays of capturing the Pristina iirport on their first day in the srovinee, did give a statesman’s ‘esponse to the situation upon irrival here Saturday. “I welcome here the Russian R} commander,” Jackson said, referring to the name of the nternational peacekeepers here sovo Force. “We are setting > the command structure ary to oversee the entire H CTOR N_Y. Whether referring to Pristi- na’s gun-happy Serbs, or merely issuing a general warning, Jack- son emphasized that KFOR will vigorously carry out terms of the agreement Yugoslavia’s military leaders signed. “Vivlence or non-compliance will not be tolerated from which- ever quarter it may come,” Jack- son said. But many Serbs_ believe NATO forces will be unwilling or unable to save them from revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians, and see Russian troops as their pro- tectors. Both NATO and American officials were stunned when a convoy of Russian soldiers moved into Kosovo's capital about 1 a.m. Saturday and were met by thou- sands of cheering Serbs. Russian Foreign Minister Ig- or Ivanov went on CNN and said iT O OT) NAC 3 @ = NATO warns Times News Service “unfortunately” from Bosnia and had been ordered to leave Koso- vo.

President Yeltsin’s top for- eign affairs aide, Sergei Prikhod- ko, said on Saturday that Yeltsin himself had given the deploy- ment order, but left the timing of the move up to the Russian mili- tary. Russia has been expected to take part in the peacekeeping force, but has been unsuccessful in negotiations with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to secure control of a sector of its own — alongside allies Italy, Germany, France and Great Brit- ain.

The tension here was a pal- pable presence Saturday. Serb families were on the roads de parting the province altogether or moving from isolated villages to the protection of numbers in this city with a large Serb population. They and their possessions were stuffed in cars and trucks and the same kind of tractor wagons that ethnic Albanians used to flee Kosovo under the rigorous Serb ethnic cleansing campaign that finally appeared to be ending with the signing of the military document. Now it be- came the Serbs’ turn to run. A plump Serb woman walking in the cool rain exemplified the intense animosity dividing the ethnic communities here. She began vile swearing when she happened upon two carloads of Western journalists sitting at the side of a street entering Pristina, trying to fix one of their vehicles. “Go out from here. Go away,” she said. “Tonight we will mas- sacre the Albanians.” The day started on a dramati- cally different note for the hun- dreds of tanks and trucks and ar- mored carriers that convoyed from Camp Able Sentry outside Skopje, Macedonia, north across the border into Kosovo for the first time Saturday. Ethnic Albanian refugees cheered their departure from Macedonia, and they proceeded largely uneventfully across the border and into Kosovo. The British vanguard of para- troopers and Nepalese Ghurka Rifles had little trouble clearing the road of explosives for the fol- lowing troops, but they strung boundary strings on both sides of the pavement to indicate the lim- ited area known to be safe to walk or drive. And French tanks were halted by a minefield along the Yugoslav-Macedonian border.

Some Americans — including liaison and mine clearing per- sonnel — and about 200 Germans crossed the border, too, and the Italians were to enter Kosovo lat- er Saturday. A larger contingent of the expected 8,500 Germans were to march into Kosovo from Albania today, and U.S. Marines were to also move in as early as today. Once over the border, the convoy passed a virtually depop- ulated land for at least 12 miles. Wrecked cars and ransacked roadside restaurants gave way to entire villages where not a person nor an intact window could be seen. Homes and apartments had big black squares where windows should have been reflecting the bright sunlight. Roses bloomed outside emp- ty, often fire-scarred homes, add- ing gentle color to the eerily silent scenery. At some apartments, a few items of clothing still hung on balcony wash lines, testimony to the inhabitants’ hasty departure. The first small group of wav- ing people appeared just beyond the town of Kacanik, but then more nearly abandoned villages filled the otherwise bucolic countryside where lavender waved a blueish tint to the fields and Queen Anne’s lace made dots of white. An unseemly blend The flowers and greenery of trees spreading over mountain- sides were an unseemly blend both with the destruction of the buildings — nearly every gas sta- tion and restaurant was damaged and empty — and the presence of so many troops stationed to se- cure the countryside. NATO troops lolled in a soc- cer field, stretched out on the sides of roads, stripped to the waist to wash at an abandoned gas station and threw up tents ata non-working brick factory. One farmer was seen haying in his field. When more people did begin to appear, they were an adoring audience for the passing troops. On the outskirts o OSE about 100 ethnic Albanians flocked to the roadsides and cheered the incoming troops. They waved flower bouquets and shouted “NATO! NATO!” and many reached onto the road ta ne the slower moving vehi- cles. At one roadside collection oi smiling Kosovars, 31-year-old Ilaz Noradimi told how his family had moved from place to place three times after their own home was burned down. He was elated to see the troops arrive in this cool- ing and clouding up afternoon. “We knew they were coming. We saw the helicopters,” he said. “This is the first time we have been outside.” He and others said Serb troops continued burning homes even on Saturday, making a last statement before they left the re- gion. Noradimi, 34, said the ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo have been “in a bad state” for more than a decade, and now in the faces of the passing NATO sol- diers, in the tanks and guns and their support for Kosovar Alba- nians, he saw the light of hope. “This is the first day we feel free,” he said.

        "ocr_text": " Troops face resistance Barricades a j.{ hamper effort By Marcia Kunstel Palm Beach Post Staff Writer PRISTINA, Yugoslavia — Keeping the peace in Kosovo got harder and more dan- gerous for NATO troops Sunday. British soldiers shot and killed a civilian Serb who fired on them here in the provincial capital, and German troops in the second city of Prizren killed a sniper after several conten- tious standoffs with Yugoslav military, NATO finally retreated from its effort to set up headquarters at the crucial Pristina airport after a Russian contingent that is supposed to be part of the Kosovo Force, or KFOR, raised a day-long barricade to keep the NATO troops out. The NATO-Russia imbroglio carries weighty long-term consequences — radio Belgrade today suggested it signaled the start of anew Cold War — but the killing of an armed Serb man who fired on NATO troops caused an immediate uproar, The man, reported to be a reserve po- liceman, came up to a British patrol and hs gan firing with a pistol.

HNATO forces kill. two Serb snipers “They followed the rules of engagement,” he said, since they were shooting in self-defense. Another sign of the growing tension was a request from Serb journalists that NATO supply armed guards to escort them home to Belgrade, out of fear trigger-happy allied troops or armed Kosovar Albanians may ‘shoot at them. More strain came as news ‘circulated about three bodies ‘found in northern Prizren Sun- ‘day, said Capt. Gareth Light of the ‘Irish Guards. “We assessed it to be a re- prisal attack,” he said, suggesting that the likely assailants were members of the Kosovo Libera- tion Army, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla group that mounted the fight for Kosovo independence from Yugoslavia. Two of the dead were Yugoslav army troops. A face-off with Serb forces The first of 5,000 German NATO troops — whose sector includes Prizren, the province’s second-largest city — also ran into resistance Sunday. The first incident occurred when they ordered Serb troops at the border with Albania to begin withdrawing. The Germans set a halfhour deadline, which the Serb-led Yugoslav troops unsuc- cessfully tried to extend to six hours. The border units did leave as demanded, but when German forces got into the city they faced off against a lineup of Serb para- military forces trying to approach the city. *-<The two sides faced each other a few feet apart while a German commander talked to a Serb who was wore a black ban- dana around his head. the cheers “of a nearby @ Russian unit blocks NATO move into airport JIM HOLLANDER /Reuters U.S. Marine Sgt.

Helmut Harff said. Sniper killed; soldier wounded Later Sunday, a Serb military sniper was shot dead after firing into the air and threatening ethnic Albanians. A German soldier also was reported wounded in the ex- change of gunfire.

There were no other immediate details. About 100 to 150 U.S. Army soldiers in armored _ vehicles crossed into Kosovo at Blace, Macedonia, in the first significant U.S. force to join 5,000 NATO peacekeepers already in the province. Yugoslav military joins In Pristina, the Russians who lined up against NATO did not retreat when tested. The Russian troops who sud- denly appeared here before day- break Saturday continued block. ading the airport with an armored personnel carrier and armed troops, with Yugoslav military joining them. First the Russians turned back a French convoy Sunday morning. “Our mission was to deploy at the fuel bulk depot at the Pristina airport,” said the French officer leading the convoy, who refused to identify himself. “When we ar- rived half an hour ago, we saw Russians and Serbians and they said we cannot enter.” Neither the Russians nor the Serbs would talk to correspon- dents about why they were re- fusing to let NATO forces enter the airport they had been plan- ning to use as KFOR headquar- ters. “We were ordered to do it,” said one burly Russian officer. Sunday afternoon, members of a British contingent made an- other go at getting through the barrier, but they also were re- buffed. While the confrontation was under way, the Russian troops brought a second armored carrier as reinforcement. By the close of the day, KFOR commander British Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson apparently de- cided to cut his losses to avoid a more serious conflict with the Russians and found another lo- cale for his headquarters. Russian President Boris Yeltsin and President Clinton agreed during an hour-long tele- phone conversation Sunday that their generals should work out details for the first 200 or so Rus- sian soldiers already in Kosovo while talks continue on command arrangements for a larger Rus- sian contingent. Many Serbs believe NATO forces will be unable or unwilling to save them from revenge at- tacks by ethnic Albanians, and they see Russian troops as their protectors. Those fears have sent Serb civilians fleeing Kosovo. As many as 8,000 Serb civil- ians arrived in neighboring Mon- tenegro early Sunday, leaving Kosovo ahead of NATO peace- keeping troops, police said. An additional 2,000 were expected to arrive Sunday, the Associated Press reported. Some easier moments, too Sunday also brought some easier moments for NATO, as it began deploying tank units throughout the city and contin- ued getting thanks and good wishes from ethnic Albanians who have been cooped in their houses for much of the time since late March. That was when the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began, and when the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government intensified its zealous ethnic cleansing cam- paign to decimate the Albanians’ 90-percent majority in Kosovo, a southern province of Serbia, Yu- goslavia’s dominant republic. Almost every NATO tank seen on Pristina’s streets was adorned with bunches of flowers that grateful Kosovar Albanians tossed. “We want to give thé flowers to the NATO troops,” said Fidoni Shala, 10, who was carrying a handful of roses to a tank. “We want to say thank you for coming here to protect us.” NATO forces did seem to be gaining in their effort to replace Yugoslav troops here and secure the city as KFOR headquarters. The main road into the southern outskirts of Pristina was well guarded by evening, and Ss were in place throughout the city center that apparently will be the transit route for troops fanning out to more northern parts of the province. Mobility for forces is goal The aim is “to guarantee mo- bility to friendly forces,” said Capt. Light, who was coordinat- ing movements of dozens of units from the top of a tank parked just south of the city center. The Yugoslav military has caused fewer problems than he expected, he said, adding that they were withdrawing from Ko- sovo as required in the agree ment Yugoslav generals signed late last week. ; “They haven’t contravened anything so far,” Light said. “But they’re not very happy to have us here at the moment.” : More fires, which departing Yugoslav forces apparently oan sent columns of smoke into the skies over Pristina and suburban villages throughout the day. An- other constant billow of smoke came from the central police sta- tion, where documents not being burned were flung out the win- dow into a guarded courtyard. Soldiers were lined up at routes out of the city, bags at their side, hitching rides back home. They may have been reservists, such as a soldier who identified himself only as “Draga” and said he was glad to be getting out of uniform. “Everything will be OK now,” he said, as a friend gave him a lift back home to Urosevac and his technical schofl classes.

And on a day filled with tense moments betwen NATO and Serb-dominated Yugoslav troops, Ameri¢an paratroopers were barely two hours into their missibn before a brief but tense standoff occurred. About 100 members of the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., had landed in the southern Kos- ovo village of Jerli Prelez to begin establishing an American operations base for Kosovo Force (KFOR), when an apparently drunken Serb soldier got out of a troop bus carrying a Russian-made Kalashnikov: a and threatening to fire at them.

        "ocr_text": "Wounded in body, spirit, missing men emerge By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Pristina, Yugoslavia — Emaciated young men slowly walk the twisting, narrow alleys of an ethnic Albanian neighborhood, while Others too injured to wander recuperate in homes where they were lucky to find care and shelter. They are the missing men of Kosovo, and they are beginning to turn up in sad shape after weeks of what they describe as extreme maltreatment in Serb-run prisons. In a single small neighborhood in north- ern Pristina seven of these still-dazed men could be found Monday, all of them released from prisons or the hospital on Thursday. It was the day after Yugoslavia agreed to pull its troops out of Kosovo, and Serbs learned they were about to be confronted with responsibility in the eyes of the world for their ethnic cleansing campaign. “I never thought I’d get out of there,” said Ramadan Sadriju, a 20-year-old ethnic Alba- nian with hollow cheeks and ribs jutting from his skinny torso. He referred to the feared prison at Lipjan, where he spent six gruesome weeks packed into a single cell with 38 others. Now he was out, but he seemed unable to ‘smile. His 16-year-old brother, Berat, was just as physically debilitated. As they sat without shirts, their heartbeats were easily visible. Berat was too withdrawn to answer a jour- nalist’s questions or describe his stay in the same prison. The pair and four other men interviewed told how they were grabbed by Serb forces from refugee convoys trying to escape into Macedonia or Albania. A seventh man was shot and injured during an attack on his vil- lage, then taken away by Serb soldiers. All are patients of a remarkable young doctor, Murat Abdazi, himself only 25. Abdazi, working sometimes with a nurse and medical assistant, has spent these grim months racing from one disastrous case to the next. For a while, his team worked in a nearby mountain village under siege, but mostly he has snaked his way through sniper fire and bombardments in Pristina, delivering babies, treating people beaten and shot, and generally trying to keep alive the ethnic Albanians hiding in his own neighborhood. “I was prepared for this. I had saved the medicine,” said Abdazi, who was greeted by almost every passing person as he led two journalists through the hilly district of houses. But he had nearly exhausted his supplies, and he was worried about treating some of these ex- prisoners who were his latest round of emergency patients. One of the most seriously injured was Bahtir Zeciri, 26, who was wounded in a Serb mili- tary attack that killed his father in their village of Kolatec on May 26. He was shot in the left shoulder and right arm, and another bullet grazed his upper lip. Police seized him and two other men, he said, and he ended up in what sounded like a special interrogation room in a _ base- ment in Pristina. “For three days I had no food or water,” Zeciri said. He was blindfolded the entire time and had no medical treatment. Like others interrogated, Zeciri said the Serbs tried to make him admit to being a mem- ber of the rebel Kosovo Libera- tion Army and to give informa- tion about the KLA, which the Yugoslav government has labeled a terrorist group. He was released after three days, but en route to his village he was cornered by Serb para- military forces who beat him severely. That apparently was when his left arm was broken. Zeciri finally ended up in the main surgical hospital in Pristi- na, but it was no safe haven for an ethnic Albanian brought in by Serb security. “Everyone who came into my room beat me,” he said, citing the nurses, the doctors and two army officers who threatened to throw him out the window. “Peo- ple from the prisons came to the hospital, but they were treated like they were in prison.” Similar stories have circu- lated already about the Pristina hospitals. The Serb-run hospital, too, discharged its prisoner patients on June 10, and Zeciri staggered out into the city. A young woman from Abdazi’s neighborhood found him and brought him ken arm was set, but he had not Brothers Berat Sadriju, [6, (left) and Ramadan Sadriju, 20, show the privation they suf- fered in a Serb-run prison. removed the cast to see it yet. He said wounds to the young man’s right arm and wrist were not well-doctored, and the patient cannot move his ring fin- ger on that hand. : Veton Berisha, 22, is another of the complicated cases the young doctor has been trying to treat with few resources. He and his 48-year-old father, Iimi, were pulled from a convoy April 30. They also were dis- patched to Lipjan prison, which Ilmi Berisha described as a house of horrors. “Several died in the cell with us from beatings,” said Imi Ber- isha, describing pitiless condi- tions in which 160 people from four cells shared one toilet. Food was marginal and beatings fre- quent, he said. After 20 days, authorities took three or four people from each cell, and they never were seen again in the prison, he said. Prisoners in his cell ranged in age from 13 to 75, he said. His son was severely injured on the day prisoners were ejected from Lipjan. In weak- ened condition, they were forced to walk the 12 miles to Pristina, then encountered hostile Serbs in the city. It was one day after Kosovo’s ethnic Serb population learned it had lost to NATO, which would be sending interna- tional peacekeeping troops to secure the city at the same time Yugoslav troops would be required to leave. In the city both men were beaten to unconsciousness. Abdazi said the younger Berisha was hit at least 20 times on the head, based on the wounds he found. His jaw was broken and his left ear nearly ripped off. The father and son were dropped into a building that was then set afire. They were fortunate that neighbors saw what had hap- pened and busted through a win- dow to retrieve them. Finally they were brought to Abdazi’s neighborhood, where he is trying to heal them. h Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 15, 1999 \f"

The three-family building had been transformed into a junk- yard of filthy, ravaged rooms. Krasnici said he was certain much of the stealing and damage were done Monday and Tuesday while he could only stand and watch from behind a NATO tank on the corner of his street.

In the village of Shale, about 30 miles southwest of Pristina, Agim Hoxha, 59, was among thousands of people returning to their homes after spending as many as 10 weeks roughing it in the nearby mountains. “Our houses are burned. We. are living under plastic sheets,” : he said. “Now I am afraid to go in: my fields. Maybe there are! mines.” So far, an estimated Fr. 1060: they are finding. Others say they want to rebuild their homes and return to work, but they have no means to do either. Hoxha said he returned to the village because his family had nothing left to eat. The villagers had been resourceful enough to build a water mill to grind grain into coarse flour, and most appar- ently had eaten little except bread they made. Children ran around on skinny legs. Men had made new belt notches to hold up pants gathered in bunches around their waists. Tuesday brought the first relief shipment of food — 35 metric tons of goods, including wheat flour, cooking oil, sugar and yeast. It was supplied by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the first organization to get big ship- ments of bulk food out to the hungry countryside. But Shale and countless other villages may never be able to overcome the deaths of so many people. In Shale the count is 27, including both those killed in Serb attacks and those who died in the desperate conditions of life in the mountains. “It’s my duty to keep this list,” said Mohamed Karpuzi, 39, an elementary school teacher who can say how and when each per- son died. “The people gave me this responsibility.” In Pristina, Krasnici has not had to deal with that kind of loss. His family is intact, but his pos- sessions are gone. “Everything, they took every- thing,” he said, sweeping his hand to encompass the downstairs warehouse once filled with goods from coffee to motor oil, and the spacious upstairs apartments once filled with appliances and nn . TIM OCKENDEN / Associated Press Rooms that were not empty were littered with broken window panes, empty bottles, broken fur- niture, food and even feces. Toi- lets and sinks had been smashed, and Krasnici found a suit jacket with a 3-inch, V-shaped cut in the sleeve made by someone wielding a pair of scissors. On Monday afternoon, when he asked the NATO troops stationed on the corner to intervene, a Brit- ish major walked down the street to tell the Serb troops they were being closely watched. But he said KFOR had no right to inter- fere with the Serbs until the dead- line for their departure had arrived. Several times Monday and Tuesday, Krasnici cried quietly, thinking about the work he had done to create this place for his family. But, for his family, he will rebuild. “TI will sleep here tonight,” he said. “I'll start cleaning it one room at a time, from the ground floor up.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 16, 1999 (Contiued) | | \f"

Meanwhile, NATO troops are beginning to move into the central and northern sectors of Kosovo, according to alliance spokesman Col. Robin Clifford. Those are the next areas Serb forces must leave by Sunday, the withdrawal deadline for 40,000 Serb troops imposed by NATO.

        "ocr_text": "e > * . * = 2 By Joseph Al € © Palm Beach per Staff Writer : UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia — Panicked by a wave “of about 10 kidnappings aimed at prominent Serb families, at least 4,000 ethnic Serbs on Thursday fled - the American occupation zone of Kosovo in a con- * voy under NATO protection. : For 90 minutes, a ragtag column of about 1,000 _cars and farm wagons choked the road north to ~Serbia from this predominantly Albanian city of - some 100,000 people that has largely escaped the - ravages of the war. A heavily armed assault team of American - peacekeepers rescued one elderly Serbian kidnap - victim when they burst into a military barracks that the Kosovo Liberation Army had recently taken “over as its headquarters. About six other Serb civilians were also re- « leased, some after agreeing to give their kidnappers - weapons that they had hidden in their homes. By nightfall, at least two kidnap victims had not been found. One was the 15-year-old sister of a Serb -militiaman allegedly associated with the Black _Hand paramilitary organization blamed with ter- - rorizing Albanians before and during the war. The wave of kidnappings underscored the diffi- - culty NATO peacekeepers face in trying to control revenge-minded KLA soldiers. . “The international community allowed this to happen,” raged computer programmer Marjan Milenkovic, 40, a Serb with lifetime roots in Urose- - vac who was preparing to leave. “I personally ex- pected to have peace when the military forces of NATO entered Kosovo, but it happened differently.” Police Chief Tomislav Simic, an ethnic Serb, - blamed the kidnappings on undisciplined factions of the KLA eager to seize the Serbs’ stocks of weapons. Surprised by the speed and ferocity of the backlash by ethnic Albanian factions against local Serbs, the U.S. Army first sent loudspeaker vehicles into the city streets late Wednesday to appeal all - night for the release of at least a half-dozen reported Serb kidnap victims. By midmorning Thursday, a crowd of more than 1,000 worried Serbs gathered with their cars in the city square to await a NATO convoy to the Serbian border. Around 11 a.m., their worry turned to anger and panic when word spread that KLA kidnappers had just seized the 21-year-old son of the chief manager of the town's steel pipe factory. One of the Serbs then led a correspondent three blocks past the town’s Serbian Orthodox Church to the factory owner’s white Audi. There, the kidnap victim's mother, Danica Kotorcevic, was weeping. “Five men with guns came and took my son as we Panicked by KLA kidnaps, 4,000 ethnic Serbs flee city were preparing to join the convoy,” she said. As she and her two other sons were giving their account of the kidnapping, an ethnic Albanian wearing black pants and a straw hat appeared at a street corner ards away. He could be seen handing what ed out to be a small handwritten ransom note to one of the Kotorcevic sons. Written in Serbian, it enumerated a small arse- nal of weaponry — an automatic rifle, two pistols plus ammunition. “Just give us these guns,” the note said. “When you give us the guns, your son will come back in five minutes.” By then, reports of the kidnapping had reached the American peacekeepers stationed in the city square and a detachment of about 20 U.S. para- troopers rushed up to the victim’s mother. Told what had happened, the paratroo double-timed around the corner. They grabbed the man who delivered the kidnap note and an alleged accomplice, throwing both on the ground and con- fiscating pistols from each. The two ethnic Albanians claimed they didn’t know how to find Mitchko Kotorcevic, the kidnap victim. But then, 15 minutes later, Mitchko was freed and rejoined his family amid shouts of delight. “I was freed because my mother turned over to the KLA guys one Kalashnikov (rifle) and promised them one pistol also,” Mitchko explained. As the Kotorcevic family and thousands of other Serbs were starting their car engines to leave for Serbia, the ranking U.S. Army commander in Uro- sevac, Lt. Col. Joe Anderson of the 82d Airborne Division, met at town hall with the deputy mayor, an ethnic Serb, and two mid-level commanders of the Chastising the KLA commanders for an over- night surge of robberies and kidnappings allegedly committed by those with KLA ties, Anderson said that in two hours American peacekeepers would begin a sweep of KLA-controlled offices. “We will start going through buildings,” Ander- son said. “And we will force you to surrender all arms or apprehend those who do not do so.” In the midafternoon, four U.S. Army armored Humvees topped with 50-caliber machine-guns stopped i in front of the former Serbian Army bar- racks that the KLA had seized for a headquarters. Inside the barracks building, two Army ser- geants opened the door of a closet and found an ethnic Serb in his mid-60s, severely beaten and with his hands trussed behind his back and tied to a pole. Ten KLA soldiers, found inside the headquar- ters building, were forced to lie face down on the floor and to give up their weapons while Army medics gave the kidnap victim first aid.

        "ocr_text": "Fear mixes with hope as Kosovar goes home @ One woman’s day-by-day story of what she finds upon her return to Pristina By Marcia KuNSTEL American-Statesman Intemational Staff PRISTINA, Yugoslavia — One week ago, Florie Topanica began the emotional journey that more than 1 million Kosovo Albanians will make in coming weeks, re- turning to uncertainty and sadness. Flora, as she is called, is my translator and now my friend, a brave woman who came with me to Kosovo on the day NATO troops opened the border from Macedo- nia. Not knowing what awaited beyond that border, this slight 25- year-old managed to face the fear she had left behind in Pristina, from which her family had fled on April 3. Now she was frantic to learn what happened to her home, her friends and — we discovered later — her boyfriend, who had been imprisoned since 1995 for belong- ing to an illegal pro-independence organization. Here is her story: june 12 Flora called at 8 a.m. as ar- ranged. I had a surprise: “Can you be ready at 8:45? We'll go to Pris- tina today.” Soon, another surprise: The border guard was a Serb, not a NATO soldier as expected. Serb soldiers had hounded Fio- ra’s neighbors the day her family left Pristina, giving them 10 min- utes to leave or face death. They had taken her boyfriend Liburn four years earlier. They had killed some friends. The border guard summoned her from the car. “Oh, my God,” Flora said. He started questioning her, but we intervened. He had no right to stop a journalistic team in a NATO military convoy with NATO credentials. He wilted, and we soon ad- vanced into a surreal world of burned and shattered villages. “Oh, my God. Look at that. Look, there is noone,” she said again and again, pointing to roofless houses or gutted stores. Exhilarating moments when people finally appeared — ethnic Albanians joyously greeting our convoy of NATO tanks and trucks — were followed by near panic once we hit Pristina. We lost the convoy when we had stopped to talk to villagers, and now we were alone in the twilight hours amid Serb soldiers and police. There was shooting. And no NATO presence in sight. Journalists were at the Grand Hotel, we had heard, but it had been a Serb social spot where eth- nic Albanians like Flora hadn’t dared go for years. We luckily found a NATO tank and troops guarding it. One intervened when a Serb driver yelled at us for parking in a spot he was saving. We walked through the rain into the jammed lobby. Reporters were mixed among Serb men in uni- forms just hanging out. I linked arms with Flora and stayed close. No rooms were available, so we slept on the mezzanine floor along with dozens of other new arrivals. June 13 We drove around Pristina, watching the mostly Serb pedes- trians glower at us as we passed. Between news tasks, we went to Flora’s place. “This is my house,” she said, as we reached her apartment build- ing. ‘These are our flowers,” she said, pointing to the plants on the fourth-floor stairs. “This is our door.” It was number 15. But the key didn’t work. Children could be heard some- where. Was it behind her door, or another? “I think there are people inside,” she whispered. But no one answered either then or later when we returned. Then another bad sign. Flora went to the flat of a girlfriend, and found that Gypsy neighbors, who had been left the key for safekeeping, had stolen valuables and trashed the place. It was so filthy that Flora vomited. A last stop at the International Committee of the Red Cross for an interview, and Flora added her own question. Did they have lists of prisoners transferred from Ko- sovo? No, they couldn’t help yet. June 14 A morning stop at a headquar- ters of the Kosovo Liberation Ar- my guerrillas turned up several of Flora’s old buddies, none of whom had news about Liburn. Then a young doctor took us to patients who included seven emaciated men, some badly in- jured, all of whom the Serbs sud- denly had released from prisons on June 12. Flora didn’t have to explain her pale face or subsequent silence after she translated their stories of prison life — the beatings, the filth, meager food, overcrowding. Liburn must be like these men, she said, if he is still alive. June 15 The problem Flora kept pon- dering: how to break into her family’s apartment without get- ting blown up, if it’s boobytrapped, or shot, if it’s occupied by Serb squatters. Later, we visited a returned refugee who had watched in frus- tration Monday as Serb troops wentin and outofhis house, which they had taken over in April. Children who got into the gated compound said the soldiers were filling their trucks with his stuff. Now the Serbs had pulled out, and he returned to find utter dev- astation. Flora was so disturbed that she almost got sick again. June 16 “Wonderful news!” Flora said. She had learned that her brother, here as a translator for NATO troops, had gotten into the apart- ment. No one was inside, but all their possessions were. Someone must have damaged the lock, per- haps trying to get in while the family were refugees in Macedonia. She found the apartment exactly as her family had left it. “This is my desk. These are my books,” she said, touching them as though they were treasures. June 17 Devastation is everywhere. Thousands of people are missing or in prison. Flora has only asmall — but undamaged — apartment for her family. And the man she loves is still in danger — if, as she said, he is still alive. Reports of Serb atrocities are being joined now by increasing numbers of stories about angry ethnic Albanians exacting retri- bution through kidnappings or shootings. Flora tries to be positive. “Things will calm down,” she said. “It will get better.” Austin American-Statesman - June 20, 1999 \f"

Albri Berea STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Sajkovac, Yugoslavia — As the last Yugoslav army troops pulled out of Kosovo on Sunday, they left behind a town where more than 8,000 Kosovar Alba- nian refugees had been herded at gunpoint and packed into private houses with little more than bread and water for two months. Towing broken-down military vehicles behind them, the last of 40,000 Yugoslav troops rolled out of the province, prompting NATO to declare a formal end to its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. Negotiators from the NATO-led peacekeeping force also reached agreement with the Kosovo Liber- ation Army that called on the rebels to turn over their heavy weapons, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said at the summit of the world’s seven lead- ing industrial powers and Russia in Cologne, Germany. Lt. Gen Michael Jackson, com- mander of the peacekeeping forc- es, received written confirmation from the Yugoslay, military Sun- day that all troops had withdrawn to beyond the three-mile “ground safety zone” along the Kosovo border, said peacekeeper spokes- man Lt. Cmdr. Louis Garneau of Canada. Under the Kosovo peace plan, all troops had to be out by midnight. What the Serbs left behind was clearly evident. “We didn’t have enough to eat, but at least we survived,” said Fehmi Tahiri, 33, who was leaving Sajkovac on Sunday, pushing all of his possessions in a wheelbar- row. The tall, gaunt farmer said he dropped from 165 pounds to 143 pounds on a diet of bread and occasional soup. And his tractor was stolen. On his way home, he passed the town’s cemetery, which contained 51 freshly dug graves. Ten of the RUSSELL BOYCE / Press Albanians loot the abandoned homes of Serbs on Sunday in the village of Grace. Thousands of Serb civilians fled Kosovo as the midnight Sunday deadline for a full troop withdrawal drew near. mounds were so short they seemed to be for small children. Sobbing softly beside one 3- day-old mound was a young mother. Abide Mulolli, 22, said her father was shot by Yugoslav sol- diers just hours before they aban- doned the town and allowed the remaining 5,816 refugees to go home. That was about three days ago. “He tried to sneak out to go and buy some food and medicine for the children,” she said. “The British peacekeepers brought us his body when they arrived, on the same day the Yugoslavs left.” When the Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing struck northern April Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 21, 1999 > Sens =: Csrandfather shot seekins Food for kiais members of the extended Mulolli clan were driven from Sajkovac to join a stream of refugees who spent two weeks being herded from town to town, never being allowed to flee into exile in Alba- nia or Macedonia. Then in early May, Serb police directed the Mulollis and about 50,000 other refugees back north toward the Kosovo province’s border with the rest of Serbia. Abide Mulolli and her parents were allowed to return home — so they could turn their little courtyard into an involuntary ref- ugee camp for 86 people. Living 30 or 40 to a room All the Sajkovac refugees, even 2-year-olds, were assigned num- bers and registration certificates that delineated how far they could travel. In many cases, refu- gees were authorized to move around only within their own houses or walled compounds. A few others were allowed to move about the town. One refugee, a 38-year-old builder named Isup Kurtolli, organized a house-to-house cen- sus of refugee families. From the handwritten names in his green notebooks, the size of the refugee population in Sajkovac — which is about 15 miles northeast of Pristina, the Kosovo capital — can be counted. On the scale of the atrocities inflicted on the Kosovars this year, the indignities suffered here are scarcely the worst. No systematic torture nor gang rapes are known to have occurred in Sajkovac. Fifty-one people died, some of hunger and others from Those concentrated by the Serbs in Sajkovac were forced to live 30 or 40 people to a room for two months. And they were so short of nutrition they lost 20 to 40 pounds each. To stay alive, many were forced to buy flour from Serbian troops at five times the standard price. “We had 86 people in our home,” said Abide Mulolli. “I took in 163 people — 11 in my family and 152 refugees we’d never seen before,” said her uncle Nazmi Mulolli, 60. “We had 79 people sleeping in two rooms,” said another rela- tive, Ramadan Mulolli. “We spent almost all the time indoors because there was a Yugoslav army post on the hill that would shoot at us if we came outside.” He said nobody in the village ever knew for sure why they were being held. “Maybe they wanted to use ‘us as human shields,” he speculated. With new revelations of mass graves and atrocities coming almost daily, and with people like the hostages of Sajkovac con- sumed with efforts to reassemble their lives, there was little incli- nation to celebrate the final departure Sunday of Serbian mil- itary and police forces. They left quietly, most of them well ahead of the Sunday night deadline. ‘They will be back’ Near the border with the rest of Serbia, only two dusky green military trucks filled with sol- diers were seen zipping up the road in midafternoon. A lone jeep was abandoned in the middle of the main north-south road. Yet the withdrawal ended a decade of Belgrade’s dominance and repression in Serbia’s Connecticut-sized province, a decade that culminated in the horrors still being uncovered. The northern Kosovo popula- tion, predominantly Serbian and so close to the border with Serbia proper, seemed to care little about the troop withdrawal. Nor did they offer disparaging remarks about the international peacekeeping units spearheaded by NATO troops. Most are farmers who spent this sunny, hot Sunday as they do other days, in backbreaking field labor. This is hay harvesting time, and families were out in force swinging scythes and mak- ing haystacks. “The troops left yesterday. For now there are no problems,” said Srecko Radosavlevic, 26, who was standing by the side of the road awaiting a ride. “We do worry about the Kosovo Libera- tion Army.” Yet he said he could not understand why so many Serbs living in Kosovo gave in to “mo- mentary panic” and fled. They were still leaving Sunday, not in a steady stream but in occasional cars or horse-drawn carts piled high with family furniture and clothes. “They will be back,” he said.

        "ocr_text": "NATO soldiers kalled Blast in Kosovo kills four people as peacekeepers begin work. By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Pristina, Yugoslavia — War ended here Monday, but the -deaths of two NATO soldiers and two Kosovo civilians in an explo- sion illustrated what a hard job nurturing peace will be. - On the day NATO declared an official end to its air assaults, and Yugoslavia’s government moved to end its state of war, the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army began to carry out the terms of its demilitarization. ‘ KLA guerrillas turned over maps of minefields and, in some cases, their guns and grenades. The NATO soldiers who were killed, members of Britain’s 69th Gurkha Field Squadron, were Nepalese ordnance experts who ‘hold some of the most hazardous jobs in the military. On Monday, they died carrying out one of the most critical tasks in the recon- Struction of war-torn Kosovo. The troops were clearing explosives near a school in the village of Negrovce, about 20 miles west of Pristina, when the munitions exploded, according to a NATO spokesman, Lt. Col. Nick _Clissett. ' fatalities, an injured civilian was _‘in stable condition at a military _field hospital in Pristina. ' The ordnance at first was reported to be a mine, but later information raised the possibility that bomblets from a NATO clus- ter bomb or other leftovers from aHied air strikes exploded. President Clinton, who was in the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, telephoned British ‘Prime Minister Tony Blair to offer condolences, officials said. _ the In addition to the four: The rugged mountains of southwest- ern Asia, did not let the fatal acci- dent impede their work. A few RIhours later, on a road just south of where the explosion occurred, ‘soldiers from the bomb squad were surveying roadside proper- ties, talking with landowners and putting up warning markers with [| red-and-white striped roping to keep people out of minefields. Mines and unexploded bombs are part of the deadly legacy of Serb ethnic cleansing campaign that pushed an estimated 1.3 million Kosovo Albanians out of their homes. Military experts have esti- mated hundreds of thousands of mines were laid throughout Kosovo. » Humanitarian agencies are putting up posters showing the types of mines people might encounter. The group Doctors Without Borders is briefing villagers on mine dangers at every mobile clinic stop. A nurse gives graphic descriptions of how unsuspect- ing Kosovars have been killed or their feet and legs mangled. Monday’s fatal explosion was a grim way to usher in the new stage of peace in Kosovo. On Sunday, Yugoslav mili- tary and police forces completed with- drawal under terms of a military tech- nical agreement negotiated with NATO. In the early morning hours Monday, NATO completed a pact for demilitarization of the rebel KLA. Those two events released NATO to declare an end to the air war against Yugoslavia that began March 24, and led the Yugoslav government to request that its parliament revoke the state of war. In Washington, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered back to/'their home bases 300 U.S. warplanes that had participated in the bombing campaign. Cohen said 47,000 Yugoslav troops have left Kosovo in the past 11 days, taking with them 800 tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces. The NATO commander, Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, said he hoped the world will look back on the KLA pact, achieved after protracted negotiations, and see it as “a turning point in every way.’”’ Very soon, the NATO-led Kosovo Force of peacekeepers, known as KFOR, will be the only military pres- ence in the province, Jackson said. *“That is how it should be.”’ But with returning Albanians forced to confront the grisly evidence of months of Serb atrocities, ‘‘It’s going to take a lot of leadership and a lot of self-discipline for those who have come home not to retaliate,’? President Clinton said in Bonn, Germany. other Gurkhas, from the - JEROME DELAY / Associated P & Kosovo rebel tears down a poster of Yug slav President Slobodan Milosevic in Pec, after KLA gul4rrillas signed atdemilitarization pact. Speaking about Albanian retaliation against Serbs, Clinton said, ‘They should not do it. They should not do it. In the end, it will not satisfy anyone, and it will only compound the horror.” KLA leader Hashim Thaci, appear- ing at a news conference in Pristina on Monday -ith U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin, hailed the demilitarization pact as marking ‘a new epoch beginning for the people of Kosovo.”’ With that, Thaci said, ‘““We ask all Serbs that have fled from Kosovo and haven’t done any crimes here to come back and live in Kosovo.”’ Efforts to disarm the KLA and move it out of power positions have been aimed not only at securing peace, but also at persuading ethnic Serbs to con- tinue living in Kosovo. The agreement, which gives the KLA 30 days to turn over heavy weap- ons and 90 days to give up automatic firearms, also mandates that guerrilla fighters not carry weapons within two kilometers (1.2 miles) of main towns or borders. The pact was having some impact already Monday. KLA officers handed over to German peacekeepers in the southern city of Prizren maps of mine- fields located near the border with Albania. Serbs were not much convinced of their security, although 70 came back across the border Monday under NATO escort from Montenegro to their home city of Pec.

MARCIA KUNSTEL~ NATO peacekeeping troops headquartered across the street had pronounced repeatedly their mission to provide security for all the people of Kosovo. That very day NATO announced it had taken over police powers, so my colleague and I sharing this apartment figured they could swing a patrol down our street. If the troops didn’t care much about a couple of Western jour- nalists, surely they would worry about Serb families we found also had been targeted in our building. Some already were leaving. Oth- ers were distraught with fear. Wrong assumption. It was after 7 p.m. and the media center at KFOR headquar- ters, the place we journalists logi- cally should inquire, was locked up. A soldier who answered our insistent fists on the door said business hours were 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. That went for the mili- tary police headquarters, as well, he said. A concerned sentry outside the locked military police office, where the sign said inquiries should be made after 8 the next ee: nae pineedet in of two guys appeared on a second- floor roof, looking down in appar- ent irritation at being bothered by a request for help. Serbs were being harassed and kicked out all over the city, one soldier said. There was nothing NATO could do either for them or for us, not with their limited num- bers of troops. He said to drop by the office in the morning, and a patrol might be arranged to pass the next night. If we had any trouble that night, he suggested, we could just run down the 10 floors and across the street and bang on his door for assistance. If we couldn’t get out past the intruders, he said, don’t simply yell “Help” out the window. “Shout ‘Fire’ or whatever the equivalent is in Albanian,’” he advised. “Nobody around here will answer a call for help.” We returned to the apartment disillusioned ‘and understanding why Serbs were leaving Kosovo in droves. The supposed protection by NATO forces was a dangerous illusion at best. We lodged a heavy chair in front of the door and hunkered down. There was banging on other doors, skirmishing in the hallways, but we were not bothered again that night. The next morning when Shpetim and the landlord Nobel came ’round they were not too surprised at the shenanigans in the building. That’s when they found the false name on our door. When we told Nobel that a Serb guy on the landing below had asked for him, our young landlord quickly went to visit the Serb. The tenant was shaken after Kos- ovar Albanians had come to his door with a gun and told him to get out. Milan, the Serb downstairs, had helped both Nobel and een when Serb gunmen were on rampages through the city. He had supplied cigarettes and food and watched the apartment. Now, Milan needed a hand. When Nobel came back, it turned out Milan hadn’t asked for much. ‘*He’s leaving and he asked if I would keep his key. He said I could do what I want with his apartment, and if he ever comes back here maybe I would give back the key.” A few minutes later, Milan came up to deliver the key. He was dressed in blue jeans and a jean jacket, ready for his road trip north into Serbia where he would stay with his mother. He shook hands with Shpetim and Nobel, then hugged them. Before he left, Shpetim told him to wait a minute, he had one thing he wanted to do. The lanky young ethnic Alba- nian quickly ripped a piece of paper, wrote his own name on it, and went down to tape it to Milan’s door, in hopes it might give a little insurance against marauding by his own people.

        "ocr_text": " CASE AGAINST MILOSEVIC War crimes evidence vanishing By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT izbica, Yugoslavia — Churned earth has replaced the neat rows of mounds that told the world a mass grave was here. A few detached body parts may remain in the clods of dirt, along with the errant shoe or muddy blanket once used to wrap a body. But gone are the corpses, the most compelling evidence of a heinous crime. “They were removed to destroy the evidence, to destroy the facts,” said Sadik Gjemajli (pronounced jie-MY-lee), the local commander of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. The story of the Izbica (pro- nounced is-BEET-sa) massacre, in which more than 140 people are said to have been executed, is one of seven in the four-count indict- ment against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four cohorts for war crimes in Kosovo. Gjemajli and other eyewitnesses said Serb soldiers returned here three days before the Yugoslav army agreed June 10 to withdraw troops and spent two days digging up the graves, removing corpses, and then setting afire a wagonload of grave markers and blankets that had wrapped the bodies. Here in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, justice will be difficult to attain, even where there has not been intentional evidence tamper- ing. There is ample opportunity for evidence to be ruined simply by the passage of time and intrusion of innocent people into crime scenes that have no guard, no fences or even any markings. At the same time, continued dan- ger, bad communications and hard travel contribute to delays in investigations by The Hague’s tri- bunal on war crimes, the body that indicted Milosevic and four colleagues. Forensic teams began probing alleged sites in Kosovo last week. Among them were teams from Scotland Yard, the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. But they are in the second stage of the investigative process, according to Paul Risley, spokes- man for the tribunal, while thus far the crucial first stage has yet to be carried out. “In each of these cases, we have soldiers secure the sites,” Risley said, speaking of KFOR, the Kos- ovo Force of NATO troops, which is taking over the seven sites listed in the indictment. “There is a limited window of opportunity for [collecting] the sur- face evidence — tire marks, foot- prints, bloodstains,” he _ said, emphasizing the need for quick forensic assessments at protected sites. In the southern Kosovo town of Djakovica, the crumbling house where an estimated 20 women, children and elderly people were burned alive still sat open last week to the elements and to intrud- ers. The attack on this modest home on the night of April 1 also is listed in the indictment. A neighbor poked through the remains of the house, picking up pieces of human bone with a pair of pliers, just out of curiosity. One piece was potential evidence that might help identify a victim — a piece of jawbone with a tooth still attached. Nor at midweek was there any sign of KFOR protecting anything within miles of Izbica, a village in the central Kosovo region that was a KLA‘stronghold and was thoroughly routed by Serb troops. With the bodies of dead villagers missing, any evidence left gains in importance. Relatives of the victims clearly have been moving through the site, if only to replace grave markers | bowled over by Serb backhoes — despite the fact that the bodies are gone. The corpses would be the best evidence, holding bullets that might be identified as Yugoslav military issue and other signs indi- cating the manner of death. And of course, the identification — and even the numbers — of the victims now is a matter of hearsay, based on lists the KLA and villagers com- piled before they buried their friends and loved ones. There also is a videotape of some stages of the burials. The graves first appeared in NATO spy satellite photographs in early April and were publicized as evidence of Serb atrocities. In mid- April, villagers said they buried the bodies after a Serb massacre, and a videotape surfaced later and was shown on news broadcasts. Izbica is not the only place Serb forces are reported to have dug up and removed corpses. Risley said the tribunal has received a number of reports of Yugoslav authorities saying their forces discovered the mass graves and identified the corpses as “victims of terrorist attacks.” The Yugoslav authorities said Serb troops then removed and humanely gave a decent burial in individual, marked graves. “You can see this as a kind of very sophisticated effort to hide the evidence,” he said. “That in itself would be a specific kind of war crime committed by the military units.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 27, 1999 \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Palm Beach Post Staff Writers BEIJING — The unassuming old Chinese cobbler who works on a nar- row city alley suddenly realized he risked getting locked up. So he took the logical step and stopped doing his ;¥\" daily meditational exercises. And he makes sure everyone knows it. “J used to practice Falun Gong, but now I| know it’s not good,” he an- nounced out of the blue to a foreigner who stopped to chat. “It was a good thing the government explained this.” The government has not merely “explained” the evils of Falun Gong to average Chinese like Liu Donghua, the 73-year-old who quietly tends to broken shoes and zippers from his ti- ny alley chair. It outlawed the popular regime of meditation and exercise, and has blanketed this nation of 1.2 billion people with an unrelenting propagan- da barrage that even government supporters describe as overkill. Thousands of Chinese followers of Falun Gong were detained at least briefly, and thousands more like Liu now have renounced the sect and its charismatic founder Li Hongzhi, who lives in exile in New York. In coming weeks the movement’s core leaders are expected to be charged here and tried for crimes related to undermin- ing social order. Why this attack-dog response to a spiritual, mental and physical regimen that draws on respected, centuries-old Chinese traditions such as Buddhism and Taoism?

Since then, Li managed to attract as many as 70 million Chinese adher- ents to his five meditational exercises, four done standing and one seated.

In this case, the wake-up call jolted Beijing on April 25, when 10,000 Falun Gong members suddenly showed up at the capital, quietly ringed the seat of government at Zhongnanhai com- pound and protested their failure to win official recognition. The top leadership soon discov- ered that Falun Gong encompassed not just cobblers, but military officers, educated professionals and even Communist Party members. The group had set up 39 teaching centers, 1,900 places of instruction and more than 28,000 group exercise venues. It had also published books and _ pro- duced videos, and kept it all connected with high tech communications via Internet, phone and fax. It was organized, and to an auto- cratic Communist regime that does not countenance any other indepen- dent organizations, that meant it was dangerous. On July 22, Falun Gong was banned. A monthlong drumbeat of government-sponsored propaganda against the group has included daily articles in newspapers and testimoni- als televised day and night from Chi- nese telling how their lives or their loved ones were ruined by the practice of Falun Gong. The tragedies included suicides and deaths from refusing medical treatment, supposedly under Falun Gong influence. Chinese government claims that Falun Gong has wreaked both per- sonal physical harm and broader so- cietal damage are countered by the © cultivate zhen-shan-ren — or truthful- ness, compassion and forbearance — while eschewing unhealthy habits like cigarettes and alcohol. However, the government’s claims of anti-scientific teachings have some basis in Falun Gong literature, all of which has been banned. The group's Web site speaks to the “supernormal capabilities” of Li and other masters of meditation, such as “penetrative” and “remote” sight per- mitting them to see through objects and miles distant. It suggests they can “remove the evil spirit and pull out the vr of the disease” from a person who is ill. Whatever Falun Gong has preached, and whatever average Chi- nese truly think about it, the govern- ment hit a societal nerve when charg- ing the movement incited disturbanc- es and fostered instability. Liu the cobbler, who had practiced Falun Gong for nearly two years and said he is in great physical shape, nonetheless seemed to have dropped it effortlessly. The explanation may lie in another comment he made, when asked to cite the best change in China in recent years. “Social stability,” he said. “It’s im- proved peoples’ lives in every way.” Palm Beach Post - August 29, 1999 \f"

Beijing officials promised to use-that power to the hilt next menth “to insure a successful cel- ebration” of the SOth anniversary of the Communist takeover of CBHima on Oct. 1, state media reported. “About 25 large enterprises in Beijing that produce a lot of pol- lution every day ... have been ordered to reduce production and stop using equipment burning fuel and coal from Sept. 21 to Oct. 1,% the state-run China Daily said. Among the enterprises instructed to cease burning coal befere the revolutionary celebra- tion, was Beijing’s most notorious polluter, Capital Iron and Steel Corp., which has been blamed for generating about 20 percent of the- eye-stinging fumes that tugmed Beijing’s sky into a gray curtain of smog on 256 days in 1997.

Xie told a press conference that a factory shutdown would do little good. But, perhaps by coinci- dence, Beijing was blessed with a rare run of sky-blue weather dur- ing the Clinton visit. Five years earlier, some facto- ries and hospitals were ordered to turn off their coal-burning heat- ing plants to reduce smog at nearby sports complexes during a visit to Beijing by a 12-member inspection team from the Interna- tional Olympic Committee. At the time, Chinese authorities denied they were trying to reduce the smog in their unsuccessful pitch to win the 2000 summer Olympics. This time around, the Beijing Public Security and Traffic Administration left no doubt about its determination to control the smog for the Oct. 1 celebra- tion. “These measures are expected to improve the quality and visibility of the air ‘above Beijing in a short period of time,”’ China Daily reported. In addition to shuttering big coal-burning factories, the municipal authorities also prohib- ited all “large freight trucks, die- sel locomotives and motorcycles using mixed fuels” from entering the city for 10 days before the celebration. China Daily cited a painful epi- sode five years ago: ‘In the last military review on the 4Sth anni- versary of the People’s Republic of China, Beijingers were unable to view the fighter planes flying in the sky because of low visibil- ity of the heavily polluted air.”’ Another Beijing newspaper, Shopping Guide, reported that most radio transmitters support- ing telephone pagers will be closed on Oct. 1 “to guarantee an absolutely unblocked radio sys- tem in the air above Beijing for the flight formation of the Air Force, which will fly over Tianan- men Square that day.’”’ - September 1, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "North Korean ruler hailed Dictator’s subjects throw him a party in starving land By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing -— Thousands have starved to death in his country and thousands more have tried desperately to escape, but this week North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is being lavished with Praise at home for a great first year in power. While North Koreans have been reduced to dining on con- coctions of roots and leaves, the “sun of the 21st Century” is being thanked in state-run media for his “paternal love for the people” and for guiding his countrymen to tess. Kim officially assumed the mantle of power a year ago, but had been running the poverty- stricken Stalinist nation since his father, North Korean President Kim Il-sung, died five years ago. The Korean Central News Agency, which publishes many of its dispatches on an English- language Web site, pointed to Kim’s ‘‘on-the-spot guidance” asa primary exam- ple .of how Kim actually “works heart and soul” on behalf of his people. “He visited Sinhung res- taurant i Hamhung and informally took an ordi- mary noodle, saying that he - would like to taste noodle which is winning popularity among people,” the agency said. ‘“He noted with great satisfac- tion that strips of noodle are vis- cous, and noodle broth is unique and noodle is very good.”’ Then he urged the restaurant’s employees to improve the noodle even further and better serve “He [Kir Jong-Il] visited Sinhung restaurant in Ffamhung and informally took an ordinary noodle, say- ing that he would like to taste noodle which is winning popularity among people.” KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY people in the future. The normally reclusive Kim apparently has been doing a lot of “on-the-spot guidance” in recent months, with other news accounts describing his tours of a fish- ery and of a chicken farm that was pro- nounced “rem- iniscent of an advanced sci- ence research center.”’ The country keeps such detailed track of Kim’s rare appearances that the news agency recently cited the popularity of “June 2 camps” for young people, which harken back to the day in 1956 when Kim began camping during his middle school days. It also noted last month the 20th anniversary of the “on-site guidance” he supplied in a 1979 visit to the international friend- ship exhibition,’ a monument dis- playing gifts world leaders have given to his father and himself. It may be better to focus on camps and monuments than on food in North Korea these days, considering the reports that relief agencies permitted in the country have been mak- ing on conditions there. One South Korean charity group recently estimated that 3.5 million peo- ple have died of starvation in North Korea in the last five years. U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) finished a four- day trip to North Korea early this week and said the food situation seemed to be improving. However, he was visit- ing in late summer, when more food is available than any other time of year. 7 0 In the depths of winter, desper- ate North Koreans have tried to flee their country, with tens of thousands sneaking across the difficult border into China’s northeastern provinces where they have been meeting an increasingly hostile reception. The S7-year-old Kim officially is the general secretary of the Workers’ Party and the chairman of the National Defense Commis- sion. When he took the latter title a year ago and was acknowledged ‘publicly as the head of state, the title of “president” was retired — Kim’s late father was bestowed with the title of “eternal president.” Now, however, North Korea has recognized that the son of the founder of the nation has come into his own. The government has just pub- lished an English translation of the younger Kim’s political phi- losophy, entitled “Kim Jong-il, the Lodestar of the 21st Century.” In announcing it, the news agency proclaimed: “Now, in mame and reality, the era of Kim Jong-il has begun.”  .

The street is a centerpiece of the 50th anniversary cele- bration of the advent of China’s commu- nist regime. And plenty of Beijingers do sound happy to see the changes. “Even if we don’t spend this. money now, we will have to spend it later.

The name derives from Ming dynasty days, when an emperor reputedly demanded that his 10 brothers live together near the Forbidden City for easy sur- véilJance. The street became known as Shiwangfu, or street of mansions for 10 brothers. In the century before the revolution it was called Morrison Street and was a premier shopping district. Post-revolution, it reacquired the Chinese name — adding “jing” for an‘ancient well there — and got a néw attitude. Shops became state- ownéd and the half-mile-long street was anchored with the —- peoples’ department store, where plain and basic were orders of the day. Now shabbier stores are being replaced and storefronts are get- ting spiffy new facades and signs. Jewelry stores, camera shops and a new fur and leather emporium will compete with more modest dress and underwear stores. The street itself has been reconfigured into mainly a pedestrian mall, with only buses and a few permit- ted vehicles allowed. Flowering planters made from wboden bar- rels and carts enliven the tree- lined walkway, and plazas with irregularly timed water jets draw giggling children trying to dodge the sprays. The change is remarkable to people like the elderly Zhong. ‘In the old days Beijing had only a lot of single-story houses. People’s clothes were only in three colors — black, gray and blue — nothing else,’’ she said. ‘‘It was a very sim- ple life.”’ This focus on consumption is polar opposite the principles that undergirded Chairman Mao’s rev- olution. And consumption isn’t so popular today, either. Zhong and her husband are an example. ‘‘We didn’t come down- town to shop today, just to see the changes,” she said. The reopening of the refur- bished Beijing Department Store drew 400,000 people recently, but many came just to gawk or to buy tea or trinkets. Most people strolling Wang- fujing aren’t burdened with pack- ages, a sign of the nationwide angst brought on by dislocations from economic reform policies. An estimated 8 percent to 10 percent of the urban work force is unem- ployed, and layoffs *ipple through- out the countrv as unprofitable. inefficient state enterprises fold under competitive pressure. The state has scaled back long- time Communist benefits such as heavily subsidized housing as it moves to free the economy. Demand has been so slack that retail prices have gone down for 22 months in a row, leaving stores and factories with bulging inventories. Pedicab driver Wu said Chinese won’t even buy rides in his buggy these days. Forced into early retire- ment from a clothing factory a few years ago, Wu pedals Beijing’s streets to make enough money for his family. It’s easy to understand his bitter- ness at the expensive, gala festivi- ties planned for October. But the fireworks and parades and newly finished public works probably will stir pride and opti- mism deep in the souls of many Chinese, especially if they consider the long, austere and often tortur- ous road they have been forced to negotiate over the past 50 years.

In fact, he proudly noted that his Wolong Nature Reserve has had 100 percent survival of pan- das that reach six months of age. Yang Yang's digestive problem has had him sprawled like a sack of potatoes in his cage in the gray concrete sub-adult house at the Chengdu research base, suffering since mid-August from diarrhea and lack of appe- tite. American Sarah Bexell, a zoologist and education specialist from Zoo Atlanta, who has been working here on the research project, lamented that the staff could hardly tempt Yang Yang even with fresh bamboo shoots they collected from the mist-shrouded grounds of this leafy, wet research center. “He chewed it up and then spit it out,” she said. “He didn’t swallow more than three mouthfuls, I hadn’t worried about it until Yang Yang got so sick. They are vulnerable animals. When you watch them you can’t believe it because they are so big and roly- poly and playful.” A Zoo Atlanta nutritionist and veterinarian have been consulting long-distance on the case, and antibiotic shets got Yang Yang well enough for daily workouts last week. His female companion, Lun Lun, seemed bummed out about his absence from the play yard, “Lun Lun has been pining for him,” Bexell said. “‘The first few days after Yang Yang was separated from the group, Lun Lun spent a lot of time wanting to get back to him. It’s what we call ‘door directed behavior.’ ” On the one day Yang Yang did come out to play, Lun Lun ignored him for 15 minutes, until a keeper guided Lun Lun over to her playmate, who was belly-up on the jungle BYIn.

She ultimately headed.for the moaty and Yang Yang finally followed her there for a companionable snooze. Such sociable interaction transfixes humans, but diminishes as pandas reach adulthood, when they aggressively bark and bleat at each other and often must be sepa- rated. By the time they are sexually mature at age 5 or 6, they may tolerate each other only at Lun Lun’s once-yearly mating time. Atlanta researchers will have some crucial decisions to make before the pair reaches panda adolescence — with the help of a panda paternity test. “We chose these two pandas because they can breed, because their families are sepa- rate,” said Yu Jianqiu, deputy director of the Chengdu research base. “Also, maybe we can get money from Atlanta to help us get more equipment here for research of diseases and for reproductive and genetic research.” The money part is pretty much a sure thing. The breeding is not. Zoo Atlanta personnel suspect that Lun Lun and Yang Yang may be too closely’ ‘ related to mate withaut causing the genetic consequences of in-breeding. In fact, they may share the same father. When Yu hauled out China’s “Stud Book,” achronicle of panda breeding, he looked sur- prised to find that Yang Yang was not listed. The book stopped at the beginning of Septem- ber 1997, and Yang Yang was born Sept. 9 of that year. Maple said DNA testing eventually will determine the relatedness of Yang Yang and Lun Lun. Although researchers chose these two pandas because they are compatible and it seemed mating “was an option,” he said the discovery of the potential barrier will not block Atlanta’s research program. “Tn one sense it is important in that we want these two to become breeders,” Maple said. “But we didn’t acquire them just to breed them. We acquired them to study them.” If this pair is returned to China to breed with more genetically appropriate pandas, Maple said he assumes Atlanta would receive a replacement pair to breed and to study. “T believe the panda program in essence is in perpetuity,” he said, “We want to be in China as long as we're doing good there.

Family trees twisted By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU China — If there’s any- thing trickier than making panda babies, it’s tracking panda papas. Ts Yang Yang's dad Lan Lan or Lin Lan? Or some other male panda whose seed may have been frozen in a sperm bank for several years? And by the way, how come Yang Yang’s keepers call him Jiu Jiu? The researchers at Zoo Atlanta would love to know his pedigree. But because of a Chinese panda breeding phenome- non inelegantly referred to as a “cock- tail,” Yang Yang and Lun Lun could be half-sibs — or just good friends. To start with, Yang Yang, the male of the pair, is not listed in the “Stud Book” that traces giant panda lineage. The book stops about a week or so before his birth on Sept. 9, 1997. Yang Yang was born at the Chengdu Research Base for Giant Panda Breed- ing, so there is no doubt about his moth- er. She is Ya Ya. And her lineage is illus- trious, including her renowned grandmother Mei Mei, who produced so many offspring that the Chinese desig- nated her the “hero mother” and gave her a special posthumous exhibit in the Chengdu museum. The complication is that Ya Ya not only mated naturally that spring before Yang Yang was born — weighing in at only 173 grams, or 6 ounces —- but she also was artificially inseminated with what Western zoologists call a “semen cocktail.” “We did artificial insemination with several different males,” acknowledged Yu Jiangiu, deputy director of the research base. . Yu said he didn’t think it possible that among the sperm donors was Lin Lan, whose sperm has been identified as pro- ducing Lun Lun, the female of the young panda pair Atlanta wants to borrow for the next 10 years. He wouldn’t say why it’s not possible — it just isn’t. ’ Rebecca Snyder, head of Zoo Atlanta’s panda research, said via e-mail that she managed to track down Ya Ya’s natural mate, a male called Lan Lan, and she thinks she has traced one donor for the artificial insemination. But that doesn’t solve the mystery. The Chinese say the multiple breeding attempts are an effort to produce multi- ple offspring or at least one solid pairing of egg and sperm. And they have improved the pandas’ poor breeding But with only about 100 pandas in cap- tivity, around half of them males and many too young to breed, the pool of available sperm is limited. That is why Western wildlife experts prevailed upon the Chinese to create the “Stud Book,” which they hope will prevent breeding of closely related pandas, Although there are glitches even with the book, DNA testing will identify genetic heritage before any in Atlanta might take place. = Adding to the confusion isthe profu- sion of names some pandas accumulate. — Officially they get numbers, but many also are named in the zoos or research centers where they are born.

Apartment buildings were splintered into giant crumbs of concrete and the earth had heaved into a new hillock. Television reports throughout the day showed soldiers pulling bloodied bodies from buildings and relatives of the dead sitting in front of buildings crying and weeping. (ne man who was rescued from a col- lapsed high-rise building in Taichung said in a television interview that while he was trapped in the ruins, he could hear the voices of his children also caught in the wreckage nearby, calling to him. But after a while, he said, their voices faded away and he did not know where they were, Along one small street where scores died, more than 200 survivors spent the night on blankets on an outdoor basketball court of the Taiwan army's Dakuan Supply Base, a few hundreds yards from the ruins. “They're too afraid to sleep inside,” said Capt. Lee Tai Shen, showing an almost vacant, temporary dormitory the soldiers had created y giving up their own bunks.

It seemed remarkable that anyone at the epicenter sur- vived the fury of the initial pre-dawn quake and the three aftershocks on Wednesday of magnitudes 6.8, 6.1 and 6.0 — the strongest of more than 2,000 that have rocked the island. The aftershocks were feared to have triggered mud- slides, cracked one of Tai- wan’s largest reservoirs and forced evacuations, as the death toll from Tuesday’s quake climbed to 2,043 peo- ple, the Interior Ministry’s disaster management center said today.

        "ocr_text": "Mao’s legacy revived in China From television to currency, nation honors late Communist leader as a source of inspiration. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — The myth of Chairman Mao is making a comeback. With China transfixed by weeklong cele- brations of the 50th anniversary of Commu- nist Party rule on Friday, the face on the movie poster outside the Chinese capital’s biggest downtown theater isn’t Leonardo DiCaprio. Last year’s heartthrob has been replaced by a movie poster of a young and virile Mao Tse-tung. Mao’s face will also get prime play in the next few days when the People’s Bank of CHina releases China’s first new series of ban- knotes in 20 years. Gone will be the three old revolutionary comrades who used to flank Mao on back of the 100-Yuan banknote (worth about $12). From now on, Mao’s picture will appear alone — the first time a Chinese banknote has depicted a single political figure since the People’s Republic of China proclaimed itself as a nation on Oct. 1, 1949. Almost every night, prime-time Chinese State television shows yet another two-hour installment of a documentary on the achieve- ments of the Communist state that emerged in 1949 after Chairman Mao’s guerrilla legions expelled the remnants of Nationalist genera- lissimo Chiang Kai-shek’s armies to the island of Taiwan. ‘At least 55 hours of official documentaries have aired in the last month. While Commu- nist Party filmmakers acknowledge that Mao committed “errors” through his excessive zeal for Communism, they have given Mao more propaganda credit than he has gotten in a decade for having built China into a powerhouse. This doesn’t mean that Mao jackets are back in fashion, or that China is reverting to Marxism. Chinese leaders are grasping for symbols to inspire this country’s 1.3 billion people to keep striving into the next century. ' Suffering unemployment, angered by offi- cial corruption and finding little solace in out- moded Marxist ideology, the party realizes that hundreds of millions of Chinese are look- ing for something to believe in. Just two years ago, Mao’s reputation seemed caught in a terminal tailspin. In the mid-1990s, Mao’s name was rt F re: 4 5; VINCENT YU / Associated Press An officer stands guard as a portrait of Mao Tse-tung, the late chairman of the People’s Republic of China, overlooks Beijing’s Tiananmen Gate Tuesday. As China gears up for the 50th anniversary of Communist rule this week, the country is paying tribute to Mao. mentioned less and less often by the state-run Xinhua news agency. There were even a few suggestions in China’s controlled press that Mao’s corpse should be removed from its mar- ble mausoleum in Tiananmen Square. i But now in the run-up to the SOth anniver- sary, some Beijing intellectuals are dismayed that the party’s message on Mao seems to have reversed. “I fear that the authorities in the current government are trying to re-emphasize the role played by Mao Tse-tung,” said economic consultant Mao Yushi, chairman of the non- governmental Unirule Institute of Economics.- “If you ask intellectuals, I believe more than 90 percent hold a view very strong against Mao Tse-tung,” said the consultant Mao, who is no relation to the late chairman. “But if you ask the average worker or rural people, I would say 50 percent or more still respect Mao as a great man.” One way to gauge how Mao rates these days _ in party propaganda is to visit a grandiose exhibit now under way in the Beijing Exhibi- tion Center. Organized by a consortium of Chi- nese ministries, provincial governments, the military and the Communist Party, the show is titled “Glorious Course — Exhibition of Achievements of the 50th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China.” An unofficial count puts the number of pho- tos of Mao in the exhibit at 102, compared with only 68 for the late leader Deng Xiaoping. Only one Chinese leader commands as much space in the 50-year “Glorious Course” exhibit as Mao. That is incumbent President Jiang Zemin, whose exploits during his rela- tively colorless decade as Communist Party chief are recorded in 106 photographs. Mao is shown as transcending the movie- poster version of the virile Chinese guerrilla fighter thrashing bourgeois reactionaries and knocking the foreign devils on their ears. As depicted by the “Glorious Course” exhibit, Mao is also a nation-builder, a delight for awe-struck Chinese children, a spearhead of Chinese education, an inspiration for rocket scientists and a creator of steel mills. Mao didn’t build China all on his own. As the exhibit’s designers explained in a press conference, “Glorious Course” lets people cherish the memory of China’s accomplish- ments under “three generations of collective leadership.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 29, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "China salutes : communism in lock step By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — Sixty howitzers boomed 50 shots each and goose-stepping soldiers crossed Tiananmen Square today to hoist the red-and-yellow flag to begin Communist Chi- na’s salute to 50 years of phenomenal change. A sea of Young Pioneers filled the world’s biggest public square in a red-and-yellow formation spelling the Chinese characters for National Celebration as the 10 a.m. ceremony commenced. Then President Jiang Zemin, wearing an updated gray Mao suit, headed off in a Red Flag limousine to inspect the 11,000 troops lined up with the latest Chinese military hardware along the Avenue of Perpetual Peace “Hello comrades,” Jiang called out to the soldiers manning 400 tanks and armored vehicles. “Hello leader!” they replied. The camouflage-green phalanx of military machines was set to roll down the street with a roar of motors and belching exhaust. Waves of civilian paraders and marching bands in a rainbow of bright colors were lined up and ready to go. “For my whole life I have been waiting for this moment,” said Huang Erzun, 85, a leftist student in 1930s China who settled in Tai- wan and came back to celebrate the 50th birthday of the People’s Republic of China today. Soldiers accompanied 2 groups of weapons, from tanks to radars to the new East Wind 31 intercontinental ballistic missile, in the first military parade through Tiananmen Square in 15 years. And the air force was expected to unveil its new Flying Leopard eee plane in a aming f th ; “This is the first time we have shown our complete system of armaments,” said an announcer from the state television channel. Viewing access, permitted only to those with a red, numbered invitation and laminated identity card, was so restricted that in some prime viewing stands just 30 yards from the armored col- umn, half the seats were empty. Traffic in central Beijing had been immobilized one minute after midnight as part of an iron- handed security lockdown. Tens of thousands of police isolated the heart of the capital in a form of martial law aimed at guarantee- ing that no disruption — or any speck of spontaneity — would sully the festivities. The 500,000 marchers and entertainers for an evening gala were as carefully picked and placed as the 500,000 potted flow- ers stuck all over the city in metal frames, shaped into huge boats, shooting stars or gaily colored columns. To assure none strayed from key nationalistic themes, partici- pants had a list of 50 approved slogans to shout, such as “Stress theoretical study, political aware- ness and good conduct!” The two-hour parade hailed China’s progress, with 91 floats including replicas of a rocket launch and a snowy peak in Tibet, where mountaineers surrounded by rainbows planted China’s red flag with five yellow stars. The parade swayed down the Avenue of Perpetual Peace, the capital’s biggest east-west boule- vard, to be reviewed by Jiang near the entrance to the Forbid- den City. The procession was an eccen- tric combination of the dour Sta- linesque might of Moscow’s Cold War parades in Red Square and the pastel pageantry of Pasade- na’s New Year’s Day Rose Bowl parades. Central Beijing started shutting down at noon two lines of troops with bullhorns swept across Tiananmen Square to evict thousands of strolling Chinese and foreign tourists. Bomb-sniffing German shepherds followed. Then offices and shops along the parade route were searched, locked and sealed by police. Before the sidewalks closed around the Forbidden City on Thursday, gray-haired Du Zhiy- ing, 70, was having his picture taken before the ever present portrait of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. “Our motherland has pros- pered,” said Du, who was in Tiananmen Square the day 50 years ago when the Great Helms- man, as Mao was known, declared the People’s Republic of China in ‘existence. Du came from Shanxi province for the celebration, but the life- long party bureaucrat said he was afraid he wouldn’t get within sight of today’s events. They were open only to officials and invited guests, and he was neither. Authorities tried to guarantee control by damping down pollu- tion, turning out itinerant work- ers and tuning off beepers and mobile telephones that might interfere with military com- munications. Beijing’s. pollution is so foul that it obscured the last display of military air power, in 1984 during the new China’s 35th anniversary. This year, factories got orders to shut down smoke-belching fur- naces 10 days before the event. No military parade was held for the 40th anniversary, a bleak celebration in 1989 that came just months after tanks and soldiers had made an unscheduled, blood- filled appearance on this same route and into Tiananmen Square to quell student-led protests. Then, no one wanted a reminder of the efficiency of Chi- na’s military. Now the mood is brighter. Chinese live much better than they did 50, 20, even 10 years ago. Life was grim in 1949 when Mao stood atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace to announce the meaning of his army’s victory in a vicious civil war. Hearts lifted with his proclamation of a new era: “We, the 475 million people of China, have now stood up.” Back then a peasant family may have shared a single pair of pants among 10 people, who took turns going outside. Life expect- ancy was 35 years, and education an extravagance for a small elite. Things didn’t change quickly. After a modest start at industrial- ization, expanded education and agricultural renewal, Mao’s notions of continuing revolution sent China into one chaotic frenzy after another. The Great Leap Forward. The Anti-Rightist Campaign. The Cul- tural Revolution. Behind the titles lay famine, smeared reputations and tens of millions of deaths. Into the mid- 1970s, Mao and his minions nearly wasted a generation of youth sent not to school, but to pound stones or dig potatoes. In exchange for the relative calm and bloom of prosperity brought by subsequent leaders — initiated with the reforms of the late Deng Xiaoping — the Chinese people have been forced to do without free expression and democracy. Economic gains have been remarkable since Deng’s reforms began in 1978. China has become the world’s 11th-largest trading power after a decade of average growth rates surpassing 10 per- cent a year. Life expectancy now is 71 years. Illiteracy is less than 15 percent, mostly among elderly and farmers. Yet stirrings of protest against political restrictions and uneven economic distribution have the Communist leadership on edge. To head off public dissent in the anniversary run-up, authori- ties have taken drastic steps. At least 16,000 migrant work- ers were expelled from Beijing, and thousands of Chinese without proper papers were dumped in detention centers. Beggars, peddlers and pros titutes were driven from streets Even Chinese tour groups were forbidden to enter the capital f the last two weeks. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 1, 1999 \f"

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — China put its arsenal of nuclear missiles on parade for only the second time in its history Friday. The rare show of thermonu- clear hardware was the crowning moment of a day of pageantry and power in which more than 500,000 carefully chosen patriots celebrated the SOth anniversary of the People’s Republic of China. This largest display of Commu- nist China’s military brawn car- ried a twofold message. One had a domestic audience, pumping a strong infusion of patriotism into a population at loose ideological ends without an anchoring set of national values. With no clear political blueprint to follow, pride and love of moth- erland are pitched as the national glue. The second target seemed to lie 90 miles off China’s coast, on Tai- wan, whose leaders have this year inched themselves to.the verge of declaring the island an indepen- dent state.

As China’s leaders watched the troops from atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace on Friday, rocket forces paraded three types of nuclear-capable missiles through Tiananmen Square. The most powerful weapon on display was China’s new three- stage Dongfeng-31, a mobile solid-fueled ballistic missile capable of landing a nuclear war- head up to 5,000 miles away in Hawaii, Alaska or parts of the state of Washington. Tractor-trailer trucks slowly hauled three Dongfeng-31s,; each encased in a heavy khaki-colored metal tube, past the reviewing stands. They were the last weap- ons to appear in the half-hour.mil- itary parade of 11,000 troops that also featured tanks, self-propelled cannons, marine commandos, goose-stepping honor guards and a flyover by 132 warplanes. .

But this was only the second military parade in Tiananmen Square in the last four decades, reported the state-run Xinhua news agency. The last such military parade took place in 1984, when Deng Xiaoping was consolidating his power eight years after the death of Mao.

        "ocr_text": "China vows new birth rate curbs By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — On the day world population was estimated to reached 6 billion, China con- founded speculation that it might relax its one-child policy for the next century. At a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday, officials of the world’s most populous country pledged a new “historical leap” in birth con- trol with a goal of ending all growth in China’s population by the mid-21st century. The objective is to stabilize China’s population at about 1.6 billion around 2045, by which time India is projected to be the most populous nation on the globe. Despite China’s long- standing target of just one child per family, its population still is growing by 1 percent a year — giving it 10 million new mouths to feed annually. The audience in the Great Hall of the People heard a letter from Premier Zhu Rongji, pledging the support of China’s top Communist leadership for “the whole set of family planning principles and measures that have long been effective.” Although the premier didn’t provide a blueprint of the ongoing population measures, they. include widespread promotion of IUDs, condoms and abortions, as well as heavy encouragement of female sterilization especially for women who have borne a second child. “Any mood of relaxation and blind optimism could lead to a rebound in our fertility rate and the deterioration of our popula- tion environment,” said Zhang Weiqing, director of China’s state family planning commission. Only a month ago, there were headlines in the Financial Times and other Western publications suggesting that China had decided to loosen its 20-year-old one-child policy, supposedly because leaders had concluded that China’s once-exploding popu- lation was under control. But one speaker after another took to the podium Tuesday to call for China to strive even harder to convince the Chinese masses to have fewer children in the new millennium. Liu Peng, deputy chief for pro- paganda of the Chinese Commu- nist Party Central Committee, said every newspaper and televi- sion station in China must run programs to publicize birth con- trol objectives. One purpose, he said, is to con- vince China’s 900 million villag- ers and small town dwellers that families get rich not by having more children but “by science and technology and working hard.” In many provinces, rural fami- lies have actually been governed by a de facto “one-son” policy in recent years. If a couple gives birth to a girl, they have another chance to create the son consid- ered so important to peasant farmers. The result has been that rural families having a girl first will continue trying for a boy, resort- ing to sex-selective abortions when ultrasound scans indicate a female fetus. Several provinces are trying to enforce prohibitions against the use of ultrasound for sex identification. i Urban families have continued to be under heavier pressure to stick with the one-child policy. While birth control has been almost exclusively an issue for married couples, singles are beginning to be targeted as well for purposes of both health and population. In major cities, especially around university campuses, con- dom machines have appeared in the last few months. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 13, 1999 \f"

In arare governmental effort to head off a Nobel award, China has made aseries of calls to the Nobel committee in Oslo, reportedly called in the Norwegian ambassa- dor to complain, and issued a stinging statement on Thursday warning against Western aggran- dizement of Chinese dissidents. Such a Nobel award would be “flagrant interference” in China’s internal affairs, said Foreign Min- istry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue. She was responding to reports that exiled dissidents Wei Jing- sheng and Wang Dan, both of whom served time in Chinese prisons for their political activity, might win the prestigious prize. “If these people win the prize, that is unacceptable to the Chi- nese people and the Chinese gov- ernment,” Zhang said at a minis- try briefing. “Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan had been sentenced to prison terms by the judicial depart- ments of China because of their engagement in activities that jeopardized national security and overthrowing the government,” she said. ‘“‘Now some people in Western countries have gone so far as to nominate these people as candi- dates for the Nobel Peace Prize. This constitutes a flagrant inter- ference in China’s internal af- fairs.” China is clearly nervous that the two are among possible favor- ites to win the prize, which will be announced today in Oslo at the Norwegian Nobel Institute. China is especially sensitive now to such an implied critique of its human rights policies, since this year it is touting the range of achievements scored in 50 years of communist rule. It doesn’t want the continuing celebration tar- nished by a Western anointment of two men it considers domestic saboteurs of the Chinese system. Reports out of Oslo quoted the Nobel committee secretary as saying he received several wor- ried telephone calls from Chinese officials. And Norway’s foreign ministry spokesman said Chinese officials summoned Norway’s ambassador and made other con- tacts to express concern, accord- ing to the Associated Press. Norwegian officials emphasize the Nobel committee is not a gov- ernment agency, but a private or- ganization. 3 Lancaster (Pennsylvania) Intelligencer-Journal - October 15, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Mian vs. panda: Who will win? Protection efforts may be too late as species dwindles -China — Normally, cabbages don’t threaten giant pandas. But here the big green plants shoulder up to the edge of a wind- ing, rock-pocked road, then creep in neat rows high up the most impossible-looking mountain terrain. The cabbage is one calling card of humanity inexorably pushing itself into misty wilderness heights, fragmenting the bamboo- forested mountain that supports the last clusters of the estimated 1,000 giant pandas living in the wilds of southwest China. Despite recent habitat protec- tions, wildlife experts assess con- tinuing human pressures as intense. They are not at all con- vinced that the enchanting animals will survive to amble through many new chapters in their 3 million-year history. “To save the panda species, we have a long way to go,” Liu Yong- fan of the State Forestry Adminis- tration told Chinese and Ameri- can scientists gathered recently at this nature reserve for a con- ference on pandas. China at least is inching down the route of protection. There are efforts to stop the human encroachment that has cut up panda territory and. divided the panda population, making genetic inbreeding a problem that could be deadly and leaving iso- lated, small groups susceptible to environmental crises that larger numbers could weather. Research is continuing to improve achievements made in captive panda breeding to assure the pandas survive somewhere. China has about 100 pandas liv- ing in captivity, most of them bred at Chinese zoos and research institutes and the rest captured in the wild. Now the Chinese are laying the groundwork for the possibility of reintroducing to the wild areas the pandas born in captivity. But money, knowledge and national will are in short supply. That is partly because people don’t know about the cabbages snaking up nature reserve moun- tains or the peasants still strip- ping forests for firewood or about the poachers and hunters whose snares may grab pandas by mis- take but kill them nonetheless, said Zhang Hemin, director of the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda. “In China, there is something wrong with the propaganda,” Zhang lamented in an interview. “People read about cloning and fae they think there is no problem now with the panda. Some say that in the wild there are no problems.” Zhang’s success is one reason for the blase attitude. Every time a panda gives birth at Zhang’s breeding center, the news is trumpeted around China by the official media. And before the panda confer- ence was half finished, Beijing newspapers published optimistic accounts of the still tentative hope Zhang had expressed in a speech to introduce captive-born pandas to the wild. Ethnic traditions at stake The prospect of reintroduction may be an exciting project, but it is fraught with difficulty under even the best of conditions. The newspapers did not men- tion that Zhang had failed to get state funding for the square-mile enclosure he wants to build high on the mountain to begin experi- mental training and instead will be lucky to finance a semi-wild area of one-fifth of a square mile. If any pandas become ready for release in the wild, a crucial question is whether there is enough wild to support them. One development that will help determine panda policy is a panda j rh om “ been delayed sev- JOSEPH P. ALBRIGHT / Staff Want to play? Logs are a jungle gym at Chengdu research site. according to Yan Xun, chief biolo- gist for China’s nature reserves. The survey is to begin early next year with the aim of generat- ing solid estimates on pandas and where they live. The last survey was finished in 1988. “If the population is decreasing very fast, maybe we will formu- late some strict policies to stop the spread of townships or even to remove some coinhabited areas,” Yan said. In Wolong, a 720-square-mile nature reserve, attempts to remove some peasant families who farm, hunt and collect wood were called off. The issue was sensitive because many residents are eth- nic Zang (of Tibetan origin) or Qiang, and Beijing has been under international fire else- where for ham-fisted tactics against minorities. “It was a question of the rights of animals versus the rights of people,” explained Deng Xiang- sui, director of wildlife conserva- tion here in Sichuan province, where 80 percent of the giant pandas are believed to live. ‘Panda corridors’ One crucial policy change already, he said, was the outlaw- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - ing of timber-cutting throughout the region last.fall.. This summer the government went further and prohibited the transport of lum- ber in protected areas, he said. Another goal frequently cited at the conference, run by the Minnesota-based Conservation Breeding Specialist Group, is set- ting up “panda corridors” to link reserves and other panda habitat now divided by roads, communi- ties or forest clear-cutting. Corridors would promote the mixing of animals from various geographic areas, potentially improving genetic diversity and giving pandas wider areas to for- age for food. Making such corridors is another tough goal, an example of “nascent ecology” that scientists don’t quite know how to accom- plish, according to Ulysses Seal, chairman of the American group. But something must be done to ease human pressure and better protect the remnants of the panda population, he said. His predic- tion: “Without intervention, I'd say in the next 100 years we’d see these fragmented [panda] popula- tions wink out one by one.” October 17, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Mayor wants Austin to go global City leaders’ trip to China designed to lay groundwork for future growth By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT AND Marcia KUNSTEL Cox News Service BEIJING — His head bursting with ideas and his pockets stuffed with Chinese business cards, Austin Mayor Kirk Watson flies home today deter- mined to start a three-year plan to en- hance Austin’s stature as a global city. The most visible payoff of the week- long trip by Watson and his 17-member delegation was a deal to create a new eatery in China’s largest province — to be called Sam’s Texas Barbecue Restaurant. But Watson didn’t come to China just for quick returns. He said he wants to lay the groundwork for relationships palate-blistering cuisines in the world. { Another highlight, Watson said, was sealing an agreement with a sleepy, tropical, rubber- producing county called Xishua- ngbanna to become one of Austin’s growing list of worldwide sister ities. Xishuangbanna is one of the 28 heavily ethnic autonomous counties in Yunan province, which became a sister province to the State of Texas in the 1980s. ‘ Nestled on China’s southern- most border with Laos and My- fnmar, the 900,000-population county is perhaps best known for its 400 “dragon mountains,” where monkeys and thousands of species of other rare creatures have lived for centuries in rain forests. The local Dai minority tribes consider the mountains to have awesome geomantic power. ; Though Xishuangbanna is far behind urban China in high-tech development, Watson said the county would prove an auspicious fit with Austin. He said its officials are eager to find foreign expertise that will build mutual benefits well into the next century. “Globalization doesn’t have to be just about high-tech,” Watson said. “It doesn’t have to be just about micro- chips. It can be about tortilla chips. It can be about Texas barbecue.” He said delegation member Sam Chen, a representative of the Austin Asian-American Chamber of Com- merce, cinched an agreement on Thursday to start the new restaurant in downtown Chengdu, the capital of Si- chuan province. The province, with a population of more than 100 million, is the heartland of Asia’s sizzlingly spicy Sichuan hot pot, one of the most to help develop its abundant re- Sources and cope with problems — issues as basic as wastewater treatment. ' “We weren’t looking just for a city in China that had a whole lot already happening,” Watson ex- plained. “We kind of liked the idea of looking at a city where there might be economic opportunities beyond some of the bigger cities.” Known officially as Xishuang- banna Dai Autonomous Prefec- ture, Austin’s sister region as- pires to develop trade through its ports on the Mekong River and to increase lucrative overseas tourism. Watson said its prospects are now constrained by its airport, which he said has no taxiway and can accommodate only four air- craft on the ground at one time. But the prefecture’s leaders are eager to grow, he said. Watson said that after his return to Austin, he wants to assemble a task force of academics, business people and foreign trade special- ists to help widen Austin’s outlook Austin American-Statesman - Austin Mayor Kirk Watson stands before the Chinese flag in Beijing.

He said he will ask these “best minds of Austin” to help him form a three-year plan for enhancing Austin’s Asian trade prospects. “Clearly, Austin stands a chance to be the portal for anyone internationally who wants to do business in the United States,” Watson said. The second step is creating an international trade organization, as many major American cities have done, to promote trade and serve as a conduit among the University of Texas, Greater Aus- tin Chamber of Commerce, Austin businesses and foreign clients. , Watson was accompanied on the trip by his wife, Liz, who chairs Austin’s sister cities programs around the world, and his 10- year-old son, Preston. The mayor said he, his family and other del- egation members paid their own expenses. Others on the trip included City Council Members Willie Lewis and Jackie Goodman, lawyer An- thony Goodall and water expert Chien Lee, a member of Austin’s Water and Wastewater Commission. After returning to work in Aus- tin for nine days, the mayor plans to fly again to Asia to continue promoting Austin’s high-tech im- age in Japan and South Korea. October 24, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Theodore Hall; Gave Secrets to Soviets By MYRNA OLIVER TIMES STAFF WRITER Theodore Alvin Hall, a physi- cist who helped develop the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, N.M., and was unmasked decades later for passing secrets to the So- viet Union, has died. He was 74. Hall, a native of New York City, died Nov. 1 of kidney cancer in Cambridge, England, where he had worked since 1962 in biologi- cal research. Soviet cable fragments declassi- fied by the U.S. National Security Agency in 1995 and 1996 identi- fied “Teodor Kholl” and “Savil Saks” as volunteer Soviet inform- ants—Hall and his Harvard room- mate, Saville Sax, who died in 1980. The FBI had questioned Hall and Sax in 195], but did not press charges for lack of evidence. The interrogating FBI agent, Robert McQueen, told the Washington Post in 1996 that he “was con- vinced that Hall was guilty, but I could never develop enough evi- dence to prosecute him.” Last year, Hall recalled for the British Broadcasting Corp. how the FBI interrogation ended: “I reached for my coat, I think, and I just got up and walked out. And step by step, waiting for the hand- cuffs to be put on before I walked into the elevator, expecting to be collared before I got on the eleva- tor. But I called for the lift, and it came, and I went in, and I got in and went downstairs, and walked out onto the street. And they didn’t come.” By the time the declassified ca- bles pinpointed Hall, so many wit- nesses had died that prosecution would have been extremely diffi- cult. Hall's spying was detailed in a 1997 book, “Bombshell: The Se- cret Story of American’s Un- known Spy Conspiracy,” by Jo- seph Albright and Marcia Kunstel. In a statement to Albright and Kunstel that year, Hall said he had been “immature, inexperi- enced and far too sure of myself” when he was working at Los Ala- mos. He added that, “I am no lon- ger that person—but I am by no means ashamed of him.” “During 1944,” he said, “I was worried about the dangers of an American monopoly of atomic weapons if there should be a post- war depression. To help prevent that monopoly, I contemplated a brief encounter with a Soviet agent, just to inform them of the existence of the A-bomb project. I anticipated a very limited contact. With any luck it might easily have turned out that way, but it was not to be.” Precociously intelligent, Hall entered Harvard University at age 16 and graduated at 18. He was only a year older, the young- est physicist on the Manhattan Project, when he went to Los Ala- mos. As detailed in the PBS docu- mentary “Red Files” last month, Los Angeles Times - November 24, 1999 Hall handed papers about the in- novative “implosion principle” to Lona Cohen, who fled to the So- viet Union with her husband and co-spy Morris Cohen after the ar- rest of better-known spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953. The Cohens were arrested in Britain and im- prisoned in 1961, but freed in a prisoner exchange with the Sovi- ets. It was long believed that American David Greenglass and German refugee Klaus Fuchs, the only people working at Los Ala- mos ever convicted as Soviet agents, gave the Soviets the first information on the implosion prin- ciple. Information about that theory, a new way to ignite an atomic bomb by using pressure, enabled the Soviets to build an atomic bomb years before they otherwise could have, Albright and Kunstel con- tended in their book that it was Hall who first divulged the implo- sion theory. Hall, burdened by his past but unrepentant, seized the chance at a one-year appointment at Cam- bridge University in 1962. He stayed on, working in biological research. In 1996, he said he con- sidered his greatest achievement to be developing electron micro- scopes for use in biological X-ray microanalysis. Hall is survived by his wife, Joan; daughters Ruth and Sara, and three grandchildren. Associated Press contributed to this story. \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Kashgar, China — This exotic Silk Road city doesn’t look, smell or sound like China. Mosques jut elegant minarets above the low skyline, calling the faithful to prayer in a Turkic- based tongue. Succulent, cumin- scented lamb chunks broil on sidewalk grills. And wall clocks in restaurants and shops brazenly herald the hour — two hours off official time. Despite Beijing’s best efforts tc tame this wild western region o! the world’s last Communis' empire, resentment still simmer: against Chinese rule. At times, it explodes. The huge region called Xinjiang ranks with Tibet and Taiwan among China’s most wor- risome political flash points. Today, Beijing suffers even greater angst after watching eth- nic rebellions elsewhere in the world — Chechnya, East Timor and most of all Kosovo, where NATO intervened on behalf of ethnic Albanians, mostly Muslims. Hostility is most widely and quietly marked in Xinjiang on the clocks and watches of ethnic Uighurs (pronounced “WEE- gurs”), the Muslim, Turkic- speaking descendants of the Huns. They live two hours behind Beijing time, following the rhythm of the sun instead of the central government’s mandate that all China observe the same time. It is perhaps the only safe pro- test allowed in this region 1,800 miles west of Beijing that has con- vulsed periodically in riots, J bombings and killings staged by Uighur activists. They are fight- ing for independence and full reli- | gious freedom in this land of } mountains and deserts that com- prises one-sixth of all China. “We have had the struggle against separatist activity throughout our history. It has never ceased,” acknowledged Ablait Abdureschit, governor of the Xinjiang (pronounced “SHIN- jyan”) Uighur Autonomous Region, and himself a Uighur who is loyal to China. “We will never allow splittists to separate Xinjiang from our motherland,” Abdureschit said in a recent interview in the modern regional capital, Urumqi, echoing the determined declarations of officials from the bottom of the bureaucracy to the top guns in Beijing. China’s two-pronged approach to subduing Xinjiang focuses on economic development, which is aimed at eliminating dissatisfac- jon with Chinese rule, and on strong-arm security aimed at eliminating those who express discontent anyway. Shi Shaolin, a Han Chinese and deputy commissioner of Kashgar prefect, is proud of the changes Chinese have brought to this city of 350,000 and to the still back- ward countryside. “After liberation, the central government invested lots of JOSEPH P. ALBRIGHT / Cox Newsnaners New China also brought mil- lions of Chinese, who helped develop the region and diluted ethnic mix. In 1949, the non- Chinese population was 93 per- ly Uighur, and Chinese 7 percent. By 1997, percent Kazak and other minorities. The Han Chinese got the best jobs in government and industry, and with their experience else- where are now making inroads in commerce, or so Uighurs say. “Young Uighur people have lit- tle chance to learn new things, like computers. Uighurs just work in trade. Or they are farm- ers,” said one Uighur. “Things change very slowly here for us.” The relatively high-paying oil industry is one example. The mid i] (ic cd id Oil Co. employ some 4,000 peo- ple, but only about 300 of them are Uighurs, according to Vice President Jia Chengzao. Irritation is palpable among Uighurs who refuse to go into Chinese restaurants, or who snicker in Uighur about Chinese officials ignorant of the language. Although Chinese leaders pro- claim they respect the local cul- ture and traditions, they some- times show little understanding of either. Two female government offi- cials, both Han Chinese who grew up in Xinjiang, laughed at a for- eign female guest who hurried to buy a scarf at the bazaar before walking into a mosque. The Chi- nese went bareheaded into the cavernous prayer room to meet with the chief imam. In other countries they would not be permitted to enter a mosque bareheaded, but here no one objected. One Uighur Muslim quietly thanked the foreign visi- tor for wearing a scarf. Uighurs know that protesting can cost them dearly. Simply speaking to a foreign visitor with- out authorization has landed some Uighurs in jail. And that is the second tactic of Beijing’s strategy here.

East Turkistan is the name around which independence- minded Uighurs rally. Two short- lived Republics of East Turkistan were proclaimed to exist here in Kashgar in 1933 and in Ili in the north in 1944, but both fell quickly to Chinese rule.

From March to June of each year, wind currents slash down from Siberia and collide with northbound airflows from the Ti- betan plateau. The result is killer sandstorms in which the sky blackens and the air fills with sand and gravel that hits like bird-shot. That’s why Taklimakan in local dialect means ‘‘go in and don’t come back out.” The summer isn’t much more pleasant. The sun bakes the desert floor until the temperature reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In the winter, the wind blows and the desert chills to 20 degrees below zero. One of every four barrels pro- duced in the Tarim Basin comes out of the ground here at the Lun- nan Oil Base, a cluster of buildings and oil processing apparatus huddled on hardscrabble waste- land 70 miles north of Taklima- kan’s first ridge of flowing sand dunes. Typical of the difficulties of working in the Tarim Basin, the Chinese are finding increasing volumes of brackish water flowing up the well casing along with the oil in Lunnan. And even though Lunnan’s 67 wells have been pro- ducing for only a decade or less, the Chinese are being forced to install some big mechanical rocker-arm pumps to bring up crude that used to flow up freely under natural pressure. Where’s the oil? The Tarim Basin now ranks as China’s seventh-largest oil’ field, far less than its original promise. But along with the oil, Chinese drillers have found impressive supplies of natural gas, which may be piped to eastern China and help replace dirty coal as the main heating source in Shanghai and other heavily polluted cities. Ta- rim’s proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 200 billion cubic meters. “At the beginning we hoped we could discover a huge oil reserve here,” acknowledged Jia Cheng- zao, deputy chief of China’s Tarim oil and gas prospecting zone. ‘But from our experience, we have found more gas than oil.” Although the Chinese have had some successes on their own ex- ploration blocks, nothing the | further from the sea than any other point on the giobe. Western drillers have tried: here has paid off. Because the suspected oil layers lie up to 20,000 feet below the dunes, drillers are forced to use new and expensive wildcatting tricks, including three- dimensional seismic mode : digital simulation and _ high- pressure jetting for super-deep drilling. And the high-tech hasn’t been working. Exxon, which has been hunting for oil in the Taklimakan since 1993, is the only Western company still drilling. Unless Exxon’s for- tunes get better, it may pull out before long. An Exxon spokesman in Dallas said the oil company was not cur- rently drilling in the Tarim Basin, but Jia confirmed that Exxon is now drilling a wildcat well on one of its New Jersey-sized lease- holdings on the northwestern edge Of tne desert and snowid learn within two months ifit isa winner. Jia said Exxon already abandoned another similar-sized block after another wildcat well found no commercial-sized oil deposits. The Exxon spokesman did not turn follow-up phone calls in- quiring about the exploratory well of which Jia spoke. British Petroleum, which won one of the first lease blocks in 1993, has already dropped out after finding nothing. Texaco and Agip, which hold the rights to explore a territory bigger than Wisconsin, have drilled two dry holes and have told the Chi- nese they have no plans for further exploration, according to Jia. The Agip-Texaco leases are due to ex- pire at the end of December. The Taklimakan hasn’t been tamed so far, Maybe it never will be. Austin American-Statesman - November 28, 1999 (Continued) \f"

At midnight tonight, the 446-year-old colony will begin self-rule under Chinese sovereignty. @ Portugal eager to hand over its longtime colony to Chinese sovereignty By JoSEPH ALBRIGHT AND Marcia KUNSTEL American-Statesman International Staff MACAU — The checkered his- tory of this indolent 446-year-old Portuguese enclave is about to end, and few are weeping as China prepares to take over. Macau is where the Hollywood swashbuckler Errol Flynn tried to recoup his gambling losses by in- troducing cock-fighting in the 1930s. It is where spies and mercenar- ies flocked to swap stories during World War II when the rest of the world honored Portugal’s neu- trality and transformed Macau into the Casablanca of Asia. Four hundred years ago Macau was far richer. Portuguese traders dined on plates of gold, enjoying the fruits of a century-long world monopoly on trade in silk, gold, porcelain and silver with Japan and China. Yet there was always a seamy side to Macau’s wealth. The Por- tuguese imported slaves from Af- rica to heave cargo onto sailing schooners. Some of the slaves would escape on boats and turn into the legendary pirates of the South China Sea. Macau also had its share of the opium trade. Revenues from Macau’s shal- low seaport evaporated when ee | a eigee Britain seized the deep- -water port of Hong Kong in 1841 and it be- came the linchpin of the region’s commerce. About 20 years later Portuguese Gov. Isidoro Fran- cisco Guimaraes saved Macau Irem ruin py granung wwe IIrst gambling licenses. Out of all this, Macau has grown into one of the oldest, most lucra- tive gambling resorts in the world. With casinos have come wide- open prostitution and police cor- ‘ruption, along with recurrent battles between Chinese Triad critninal syndicates in which 35 people have died just this year. Twelve- years ago China and Portugal had no trouble agreeing that the Portuguese should end their occupation, setting a dead- line just before the millennium. Both sides have stuck to this pact with little friction. And to- night, 2,500 guests from Portugal, Macau and China are due to dine here in a temporary steel-and- glass banquet hall that will look like a giant Chinese lantern over- looking the Pearl River estuary. Just before midnight they will toast the end of nearly 450 years of Portuguese occupation. When the clock in the Macau cathedral strikes midnight, Portugal will lower its flag on the last and oldest Western enclave in Asia. Atone instant after midnight on Dec. 20, the flag of the People’s Republic of China will rise over Macau. An assemblage of Chinese communist dignitaries, including President Jiang Zemin, will smile with satisfaction. Macau to end days a as Portuguese enclave ‘Fireworks will light thesky, and this 8-square-mile territory will become part of China under a guarantee of 50 years of self-rule under Chinese sovereignty, in a form of self-government similar to Hong Kone’s. Quickly to be sworn in as the new Macau governor is one of Macau’s richest businessmen, 44- year-old Canadian-educated banker Edmund Ho Hau-wah. Al- ready a member of the Beijing Communist establishment, Ho isa Macau delegate on China’s pow- erful standing committee of the National People’s Congress in Beijing. Among the most prominent and powerful participants in the evening will be billionaire gam- bling proprietor Stanley Ho, 77, whose corporation operates all of Macau’s 10 gambling casinos un- der a monopoly franchise he was granted by Portuguese authorities when he submitted the highest bid 37 year's ago. Though the new governor and the gambling proprietor are not blood relatives, they are friends and fellow shareholders in Macau’s television network. The casino proprietor was one of the most influential backers of the governor's selection. Vietnam =. By tart te most ot important de- cision confronting Gov. Ho will be whether to renew Stanley Ho’s gambling monopoly when the current Macau casino license ex- pires in 2001. Stanley Ho’s compa- ny has reportedly been paying the Macau treasury 31.8 percent of the calculated net profits of the casi- nos, or about $750 million a year. Everyone is waiting to see whether the new governor splits up the franchise, issuing 10 new licenses for each of the 10 casinos, or lets Stanley Ho keep his Macau gambling monopoly. Not content to rely on chance, Stanley Ho has been busily developing a new Austin American-Statesman - December 19, Area: 23.6 sq. km (10 sq. miles Population: 430,0) Chinese 95% / 2% Portuguese 3% _ Other S 3 Economy: GDP $6.9 billion (1998) Contributors to GDP Gambling galls Tourism 50% wo Other: _ Mainly textiles, fireworks 25% Real growth rate: Asian financial C crisis hit Macau hard oe 19920 13. 5% -27.3% EEE 1. 996 has been eager for two decades to liquidate this last remnant of its empire, s0 long as it can do so with a modicum of dignity. Another is that Portugal never encouraged strong Hong Kong- style democratic institutions ei- ther in Macau or any of its colo- nies. So Macau has no real focal point for anti-Beijing protests of the kind that broke out in Hong Kong before the British colony's handover. “People in Macau are not so concerned about democratic pro- tections, or even about human Philippines. But at least in the first few weeks, this will be a far less con- tentious, emotion-packed han- dover than when the British somewhat reluctantly turned over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. As the Chinese takeover ap- proaches, almost no public dissent has arisen among the 9 percent of 440,000 Macau residents who speak Chinese as a first language.

        "ocr_text": "Yeltsin leaves a mixed legacy from 8 years in power By Cuarnces W. Ho_MeEs, JOSEPH ALBRIGHT AND MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service MOSCOW — Boris Yeltsin, who flirted with greatness in leading his country out of the communist wil- derness, leaves a mixed legacy from his eight tumultuous years in power. The snowy-haired Yeltsin helped topple the Soviet Union and wenton to become the first popularly elected leader in 1,000 years of Russian history. Yet he ended his career in frustra- tion and sad irony. { Ailing and at times politically \\irrelevant in his last years in office, } Yeltsin was unable to fully transform Russia into a workable democracy. The country he left behind continues a painful, lurching transition. The Russian Federation, which r Yeltsin created in 1991 from therubble | of Mikhail Gorbachev's disintegrat- _ ing Soviet Union, enjoys more social freedoms and economic diversity. His pinnacle moment came when he stood yan a coup attempt against Gor- ‘bachev by climbing atop a tank and tallying democratic forces, an Appearance that former British Prime “ Minister John Major would call “sheer raw courage.” Yeltsin wrought huge change, but did not complete the conversion or achieve what he said were his greatest goals: to bring Russia tranquility and widespread prosperity. The former superpower continues to struggle to feed and care for its people, and cope with wild “bandit” capitalism and deep government corruption. Indeed, the 68-year-old Yeltsin acknowledged in his resignation speech Friday that he had failed to solve many of Russia’s most vexing problems. “I’ve done whatI could,” he said. Yeltsin was a colorful figure who rose to prominence as a friend to the common man. In his prime, he was bigger than life, projecting an image of a fearless, benevolent leader who could swig a glass of Russia’s cher- ished vodka, dictate domestic policy and maintain Russia’s prominence on the world stage. . Yet to keep his new country from tumbling into civil war, Yeltsin twice unleashed internal violence on ascale unseen since the days of Josef Stalin. Among the most memorable images of his a -vear Kremlin rule ussian tanks blitzing the Rus- sian parliament building in October 1993 and Yeltsin's forces laying waste to Grozny, the capital of upstart Chechnya republic on Russia’s southern flank in a botched, unpopu- lar 1994-96 war. A new war against Muslim separatists in Chechnya continues today. In both cases, Yeltsin said force was necessary to keep the country united. His reputation never recovered. Indelible, too, are more recent scenes of a frail, sick man clinging to his presidency from his plush country houses while his thread- bare country — suffered under severe economic depression. He underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery in November 1996. He fired the entire government several times, often for little apparent reason, and damaged his democratic credentials by resorting to force to solve political disputes. Yeltsin’s hopes of disbanding the “socialist command economy” at home met with only limited success. Despite his sweeping decrees in _ favor of private ownership, nearly all | farmland is tilled by Soviet-style col- lective farms as Yeltsin has not pushed land ownership laws through _ parliament, The economy remains a _ confusing, chaotic hybrid, with 70 percent of factories privatized. But many mega-enterprises, including the gas industry, remain as state- controlled monopolies. Under his @ stewardship, Russia’s gross domestic FOCUS ON YELTSIN product plunged and the buying power of ordinary Russians faded under periodic bouts of runaway inflation. In recent years Yeltsin has became more and more insular. He has suf: fered “acute loneliness” in ruling the nation, he confessed in his 1994 autobiography. At times he turned to alcohol for solace, appearing tipsy at public events or behaving erratically, One of the most embarrassing episodes. was a September 19% refueling stop in Ireland, when Yeltsin simply failed to leave his airplane to acknowledge the welcoming troops and digni- taries turned out on the tar- mac, including the country’s prime minister. With all his imperfections, Yeltsin wasembraced by American and other Western leaders as the best hope to make democracy and free enterprise work in Russia, the nuclear-armed behemoth where communists and ultranationalists still draw signifi- cant followings. Despite profound problems at home, he managed to maintain Rus- sia’s Tole as a major player on the world stage, asserting diplomatic influence on the world’s two hot spots of the last decade, Iraq and the Balkans. . Among Yeltsin’s world-changing achievements was signing the 1991 Byelovezhskaya agreement that shattered the old Soviet empire by making Russia, Ukraine and Belarus . independent countries, Dayton Daily News - January 1, 2000 \f"
