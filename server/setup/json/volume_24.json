        "ocr_text": "Kuwait recovering, but shock of war lingers. 2 years later, fea threat still looms By Joseph Albright i ORES ONT { i ex uwait City — Fisher- men are catching healthy fish. Oil produc- tion is near normal. De- ‘mocracy is around the corner. ‘But on the second anniversary of tthe Iraqi invasion, Kuwait is still ‘a nation in shock. : “People are frightened,” said ‘political scientist Ghanim Najjar. ‘A catastrophe took place without ‘anyone seeing it coming. The ‘cause of that catastrophe is still in /power and still threatening us.” : The Kuwaiti crown prince, :Sheik-Saad Sabah, says, ‘“‘Our en- ‘emy is still armed. ... Can we :sleep on silk pillows in the face of this?” i With Saddam Hussein still \\keering down at them from the i ; most Kuwaitis have no use ze 3 ideology of “Arab broth- verhood” that has dominated Arab intellectual life since ‘the date 19th century. : Instead, Kuwaitis find them- Yselves clinging to the once-re- | viled United States as a security blanket. Probably not since the Uaited States helped to create Is- tin 1948 has it had such a Eeptopliant client state in the Mid- 4e8 erias4 ne general public thinks “hat: Kuwait should become the Sastsstate or that we should make Fa-treaty for 100 years,” said Abd- ' ullah Nibari, an editor and former ‘ member of Parliament. “It is only | the.. .intellectuals who realize we t bank on American support ' as though it will be there forever.” | Good life reviving ‘ -. For a Western reporter re- ‘ turning for the first time since : the chaotic, joyous festival fol- +: lowing Kuwait’s liberation, the , initial impression is that the good life has returned remarkably fast to the languid welfare state. No more oily smoke blots the sky — thanks to the Boots & Coots, Red Adair and rs ers who quenched 603 oil fires in only seven months last year. True, the desert remains in- fested with thousands of land mines. And gooey lakes of oil spread across 3,500 acres. Be- cause of all this, the authorities operate roadblocks that keep most Kuwaitis out of three- fourths of their own country. But in Kuwait City, the only visual evidence of the hellfires is that skyscrapers look like they need a bath. Today, the war’s clearest eco- logical legacy is more frequent dust storms caused by the mas- sive disturbance of the desert surface, says Ibrahim Hadi, Ku- wait’s director of environmental protection: So far, international researchers have found no no- ticeable human health effects, Mr. Hadi said. Social scars remain The demographic changes have been far more profound. Despite international criticism, Kuwait has carried out a hard- boiled policy of deporting or scaring out Arab population groups suspected of wholesale collaboration with the Iraqi oc- cupiers. Only about 40,000 Pales- tinians remain of the 400,000 who made up Kuwait’s second- largest population group. The Kuwaiti press last week carried an anti-Arab commen- tary that would raise hackles even if published in Israel. ‘Arab peoples from time immemorial have been no more than herds of sheep controlled by shepherds,” wrote Kuwaiti columnist Faisal Rasman in the newspaper al-Qa- bas, warning against giving Ar- abs too much freedom. i Probably never before has a country made such a rapid mate- rial recovery from being sacked. There are no shortages. At the futuristic Sultan Cen- ' ter supermarket, Kuwaitis and expatriates can buy American- imported T-bone steaks for $10.20 a pound, along with five varieties of fresh grapes, 11 vari- eties of mustard, 14 brands of ketchup and 25 kinds of vinegar. At the fresh fish market on Arabian Gulf Street, Kuwaiti brokers auction dozens of variet- ies of Persian Gulf fish every af- ternoon. Health officials say Ku- waiti waters at the head of the gulf were not polluted, because currents carried oil spills south- ward toward Saudi Arabia. Profits down, deficit up Business is slow, merchants admit, because the Palestinian ‘clientele has vanished. In place of the Palestinians, Kuwait has imported Egyptian,- Indian and Bangladeshi laborers, who gen- erally have not been allowed to bring their families. While commercial profits are down, no one with Kuwaiti citi- zenship is hurting. Kuwaitis face no taxes, no unemployment, no fees for attending the fully func- tioning hospitals and universities. To pay for all this and also re- pay the Western allies for fighting the war, the emir, Sheik Jaber Ah- med Sabah, and his government have liquidated more than half of Kuwait’s $100 billion portfolio of foreign investments. Kuwait also has run a $70 billion government budget deficit over the last two years — amounting to about a dec- ade’s worth of oil revenues. Happily for Kuwait, the great Burgan oil field, the second most prolific oil puddle in the world, has sprung back to life far more rapidly than anyone thought pos- sible when it was spouting flames only a year ago. Thanks to a legion of Filipino and other Third World oil field hands supervised by California’s Bechtel Corp., Kuwait’s national- ized oil company is reopening the Iraqi-destroyed wells at the rate of one every nine days and is drilling one new well every 23 days. About 260 of the 900 wells are producing, and the output is two- thirds of Kuwait’s prewar produc- tion. Kuwait already is exporting. nearly 1 million barrels a day. ‘POWs’ haunt survivors Though Kuwait’s material wounds are mending, many Ku- waitis say they are troubled about the country’s future, as well as their own. Almost every Kuwaiti family feels aggrieved and dishonored by the disappearance of neigh- bors or relative, grabbed from Kuwait by the Iraqi occupiers, never to be heard from again. Kuwait now counts 850 citizens as Iraqi “prisoners of war.”’ If there is any trauma anti- dote on the horizon, it is the Ku- waiti parliamentary elections that the emir, head of the ruling Sabah family, has agreed to hold in October. Kuwaiti pro-democracy lead- ers complain that the Sabahs and a coterie of super-rich Kuwaiti commercial families have limited the franchise to males over 21 whose ancestors were registered Kuwaiti subjects in 1920. The vot- ing rules will mean that only 90,000 of the 600,000 Kuwaitis are eligible. Among the 1,000 male Sabah heirs and the handful of powerful Sabah women, there reportedly is a split on whether it is wise to al- low even this watered-down ver- sion of parliamentary democracy. \\ e Kuwaitis view a captured Iraqi armored vehicle on display Saturday in Kuwait City.

        "ocr_text": "By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT uwait City — Flak-jacketed Kuwaiti soldiers stood guard. outside the U.S. Embassy on Monday as more than 6,000 Ameri- can troops began taking positions for military exercises that some high- ranking Kuwaitis think are aimed at toppling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. “The Americans are coming in, yes, for joint maneuvers, and yes, to show support commitment to the se- curity of Kuwait,’’ said Princess Ra- sha Sabah, the newly appointed head of the political department of the emir’s court ministry. “But I also feel that in light of what has happened inside Iraq with the U.N. inspectors, that if that tyrant continues his histrionics, these guys and brave girls will be on hand to do him in once it is needed.”’ A first cousin of the ruling emir’s with a doctorate in literature from Yale University, Princess Rasha was named with considerable fanfare last week to advise the emir on foreign policy, defense and environmental issues. In the half-century since oil was discovered in Kuwait and Saudi Ara- bia, there has been only one U.S. ground exercise in the Persian Gulf region that matches the coming. string of Pentagon exercises in size and complexity. That was Operation Desert Shield, the precursor to last year’s Persian Gulf War. Events in Iraq served to keep ten- sion high. U.N. officials reported that a doc- tor working with an aid group jn northern Iraq was shot in the arm and stomach, and shots were fired at a uniformed U.N. guard in Baghdad. Iraq offered no explanation for the incidents, the U.N. officials said. From a purely military perspec- tive, the string of interlocking exer- cises could have three effects that no U.S. or Kuwaiti official is acknowl- edging: ® Saddam and his generals must contemplate whether to declare a military alert to guard against the prospect of an American cross-bor- der raid into southern Iraq. Yet by declaring an alert, Saddam might put arms and ammunition at the disposal of military units that could try to overthrow him. & Once the Sth Special Forces Group arrives from Fort Campbell, Ky., the United States will have pre- mier specialists in deep reconnais- sance operations, psychological war- Associated Press U.S. Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., ee a camouflage net on Monday in Kuwait City.

Fear remains in Kuwait that Ira- qi agents will try to disrupt the U.S. exercises using similar terror tac- tics, possibly by trying to hit the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy. ““I do believe that there are a lot of people still here who are either plant- ed or who remained and who have very powerful sympathy for Saddam Hussein and his ideology,’’ Princess Rasha acknowledged. She said that is why her brother, the interior minis- _ ter, has called on all Kuwaiti citizens to redouble their vigilance against a pro-Iraqi ‘‘fifth column.’’ : Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 4, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "CIS. MAarines storm ashore mn Rhuarwwvait Many resiaents ship cash abroad By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Kuwait City — A 1,900-man U.S. Marines expeditionary unit came ashore in helicopters and landing craft Tuesday to begin several months of combat exer- cises that have frightened Ku- waitis and drawn criticism from neighboring Iraq and Iran. “We are here for any contin- gency, and if we are asked for anything, we are ready,” said - Marine Col. Michael Hagee, 47, who led a Marine special opera- tions unit in Europe until two years dgo. Along with his Marine infantry troops, Colonel Hagee took ashore a platoon of Navy Seals, reporters were told in a shipboard briefing. With the U.S. Army Special Forces Group, due soon from ' Fort Campbell, Ky., the Marines and Seals give President Bush a potent commando force in Ku- wait if he chooses to deploy it. _ The Kuwaiti opposition news- aber Al-Oabas accused the gov- ernment of whipping up a crisis atmosphere. Both Al-Qabas and banking sources reported that there had been a run on dollars and that millions had been transferred abroad, with one customer alone demanding $500,000 in cash. “This is what is happening in spite of the fact that most believe that [Iraqi President] Saddam {Hussein} cannot reoccupy Ku- wait, although some are afraid of stray rockets,” Al-Qabas said. | The anxiety level was height: ened further by an American Embassy circular that reviewed crisis procedures, while stress- ing no threats were imminent. Iran scoffed at Kuwait for feeling threatened by Baghdad, and accused the United States of looking for cheap oil. “Although we condemn Iraq’s ludicrous territorial claims on Kuwait, we believe that the Iraqi regime is so weak- ened that such pronouncements should not be taken seriously,” said an editorial in the English- language Tehran Times, which usually reflects official policy. n official Iraqi newspape Tuesday called Kuwait’s leaders “stooges” for permitting the joint maneuvers, the Iraqi News Agency said. “Washington aims at keeping the rulers of Kuwait captives to their illusions of what the White House calls the security umbrel- la,” the newspaper Al-Thawra was quoted as saying. It, too, ac- cused the United States of trying to control the region’ s oil. Adding eerie realism to the U.S. landing exercise, a Kuwaiti air raid siren began wailing just as the last Marines rolled off their World War II-style landing crafts in Desert Storm-era HUMVEEs. Instead of storming a beach, the Marines drove through 20 feet of surf and then up a concrete ramp at a Kuwaiti port. ’“Anything’’the president’ de- cides, we are here to do it,” said Cpl. Ignacio “Pappy” Perez, 23, of Brownsville, Texas, as he cruised toward the Kuwaiti shore - ina lightly rocking landing craft. Two dozen U.S. journalists, including three U.S. network camera teams, were invited to ride ashore in a landing craft — which means Saddam could watch the opening or tne war ercises in living color. The Marines pitched tents at Camp Monterey, a previously un- disclosed U.S. base in northwest- ern Kuwait about 25 miles from the Iraqi border. The surrouiid- ing terrain is rolling sand dunes, with virtually no Iraqi defenses at the undelineated frontier. In all, more than 5,000 U.S. troops from all branches of the military are to take part in the desert exercises with about 1,900 Kuwaitis, officials say. _ Operation Eager Mace, which concludes Aug. 19, is the first of three combined U.S,-Ku- waiti maneuvers over the next several months. The next tele- vised event is scheduled on Fri- day, when Kuwaiti Air Force helicopters are to land aboard a U.S. Navy ship off Kuwait. Whether or not by coinci- dence, the first U.S.-Kuwaiti ma- neuvers are scheduled tobe opened to TV coverage the same day a new team of United Na- tions weapons inspectors is due to arrive in Baghdad on another potentially touchy weapons’ In. spection mission.

        "ocr_text": "Pressure builds on Serb leaders as U.N. drafts resolution on fo force By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — New interna- tional pressures suddenly are bearing hard on Serbian leaders, including a U.N. resolution ex- pected by midweek to authorize “all measures necessary” to en- sure that humanitarian aid is de- livered to Bosnians under siege by Serb militiamen. The United States and Euro- pean allies on the U.N. Security Council agreed Monday on the wording of the resolution, a sweeping authorization that for | the first time would allow region- | al military organizations suchas AY Serbian soldier fires a 105mm howitzer | during an artillery fight near Teslic on Sunday. — The village is about 100 miles from Sarajevo. NATO to act on behalf of the United Nations. Russia was described as “ex- Th tremely helpful” in the effort, even though Russian leaders have come under some domestic pressure not to act against the Serbs, who have traditional ties with Russians. The linkage of military force to the delivery of humanitarian aid was believed . to make the resolution accept- able to the Russians. China, the only other Security Council member that could veto the reso- lution, may abstain. Also Monday, the U.N. Hu- man Rights Commission adopted an American initiative and voted to conduct an inquiry later this week into “the rapidly deterio- rating human rights situation” in the region, according to State De- partment spokesman Richard Boucher. Besides taking up the use-of- force authorization Wednesday, the Security Council is expected to issue a demand that all parties in the bloody conflict open deten- tion centers to inspection by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Recent reports of horrific conditions in Serb-run detention camps released an outpouring of revulsion in Europe and the United States, leading finally to government action. The most powerful of all these measures is the resolution that in draft form calls on U.N. member states to use all means necessary to facilitate the deliv- ery of humanitarian aid to Sara- jevo or other places in Bosnia- Herzegovina. It places no limits on what kind of force may be used or at what it may be directed. The only limitation is that measures em- ployed must be on behalf of sup- plying aid, which could be inter- preted very broadly. “One of the objectives of the United States in seeking such open-ended language is to leave all military options open,” said Jeffrey Laurenti, director of multilateral studies for the Unit- ed Nations Association, a private think tank that studies and pro- motes the United Nations. The resolution as now drawn gives the member states “carte blanche authority from the coun- cil for whatever action that the national commanders in chief think expedient,” he said. That technically could range from guarding truck convoys to air strikes on the Yugoslav capi- tal of Belgrade as the supply cen- ter for Serb troops fighting: in Bosnia. The Serbs have overrun two-thirds of Bosnia and are pre- venting food and medicine from reaching isolated concentrations of Croats and Slavic Muslims. The resolution not only au- thorizes states to act individual- ly, but also permits action by re gional military organizations such as NATO or the West Euro- pean Union, according to U. N, of. ficials. “NATO authorities are: re- viewing options and they are planning for what NATO might do to assist in ensuring that hu- manitarian assistance gets to those in need,” Mr. Boucher said. The resolution as drafted means NATO troops would be authorized not only to fly in sup- plies or give logistical aid, as had been envisioned in some scenari- os. The NATO command struc- ture could be given the task of military defense of aid deliver- ies, including air strikes at Serb artillery positions and ground es- corts for truck convoys. After the Sarajevo airport was Closed several days last week due to heavy fighting, it re- ceived an estimated 500 metric tons of relief supplies over the weekend in 41 flights, seven of them involving U.S. planes and crew, according to Mr. Boucher. He said as many as 24 flights were expected to land Monday. Atlanta Journal- Constitution August 11, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "International team helps the Kowwasiti oul industry stage a fast comeback By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Burgan Oil Field, Kuwait — An international gang of oil-field hands has made oil gush again from the doused inferno called Kuwait. “If anyone had told me last year we’d be producing a million barrels of oil a day, I’d say he was crazy,” said Jim Jackson, 56, of Sour Lake, Texas. ‘Last year at this time we had nearly 650 wells in Kuwait still on fire.” After 38 years in oil patches from Texas to Trinidad to the North Sea, Mr. Jackson turned up in Kuwait right after the war. He worked first as an admin- istrative sidekick for Boots and Coots, a company specializing in putting out oil-well fires. Now he bosses the crews of three fast- moving drilling rigs that are reactivating the Kuwait Oil Co.’s scorched wells at the rate of one every six to eight days. Americans, Britons in charge Mr. Jackson is part of an polyglot army of oil-field hands numbering in the tens of thou- sands. They are mainly Filipinos, Indians, Bangladeshis and Egyp- tians — with a few Americans and Britons as supervisors. Tom Cain, 42, who used to work the oil fields at the U.S. Na- val Petroleum Reserve in Cali- fornia, is new to Burgan. “T’ve never seen anything like this field,” he said. “It’s pretty amazing that all these wells were running wide open for a year and there is so little damage [to the producing capacity].” Mr. Cain said Burgan is an oil driller’s dream — “a high-vol- ume, low-pressure field” that is “the most producible field I’ve ever seen.” Two strokes of luck After the oil fire catastrophe, ; Kuwait has enjoyed two stroke: of fortune. First, the fires were quenched much faster than the: experts anticipated. Then, the’ capped wells turned out to:b easy to restart. the wells,” said Mr. Jackson “Now we think it is going to b way closer to 90 percent, andi maybe 100 percent.

Human Rights Commission adopted an American initiative and voted to conduct an inquiry later this week into ‘the rapidly deteriorat- ing human rights situation” in the region, according to State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, In one more warning sign to the Serbian-controlled state of Yugoslavia, the United States extended stronger backing to the three states that broke away. Boucher announced Washington is moving immediately to establish full diplomatic relations with Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Milan Panic, the U.S. businessman who last month became premier of Yugoslavia, said “West- ern intervention could lead to disaster.” He said Yugoslavia, now comprising only Serbia and Mon- tenegro, would have to defend itself if attacked, Panic, speaking during a one-day trip to Greece and Albania, said any Western intervention “could ~ trigger a full-scale guerrilla war in Bosnia and a second Vietnam in the Balkans,” Besides taking up the use-of-force authorization . Wednesday, the Security Council is expected to - issue a demand that all parties in the blood WASHINGTON — The United States, Britain and conict op parties in the bloody France agreed Monday on a draft resolution authoriz» ing “all measures necessary” to ensure relief is conflict open detention centers to inspection by the International Committee of the Red Cross, It was recent revelations of horrific conditions in Serbian-run detention camps that released an outpouring of revulsion in Europe and the United States, finally leading to action by governments. The most powerful of these measures is the draft resolution that apparently authorizes force to keep supply routes into Bosnia open. In draft form, the resolution calls on U.N, member states to use all means necessary to ensure - delivery of humanitarian aid to Sarajevo or other places in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It does not limit force or at what it may be directed. The only limitation is that measures must be employed to supply aid. Member states would have “carte blanche au- thority for whatever action national commanders- in-chief think expedient,” said Jeffrey Laurenti, director of multilateral studies for the United Nations Association, a private think tank that studies and promotes the U.N. That technically could range from guarding truck convoys to air strikes on the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade as the supply center for Serbian troops fighting in Bosnia. They have overrun two-thirds of the country and are preventing food and medicine from reaching isolated concentrations of ethnic Croatians and Slavic Muslims. Although the Yugoslav government has denied direct troop involvement in the conflict, the Yugo- slav military widely is held to be the source of weapons stocks and other supplies fortifying the Serbs with arms in Bosnia. The resolution not only authorizes states to act individually, but also permits action by regional military organizations such as NATO, “NATO authorities are reviewing options and they are planning for what NATO might do to assist in ensuring that humanitarian assistance gets to those in need,” Boucher said Monday. The resolution as drafted means NATO troops not only could fly in supplies or give logistical aid, but also could defend aid deliveries with air strikes at Serbian artillery positions and escorts for truck convoys. After several days’ closure last week due to heavy fighting, Boucher said the Sarajevo airport received about 500 metric tons of relief supplies during the weekend in 41 flights, seven of them involving U.S. planes and crew.

Security Council was ready to vote over- whelmingly today to authorize “all measures necessary” to get aid to suffering Bosnians. Military action would not follow immediate- ly. But such a strong international flex of muscle well may bolster one more effort Friday to restore peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina by dip- lomatic means. Lord Carrington of Great Britain, the top Yugoslavia peace negotiator for the Economic Community, has arranged meetings in Brussels among leaders of the six states that made up Yugoslavia before Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina declared indepen- dence. The two remaining united as Yugoslavia are Serbia and Montenegro. Permanent military representatives of the 16 NATO nations will meet Friday in Brussels to discuss ways to implement the Security Council resolution authorizing all means, including mili- tary, to deliver humanitarian aid should fight- ers continue blocking access. The resolution is expected to permit individ- ual states to act, if coordinated with the United Nations, but also will specifically authorize for the first time regional organizations to use military force on behalf of U.N. aid efforts. Any major decision such as sending troops to Yugoslavia would almost certainly require scores of diplomatic and military contacts in- volving dozens of capitals over several weeks. But diplomats hope that simply the threat of action — one widely backed in the international community — will be a sobering jolt sufficient to calm the chaotic hostilities preventing aid from reaching thousands of Bosnians. “There is a solid majority in place,” said John Tessitore, a spokesman for the United Nations Association in New York, which tracks U.N. activities, “You should look for China and Zimbabwe to abstain, and the rest are expected to vote in favor,” he said. “This would result in a 13-0 vote with two abstaining, which tells you that the Third World is strongly supporting what some would call intervention in a nation’s internal affairs.” He said Belgium also will co-sponsor, Russian leaders have held some reluctance to act in this crisis, since Russia has traditional ties with the people of Serbia, who are largely faulted for the worst of the assaults. Serbs who expected Russia’s support will find its co- sponsorship of the resolution a blow. If U.N. members do decide to take up arms, American and Russian soldiers could become fighting allies for the first time since World War IT. They have not even served together on U.N. peace-keeping forces since 1948. Russia, other republics of the former Soviet Union and East European nations all are affili- ated with NATO through the new North Atlantic Coordination Council, Palm Beach Post - August 13, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Baker’s departure raises foreign policy concerns He'll be leaving unfinished work joseph Albri: and Mercia Kurete dei STAFF WRITERS Washington — Secretary of State James Baker swept off the global stage Thursday, leaving fans crying for encores and dis- tressed that the foreign policy show might fold without him. As Mr. Baker and his top aides move to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., the Bush administration is in the rare predicament of hav- ing to juggle two foreign crises simultaneously — both involving the risk of shooting wars. Another crisis-of human suf- fering stands virtually untended by the international community in Somalia, where hundreds are dying daily of starvation and civ- il war. In the Adriatic Sea off Yugo- slavia, a U.S. Marine expedition- ary unit from Camp Lejeune, N.C., is positioned for duty in Bosnia- “Herzegovina if diplama- __ cy fails. And in Kuwait, Marines from California and Army troops from Texas maneuver just south of the Iraqi border, ready for an- other go at Iraqi President Sad- dam Hussein. And while trying to keep these parallel crises from ex- ploding, the Bush administration is also trying to keep two historic . opportunities from slipping into the mists of politics. One is the Middle East peace talks, which resume Aug. 24 in Washington. The other is the superpower nu- clear arms treaty that is up for ratification next month by an un- predictable Senate. “It’s too bad Baker’s leaving, because the next round of Middle. East peace talks will be a crucial one,” said Middle East expert William Quandt, who served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. “It is the first time the parties will turn to substantive issues, and left to their own devices, they will have ahard time reaching agreement.” Mr. Baker’s move to the White House may also make the START nuclear treaty more vul- nerable to Senate blocking tac- tics, predicted Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association and a former dis- armament official under Mr. Nixon and Mr. Carter. Mr. Keeny said Mr. Baker de- serves a major share of credit for having grasped opportunities to bring about dramatic cuts in U.S. and Russian nuclear arms dur- ing the crumbling of the Soviet Union. “The whole process could have come ‘tnraveled, and he played a central personal role in keeping the matter on track,” “Mr. Keeny said. Me ert ‘ait Quandt said 8 deal-making have La a deci- ~ sive difference in getting Israel and the Palestinians to the verge ‘of what may be a historic peace * ‘settlement, ‘If someone had said - ; year ago that this was possible, I might have believed it, but I wouldn't have said it would be easy,” Mr. Quandt said. And Blair Ruble, director of the Kennan Institute for Ad- vanced Russian Studies, de- scribed Mr. Baker as “cautious and competent” in his dealings with Moscow and other capitals of the former Soviet Union. “On bal- ance, his record is a solid one.” But Mr. Ruble added, “We are entering a period in which it will be very difficult for the Unit- ed States to respond to changes t and gift for: in the international environment. ... This is part of the price we pay for having a drawn-out, com- plicated election campaign.” Of all the 14 secretaries of state of the nuclear age, only George Marshall, Dean Acheson, Henry Kissinger and Cyrus Vance have built such a long rec- ord of achievements as Mr, Bak- er’s, It runs from the Middle East ‘and arms control to Nicaragua, Cambodia and Korea, Yet in leaving the’ State De- partment in the midst'of a presi- dential term, Mr. Baker joins a far less lustrous crew of prede- cessors, such as Edward Stettin- ius (1944-45), William Rogers (1969-73) and Alexander Haig Jr. (1981-83), | Mr. Baker put out the word- ‘through a State Department background briefing that he in- tends to stay involved in foreign policy “as the need arises,” even after his resignation takes effect Aug. 23.

Presidential politics in the U.S. are merely one distraction likely to put a hold on any drastic action as permitted — but not required — under terms of the broad resolution approved by a 12-0 vote. Three of the 15 council members — China, India and Zimbabwe — abstained. NATO ambassadors meet in Brussels today to discuss contin- gency plans drawn up by military advisers for deploying Western forces to back up the U.N. threat of armed intervention. But the advisers reportedly were sent back to the drawing boards Thursday after producing figures tracking American esti- mates that as many as 120,000 troops would be needed to keep the Sarajevo airport running safely and to guard a ground supply route from the coastal city of Split into the Bosnian capital. The NATO planners said at least 100,000 soldiers backed by helicopters and other aircraft would have to be deployed. Such a vast military operation | would almost certainly spark divi- sions among the 16 NATO mem- bers. The United States and Brit- ain, among other NATO countries, are reluctant to get heavily in- volved in Bosnia and have ruled out sending ground troops for now. They were joined by President Francois Mitterrand of France, who was quoted by a French news- paper Thursday as saying that al- though international action was needed, “adding war to war solves | nothing.” “A military campaign in the strict sense of the word would be a formidable test,” Mitterrand said, “France 1s not proposing tat The resolution calls on members to employ “al measures necessary” to get humanitarian aid into Basmla, where the majority Muslims and Croats came under attack by ethnic Serbs shortly after splitting of {rom Yugoslavia as an independent state in Februar, Ethnic Serbs, a minority that did not want to be independent, are backed by Serbian leaders wo stl control what is left of Yugoslavia, Only Serbia and Montenegro remain in what ued to be the six-repubic NOM OL LUEOS avid Diplomats and US. officals have expressed hopes that simply the threat of force will douse the fighting passions, primarily because backing up the threat in Bosnia’s mountain terrain would be tough, The Security Council resolution, sponsored by the United States, Britain, France, Russia and Belgium, did not hold any of the contending ethnic groups tesponsible for spearheading hostilities or human rights violation, though U.S. officials have blamed Serbs for the worst conduct, The Security Council also demanded Thursday that all partes to the ethnic conflict grant the Internation al Committee of the Red Cross “immediate, unimped- ed| and continued access” to detention camps that have been the sites of alleged atrocities, While this second resolution warned the prinicipals that they can be held individually responsible for such human rights violations under the Geneva Conven: tions, it carried no mechanism either to assure the ICRC does get access or to enforce international law governing the conduct of war. It specifically cited for condemnation the practice of “ethnic cleansing,” in which primarily Serbian militias have forced Muslims and Croats to flee their homes in areas of Serb control. Human rights organi- dations charge the Serbs have employed methods of intimidation ranging from murder to kidnapping. The resolution was enacted under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which provides for enforcement by military means, but a separate resolution authorizing force would have to be adopted later if the demands to stop abuses are not heeded.

U.S. Navy pilots returning to the USS Indepen- dence in the Persian Gulf said they had flown over bridges, roads, airflelds and known anti-aircraft sites without being challenged by the Iraqis, The U.S, pilots were under orders to blast any Tragi anti-aircraft sites on the ground that “locked on” with their search radars in prepara- tion to fire, But no Iraqi anti-aircraft radars were activated, and no Iraqi planes flew in the no-y _ Zone, Mr. Hall said. “Tf it is only a no-fly zone, it is no oroblem,\" said Information and Culture Minister Hamid Yusif Hummadi in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Thursday afternoon, Only one day earlier, he had told NBC News that Iraqi anti-aircraft guns would try to shoot down intrud- ing warplanes, One effort by the Iraqi regime to massage its population into accepting the new no-fly zone without response may have come earlier this week with the unusual showing of the movie “Gandhi” on prime-time television. An Asian diplomat in Baghdad noted that while the film’s message is clearly anti-imperial- ist, it also glorifies passive resistance. Saddam’s aim, he suggested, is “passive defi. ance and provoking the other side into a series of blunders,” Mr, Hummadi, who is among the senior cele of leaders from Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, said Iraq is concerned about President Bush's omparison of this ne situation to the ale ZOTe 1992 established for the Kurds in northern Iraq. “At first it was a no-fly zone, but gradually it developed into some sort of security zone,” he said, objecting specifically to the allies’ pushing Iraqi troops out of the Kurdish zone. Now the area is autonomously run by Kurds with continued allied protection. He cautioned the allies against following that pattern in the south. “This is a situation where confrontation will be real,” he said. ‘‘We are not going to with- draw our forces from this area.” Even the RCC’s communique suggested Iraq would engage in _no immediate retaliation. “We shall choose the proper ways and the proper timing to confront this outrageous, aggres- sive resolution,” said the an- nouncer, who reported the out- come of a morning meeting of the RCC — the ruling body of the _ Government headed by Saddam. | The no-fly zone covers a 47,520-square-mile swath of de- serts, marshes and farmland that is roughly the size of Mississippi. Mr. Bush joined Britain and France in demandig an end to Iraqi civilian and military flights there for an indefinite period be- cause Saddam’s military forces had been repressing dissident Shiite Muslims in defiance of an April 1991 U.N. resolution. Just hours before the exclu- sion zone was to take effect, hun- dreds of demonstrators showed ‘up in an upper-middle-class Baghdad neighborhood called Mansour to protest the allied plans for southern Iraq. ‘“‘We shall defend the unity of Iraq with our blood,” shouted the protesters, several of whom brandished rifles a}yi handguns, Allied flight “are going to create a fragile situation in the south which would make it vulnerable to Iranian intervention.” a HAMID YUSIF HUMMADI Iraqi information minister a rare sight at normally placid, and unemotional Iraqi demon-, strations. In the interview, Mr. Hum-: madi said Iraq will “respond -in self-defense,” if necessary. Hé cited an example of “some nut pilot” realizing he was beihg tracked by Iraqi radar and shoot’ ing. He did not suggest Iraq would try to shoot down the sur- veillance planes as long as oo were peaceful. Mr. Hummadi complained that Iraqi flights are mainly, needed for surveillance of possi-. ble infiltration by Iranian milf. tants who have supported Shiite. rebels fighting Iraq's Sunni: dominated regime. “They are going to create a fragile situation in the south which would make it vulnerable to Iranian intervention,” he said of the air cap preventing Iraqi surveillance. ‘We in Iraq know the ambitions of the Iranian re- gime, probably better than the American administration.” Now, he said, infiltration will be possible not only through Ira- nian secret routes in the dense border marshland, but also over Iraq’s borders with Saudi Arabia and Kuwiit.

        "ocr_text": "U.S. drops leaflets aimed at breaking Iraqi troop morale By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kumstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Washington — U.S. fliers cranked up the pressure Friday on the Iraqi military by dropping hundreds of leaflets on exposed Iraqi troops, warning of death to any defender who dares to fly or “lock on’ with anti-aircraft radar. It was a tactic out of the “‘psy- ops”’ playbook that Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf used to break down Iraqi troop morale during the Persian Gulf War. But this time around, one evident purpose is to hammer at the confidence of Iraq’s senior officers, who will now have to calculate whether their 60,000 troops in southern Iraq will once again begin pan- icky defections. To ensure that Iraqi Presi- dent Saddam Hussein’s inner circle would know of the leaflet drops, Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall took the unusual step of an- nouncing them at a briefing, which was covered live by CNN. As the Pentagon knows, CNN’s live broadcasts are watched closely in Baghdad ministries. U.S. military officers said pri- vately that more leaflet drops are likely in coming days, as the al- lied fliers zoom low over the eight to 10 Iraqi divisions that have been harassing Shiite Muslim dissidents in the Iraqi marshes south of Amarah near the Iranian border. One unstated objective of Operation Southern Watch is to force those troops to leave their combat stations near the marshes and return to barracks. An exiled Shiite opposition group claimed in a statement Thursday that some Iraqi forces had already begun withdrawing Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 29, 1992 from Amarah and the nearby city of Basra, but there was no con@r- mation in Washington ior “We've Baghdad. 4 Mr. Hall said, seen some troop m mts in south but would not be able *to characterize them as withdrawing from any place or confirm the idea that the city’s been retaken.” . It was months after the Gulf War before the Pentagon spoke openly about the 29 million leaf- lets the allies scattered on Iraqi troops during Operation Desert Storm. But in a mid-1991 report assessing why the allies won the war, the Pentagon quoted one Ira- qi division commander as saying that next to the allied bombing, leaflet drops and covert radio broadcasts were “the greatest threat to his troops’ morale.”’ Mr. Hall said that American Air Force and Navy planes flew 90 missions without incident on Thursday and early Friday over the Miéississippi-sized ‘‘no-fly zone’’ that President Bush said he | was declaring to force Iraqi com- ; pliance with U.N. resolutions. - French and British planes were . said to be en route to the Middle East to join the air patrols. Aboard the USS _ Indepen- dence in the Persian Gulf, U.S. pi- | lots said they could tell from their - radar-spotting equipment that some Iraqi radar systems were tracing their movements, but the Iraqis were not “locking on’’ to them with fire-control radars. : ; ‘ “They know we’re out there | — they’re looking at us, they’re | watching us, but they’re not re- . acting,’’ Cmdr.

        "ocr_text": "Allied jets to challenge Saddam’s forces today Iraq proposes mediation effort By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Baghdad, Iraq — American- led allied jets will be abuzz in the skies over southern Iraq again today, challenging Iraqi Presi- dent Saddam Hussein's antiair- craft batteries and planes to shoot them down. The renewed air maneuvers, set to begin at 10:15 a.m. EDT, follow President Bush’s an- nouncement Wednesday that the allies are imposing a “no-fly zone” to force Iraq to comply with the U.N. directives that end- ed the Persian Gulf War. In Baghdad, there was no sign that people in the streets were aware of the brewing crisis. Traffic was normal. Late-night snack shops and stores did busi- ness as usual. Iraq’s first response to the no-fly announcement was to have its U.N. ambassador appeal for an international committee of “wise men” to visit Iraq and help “defuse the crisis.” Iraq proposed that the com- mittee members come from Chi- na, India, Austria, Indonesia, Morocco, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Turkey and Oman — all of which have been lukewarm or flatly op- posed to further Western mili- tary intervention in Iraq. Along with this apparent ol- ive branch, Iraq rejected the twin allied demands for a ban on Iraqi civil and military flights below the 32nd parallel, coupled with unfettered allied flights over the oil-rich southern third of Iraq. In the United States, Demo- crats, whose election chances could be affected by the success of the new operation, dubbed “Southern Watch,” remained all but silent following Mr. Bush’s announcement. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton told reporters in Mem- phis, Tenn., that he supported Mr. Bush’s action. But he also re- newed criticism that Mr. Bush had moved too slowly to prevent Saddam from attacking Iraqi Kurdish and Shiite Muslim eth- nic groups in the aftermath of the Gulf War. Bush cites violations The president said he decided to order U.S. pilots to resume flights over southern Iraq be- cause of accumulating evidence that Saddam’s forces have contin- ued to repress Iraqi Shiite dissi- dents in violation of an April 1991 U.N. Security Council resolution. “What emerges from eyewit- ness accounts ... is further graphic proof of Saddam’s bru- tality,’ Mr. Bush told a White House news conference. “Saddam’s grip on sovereign- ty is being chiseled away,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Ed- ward Djerejian told a White House briefing following Mr. Bush’s remarks. “He no longer controls parts of his territory.” At the Pentagon, some rank- ing officials said they expect the Iraqi military will hunker down and avoid provoking any early shooting match with the U.S., French and British pilots operat- ing from bases in Saudi Arabia . and from the American carrier | USS Independence in the Per- sian Gulf. _ But if Iraqi ground radar sta- tions choose to turn on their anti- aircraft radars and “lock on” to the American reconnaissance planes, it could only take a few seconds for the ‘“‘no-fly zone” to turn into a killing zone. ‘ Pentagon officials said that if American Navy and Air Force pi- Igts detect an antiaircraft “lock oh,” they are authorized to re- spond quickly by launching RM anti-radar missiles. The 13-foot-long HARMs, which hang under the wings of combat jets, are designed to home in on radar sites from up to 50 miles: away and blast them with frag- mentation warheads. U.S. lost 38 warplanes . During last year’s Operation Desert Storm, the United States Idst 38 fighters and _fighter- bombers, almost all of them hit from Iraqi antiaircraft bases dug in on Iraqi territory. Seventeen U.S. fixed-wing planes were lost in the first week of the air war, before the allied bombers had fully blinded the Iraqi air defenses. But even in the final week of fighting, as U.S. warplanes swept in lower to sup- port allied tank columns, eight American warplanes were lost, mainly to surviving hand-held SAM missiles or antiaircraft ma- chine guns. . Between Baghdad and Basra, Western journalists driving on an Iraqi guided tour eight months ago saw what appeared to be undestroyed Iraqi air de- fense radars peeping out from sandbagged bunkers. ’ From a military perspective, the immediate allied objective is to harass and demoralize a con- centration of about 60,000 Iraqi armored, artillery and engineer- ing troops that, according to U.S. intelligence reports, are bunched in a triangular zone about 75 miles northwest of the Iraqi southern port city of Basra. Ouster of Saddam sought From the perspective of in- ternational power politics, the White House made clear that its goal was more ambitious: to pro- vide further incentives for anti- Saddam elements in Baghdad to rise up and replace Saddam as the Iraqi leader. Rear Admiral Michael Cramer, director of intelligence of the Joint Staff in the Pentagon, told reporters that for the last several months, Iraqi forces based in the southern triangle have been launching punitive raids on “tens of thousands” of Shiite dissidents in the marsh- lands of southern Iraq. In all, about 7 million Iraqis — inostly Shiites — live in the no-fly zone proclaimed by the allies. Marcia Kunstel reported from Baghdad, and Joseph Albright re- ported from Washington.

The bomb was discovered and defused Thursday, within hours of the announcement by Saddam Hussein’s Revolution- ary Command Council that it would “choose the appropriate methods and timing to confront” the allied imposition of a “no-fly zone” in southern Iraq. In Washington, a senior Bush administration official said Sat- urday that the United States plans to consult its Persian Gulf War allies over the weekend to fashion a response to the at- tempted assassination of the U.N. guards. The episode oc- curred near Irbil in northern Iraq, about 250 miles north of where allied warplanes contin- ued patrolling Saturday without being challenged. _ “This is the first time they have been caught red-handed” in ‘an attempt to harm U.N. person- nel i in Iraq, said the administra- tion official, who declined to be identified. As reported to U.N. headqua: ters in New York, the incident ir volved three U.N. guards inte: cepted by Iraqi soldiers who de manded to search their vehicle. The guards objected and gi out of the vehicle to argu against the search of U.N. proy erty, according to the report. I the midst of the confrontatior they saw someone slip unde their vehicle and apparentl tamper with the undercarriage. After they cleared the road. block south of Irbil, the final gov- ernment checkpoint before en- tering the Kurdish security zone protected by Western allies, the U.N. guards continued until they reached a checkpoint manned by Kurdish Pesh Merga fighters. They asked the Pesh Merga to search under their vehicle to make certain there had been no dangerous rearrangements. Ac- cording to the report, they dis- covered the time bomb. “I cannot deny it. The inci- _ dent happened,” said Gualtiero Fulcheri, coordinator of the U.N.’s interagency humanitarian program in Iraq. In Washington, the U.S. offi- cial said that as a first step, the United Nations plans, to issue a sharp protest soon after sum- moning Iraq’s U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Anbari. Word of the incident was re- layed Saturday to senior Bush administration officials by the U.N. secretariat in New York, soon after the news had arrived from U.N. officers in Baghdad. The U.N. guards, lightly armed security officers assigned to keep watch over U.N. person- nel and property, have come un- der serious attack in the north- ern security zone. One was killed in sniper fire and another was injured in an ex- plosion. No one claimed respon- sibility for the attacks, and no one has been apprehended. The northern Kurdish zone has been the scene of factional violence pitting one Kurdi group against another, and ‘th genesis of the attacks on the UN, guards has remained uncertéin,: The security zone there Was: created shortly after the.

Rather than detail how Iraq plans to deal with the latest affront — the allied no-fly zone putting fully one-third of the country off- limits to its own aircraft — Sad- dam merely said the intrusion was wrong and would be resisted in some unspecified way. The speech — which radio - announcements said contained “a historic message” on how to “foil the aggressors’ and traitors’ intentions” — in fact gave not a clue to bewildered Iraqis won- dering how their government is going to back up its promise of resistance. “No doubt your hearts are bursting with anger, and I know Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 31, 1992 the youth who love their country cannot bear this act of aggres- . sion.

By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau BAGHDAD, Iraq — The flap over the no-fly zone imposed by the U.S.-led allies over southern Iraq may provide welcome distraction for U.N. weapons inspectors Who arrived Monday, reducing them to ‘Secondary status as an annoyance to President Saddam Hussein's government. The team of 15 inspectors, experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency, arrived in to find neither the customary demonstrators nor new govern- ment threats or prohibitions, ._ Instead, news media and street talk are focusing these days on the intrusion of allied planes cruising over a protective zone for rebellious Shiite Muslims in south- ern Iraq. Hussein has told his population to hang tough and unified before the provoca- tion, which foreign diplomats say has turned internal security tenuous. While the Iraqi regime is preoccupied with the potential for serious trouble in the south, the weapons inspectors also say they are not looking for confrontation. Team leader Maurizio Zifferero, an Italian, said Monday that his inspectors may “pass into some new activities” as they continue trying to piece together Iraq's nuclear bomb-building network. They are part of the United Nations’ post-Gulf War mission to find and disman- tle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Zifferero did not comment on a recent incident, first reported by Cox Newspa- pers, that Iraqi military sentries on Friday had surreptitiously attached a time bomb to the bottom of a car carrying three U.N. guards. It was defused, But at the State Department, spokes- man Richard Boucher described the inci- dent as “just the latest ina series of violent attacks against U.N. personnel.” He called on the “international community to join us in expressing revulsion over these events.” In New York, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said U.N. workers were placed on maximum alert. Jan Eliasson, the U.N. secretary-gener- al for humanitarian affairs, protested to inspectors. Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul al-Amir al- Anbari. Anbari rejected responsibility, “saying that it was an act of provocation from the allied powers,” Giuliani said. The windshields of two vehicles driven by U.N. personnel in Baghdad were smashed Monday, hostile phone calls were made to U.N. personnel, and the tires of U.N. workers’ cars were slashed, Meanwhile Monday, there were signs that Iraq was mobilizing its paramilitary Popular Army that was assembled after Iraq invaded Kuwait. It was disbanded after the allied victory over Iraq. Dozens of Soviet-designed T-72 tanks have reportedly been sent about 100 miles south from Baghdad in recent days, sug- gesting that Hussein may be trying to increase defenses against a northward al- lied attack against the capital. In Baghdad Monday, Zifferero played down prospects for confrontation. He also refused to specify the “new activities” his inspection team might undertake, and he sounded wary of any fracas, almost re- signed to accepting. what Iraq has said is off-limits, “There are areas they have stated they are not going to cooperate in,” he said outside the team’s quarters at the Sheraton Ishtar Hotel. “Apart from these areas, Which are important but limited, we ex- pect cooperation.” Palm Beach Post - September 1, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Lima plant set to get money for tank work By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE WASHINGTON — The Defense Department, bowing to congres- sional directives, has announced it will release $250 million for early work on upgrading older M1 tanks to anew model called the M1-A2. The announcement will sprinkle research and parts-procurement money in seven states, including Ohio, where the 1,900 workers at the Lima Army Tank Plant are fac- ing layoffs in the next few years if no new tank orders come in. Don Gilleland, a spokesman for General Dynamics, which oper- ates the Lima plant for the Army, said, “It’s very good news because it continues the steps that are nec- essary to lead to a tank-upgrade program. But the release of the money does not buy tanks. And until the secretary of Defense ac- tually signs off and approves an upgrade program, there is not much ofajob impact” in Lima. _ Army spokesman Maj. Pete Keating said, “This primes the pump on the program, and now we can get going on it.” He acknowl- edged that the Defense Depart- Dayton Daily News - September 2, 1992 ment had not committed itself to a tank-upgrade project. General Dynamics has been try- ing to sell the Pentagon on a $600 million-a-year tank-upgrade pro- gram, under which it would annu- ally refit 240 of the older M1 tanks with more powerful guns, armor and computers. The refurbished models would be called M1-A2s. To many in the Pentagon, the M1-A2 is a “nice to have” item but not a must in a time of tight bud- gets. Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood, a former auto- manufacturing executive who oversees weapons procurement, is said to have blocked the tank-up- grade program for three years. Gen. Gordon Sullivan, the Army’s top general, offered this ra- tionale Tuesday for improving on the Army’s current top-of-the-line tank, the M1-A1, which helped de- feat Iraq in Operation Desert Storm: “T would like to see the digitiza- tion of the battlefield, and that in- cludes the upgrading of the tank to put a database in it so that we in fact can talk to each other using digital communications. And that includes the base piece, which is the M1-A2.” \f"

        "ocr_text": "Iraqi Arabs chant hatred for Bush Demonstration staged | as allied jet flies over By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Umm al-Fuselma, Iraq — The distant rumble of an allied jet fighter a the eyes of hundreds of Arab marsh-dwellers chanting enmity Wednesday toward the man who sent the planes — President George Bush. They stopped yelling to look skyward, fi- nally catching the tricornered glint of silver burnished by southern Iraq's brutal midaf- ternoon sun. The jet had timed its arrival perfectly, from Iraq's point of view. “Everyone sent by Bush to occupy Iraq we will kill,” Sabeh Obeid Izbani, a local trib- al chief, told the first foreign reporters to vis- it southern Iraq since the allies imposed an air cap over the region a week ago. “If they ask you in the United States of America about the situation in Iraq, tell them we are united,” Mr. Izbani insisted. Unity is claimed That was the theme of the demonstration staged for the visiting journalists in the wild marshland less than 20 miles west of the Ira- nian border; that Shiite and Sunni Muslims, Christians and Kurds are — as one farmer said — united like the fingers on a hand. Atlanta Journal-Constitution Be fe 4 Ps, rm r Ye CUCM Ue) , the 36th parallel and south of | , the 32nd parallel a ; 7\" 32nd = On Tuesday, a provincial governor in southern Iraq had said the government in Baghdad had ordered Iraqi troops in the re- gion not to shoot down allied aircraft as they cruise over the no-fly zone. In Baghdad on Wednesday, the leader of the latest U.N. weapons inspection team to visit Iraq said Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program has been rendered harmless. Maur- izio Zifferero said allied bombing during the Gulf War, coupled with the subsequent activ- ities of U.N. inspectors, had diminished the nuclear program’s threat to “zero.” As the audience of Western reporters topped a dirt embankment at the edge of the southern marsh, the raggedly dressed boys and girls crammed onto two rafts broke into anti-Bush chants, as did their fathers on the bank. The children, tired of yelling in the sweaty heat, then popped into the muddy wa- ter and swam through the marsh grass to shore. It was difficult to gauge how genuine was the sentiment tapped on this visit, however, since the journalists were accompanied by Information Ministry officials from Bagh- dad. And local leaders filtered among the crowds almost everywhere. Merchant fears house will fall People in the south described the imme- diate effect of the no-fly zone in widely diver- gent, even contradictory, ways. At the town of Fuhud, about 10 miles south of Nasiriyah, merchant Hatem Obeid told a reporter at his open-front stall on Tuesday that the noise of the jets is so dis- turbing that he fears his home will collapse. “My wife is pregnant, and when she heard the airplanes, she began to bleed,” said Aziz Abdul Hussein, a customer at the shop. Mr. Hussein said he had seen some 70 planes in the past week. But less than a mile up the road, a group of fisherwomen collect- ing their catch on the bank of another marsh said they hadn’t seen or heard any planes. In the two-day bus trip, the reporters saw only one allied jet. - September 3, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bush plans F-15 Fie to Saudis Ga. engine plant would get a boost By Joseph Albright julia Malone. WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The Bush ad- ministration is trying to wrap up a $5 billion sale of F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia, after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated this week that he won't actively oppose it. The deal, which could be an- nounced as early as next week, would mean a visible boost to the hard-hit economy of Missouri, where the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis is fast running out of orders to make F-15s for the U.S. Air Force. Missouri, which has 11 of the nation’s 538 electoral votes, is viewed by both Republicans and Democrats as a teetering swing state in the fall election. If Congress approves the Sau- di sale, dozens of other military parts makers — mainly in Flori- da, Georgia, Connecticut and California — also would get a sprinkling of economic dew. One beneficiary would be the Pratt & Whitney engine plant in Colum- bus, Ga., where 100 workers make parts for F-15 engines. “This won't create new jobs, but it will help us keep our skilled workers,” said Bob Car- roll, a Pratt & Whitney spokesman. The prospective Saudi sale follows this week’s announce- ment that the United States is selling the smaller, Texas-made F-16 jet fighter to Taiwan. In Israel, the new Rabin gov- ernment is evidently preparing the Israeli public for acquiesc- ing in the sale of 72 F-15s to Sau- di Arabia. This week, some Israeli newspapers published a leaked memo from the Israeli Embassy in Washington that said there was no chance of persuading Congress to stop the Saudi F-15 sale. Then Wednesday, Mr. Rabin told a seminar in Jerusalem that he became convinced during a recent trip to Washington that even pro-Israeli members of Congress would vote for the sale because the U.S. economy needs a boost. “I don’t like lost battles,” Mr. Rabin told the meeting sponsored by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He went on to reiterate Israel’s long-standing objections to the sale while indicating his new Cabinet would not fire up a full- scale lobbying effort to defeat the Saudi package. Even so, the Saudi F-15 sale won't have smooth sailing through Congress. On Tuesday, the heads of several major U.S. Jewish organizations issued a statement calling on Mr. Bush and Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton not to support the sale. ‘ The Bush administration may try to win concessions from Saudi Arabia that will make the arms sale more palatable to Is- rael and the U.S. Jewish com- munity. One possibility: Saudi Ara- bia may convey an unofficial commitment to facilitate Isra- el’s purchase of Saudi oil through third-party intermedi- aries. Another loose end is how much advanced hardware will be included in the F-15 model the Saudis eventually purchase. The Saudis last November asked the Bush administration to sell them the advanced F-1SE fighter bomber that was used to drop laser-guided bombs during the Persian Gulf War. Techni- cally, the F-1SE is also certified. to drop nuclear bombs. The F-15E’s proficiency for zooming in at low levels to drop precision bombs has stirred fierce objections within the Pentagon and among pro-Israel members of Congress, who have been insisting that any F-15s - sold to Saudi Arabia should be | strictly fighter planes designed to combat other fighter planes. To overcome those objec- | tions without quashing the deal; the Bush administration is ex- pected to approve the sale of a new, less potent model called the F-1SH, which would be man- ufactured purely for foreign consumption. “The F-15H would be an air-' to-air weapon and not an air-to- ground weapon,” said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Ken Sat- terfield when asked to describe the configuration of the new plane. Staff Louis J. Sa- lome contributed to this article from Jerusalem.

        "ocr_text": "With Hanging Of Profiteers, Iraqis Face Worse Shortages By MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News BAGHDAD — The recent hang- ing of 42 merchants abruptly sub- dued a wantonly speculative mar- ket, but it also has almost frozen trade and brought Iraqis even | worse shortages of essential food and drugs. “The mood is very bad now. These hangings were a big part of it,” said a European diplomat here. “The stuff isn’t coming in. It’s just not coming.” That is apparent at the Jordan- Iraq border, which used to be teem- ing with trucks of all variety at all hours of the day and night. Lines snaked down the road as truckers waited to drive into Iraq loads of. everything from bananas to whis- key to school supplies. These days few trucks are seen passing the border except the petro- leum tankers that haul oil from Iraq to Jordan under special United Nations authorization: ; It is a bad end to Iraq's first ex- periment in decades with a free market. The rules of trade were rewritten here_after the Gulf War left the government incapable of continuing its socialist policy of importing ‘massive amounts of food to feed its 18 million people at artificially low prices. ; Before the crisis Iraq had plenty of petrodollars to scatter in pur- . chases round the world, but a Unit- ed Nations embargo ended Iraq’s oil sales and the legal import of every- thing but food and medicine. So the government turned to its own inventive populace to develop a system of private enterprise. The government continued to provide -some cheap food, in the form of ra- tions that feed families for about one-third of the month. At the same time, anyone who could\" manage to buy and import “The mood is very bad now....The stuff isn’t coming in. It’s just not coming.” — European diplomat goods was allowed to do so and to sell at whatever price he could get, to fill needs the government could not meet. ry The new merchant class went overboard. “They monopolized food commodi- ties and manipulated prices,” ex- plained Information Minister Hamid Yusef Hummadi. As an ex- ample, he cited how the price of rice jumped almost eightfold in a two month period. “In every difficult situation some pockets of corruption grow. The po- litical leadership of this country cannot coexist.with corruption,” he said in an interview. “We are ac- cused of being puritans.” In a draconian crackdown, 42 merchants playing by what they thought were the accepted new rules of the day were rounded up and quickly executed beginning in late July. The days of wild speculation were over, the government decreed. Besides making an example of the merchants whom the government said had engaged in profiteering, it gave venders until November to clear from*their stores luxury goods. And it forbade the import’of’ | a long list of “luxury” items that include foods such as cheese, onions and bananas. ; , ; Few are willing now to take the risk of offending Iraq’s leaders again. ‘‘People became more scared (after the hangings) and goods be- came more scarce,” said another longtime diplomat here. The result is a market so tight that the government last week an- nounced it was making available in September two months’ worth of ra- tions instead of only one. That means instead of buying about 10 days of staples such as rice and sugar at heavily subsidized government prices, Iraqis will be able to get enough to see them through about 20 days before turn- ing to the higher priced open mar- et. ' “We don't know what will hap- pen in October,” said Yusef, a fa- ther of five. He hasn’t decided whether to buy October’s ration now and take the risk that more will be made available next month. Prices that already were far ‘above prewar levels have escalated further in recent weeks, and many things are hard to find anywhere on the free market once rations are exhausted. to Yusef said he has trouble locat- ing rice and sugar, both of which are about 34 times more expensive than before the war. Fresh milk cannot be found, eggs are four to five times more costly, and the price. of powdered milk has gone up more than twelvefold, he said. Some medicines that private en- terprise had brought into the coun- try — albeit in limited and expen- sive quantities — also have been outlawed for import. “There are acute shortages of all kinds of anaesthetics, plus medi- cines to treat chronic diseases and tumors, said Dr. Ezio Gianni Murzi, the representative of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEP). ; ‘It’s on the luxury list because there is a great scarcity and it would be almost a priceless black market item,” he said.

        "ocr_text": "Visit to lraq ‘no-fly zone’ mired in confusion Villagers condemn air patrols By MARCIA KUNSTEL Paim Beach Post Washington Bureau FUSEIMA MARSH, Iraq Hundreds of barefoot children swarmed round a village of fragile reed huts the minute a rare busload of visitors drove up their baked dirt | road. Their mothers came out, too, to see the novelty. Men were noticeably absent from this village last week. There | were the elderly, and some men who came from a nearby town to stage a demonstration for visiting journalists. Yet the approach to this miser- . able village edging a marsh was guarded by a tank, two armored personnel carriers and a soldier nested in a sandbagged gun posi- | tion. lage. They were on the watch for what might come through it, out of the marsh. High above this impoverished bit of countryside was a counter- presence to the might of the Iraqi regime. This is the no-fly zone where powerful American, British and French bombers fly patrols to protect the people from air attacks by Iraqi military. Exactly what is hidden in the reeds and bulrushes, the maze of islands and waterways that snake across the belly of Iraq, oozing into Iran on the east and southward past the cradle of civilization where the Tigris and Euphrates merge? What are the Western aircraft here to protect? And what are the Iraqis guarding against? Western allies say Shiite Mus- lim rebels who staged a short-lived rebellion after the Gulf War last year still are hiding in the marshes, and that they and supportive villag- ers have been attacked by Iraqi troops. Western intelligence re- ported the military was concen- trating for a major assault. President Saddam Hussein and the functionaries of his regime say Iraqi soldiers are here to repel attacks by Iranian saboteurs who float into Iraq through the marsh- land, and their small number of “criminal” Iraqi followers. The government repeatedly has warned that the no-fly zone will permit more intense infiltration, as They weren’t guarding the vil- | le eh a n ra Photo by MARCIA KUNSTEL Arabs paddle their boat through the marshlands of southern Iraq gathering grass to feed the village cattle and water buffalo, Iran tries to gain control over southern Iraq. The view on the ground during a recent two-day visit up and down the no-fly zone — a visit by journal- ists closely monitored by govern- ment agents — was incomplete, confused and sometimes contradic- tory. Local people, including officials loyal to Hussein’s regime, said there has been little trouble from infiltrators or anyone else in the marshlands. Taher Jalil Habuish, provincial governor of neighboring Dhiqar province, said in the provincial capital of Nasiriyah that things are so quiet the military presence has been reduced Driving south from Baghdad through Nasiriyah to Basra in the southern tip of Iraq, then back north on a more easterly road through the city of Amara, report- ers saw heavy concentrations of soldiers from Amara down along the marsh area abutting the Irani- an border. Basra was remarkably free of a visible military presence, compared to earlier this year, as was Nasiriyah. “Those in the marshes now are very few,”’ Habuish said, describing them as “outlaws,” a few Iraqi army deserters from the Gulf War, and the marsh Arabs whose fam- ilies traditionally have made their homes there. While most of the local Shiites questioned condemned the Western air patrols, the people did not spew the government’s line completely. In one telling encounter, towns- men contradicted their local offi- cial who maintained that the Shiite rebellion last year was led by Irani- an infiltrators. “‘La, la, Irani,”’ the men quietly said to a journalist in Arabic. It meant no, not Iranians. If not Iranians, who? Perhaps it is the missing men from the village at Fuseima marsh that the Iraqi military await. United Nations workers told of similar marsh villages, where most of the men are gone and parentless children abound. Iraqi military as- saults have killed some, and others who joined the rebellion are said to be harbored still in the reeds and bulrushes. How many are hiding, no one knows. Diplomats in Baghdad who try to follow developments said there are no reliable figures either for how many have been killed or how many armed rebels remain. Nor is it clear how Western air patrols can help these people, un- less the West plans more than strik- ing at Iraqi airplanes. Even a U.N. human rights report deploring the situation in the south said post- rebellion assaults came from Iraqi ground forces, not aircraft. The Iraqi regime does not need helicopter gunships or bomber planes to level what is left of this village or to mow down rebels who venture from hiding. Tanks, artil- lery, and machine guns — in plenti- ful supply around here, if not visi- bly throughout the south — carry formidable firepower. Palm Beach Post - September 10, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Anybody but Bush gets the vote in Iraq By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Fuhud, lraq — In this back- water town of farmers and fish- ermen more than 200 miles south of Baghdad, Iraqis are rooting for Bill Clinton for president. They don’t always get the Democrat’s name right — mer- chant Jabar Nazel thought it was “Mr. Linton” opposing George Bush — but the people of Iraq are aware that a U.S. election looms, and they want anybody but Mr. Bush to win. And so does Iraq’s govern- ment, which is trying to influ- ence a reshaping of America’s in- ternational policy. “I think it will be different if Clinton wins,” said Mr. Nazel, 38, accepting the name correction for the Arkansas governor. Why? . “Because we think Bush is our enemy.” Ali al Eisa, a 23-year-old teacher, agreed. “We think the Americans like Iraqis. We think he [Bush] is the only one who hates Iraq,” Ms. Eisa said. To the Iraqi people, Mr. Bush has been demonized in the same way Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is almost universally disdained by Americans. It is not simply government propaganda that molds their opinions, for even in the coun- try’s outer reaches people rou- tinely listen to the Voice of Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 11, 1992 America, the British Broadcast- ing Corp. and Radio Monte Carlo for news and views of the world. They believe Mr. Bush is leading the world against Iraq. It is not that Iraq’s leaders be- lieve Mr. Clinton would be soft on Iraq, but that they hope the at- mosphere under a different U.S. administration might be less poisoned. Many Iraqis will whisper that they have no quarrel with Mr. Bush’s decision to fight their country last year — except they regret that he stopped the battle before the job was finished and Saddam removed from power. What they do not understand, and what they have come to per- sonalize as Mr. Bush’s effort to make the Iraqi people suffer, is the continuation of economic sanctions against them. Goods are increasingly scarce as the months go by, and prices keep going up. Now they say they believe the “no-fly zone” the Americans, Brit- ish and French have created, which keeps Iraqi planes from fly- ing in the southern third of their own country, is a political move Mr. Bush promoted to enhance his election prospects this fall. “Yes, we know there are elec- tions, and we think one of the mo- tives behind his move now is to get more votes,” said Mr. Nazel, who lives in the no-fly district. Saddam’s government also is plugged into American electoral politics. Publicly, officials charge that the no-fly zone is a creature of Mr. Bush’s political ambitions. Privately, one Baghdad offi- cial said Iraq has tailored its mild response to America’s polit- ically charged atmosphere out of concern a more volatile reaction would help Mr. Bush score points in November. Besides a bit of bluster, Iraq has made no move either to pro- voke or to punish the Western planes cruising overhead. Whether Saddam can contin- ue reining in his instincts — which are to act rather than wait — and whether the quiet continu- ation of the no-fly zone will be sufficient for Mr. Bush's political needs, are key questions. “His [Saddam's] point is al- ways to take some action, to show he decides,” said one European diplomat in Baghdad. “Sure he’s playing for time. But he has a need for action to show the oth- ers he is strong.” Another European with long- time diplomatic credentials in Iraq wondered how long Mr. Bush can wait. “To have so many planes in the air with no results — it’s ex- pensive,” he said. “So maybe he [Bush] also will feel compelled to do something more.” The air exclusion zone was created to keep Iraqi aircraft from attacking Shiite Muslims who rebelled across the south last year and have suffered re- taliation by Iraq’s military. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Compromise seen as Mideast talks resume today By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Unparalleled opti- mism greets the resumption of Mideast peace talks today, after Syria and Israel gave new signs last week of willingness to compro- mise. “It’s very clear that the bazaar is open for business,” said Judith Kipper, Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. While a similar breakthrough has yet to advance negotiations between the Palestin- ians and Israel, time pressures may begin to influence those talks as well this week. A series of moves and countermoves, kicked off as the sixth round of talks recessed earlier this month, has led to new hopes for progress over the next two weeks of negotia- tions between Israel and the Arab neighbor that had been its most implacable enemy. Syria’s document committing itself for the first time to reach a peace settlement with Israel, followed by Israeli Prime Minis- ter Yitzhak Rabin’s pledge last week to return land captured from Syria on the Golan Heights, brings new potential in what had been the most unlikely venue for success. Itamar Rabinovich, Israel’s chief negoti- ator with Syria, told Israel’s state-run radio Sunday that his side would offer Syria “an attractive document” this week. The offer reflects “creative thought” and could lead to “a joint document of principles” if it is well received by Syria, he said. Martin Indyk, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Studies, called last week’s developments with Syria and Israel “an interesting exchange of signals .. . indi- cating they are ready to do business with each other.” Indyk, who just returned from Israel, said that the idea with the greatest currency in the Jewish state is “decoupling sovereignty ... from the control of territory” in the Golan. One possibility being discussed is that Palm Israel would acknowledge that Syria holds sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in the 1967 war. But Israel would lease or otherwise temporarily retain physical control of at least part of the territory where it has settled 15,000 Israelis and raised sophisticated surveillance towers. Such a specific proposal may not even be tabled in the coming days, given the very preliminary nature of the overtures made so far. There are plenty of issues to plow through first, such as whether Syria is ready to negotiate a full peace that includes open borders, diplomatic recognition and econom- ic relations with Israel, and how much land Israel is ready to return. Another breakthrough underscoring seri- ous intentions would happen if Syria re- versed its earlier position and decided to attend the separate, multilateral Mideast talks resuming Tuesday on water resources and in Moscow on arms control. Syria has refused to participate in these broader negotiations involving the entire region until the bilateral peace talks show momentum. Bilateral talks between Israelis and Pal- estinians also are to resume today, after pre- recess sessions that showed little movement. The pressure for compromise may be increasing, especially on the Palestinians, as the U.S. election nears. Fears of a Democrat- ic victory and subsequent closer U.S. ties with Israel may prompt Palestinian negotia- tors to stretch for an agreement. The Bush administration also is likely to press both sides for progress, which would enhance the president’s standing in his other- wise troubled re-election bid. The timetable agreed to when the peace process began nearly a year ago calls for Israel and the Palestinians to strike a deal by next month on Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. But there is no enforce- ment mechanism or penalty for failure, and prospects of reaching an agreement so soon are not good. Beach Post - September 14, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Israel, Syria face hard negotiations in days to come By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Israel and Syria followed up a breakthrough in Mideast peace talks by engaging in newly substantive negotiations Monday, but made it clear that building progress will be a long and diffi- cult job. Syrians . complained af- ter the first day of resumed talks that Israel sub- mitted a proposal of principles for peace that was unacceptably vague and ambiguous on the subject of withdrawing from the occupied Go- lan Heights. “How could we discuss our con- cept of peace, if the other party refrains from talking about with- drawal in the document,” said Syri- an spokeswoman Bushra Kanafani. “These things are linked. With- drawal, security, peace are linked together. You cannot take part of the equation and ignore the other.”’ Rather than flatly reject Isra- el’s overture, however, the Syrians said they will seek clarifications and present a list of questions when talks resume today. And Israeli spokesman Yossi Gal said his delegation was not disappointed in Syria’s response to the seven-page paper presented during talks that lasted a record three hours. Israel’s proposal responded to a rs V1 at] surprise initiative Syria made be- fore a ten-day recess in this round of talks. Syria said then for the first time that it was committed to peace and understood Israel had security concerns, leading Israeli leaders to announce in succeeding: days that they were willing to re- turn an unspecified portion of the Golan to Syria. The first day of talks since that breakthrough indicated the two sides, which had been considered the least likely to succeed in talks that also include Palestinians, Jor- danians and Lebanese, were indeed ready for serious business. Israeli Itamar Rabinovich, head of the delegation negotiating with Syria, said after the session that both proposals were only drafts that ‘‘are open to reformula- tion” and will be refined through ‘“‘a process of give and take.” While Kanafani said Syria would not accept “interim arrange- ments” on the Golan that might cede back territory on a trial basis, she did indicate some Syrian flexi- bility in terms of accepting “a ‘reasonable and practical agreed timetable” for Israeli withdrawal. Plenty of give will be necessary if either side is to address the other’s greatest concerns. Israel has refused to tell the Syrians for- mally that it will withdraw from any of the Golan, much less the entire plateau Israel occupied in the 1967 war. And Syria has refused to say it will enter a full peace with normalized relations. Beach Post - September 15, 1992 \f"

Merrill McPeak said at a news confer- ence, “I think we can proceed.” A report on the April 25 crash of the only F-22 flying prototype is due to be released in a few days, just as Congress prepares for a series of decisive votes over the next month on how to allocate defense spending for the fiscal year staring Oct. 1. General McPeak’s civilian overseer, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice, said that the F-22 prototype crash, in which a Lock- heed test pilot escaped from a fi- ery landing, has not harmed the case to build the next-generation stealth fighter. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 16, 1992 “T think the event that hap- pened is somewhere near incon- sequential at this point,” Mr. Rice said after reviewing prelim- inary reports on the crash and progress reports from the F-22 design team. The F-22 will be built by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. at its Marietta, Ga., plant. About 800 design and support workers are working on the project. Mr. Rice said he has every confidence to recommend that Congress fully fund the $2.2 bil- lion allocation in the defense budget for the fiscal year begin- ning Oct. 1. He said he is also ready to ask Defense Secretary Dick Cheney for “full funding” for the F-22 in the following year’s defense bud- get, to be released next January. Warning on overhead costs Along with this favorable news for Lockheed and other de- fense workers on the F-22 pro- ject, Mr. Rice also dished out a warning that overhead costs its beginning to mount on the project. He announced that he is forming a cost control team made up of senior Air Force offi- cers to conduct an overhead re- 'view at the three principal com- panies sharing the F-22 contract — Lockheed, Boeing and Gener- ial Dynamics. “We began to see a modest amount of creeping in the long- term cost projections in the F-22 development contract,” Mr. Rice said. “The overhead rates were going up some.” - He said the Air Force team will include high officials from the Defense Contract: - Audit Agency, which specializes: in checking for bill-padding, as well as the Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright-Pat- terson Air Force Base in Ohio, which oversees designing new airplanes. One of the cost team’s assign- ments, Mr. Rice said, is to make sure that the contractors don't overload the F-22 with overhead charges to offset the shrinkage of their other defense contracts; \f"

        "ocr_text": "Rather takes a slap at ‘elitist’ CNN news By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and GERRY YANDEL Cox News Service BS News anchor Dan Rather says CNN is primarily an “electronic wire service’ for an elite audience that provides too lit- tle perspective for breaking news. Rather said all national TV news broadcasts — including his “CBS Evening News” — are “not very good as far as depth is concerned.” But he contended that the major over-the-air TV broadcasts do a better job of filling in the back- - ground than does CNN. “Among broadcasters, | think, Cable News is lagging at the mo- ment in terms of analysis and background, context and perspec: tive on stories,” Rather remarked as a lecture on press coverage at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa, on Monday, A lieutenant colo- nel in the audience had asked Rather to assess the impact of CNN's global growth. Rather said another “weakness” of CNN is that “it is primarily for the elite” who are willing to pay from $35 to $70 a month for cable service, Abroad, CNN is even more a ser- vice for the elite, Rather went on, “In the main, CNN is seen in first class hotels, in foreign ministries, and in certain places in presiden- tial or imperial palaces. That is pri- marily what they do. You could add defense ministries to that. Over-the-air broadcasters, whether in America or abroad, have a much wider, broader reach.” “We have not won major awards for being thin on reporting, re: sponded CNN executive vice presi- dent Ed Turner. “When you only do 22 minutes a day instead of 24 hours, you might not recognize in: depth when you see it,” CNN President Tom Johnson said he considered Rather a friend, but “I disagree with his assess: ment. ... In our entire approach to the news we tried to be very time: ly, very accurate and very com- plete.” Later, Johnson called a reporter again from his car telephone and added: “CNN is really a network designed for the people; we wish everybody had cable. From the very beginning it was designed to be a network that was not elitist. There are no megabuck Dan Rath- er anchors around CNN,” In his War College appearance, Rather said CNN's major strength is its ability to get the news on the air quickly, “They don’t always get to the story faster than an over: the-air broadcaster, but they often do, and increasingly,” he said. Rather and a group of 20 Wash: ington-based military correspon: dents were invited to the Army War College to discuss press-mili- tary relations in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war. An Army press officer said the session was on the record. Santa Cruz (California) Sentinel - September 16, 1992 \f"

Cees nee solid discussions Wednesday that moved them to- ward achieving a preliminary agreement. Both sides spoke in terms ex- ceptionally positive for these nego- tiators about the work accom- plished Wednesday. Both walked away from the State Department leaving a sense that today’s discus- sions may become a barometer for the course of peace. Talks are expected to zero in on what Syrian chief negotiator Mowaffak al-Allaf called “the most basic two pillars” of the peace process: Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights and a definition of the kind of peace Syria is willing to offer. “We have to wait until tomor- row before we become either opti- mistic or pessimistic,” said Israeli Itamar Rabinovich, agreeing that talks are expected to focus on “very important aspects of the na- ture of peace” and “the territorial aspect of the settlement.” That is Israel's code for withdrawal. Both men raised the prospects that an agreement on principles of peace could be achieved during this round of talks — expected to end Sept. 24. Rabinovich said it will be clear- er after today’s talks whether a short, preliminary agreement will be possible that soon. Negotiations resumed this week after a recess during which both sides exchanged signals they were ready to do business. Just before the recess, Syria submitted a breakthrough docu- ment accepting the notion of peace and acknowledging Israel's securi- ty needs. Israeli leaders responded during the recess that they are ready to give back at least some of the Golan Heights captured by Is- rael in the 1967 war. Both sides said they have found some mutually acceptable pre- cepts for peace that would figure in the agreement of principles, which would be the basis for negotiating a comprehensive peace treaty. The two lead negotiators spoke of being open to changes in their positions, and of gaining a better understanding of objections by their opponents that until now have been strident demands rather than points for discussion. sa But both warned that basic is- ‘sues remain outstanding and easily could stall the talks.

Israeli negotiator Itamar Rabinovich, who said there is no reason for Americans to intercede, dismissed the differences as “an attempt to stage a mini-crisis,” “In the course of such negotiations (| there are ups and downs,” he said, “We are ») at a down moment.” What Allaf called an “impasse” devel- oped as each party refused to be the first to discuss the issue considered crucial by the other. The two key issues, which both sides had agreed finally would be on the negoti- ating table Thursday, are Israeli with. drawal from the occupied Golan Heights and a definition of the nature of peace Syria is willing to join, It was an international game of “chick- en,” a test of intentions for peace that both sides failed for now, as they continued heading instead toward collision, “We are not ready to discuss any fur- ther point with Israel unless Israel dis- cusses with us the question of their total withdrawal from our territory,” Allaf said, And he said the Israelis informed him they had a directive not to discuss territory until the Syrians supplied details of how they would normalize relations under a peace treaty. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced earlier his negotiators would have such instructions. Rabinovich essentially confirmed Al- laf's description, although in more vague terms that cast the Syrians as “demanding capitulation.” Withdrawal, peace and security “are one inseparable package, and all three components should be dealt with together, he said. There were some indications the dra- matic Syrian reaction to lack of progress on Thursday was tied to concerns over the glacial pace of movement in Israel's separ rate peace talks with the Palestinians, Jordanians and Lebanese, = Some Arab leaders recently have charged Israel is trying to divide the Arabs by moving forward in talks with Syria while stalling the others.

        "ocr_text": " Candidates differ on approach to the world By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — When it comes to foreign poli- cy, the two presidential candidates differ not in de- tails, but in their backgrounds and basic approach- es to the new, post-Cold War world. President Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton hold virtually identical positions on foreign aid to Rus- : sia, nuclear arms, a no-fly zone in Iraq and tighten-. ing the embargo on Fidel Castro’s Cuba. Both candidates spring from the international- ist, free-trade, pro-foreign aid wings of their par-: ties. Both believe it is a president’s place to help make the world a safer neighborhood — and both are philosophically prepared to send in the cavalry. But the collapse of the Soviet Union has forced a re-examination of even more basic principles. __ “Tt has been a long time since America has been, so uneasy about itself and so uncertain of where to’ go next,” a Carnegie-funded panel reported this | summer, after spending six months examining the: new U.S. role as the sole superpower. Both candidates cast their vision of the post-So- viet era in economic terms. Mr. Bush, who has built one of the most exten- sive resumes in Washington almost solely on inter- national affairs, has said the collapse of commu- nism offers an opportunity to create a global econo- my, build on free-trade agreements that would require his skill. “Governments can go two ways. They can help foster free enterprise or they can put obstacles in .its path. There is no question what course we must ‘take,” he said recently. Noting the unpredictability of the new era and his clear advantage in experience, he has openly questioned what course would have been followed ‘by “the leader of the Arkansas National Guard.” Mr. Clinton is the governor of a landlocked state. But he ties America’s new place in the world to his greatest advantage — the lack of attention paid by the Bush administration to domestic affairs. “America’s ability to lead the world and inspire others with our example has gradually been eroded ‘by a anemic, debt-ridden economy,” he said this spring. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 21, 1992 Moreover, he maintains that Mr. Bush’s mind- set is stuck in the East-West struggle, and that he has failed to reorient U.S. foreign policy to deal with the emerging economic powerhouses of Asia. “For all his experience, skill and cautious pro- fessionalism, the president has failed to articulate clear goals for American foreign policy,” Mr. Clin- ton has said. There are other differences as well, including: > The Middle East: Mr. Clinton would swiftly recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, handing a psychological prize to the Jewish state. Mr. Bush — echoing the positions of the past five presidents — would leave the status of Jerusalem open for future ~ negotiations, as leverage for settling the Palestin- ian problem. > Human rights: Mr. Clinton criticizes Mr. Bush as soft on countries with poor human rights _ records — specifically China and Haiti. He has blasted Mr. Bush for granting full trade status to Beijing. >U.S. in Europe: Mr. Bush would keep 150,000 American troops in Europe, mainly as a hedge against future German expansionism. Mr. Clinton wants to cut troop levels to between 75,000 and 100,000, applying the savings to domestic programs. > Nuclear testing: Mr. Bush has resisted con- gressional pressure for a ban on all nuclear tests. Mr. Clinton has called for a “phased approach to a’ nuclear test ban” but stops short of demanding an early end to underground atomic tests. Mr. Bush takes credit for the epic changes that have swept the world during his tenure, and as of- ten as possible, he plugs the defining foreign policy victory of his term: leadership of the 39-nation co- alition that drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait, with the loss of only 148 American combatants. When the president asked Congress in January 1991 to authorize military force against Iraq, the Democratic Party agonized — and so did Clinton. Three days after Mr. Bush narrowly won a con- gressional mandate for Operation Desert Storm, Mr. Clinton grudgingly went along with the nearly solid bloc of Republicans and the scattering of Democrats who supported Mr. Bust \f"

        "ocr_text": " Mideast peace talks end 6th round without accord, but on hopeful note By Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service WASHINGTON — The sixth round of Mideast peace talks closed without any breakthrough yester- day, but on a positive tone that may be a springboard for an October sur- prise when talks resume just before the U.S. elections, The Arabs and Israelis “are defl- nitely grappling with tough key ts- sues of territory, peace and security,” Assistant Secretary of State Edward Djerejian said at a news conference. “They're exchanging papers, they're exc ideas, they're ex- changing formulations. That goes beyond warm and fuzzy,” he said when asked whether the progress in the month of talks was a matter of form rather than substance. The form definitely was less hos- tile than ever before, as negotiators for the Israelis, Palestinians, Syri- ans, Lebanese and Jordanians gave closing statements keyed to the up- beat, even while saying they made little or no substantive progress. All looked hopefully to the next round of talks, set to begin Oct. 21, shortly after the Jewish High Holy Days and less than two weeks before the presidential election here. “We are pinning some hopes on the next round,” said Syria's Mowaf- fak Allaf. “There is promise of a new Israeli policy.” None of the parties will comment in public on the U.S, presidential election, but the Arabs have found the Bush administration more sensi- tive to their concerns than any other U.S. administration in decades. Some question privately how even- handed Bill Clinton would be as president, especially after reading the pro-Israel Democratic platform. Israel's new Labor government might prefer a Democratic adminis- tration here, but it owes a lot to the Bush policies that played an impor- tant role in Labor's victory over the right-wing Likud government. Analysts and some participants in the negotiations acknowledge there is vague talk about “a present” for Mr. Bush next month — some achievement that would underscore the president's foreign policy talents just before the election. Itamar Rabinovich, head of the Is- raeli delegation meeting with Syria, said yesterday that the two sides could have announced ent on a statement of principles this week, but the Syrians declined. In the past, Mr. Rabinovich said, negotiators have published such a statement, even if it acknowledges an area of disagreement, “to send a message that they are in the midst of serious and promising negotiations.” Israel and Syria made the most dramatic and unexpected progress during this round, but have yet to turn the key to their conflict. Syria promises to make peace, but only if Israel agrees to withdraw from all the Golan Heights, which it captured in the 1967 war. Israel promises some manner of withdraw- al, but refuses to be explicit until hearing whether Syria will sign a broad-based peace treaty. And the Palestinians remained far from achieving an ment with Israel on an interim ern- ing authority to run the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Baltimore Sun - September 25, 1992 \f"

The heaviest blame fell on Rear Adm. “Duvall M. Williams Jr., who headed the Navy's investigation of what a new Penta- gon report called “lurid” sexual abuse at the Tailhook naval aviators convention. Williams, who will be replaced by a civilian law enforcement officer not yet chosen, was criticized in the report for trying to “terminate” the investigation and for “reluctance to question admirals.” The report also noted that the one-star admiral once said that “a lot of female Navy pilots are go-go dancers, topless dancers or hookers.” Also pushed into retirement was the Navy's top lawyer, two-star Rear Adm. John Gordon. He was accused in the Penta- gon report of allowing a junior officer to participate in the Tailhook probe even though the officer was a close friend of a male pilot under investigation. The top civilian official overseeing the investigation, Undersecretary Dan How- ard, was allowed to keep the Navy’s No. 2 job, even though he was strongly criticized in the Pentagon report. The report accused Howard of “abro- gation of responsibility” for failing to ensure there was a full investigation of complaints by female Navy fliers that they were fondled and pinched by a gang of drunken male Navy pilots at the Tailhook Association convention in Las Vegas in September 1991. The Navy's inspector general, two-star Rear Adm. George Washington Davis, also will remain in the service, despite the report's finding that he had been “unfair and inconsistent” in assessing blame in the early stages of the Tailhook inquiry. Acting Navy Secretary Sean O'Keefe announced these verdicts at a Pentagon press conference. He also said the inspec- tor general's post will be made the last active-duty assignment of a three-star admiral, so that it would be insulated from pressure. The Navy's top military leader, Adm. Frank Kelso, chief of naval operations, was not mentioned in the Pentagon report, even though he attended the Tailhook convention and later was the top com- mander of the lower-ranking admirals assigned to investigate the incidents. — In June, Kelso said he “didn’t see anything untoward” during the 30 or 40 minutes he spent on a hotel patio near the corridor where Navy female pilots said they were manhandled, ; The Pentagon is trying to identify officers who took part in the Tailhook convention assaults.

Atstake is $417 million in aid to Russia, $10 bil- lion in loan guarantees for Israel, and $12.3 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund. Much of the IMF money would back loans to Russia and the other new states of the former Sovi- et Union.

In a statement, Mr, Bush said he shared Congress's desire to promote progress on human rights and fair trade with China and to restrict its sales of weap- ons, But he said the measure “would not lead to faster prog- ress in advancing our goals.” Mr, Bush rejected a similar bill earlier this year, and Con- gress failed to muster the two- thirds majority needed to over: ride his veto.

        "ocr_text": "Bug in blood may infect 1,000 Gulf War veterans By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — More than 1,000 Persian Gulf War veterans may be infected with a blood par- asite that can emerge decades from now to cause high fevers, extreme fatigue and diarrhea, a military doctor acknowledged Wednesday. The disease, probably caused by the bite of a female sand fly, has been confirmed in only 11 Desert Storm veterans. But Dr. Charles Oster, chief of infectious diseases at the Wal- ter Reed Medical Center, said unpublished Army research studies on two groups of seem- ingly healthy elite troops sug- gests that “hundreds” of other Gulf War veterans may have the infection without knowing it. “We are probably only seeing the sickest of the people who are infected, and there are presum- ably another 10 to 100 times that number who have been infected with this organism but didn’t get sick, or didnt get sick enough to get medical attention,” Dr. Oster said. He based his judgment on research in the slums of Brazil on a similar parasitic illness. Dr. Oster said such parasites can exist in a virtually harmless state for decades, and then cause major illness if the human im- mune system is suppressed by cancer chemotherapy, an organ transplant or AIDS. The Pentagon announced the existence of the Gulf War disease — viscerotropic leishmaniasis — last November. Since then it has reported “several hundred” oth- er complaints from veterans complaining of unexplained flu- like symptoms. But an Army re- port last month attributed most of the complaints to “very high levels of stress.” Yet as Dr. Oster’s comments suggested, the Army’s infectious disease researchers at Walter Reed are still troubled by a dis- ease they don’t fully understand. Walter Reed’s research institute has just awarded a high-priority Atlanta Journal-Constitution October 1, 1992 contract for development of a leishmaniasis screening test that Dr. Oster says will probably be administered in about two years to every Desert Storm veteran. One reason the military is rushing the tests, Dr. Oster said, ds that researchers have not yet been able to rule out the possibil- «ity that soldiers could in rare ,cases transmit the leishmaniasis parasite through sexual re- ‘ations. :} He said a search of medical {literature has turned up one case in Britain a decade or so ago when a man with a related form >of leishmaniasis parasite did » pass it to his wife through sex. a. “You can say from that one ag {in Britain] that sexual {transmission is possible. You can also infer from the lack of similar .cases that it probably doesn’t happen very often. But that’s something that hasn’t been looked at critically. We don’t know how often.” ** Asked what advice he would ' offer to Gulf War veterans and ‘their spouses, Dr. Oster said: “ “Since there is only one case in +world literature of sexual trans- mission of leishmaniasis, and ‘since we haven't seen document- \"ed disease of spouses of anyone ‘who has been in the Gulf, I would ““say there was no reason for them _ to be concerned about sexual “transmission. “If on the other hand, they ™ are concerned and want to do * something to protect their *-gpouse, then a condom would be ’ what I would recommend.” _. One of the first confirmed ‘victims, Staff Sgt. Victor Malloy, \"35, of the 82nd Airborne Division ‘“in Fort Bragg, N.C., described > the effect on him in a separate in-, ¢‘terview: ‘In Saudi Arabia, I used to be * able to run 10 miles in less than “*one hour. Now, if I walk six *? blocks I am exhausted and I have to come home for a nap. I am .’ lightheaded, I am weak. It is like . a flu that doesn’t go away.” Sergeant Malloy, an infantry >i forward observer in Saudi Ara- bia, said a Walter Reed doctor ;. asked him three months ago for a '-t semen sample to check whether 7 he was capable of transferring ‘4:the disease to his wife. Both Ser- | geant Malloy and Dr. Oster said ‘sno parasites were found in the ~ semen. \\ Sergeant Malloy’s illness, which began in late 1991, led Army researchers to conduct the best available blood tests on about 130 troops who fought with him in Saudi Arabia and Iraq be- tween December 1990 and March 1991. Blood tests on about nine of the paratroopers showed evi- dence of exposure to the same parasites, even though most of the soldiers showed no sign of ill- ness, Dr. Oster confirmed. . A second Army research study found a “cluster” of appar- ently healthy leishmaniasis car- riers in the Army Foreign Mate- riel Intelligence Battalion, a unit of intelligence specialists from Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. Dr. Oster confirmed that “about 4 to S percent” of the roughly 200 active Army soldiers in the Fort Bragg and Aberdeen units had been found to have some evidence of leishmaniasis infection, even though only two soldiers were showing disease symptoms. “I don’t like to quote that be- cause that test is no good,” Dr. Oster said. “It may be alarmist on the one hand to suggest that S percent of our soldiers were in- fected. It may be conservative on the other hand. Maybe it is 10 percent [who] got infected. The point is we just don’t know until we have better diagnostic tests.” Con ported last February: “CDC and the U.S. Department of Defense do not recommend evaluating asymptomatic persons for evi- dence of infection: effective screening tests are not available, and whether treating asymptom- atic persons is beneficial is own.” Doctors with patients show- ing leishmaniasis-like symptoms were advised to call these re- search centers: ®» Army: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 800-423-0231. ® Navy/Marines: U.S. Naval 7 ee San Diego, 619-532- » Air Force: USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, San Anto- nio, Tex., 512-670-7444. > Civilians: CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases, 404-488- Marcia Kunstel of the Washing- oe eM contributed to this ar- \f"

        "ocr_text": "UN establishes War crimes panel Investigators to focus on charges of atrocities in Yugoslav conflicts By Marcia Kunetel Cox News Service WASHINGTON — The movement to try war criminals in Yugoslavia’s bloody contlict — the first international effort to punish war crimes since World War II — gained momentum Tuesday when the U.N, Secur- ty Council voted unanimously to form a panel to investigate alleged atrocities, The council called on member states to submit any information on war crimes with- in 80 days and directed Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to establish an im- partial commission to analyze the data. The panel of experts also would investi- gate hostilities in the former republics of ‘Yugoslavia, then present its conclusions “on ‘the evidence of grave breaches of the Geneva ‘Convention and other breaches of interna: ‘tional humanitarian law,” according to the council resolution, The panel also will rec- ommend further action, Council representatives said they hope the action will deter crimes, although trial are not expected soon, The US. delegate to the United Nations, Hidward Perkins, said the resolution ‘sends a clear message that those responsible for the atrocities and gross violations, including Violations involved in the process of ‘ethnic Cars d We eS Uf} LOTMe P and owler War Crim Yugoslavia, must be brought to justice.” The United States spear- headed the move amid contin- ued reports of atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, includ- ing rapes of teen-age girls and the forced removal of thou- sands of civilians in the pro- cess known as ethnic cleansing. The State Department has submitted one report to the United Nations, a nine-page compilation alleging atrocities committed almost exclusively by Serbs against Muslims. It includes reported murders of fleeing refugees, fatal beatings of men in concentration camps and examples of ethnic cleansing. The new panel is similar to the 1943 commission created by the Allies 49 years ago to ensure the trial and punish- ment of persons accused of Nazi war crimes. That led to the creation of the interna- tional military tribunal that conducted the Nuremberg tri- als two years later, resulting in convictions of 19 former Nazi leaders, 12 of whom were sen- tenced to death. nte ational standards such as the Geneva Conven- tion prohibit the murder, de- tention and _ forcible displacement of _ civilians; rape; torture; mistreatment of POWs; attacks on the wound- ed or on medical units; and collective punishment against a population, according to Fe- lice Gaer, executive director of European programs for the United Nations Association, a think tank in New York. She said the new commis- sion is weakened by having to report to the secretary-general rather than directly to the Se- curity Council, and by its lack of a time frame for its work. “There's no deadline. This could take years,” she said. Bosnia’s ambassador, Mu- hammed Sacirbey, was skepti- cal about the latest resolution. “Our concern is that it may be a first step that may end up like many other resolutions,” he said, “serving the purpose of public relations and ulti- mately ending up forgotten and without implementation.” “This is not the most robust thing possible,” one Western official said, This article includes material from The Associated Press, The Wash- ington Post andhe New York Times.

I have diarrhea that doesn’t quit. Iam so tired I cannot do anything.” When Mr. Clark, 35, came back from Saudi Arabia last November, medics at Fort Jackson, S.C., released him to ci- vilian life without so much as checking his blood pressure, he says. So, the Tennessee Nation- Chartes Thanksgiving with parasites in his Oster blood. What these  one- celled “‘bugs”’ have done to Mr. Clark offers a disquieting preview of the medical, finan- cial and bureaucratic burdens that may await hundreds of other healthy Gulf War veterans in decades to come. Mr. Clark is one of 10 sufferers from the microscopic parasite called leishmania tropica who formed an unofficial “support group” while at Walter Reed Army Medi- cal Center in Washington. Mr. Clark and six of the others said in interviews that they are trying to help one another through an illness the military would rather forget. “I think they just want you to get frus- trated and say forget it,” he says. ““Well, we can’t forget it.” Army doctors have concluded that Mr. Clark acquired the parasite from a Saudi sand fly bite he doesn’t remember. His chief doctor, Col. Charles Oster, hief of infectious diseases at Walte: need TODD LILARD / Special Roger Clark, 35, says he has been unable to work since falling victim to a parasite while in Saudi Arabia. acknowledged in an interview last week that more than 1,000 Operation Desert Storm vet- erans may be infected with the same para- site without yet showing symptoms. Colonel Oster said the Army is develop- ing a simple skin test to identify those who have been exposed to the parasite without knowing it. Once the test is perfected and licensed by the Food and Drug Administra- tion, it may be administered to all Gulf War veterans in a year or so, he said. To Mr. Clark, Colonel Oster’s state- ments are a welcome sign that the Army is taking the disease more seriously. Only two months ago, he said, another Walter Reed doctor told him his complaints of muscle weakness “are all in your head.” On Thursday, the Senate gave final con- gressional approval to legislation that would require the government to provide health examinations to Operation Desert Storm veterans and fund a review of their health problems. His wife, Patsy, 36, who works in an in- surance agency, says the couple and their two children had been put in a financial crunch as they dickered with the Army over how much compensation Mr. Clark is due. They have kept current on their bills, she said, by borrowing $3,500 from theif. parents. Last week, the Army gave ie some breathing room by mailing a long: awaited paycheck for $1,900. ha Mr. Clark’s troubles began early 1991 when he ignored the soldier’s jinx: He: volunteered for something. eee He was then a civilian making $24, 00a: : ; year as a mortgage field representative, E traveling throughout West Tennessee and. : North Mississippi for Lomas Mortgage, & Dallas company. + Then a husky, 195-pound, 6-foot- 2-inch ex-Marine, Mr. Clark used to keep in shape by bench-pressing 300 pounds at the gym. four days a week and by running the other - three days.

He spent most of that scorching summer hosing down U.S. mili- tary equipment and supervising an Army. shower facility for homebound troops. Mr. Clark flew home Nov. 11. As it hap- pened, that was one day before the Penta- gon issued a low-key announcement that military physicians had discovered ‘“‘limit- ed cases” of infection caused by leishman- ia parasites among Gulf War veterans. As of this week, the Pentagon says 17 troops have the milder “cutaneous” form of the disease and 11 others have the more debilitating ‘“viscerotropic” variety. Since March, Mr. Clark has been expe- riencing a perplexing mixture of the two forms — something the Army’s top doctors hadn’t foreseen. 5B Thebes eae Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 9, 1992 \f"

Iraq refused to accept the new boundaries, but the U.N. Security Council reaffirmed the commis- Sion’s authority to set the new line. The border area, alternating between swampy and desert ter- rain, is not well marked. Even local policemen find themselves con- fused and lost at times, according to UNIKOM guards. In the last three months a Brit- ish caterer and three Swedish engi- neers who said they thought they were in Kuwait were seized in the area. All four were sentenced to seven years in Iraqi prison for illegally entering the country. The seizure of Hall, if it is not overturned by higher Iraqi authori- ties, contradicts the policy adopted at the highest levels in Baghdad only a month ago, when a “no-fly zone” over the lower third of Iraq was implemented. At that time, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his subordinates were careful not to provoke any crisis in rela- tions with Washington. They con- demned the allied action, but took no overt counteraction. Officials in Baghdad said at the time this was part of an effort to deny Bush any advantage that might score him political points in the U.S. presidential election. More recently, Iraq has asked the U.N. Special Commission not to send a new team of weapons in- spectors into Iraq as scheduled this month, expressing fears the team will provoke a confrontation that would accrue political capital to Bush.

        "ocr_text": " Explosives expert said months ago that he'd ‘go willingly’ if seized By MIRIAM AMIE and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau KUWAIT CITY — Clinton “Chad” Hall knew the risks. “In the event of an incident, our staff will go along willingly,” Hall said last spring. “But we will be in constant communications with UNIKOM (the U.N. observation force on the Iraq border).” In fact, that appears to be precisely what happened Thursday when Hall, a bomb-disposal expert, was reportedly seized at gunpoint by Iraqi security agents in a disputed and ill-defined border area that separates Kuwait and Iraq. A tall, muscular man who had served in the U.S. military, Hall had thought plenty about the hazards of running an explosives removal operation within yards of Iraq’s unmarked southern border. “We are using GPS’ and LORANS to verify our positions along the DMZ,” Hall said last spring. It was a revealing glimpse. Here was a calm, careful man who was not content to rely solely on a portable satellite Global Positioning System receiv- er to check his location. He also was going to run a double check GPS using the same kind of LORAN navigation equip- ment used by sailors. “We hope not,” he said with a laugh when asked him whether he might run into trouble. That was back in March. Hall's company had just won an $11 million subcontract to remove explosives from a 290-square-mile patch of desert and marshland along the Kuwait-Iraq border. The prime contractor is a Turkish firm, ICTAS, which won the assignment from the Kuwaiti government and then farmed out the business to Hall’s firm and several others. His company’s assignment was to find cluster bomblets dropped by U.S. planes and to empty several Iraqi ammunition depots. The sector wasn’t heavily mined. But it did include large Iraqi bunker complexes, any one of which could be booby- trapped. What made the assignment especially awkward was that his workspace lapped over a part of Palm Beach Post - October 10, 1992 ‘Chad’ Hall knew he was working in a risky situation. northern Kuwait that Iraq has sporadically claimed as its own. The eastern edge of his company’s zone covers part of Bubiyan Island, the marshy spit of northern Kuwait that Iraqi President Saddam Hus- sein tried to seize in August 1990. Hall’s business card said he was operations manager of Environmental Health Research and Testing, Inc., specializing in “explosive ordinance disposal and remedial services.” On the back of the card he wrote “Lexington, Ky.,” to denote his company’s home office. Back then, he had only a dozen employees in Kuwait. But he was on his way to the airport for a flight to India, where he hoped to recruit a sizeable staff to carry out the manual labor. He also talked of recruiting American ex-military men who were trained in explosive ordinance disposal. Hall is one of at least 150 American ex-service- men earning high salaries for removing mines from the Kuwaiti desert. Almost all are graduates of the Navy Explosive Ordinance Disposal School in Indi- an Head, Md., which trains a few specialists for each military service every year. But except for Hall, most of the American explosives specialists work in a quadrant of south- ern Kuwait that is 25 miles or so inside the Kuwait- Iraq border. . Blond with rugged good looks and dressed like Joe College, Hall gave the appearance of a man in his mid-40s. But a spokesman for his company, Dushyant Gulati, said by telephone from Kentucky Friday that Hall is “about 50-plus years.” Gulati wouldn’t say much about Hall’s back- ground, except that he had once served in the U.S. military. “His family hasn’t allowed us to release that,” Gulati said when asked about whether he was married. Nor would the spokesman say where Hall makes his home. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Iran seeks to dominate culf again With Iraq humbled, its old foe is making moves that are raising concern. By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Iran, one of the most anti-Western countries left in the world, is moving to fill a pivotal power vacuum created by the defeat of Iraq in the Persian Gulf War. The Iranian regime still is largely controlled by hard-line Muslim fundamentalists. It has raised new concern in Washington and among its Arab neighbors by: @ Threatening to fight for con- trol of three small but strategically important gulf islands — Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunb — that have historical ties to and are claimed by the United Arab Emir- ates. @ Purchasing as many as three advanced diesel-electric subma- rines from Russia, gaining a broad advantage that will allow Iran to control Strait of Hormuz shipping lanes that transport much of the world’s oil supplies. @ Working to develop a nuclear capability, particularly through purchases and contacts with China. @ Trying to establish influence within the newly independent Mus- lim states of Central Asia that used to form part of the Soviet Union. Iran has provoked consterna- tion in the Arab League, heated rhetoric in the U.S. Congress and admonitions from the Bush admin- “With the disappearance of the Iraqi threat, the other side of the equation — Iran — has started to think and to act as the sole power in the region,” Egyptian Foreign Min- ister Amr Moussa said during a recent Washington visit. The volatile dispute over the islands this fall alerted Iran’s gulf neighbors that they again must worry about their old nemesis, an exporter of Muslim fundamental- ism that threatens more moderate and even marginally more secular regimes. Moussa said the Arab League is fully backing efforts by the UAE to have the U.N. Security Council re- solve the dispute over the islands, strategically located dots of land from which Iran based attacks on oil tankers during the Iran-Iraq War. “The gulf area does not deserve a third war. That’s whv we want the U.N. to intervene,” Moussa said. The Iranians have picked a con- venient moment for expansionism: @ The United States is preoccu- pied with domestic problems and the presidential election. @ The Arab nations have yet to join a regional security arrange- ment that would counterweight Iran. @ And cash-starved, munitions- loaded nations such as Russia and China are anxious to sell weapons systems to whoever can pay. The Bush administration urged Russia not to sell the submarines, which are among the hardest to detect because they run so quietly. But after just announcing two ma- jor sales of American jet bombers to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia, U.S. arguments against weapons prolif- eration fell flat. Amid passionate oratory, the Senate made a last-minute attempt te deny Russia foreign aid if it Palm Beach Post - October 11, 1992 “This killing machine the Irani- ans are building must be stopped,”’ said Sen. Alphonse D’Amato, R- N.Y., supporting the measure that the Senate adopted. However, a Senate-House conference commit- tee bowed to the administration’s fear of jeopardizing aid to Russia and decided merely to require the president to talk with the Russians about not selling to Iran. China also has been a willing salesman but in the more danger- ous nuclear field. London’s Interna- tional Institute for Strategic Stud- ies just reported that the Chinese are selling Iran a nuclear reactor for a power plant and said contacts appear not to be limited to peaceful pursuits. A leader of the Iranian opposi- tion in exile, visiting Washington last week, said the head of Iran’s nuclear program led a group of scientists on an extended visit to China, which he claimed is supply- ing Iran with enriched uranium. “This is only the first step, and of course there are other initiatives in store,” said Monammaa Mo- haddessin, director of International Relations for the People’s Mojahe- din Organization of Iran. Mohaddessin said one reason Iran is flexing its muscle is to divert the attention of an increas- ingly dissatisfied population. Some Arab leaders, such as the Egyptian foreign minister, say some good may come out of Iran’s threatening moves if the fear final- ly prompts the gulf nations to build a serious regional security net- work. Clovis Maksoud, former Arab League director who now is a pro- fessor at American University, said Iran is not spreading its revolution- ary fervor as energetically as in the past. It has turned to more conventional means of gaining in- fluence, and those can be more easily deterred, he said. “Tt is ultimately manageable, if the Arab states get their act togeth- er in a much more coordinated fashion,” he said. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Gulf vets who served in same camp show cluster of mysterious ailments By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The Persian Gulf War mystery syndrome has grown more perplexing with the Navy’s acknowledgement of an unreported cluster of ailments afflicting 79 Seabee Reservists who served together in the desert. Seventeen Seabees from a Navy construction detachment in Columbus, Ga., are among those under observation, their com- mander, Lt. Timothy Simpson, said in a telephone interview. The others are from construction battalion units in Greensboro and Charlotte, N.C.; Knoxville, Ky.; and Huntsville, Ala. “IT got sores all over my arms and I get them in my mouth,” said Roger Flynn, 43, of Soddy Daisy, Tenn., who bulldozed combat roads into Kuwait during the war. “My joints hurt so bad it’s hard to walk. I have these headaches you can’t believe.” Some Navy doctors believe that about 25 of the most serious- ly ill Seabees are infected with a microscopic blood parasite called leishmania tropica, which is virtually unknown in North America. One of its hazards, ac- cording to a November 1991 Pen- tagon statement, is that the mi- crobes may be transmissible by blood transfusions. “I’m trying to identify a set of symptoms and physical signs that defines the illness I’m study- ing — whatever the illness might be,” said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Chris Ohl, a Navy medical investigator at Bethesda Naval Hospital in . Maryland. “One possibility is leishmani- asis,” Lieutenant Commander Ohl said in a written answer to a Cox Newspapers query. “But a lot of doctors out there don’t think it is leishmaniasis.” The Army has reported find- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 19, 1992 ing leishmania in skin, lymph and bone marrow samples from 27 Army Desert Storm veterans. And Dr. Charles Oster, chief of infectious diseases at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washing- ton, said recently that as many as 1,000 other Gulf War veterans may be infected without showing signs. One clue being pursued by Navy investigators is that all the Seabee Reservists are part of a 750-member battalion that lived in a single camp. Members of Na- val Mobile Construction Battal- ion 24 say they lived in a tent complex called Camp 13, which sprang up near the Saudi Arabi- an industrial port of Jubail. The Navy has dispatched several teams of medical specimen hunt- ers to Saudi Arabia to search the former campsite. So far, microscopic examina- tions have not turned up a single specimen carrying the parasite, said Capt. Perry Bishop, a spokesman for the Navy Bureau of Medicine. And the parasite has been positively identified in only one of the 79 Seabees, he said. Capt. Stephen Cunnion, the Navy’s director of preventive medicine, said in an interview that the illness is not life-threat- ening and that patients often get better gradually without having to risk the highly toxic medicines that are the only known cure. Even so, four of the once-rug- ged Seabees said in separate in- terviews that their illnesses have left them so debilitated that they can’t work at their former civil- ian jobs. Three months ago, Mr. Flynn said, he was laid off by the Chat- tanooga, Tenn., company that employed him as a truck driver. “I couldn’t handle my job,” he explained. “By noon or 1 o’clock, I couldn’t climb into the cab of the truck.” Another Seabee, Chief Petty Officer Jerry Jones, 50, of Leicester, N.C., said he lacks the energy to work his old job as a bulldozer mechanic for the North Carolina Transportation Depart- ment. “About an hour a day is all I can make it,” he said.

However, the spokesman said, the State Department did allow the committee access to a number of secret cables, on the basis that they would remain classified, in- cluding “a sampling of the State Department instructions” to the embassy in Baghdad in the weeks and months before Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990. The spokesman said the State Department has maintained that there was no specific cable of in- structions to Glaspie immediately before the crucial meeting she held with Iraqi President Saddam Hus- sein on July 25, 1990, a week before the invasion of Kuwait. Austin American-Statesman - October 20, 1992 “The State Department said there were no specific instruc- tions,” the committee spokesman said, “because the meeting with Saddam came up on short notice,” The Glaspie-Saddam meeting has been a point of controversy since September 1990, when Iraq released an edited transcript of the conversation portraying Glaspie as indicating Iraq had little reason to expect a strong U.S. response to any move against Kuwait. “We have no opinion on Arab- Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait,” the Traqi transcript quoted Glaspie as saying. At the time, the State De- partment publicly refused to com- ment on the transcript, giving some observers the impression that it was substantially true. \f"

        "ocr_text": "US. elections may spell stagnation for Mideast talks By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — As Mideast peace talks resume here today, negotiators who have slogged through nearly a year of margin- al achievement may find them- selves stymied by the dynamics of U.S. presidential politics. Bold initiatives during the coming 10-day session would surprise most analysts, primari- ly because the U.S. officials who massaged this process into exis- tence are so preoccupied. “Given Washington’s central role in the peace process, all sides are likely to await the out- come of the election before tak- ing a major step in a new direc- tion,” Rob Satloff of the Wash- ington Institute for Near East Policy said at a briefing Tuesday. In almost a year of talks, ne- gotiators finally have abandoned procedural spats and started grappling with the issues that have kept them at war. Now, the experts say, they need help. | Progress in Syrian-Israeli talks over control of the Israeli- occupied Golan Heights remains most promising, but even they were close to an impasse at the end of the last round. While the State Department has sent “bridging proposals” to both Arab and Israeli negotiators since the sixth round of talks closed last month, the sugges- tions are described as failing to help close big gaps separating Is- raelis from their partners in the separate talks — Syrians, Pales- tinians, Lebanese and Jorda- nians. It is the loss of former Secre- tary of State James Baker, who left diplomacy for the White House to pump up President Bush’s limp re-election cam- paign, that is most seriously felt. “What you've got is a process that only happened because American leverage made it hap- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 21, 1992 pen,” said James Zogby, director of the Arab-American Institute. “Absent that use of leverage and finesse, nothing is going to happen.” The reduced U.S. input comes at a time when it is badly needed. “We are really nearing a point of breakthrough or break- down,” said Martin Indyk, direc- tor of the Washington Institute. Israel’s Labor government, only in office since last summer, already is cracking at the seams and is expected to reshuffle its governing coalition to keep con- trol of parliament. Prime Minis- ter Yitzhak Rabin has little to show for his strong commitment to the peace process and faces agitation to harden Israel’s stands. The Palestinians are in even worse shape, confronting widen- ing opposition to continuing ne- gotiations because they have not carried any progress back to the 1.8 million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. Growing, violent unrest in the territories makes Israelis less willing to bend, but pressures Palestinian negotiators to achieve something to -take back home, and to do it fast. Movement when talks restart after the Nov. 3 election, howev- er, could be in store. The negotia- tors will need a breakthrough. And the administration, win or lose, will be less pre-occupied. Mr. Indyk speculated that U.S. diplomatic efforts now are i at keeping momentum alive, rather than achieving im- mediate success. It may be the groundwork for Mr. Baker to re-enter the picture after the election, Mr. Indyk said, “in a swan song effort to achieve some breakthrough agreements before he leaves the peace process for [his ranch in] Wyoming or the White House to take care of domestic affairs.” \f"

        "ocr_text": "For first time, Israeli utters. ‘withdrawal’ in Syrian falks By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Peace talks between Israel and Syria moved a notch forward Wednesday, when Israe- lis made a commitment to some undefined form of withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, Israeli negotiators read a statement to their Syrian counterparts that apparently for the first time went further than the vague phrase ‘‘territorial dimension,” specifying that Israel is willing to talk about the concept of withdrawing from the plateau it has occupied since capturing it from Syria in the 1967 war. The overture came on the opening day of the seventh round of Mideast peace talks, which started almost one year ago between Israel and teams from Syria, Jordan, the Palestinians and Lebanon. Syria has committed itself to making peace with Israel, but only in return for total withdrawal from the Golan Heights, And the Syrians have refused to define What they mean by “peace,” which is important to Israelis who want full diplomatic and economic rela- tions with open borders. The third major issue to negotiate is a security arrangement to assure Israel a defense against Syrian attacks on the Israeli farmlands stretching below the heights, as well as assure Syria security against an Israeli offensive. Itamar Rabinovich, chief of Israel's delegation talking with Syria, confirmed after State Department talks Wednesday evening that the word “withdrawal” does appear in the new Israeli paper. “We don't use this word mindlessly and we don’t use it in the abstract,” Rabinovich said, That means that withdrawal cannot be viewed separately, but must be discussed in the context of the Palm Beach Post - October 22, 1992 Israeli citizens get gas masks By LOUIS J. SALOME Palm Beach Post Staff Writer OR YEHUDA, Israel — The army began distributing new gas masks to Israeli citizens on Wednesday, By next September, authorities plan to dis- tribute about 5 million new gas mask kits to protect all Israeli citizens against chemical weapons. Many of those kits will replace defec- tive gas masks distributed before the 1991 Per- sian Gulf War, in which Israel was struck by 39 Iraqi Scud missiles, all of which carried conven- tional warheads, Brig. Gen. Yishai Dotan of the civil defense authority said the nearly 2 million Palestinians who live in the occupied territories will not receive gas masks, but that the 110,000 Jewish settlers in the territories will receive them. He said the Palestinians, like tourists who happen to be visiting Israel, would receive masks only in an emergency, other two issues — peace and security — explained Ruth Yaron, spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy, The new Israeli proposal apparently did not speci- fy withdrawal from all or from part of the Golan, ~ Israel and Syria are working toward a format agreement of principles, which would not specify the terms of peace but would outline what both sides agree must be the elements of any settlement. Such an agreement would be a dramatic breakthrough. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Vet °100% sure’ Iraq had U.S. arms By Joseph Albright Cox News Service WASHINGTON — A young paratrooper veteran came forward Thursday to challenge President Bush’s claim in Monday night’s presidential debate that Iraqi forces had no American-made weapons in the Persian Gulf war. “T saw them with my own eyes,” i Austinite James Ellebracht, Ellebracht said that about a week after the March 1991 cease- fire, he and his unit were flown in Blackhawk helicopters from Saudi Arabia into Iraq to seize an Iraqi ammunition storage complex. Ellebracht and a former Army comrade told of finding clearly marked American TOW anti-tank missiles in one of the more than 50 ammunition warehouses they were ordered to occupy. In separate telephone interviews, they said they also found U.S.-made small arms ammunition. “We were totally disgusted by the fact that they had American weapons, but there was not much we could do about it,” said Elle- bracht, who then held the enlisted rank of specialist with the 82nd 7 Adin Division of Fort Bragg, The second soldier, a 20-year- old specialist still on duty with the 82nd Airborne, declined to have his name published for fear of be- ing punished. Both paratroopers said they seized and held the ammunition cache near the Iraqi town for about two days. Then, they said, another unit of Army explosives experts moved in and used demolition charges to destroy it. In Monday night’s debate, Bush told Ross Perot and about 90 mil- lion television onlookers that Iraq had possessed no American weapons. “The battlefield was searched,” Bush said, “and there wasn’t one single iota of evidence that any U.S. weapons were on_ that battlefield.” Austin American-Statesman Ellebracht telephoned the Aus- tin American-Statesman to say he was “totally outraged” to hear the Bush remark as he watched the debate. “We read the lettering on the side,” said Ellebracht, who fin- ished his four-year hitch and now is getting ready to apply to college. “T am 100 percent sure.” At Fort Bragg, Col. Dan McNeill, who was one of Elle- bracht’s superiors in Desert Storm, said through an Army spokesman that he never received reports that any of his troops found TOWs or other U.S.-made armaments on the battlefield. However, McNeill confirmed that Ellebracht’s company was he- licoptered into Iraq to support oth- er troops assigned to demolish a big Iraqi ammunition complex near the Euphrates River. By McNeill’s account, the operation destroyed 53 tons of Iraqi ammu- nition, much of it of Soviet and German manufacture. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Pentagon sold hundreds of TOWs to help cement friendly relation- ships with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and Kuwait. During the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Jordan and Kuwait gave some of their TOWS to Iraq, according to an investiga- tion earlier this year by the U.S. General Accounting Office. . By Thursday, Bush was backing away from his statement on Iraqi arms. “Maybe I overstated it a lit- tle bit,” the president said in a CBS-TV interview. Veteran James Ellebracht, 22, of Austin says he saw American-made am- munition among the weapons in this Iraqi warehouse. Ellebracht was sent to guard the supplies about a week after the March 1991 gulf war cease-fire. October 23, 1992 \f"

Seventy-nine Seabee reservists throughout the Southeast are being observed by Navy doc- tors as possible victims of leishmanaisis, a blood-parasite infection that causes persistent fatigue and flulike symptoms.

Jerry Jones, 50, of Leicester, N.C., a Navy Seabee reservist who has been too debilitated to perform his old job as a bulldozer mechanic for the North Carolina Transportation Department, applauded the announcement. “That sounds real good,” said Mr. Jones, who had been turned down for a state disability pen- sion on the grounds that his affliction grew out of his involvement in Operation Desert Storm. As a chief petty officer with more than 16 years service, Mr. Jones could earn as much as $2,920 a month in “incapacitation pay” from the Navy for up to six months.

'. The mood of an electorate worried about America first, the strong possibility of a new gang in the White House, and the Bush adminis- ‘ tration’s sudden forsaking of foreign affairs are to blame. The clearest sign was the decapitation of the U.S. foreign policy apparatus when James Baker abandoned his job as secretary of state in August | and spirited away the State Department’s ire} echelon to try to rescue President Bush’s re- election campaign.

        "ocr_text": "Israel offers informal | Military will hold its fire -if foes in Lebanon do same _ By Louis J. Salome and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS — Political and military leaders said Tuesday that Israel would halt its latest retaliatory attacks on guerrillas in Lebanon, provided the guerril- las stop their own assaults. Aides to Prime Minister Yitz- hak Rabin said the government would give the go-ahead for fur- ther land and air strikes only if Hezbollah fighters continued the attacks they launched Sunday that killed five Israeli soldiers and wounded five others in Isra- - el’s self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon. Mr. Rabin vowed Tuesday night to push ahead with the Mid- dle East peace talks in Washing- ton, despite the surge of violence in the region and opposition to the talks by Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. As a warning against possible further attacks, Israel pushed tanks and troops into the 9-mile- wide buffer zone in Lebanon on Tuesday during a second day of air and ground attacks against Iranian-backed Hezbollah fight- ers and villages. Hezbollah, which opposes the peace talks and the existence of Israel, is seeking to drive Israeli forces out of Lebanon. In Washington, the peace talks lurched through another day, disturbed but not ruptured by the violence in the region. Lebanese delegation leader Souheil Chammas said his nation sympathizes with the loss of life Israel suffered, but he accused the Israelis of overreacting. He pledged to keep talking. “We will let no developments, grave as they may be, sway us from the decision we have taken, namely to pursue the course of these negotiations and stay in the negotiating process regardless of the pressures that we’re put un- der,” Mr. Chammas said. His Israeli counterpart, Uri Lubrani, likewise pledged to con- tinue negotiations, while at the same time promising that Israel will do “whatever is necessary” to achieve security in its north- ern territory. Palestinians and the Syrians did continue on substantive issues, despite the bad feelings all sides showed over the clash in Lebanon. a No specific progress was reported « Beirut BO rCom acme oes eee Mr. Lubrani challenged Arab contentions that Israel’s military occupation of Lebanon has not served to bring security but has provoked the trouble. Mr. Lu- brani said the force is necessary to combat terrorist groups that the Lebanese are unable to control. The Palestinians observed five minutes of silence during their session with Israeli negoti- ators, to protest Israel’s attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in- side Lebanon that was alleged to harbor terrorists. Israel’s separate talks with the from any of the sessions. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, who commands Israel’s army in the north, said at a news conference Tuesday that Israel would not ini- tiate attacks and would retaliate only if Hezbollah launched fur- ther strikes. If southern Lebanon and Israel’s northern border re- main quiet, General Mordechai said, so will the Israeli army. Israel’s air and ground strikes at midday Tuesday in the Bekaa Valley north of the securi- ty zone were triggered by Hez- bollah Katyusha rocket attacks at dawn that killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five other peo- _ple in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. It was the first lethal rocket attack in the town since Israel’s invasion of Leba- non in 1982. Another Katyusha salvo killed a Lebanese teacher and his 18-month-old son inside the se- curity zone. > Canada’s future cloudy after voters reject agreement B2 > U.N. envoy may quit over famine in Somalia B4 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 28, 1992 \f"

By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Arab negoti- ators said Wednesday that Ameri- can intervention may be required soon to push Mideast peace talks forward, as the peace process closed its first year with one clear accomplishment: It did not fall apart. Palestinian spokeswoman Ha- nan Ashrawi said her delegation will ask U.S. officials to take a greater role when they meet on Thursday, and Syrian chief negotia- tor Moaffak al-Allaf said his dele- gation also may ask the Americans to intervene soon to help bridge gaps separating Arab and Israeli positions. Israel consistently has opposed greater involvement by the spon- sors of the talks. Negotiators began a break for the U.S. presidential election at the close of talks Wednesday, and will resume discussions in round seven Nov. 9. Ashrawi said the lack of pro- gress after a year of talks requires all parties to renew their commit- ment to the original terms of the process, which also must be rein- vigorated ‘with the activation of the role of the co-sponsors directly in the negotiations.” Palm Beach Post - October 29, 1992 In THE MIDEAST In other regional develop- ments Wednesday: @ A COMMITTEE of Israel's parliament decided not to punish four members of the Knesset who recently met with Palestine Liberation Or- ganization Chairman Yasser Arafat or his top aides in vio- lation of an Israeli ban on such contacts. @ THOUSANDS of Palestin- ians marched through Da- mascus demanding the Pal- estinian delegation walk out of the peace talks unless Is- rael agrees to discuss an in- dependent Palestinian state.

        "ocr_text": "U.S. treasurer linked to Georgia firm Alleged influence peddling probed By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The FBI said Friday that it has searched the waterside apart- ment of the Bush appointee who signs billions of dollar bills, in what emerged as a bribery investigation involving an Atlanta-area telecommunications com- Pany in which she holds a large financial interest. U.S. Treasurer Catalina “‘Cathi’’ Vas- quez Villalpando, who has been the pres- ident’s unofficial ambassador to Hispan- ic voters, ‘‘has taken leave to deal with her personal situation,’’ said Treasury Department spokesman Rich Meyers. The inquiry evidently centers on whether she improperly accepted travel, lodging and other benefits from her for- mer company, which specializes in win- ning federal contracts under various mi- nority business set-aside programs. With the election four days away, it was another dumbfounding political de- velopment in which the president finds another prominent associate being in- vestigated by an investigative arm he os- tensibly controls. Neither Ms. Villalpando, the compa- ny, nor President Bush made any com- ment. During her 3 2 years in the largely ceremonial treasurer’s post, her signa- ture has been printed by the U.S. Mint on more than 20 billion greenbacks. Her most prominent moment came at the GOP convention in August when she called Democrat Bill Clinton a “skirt chaser” and then issued a statement apologizing ‘‘deeply.”’ Ms. Villalpando, 52, a Texan who served in the early ’80s as President Rea- gan’s White House assistant on Hispanic affairs, will collect her $112,300-a-year salary while authorities consider wheth- er to file any charges. Another focal point of the FBI search was the Norcross, Ga., headquarters of Communications International Inc., where she worked as a senior vice presi- dent before becoming U.S. treasurer in December 1989. The firm’s founder, former Atlanta Falcons’ running back Joe Profit, was Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 31, 1992 Villalpando Niewoieak o a that won 185 federal contracts during her tenure as treasurer. | quoted as saying that the FBI mentioned possible influence peddling to him when they searched the Communications In- ternational headquarters at 6020 Unity Drive in Norcross. Thursday, the FBI took the unusual step of disclosing that it had executed a search warrant for the exact address and apartment number where Ms. Villal- pando lives. Without mentioning the names of those under suspicion, the FBI said the searches were carried out Wednesday under eight U.S. criminal statutes “to look for evidence, fruits and instrumen- talities of mail fraud; wire fraud; the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organiza- tions Act; bribery of public officials; con- spiracy; conspiracy to defraud the gov- ernment with respect to claims; and false statements.” The FBI also reportedly searched the Washington home of Ernest Olivas, who had been working for the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign as director of His- Panic outreach. Mr. Olivas was said Fri- day to be on leave from one of Communi- ena International’s two Washington offices. A computer search of government procurement records shows that Com-, munications International won 185 fed- eral contracts worth $27.9 million during. the first three years of Ms. Villalpando’s tenure as treasurer. Of this, $22.1 million was obtained without competitive bid- ding, the records indicate. Ms. Villalpando had the approval of the White House ethics office to keep a financial interest in Communications In- ternational. As of four months ago, she owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of stock in the company, according to a financial disclosure statement.

        "ocr_text": "Networks won't hold back on nammg winners Critics say hasty projections will reduce turnout in West By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Television net- works aren’t budging from plans to feed election-night hunger for news, despite growing claims that early projections of who won discourage people from voting out West. Congressional resolutions, pleas by public officials and letters from political leaders, including the Dem- ocratic Governors’ Association, the Republican national chairman and western secretaries of state, have not persuaded the networks to delay presidential projections until the polls close in the West at 8 p.m., which is 11 p.m. EST. The controversy even has spurred the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a normally mild-mannered think tank, to try to sabotage the networks, “What we're working on is ex- treme and what you would not try to do under any other circumstances: an effort to start a grass-roots move- ment and tie up the network phone lines,” said Curtis Gans, director of the bipartisan, non-profit research foundation. So the committee took out quar- ter-page newspaper ads, urging cit'- zens to call the networks at the num- bers listed to protest early pro- jections. Some affiliates rebel So far the campaign hasn’t even stirred network complaints, but a flanking move by four West Coast af- filiates of CBS clearly is an irritant. They have promised a mini-revolu- tion by refusing to carry network election-night results until their poll- ing places are ready to close locally, A CBS spokesman called it “a tre- mendous disservice” to viewers, not mentioning one key concern: that the decisions probably will lower CBS's election-night ratings. “We think what we're doing is a wonderful service to our viewers,” responded Mick Schafbuch, general manager of KOIN in Portland, Ore, “We think the value of the vote is worth waiting for,” Mr, Schafbuch remembers that criticism started on election night in 1988 and continued for weeks after CBS projected George Bush the pres- idential winner at 6:17 p.m., Portland _ time. Polls wouldn’t close for almost two hours, | Final-hour voting plunged by 50 percent from the 6-7 p.m. hour, Mr. Schafbuch said, which did not hap- pen in the May primary election. “We have so many issues — some very critical issues — on the ballot this year, and some very close races,” he said. His station does not want to dissuade people from voting, and thus swing a tight race in either di- rection. An obligation to viewers On the other side, the networks say that if news has been committed, they are obligated to report it. “Tf we didn’t announce a winner at all, there would effectively be no elec- tion-night coverage,” said Tom Good- man, a spokesman for CBS News, Ifone candidate is winning a land- slide, Mr, Goodman said, exit polls taken throughout the day would re- flect it, A winner could be named as soon as most polls have closed in the Rastern and Central time zones, around 8 p.m, EST. A tight race would take longer to project, as net: works working in a pool combine exit polls with actual vote results from Critics charge that networks man- ufacture news by using exit polls, not just vote counts, . Like other networks, CBS will an- hounce a winner as soon as projec- ‘tions show one candidate has won enough states to tally the necessary 270 electoral votes. “There have been a lot of studies done regarding the projections and the effect on the West Coast. There really is no effect,” said Mary Klette, director of elections and polling for NBC. Evidence is largely anecdotal, not statistical, she said, She maintained that most people on the West Coast already have voted by Sor6p.m., the earliest that projec- tions would be made, She said many people never hear the projections be- fore they vote, and many who do still will vote because of interest in local issues. In California, Secretary of State March Fong Eu seems resigned to early projections, despite her letters urging the networks to refrain, Her second round of pleas to the networks is that they accompany their projec- tions with admonitions that people vote anyway because local races have not been decided. And besides, the projections might be wrong, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 1, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "‘Unisex’ standards urged in military Women’s rights come with catch By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Female tank mechanics should be required to lift just as much weight as male troops to get the same military jobs, the presidential commis- sion on women in the military voted Monday. By adopting job- by-job strength standards, the commis- sioners endorsed the principle of sexual equality in the armed forces. But at the same time they spoke out for “gender-neutral” performance tests that in some cases most women soldiers will find impossible to pass. “It’s a move toward a unisex Army,’’ said commissioner Charles Moskos, a sociology pro- fessor from Northwestern Uni- versity. “It would mean a few women scattered in all the mili- tary specialities, but fewer wom- en in the military overall.” The 15-0 vote set the stage for a series of controversial votes to- day on whether Congress should drop the current legal restric- tions on allowing women in com- bat jobs. The Bush-appointed commis- sion remained sharply split on the eve of its major decision, with more support evident for allow- ing women as combat pilots than for allowing females in the front- line infantry. In justifying ‘“gender-neu- tral’ performance standards, the commissioners cited a recent military study which found that only 7 out of 100 women can score 60 on a push-up test, while 78 percent of men can exceed that standard. And one commissioner re- ported that 77 percent of women had flunked a Navy test for ship- board hose-dragging, while only one-half of one percent of men flunked. As of now, only the Air Force U.S. Army Sgt. Susan Kyle of Salem, Ore., cleans her rifle while on duty in Saudi Arabia. routinely imposes weight tests for specific jobs. For instance, the Air Force allows troops of ei- ther sex to serve as F-15 mainte- nance crew chiefs — provided they can lift 75 pounds. But if the commission’s rec- ommendation is accepted by Congress and the president, each Service would have to set re- quirements for each military job where strength and endurance are“relevant.”’ The commission, named by President Bush last March, is due to present its final report on Nov. 15. Both Mr. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton have side- stepped the issue of women in combat by promising to study the commission’s findings after they are issued. In another decision, the com- missioners narrowly rejected a move by several political con- servatives on the panel to ban the defense secretary from setting “goals that encourage the re- cruitment ... of women in the services, allowing for the re- quirement of each service.” _ Commissioner Elaine Don- nelly, who led the conservative argument, said, “equal opportu- nity is not the primary purpose of the military. The purpose of the military is to defend the country.”’. ; But a bloc led by three senior retired military officers defeated the conservative effort. _The commission also issued a set of factual “findings” that are sure to be widely quoted and de- bated when the next Congress faces final decisions on women in combat. The findings included: >A survey of attitudes of Persian Gulf War veterans found that 98 percent rated the perfor- mance of men in their units as “excellent or good,”’.. whereas ‘only 61 percent said women gave an “excellent or good” formance. > On any day, the pregnancy rate among servicewomen is 7.9 percent for the Army, 8.9 percent for Navy enlisted troops, 5.4 per- cent for Air Force enlisted troops and 5.8 percent for Marine en- listed troops. > During the Gulf War, 36,704 children were separated from their parents due to the wartime deployment of either a single parent or of both parents. per- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 3, 1992 \f"

The net effect would be to open more than 150,000 Navy seaboard bil- lets to women — provided they can pass new tests for endurance and upper-body strength.

George Bush, who presided in of- fice, but broke new ground as a leader, may find his spot in history as an afterword to Ronald Reagan. Saddled with a treacherous defi- cit, an opposition Congress and a disposition ill-suited to making deals on thorny domestic problems, Bush largely refused to get engaged at home. In many ways, he let af- fairs turn worse. He plowed into the internation- al arena with relish, however, scor- ing there the points that may win him note in the world and the his- tory books, according to analysts and historians asked to define the Bush legacy. Holding the helm at a time when the world transformed itself — from the bipolar hostility of the Cold War to a configuration yet to be settled — Bush responded as a skilful tactician who kept the ship afloat. Even here, though, he did not articulate a vision and chart a course into the waters of new and still dangerous times. “He is the tail end of a 12-year conservative cycle. He is a transi- tion president,” said Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, ‘who worked with three Republican ad- ministrations. To many, the leadership pinnacle of the Bush administration was the Persian Gulf war, the one case in which the president propelled events that would not have unfold- ed without him. He swung an oppo- sition Congress and an uninformed public enthusiastically behind a huge undertaking, and got the inter- national community to join him. Mideast stability “The achievement was stability in a very combustible part of the world that clearly would not have been stable if Saddam Hussein would not have been defanged,” Hess said. Bush pressed postwar de- mands to dismantle Iraq’s deadly arsenal, which continues to be un- ravelled. Then, in perhaps the most crea- tive turn to the war, the administra- tion pulled the Middle East peace process out of a region still in tur- moil and vulnerable to pressure by the lone superpower. Whether it pushed hard enough to produce lasting momentum in the peace talks remains uncertain, The positive spin is not unani- mous. Political scientist James Da- vid Barber is among voices increas- ingly questioning the legacy of the Gulf war, considering that Saddam remains in power, thousands of Ira- qi civilians have perished and Kuwait has resumed autocratic ways. Barber also contends the war did not showcase leadership but exem- plified a Bush tendency to ignore democratic processes and disregard the wishes of the people and Con- gress. “A real question that will be looked at historically is how is it possible he was nominated to be president again,” said Barber, a professor at Duke University who studies democracy and leadership. Even analysts who deem the Gulf war a success say Bush failed to put to creative domestic use the broad popularity he derived from it. Hess called it Bush’s undoing. Although Bush was in charge as the Soviet empire crumbled, bring- ing down the Berlin Wall and re- leasing dozens of states into free- dom, few analysts credit him with propelling the change. Indeed, many fault Bush for moving too slowly both in izing the revo- lution and in helping new govern- ments stabilize on courses of de- mocracy and free enterprise. Analysts said a less-experienced president easily could have bollixed this world transition that Bush and his strong cabinet team largely guided with tactical finesse. What they did not do, however, is supply an adequate vision for the new world order they proudly declared, without defining. One crucial correct move cited by experts is Bush’s unilateral decision in September 1991 to remove nu- clear warheads from the U.S. fleet and draw back tactical nuclear weapons from Europe. Russia quickly pulled in its nucle- ar network and the ripple ultimate- ly spread to four former Soviet re- publics that agreed to give up their tactical nuclear weapons. “That's a very large contribution to security and stability, an achieve- ment no one could have expected,” said Alton Frye, Washington direc- tor of the Council on Foreign Rela- tions. Bush did not succeed in pushing further, however. Domestic politics on both sides stymied final action on expanding the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to include the other republics, and on a tentative agreement last summer with Rus- sian President Boris Yeltsin for deeper cuts. One reason the Bush administra- tion was unable to offer a stronger hand to wobbly governments emerging from communist rule is lack of money. The Bush legacy The budget deficit, which Bush inherited at $153.5 billion and let grow to $290.2 billion, affects do- mestic and foreign affairs. “That is part of the (Bush) legacy already here, and it’s going to be worse and worse and worse,” said Terry Deibel, professor of national strategy at the National War Col- lege. ““That legacy appears all across the American standard of living.” Money and philosophy have lim- ited Bush’s forays into domestic is- sues, but he did help reach compro- mise on several bills that will have lasting effect — legislation outlaw- ing discrimination against the disa- bled, strengthening penalties for race and sex discrimination, and re- writing clean air laws. More important, Bush built upon the Reagan policy of judicial ap- pointments, leaving a heavy im- print on the system of justice by se- lecting judges who are conservative and young, meaning they can have a long tenure. The result is a judiciary “more interested in sceing the law as a de- fence of the status quo,” said Louis Michael Seidman, law professor at Georgetown Law Centre, than in extending protection to the rights of the poor, women and minorities, Montreal Gazette - November 4, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": " TRANSITION TEAM Christopher has worked for Carter, LB] When Democratic presidents want someone to trouble-shoot a crisis without grabbing credit, they often turn to Warren Miner Christopher. He had just moved to Washington as deputy attorney general in 1967 when Detroit flared into - one of the country’s worst riots. Lyndon B. John- son put him on an airplane, along with future Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, as presidential representatives in Detroit. Their job was to make sure the 4,700 federal paratroopers controlled the looting without needlessly breaking heads. That fall, when tens of thousands of protest- ers surged into Washington for the biggest anti- Vietnam War protest, Mr. Johnson put Mr. Christopher in charge of crowd control. In the midst of the 1980 Iranian hostage crisis, Jimmy Carter called on Mr. Christopher to negotiate with Iranian intermediaries to win the release of the 52 American hostages. Mr. Christopher, 67, who was born in North Dakota, graduated magna cum laude from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1945, while he was serving on active duty in the Navy. He was a standout at Stanford law school and later clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William 0. Douglas. — Joseph Albright Warren Christopher Jordan ‘disliked but respected’ Washington — When several black civil rights leaders visited Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat in 1979, the only prominent black leader who spoke out against the trip was Vernon Jordan. Mr. Jordan, then head of the National Urban League, argued that the visit had endangered links between American blacks and Jews. “Certainly some people disliked me for being outspoken,” he said then. “I’m disliked, but I’m also respected.” Mr. Jordan’s gift as a coalition builder has tak- en him from an all-black Atlanta public housing project to the top of the civil rights establishment and a position with one of Washington’s top law firms. Now S/, he first gained national notice 31 years ago as the law clerk who helped integrate the Uni- versity of Georgia by bulling a path through a mob of jeering whites to help enroll young Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes. In 1972, Mr. Jordan became head of the National Urban League. He left that post in 1981, a year after he was wounded by a sniper in Fort Wayne, Ind., and joined Democrat Robert Strauss in his powerful Washington law firm. — Joseph Albright Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 7, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Advisers have varied backgrounds By Joseph Albright Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Here are some of the leading Clinton eco- nomic advisers and kibitzers, what they have done, and where they could end up. @ Roger Altman, 46, vice chair- man of Blackstone Group, an in- vestment banking firm, helped engineer the Chrysler bailout while serving as assistant treasury secre- tary under President Carter in the 70s. He might become treasury secretary. “We could stand a pretty major gasoline-tax increase, say 50 cents a gallon,” Altman said in 1987, when the economy was healthier. “Since our oil imports are rising anyway, the conservation benefits would be positive for all of us.” @ Ira Magaziner, 45, is president of SJS Inc., a public issues consult- ing firm in Providence, R.I. He could become a White House economist. “We could have gone hellbent for maximum deficit reduction, but to do so would have jeopar- dized long-term growth of the economy,” he said of the Clinton economic plan last June. “The economy needs more investment in skills, education and public in- frastructure in order to produce the high-wage jobs of the future.” @ Robert Reich, 46, of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Go- Austin American-Statesman - November 15, 1992 vernment was director of policy planning at the Federal Trade Commission under President Car- ter. He is the new assistant direc- tor for economic policy on the Clinton transition team and may head the new Economic Security Council staff. Rather than federal jobs pro- jects, he leans toward priming the pump for private businesses by getting Congress to approve emer- gency investment tax credits as well as tax credits for research and development. He is worried that the “short-term strategy” could make things worse if it causes a lot of extra red ink. WB Alice Rivlin, 61, director of economic studies at Washington’s Brookings Institution, was the first director of the Congressional Budget Office (1975-83). She could become director of the Office of Management and Budget. “The federal government cannot simultaneously play a major role in new public investment and elimi- nate the deficit without a substan- tial federal tax increase,” she wrote in Reviving the American Dream, a book Clinton read this spring. @ Robert Rubin, 54, earns a re- ported $15 million a year as co- chairman of Wall Street’s Goldman Sachs & Co. and was an economic adviser and fundraiser during the campaign. He is a po- tential Secretary of Treasury. “Our political leaders must take the lead in creating the political and public will to sacrifice con- sumption for quite some time to do what is necessary to deal with these problems,” Rubin told a Sen- ate hearing in January. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Lithuania just the first to pick old Communists as new hope? By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Lithuania’s vote to bring former Communists back to power may be a danger- ous signal of backsliding in the old Soviet republics, presenting yet another foreign policy quan- dary for the Clinton adminis- tration. Lithuania, the first of the 15 republics to declare indepen- dence, now is the first to reinstall its former Communist regime in free, fair elections influenced by widespread economic distress. Preliminary results of a sec- ond round of balloting tallied Monday showed the Democratic Labor Party of Algirdas Brazaus- kas, the country’s former Com- munist leader, gaining at least 80 of the 141 seats in Parliament. A disturbing trend, in Lithua- nia and other republics, is a pop- ular desire to return to the easier economic times that accompa- nied a controlled economy and autocratic one-party rule, ana- lysts in Washington said. *“You’re dealing with a chaot- ic situation now,’’ said Mark Lowenthal, senior specialist in U.S. foreign policy at the Con- gressional Research Service. *“People are saying things weren’t so bad, at least the trains ran on time,’’? Mr. Lowenthal said. “‘If this becomes a trend in elections, it’s a problem.’’ Mr. Brazauskas and his par- ty, which describes itself as fol- lowing the tradition of European social democracy rather than So- viet communism, has promised to slow the pace of dislocating economic change. Similar calls to put the brake on free-market reforms are pro- voking intense political battles in Russia and other republics. Part of the dilemma to be faced by President-elect Bill Clinton is how to contain a popu- lar groundswell for reversal in the new countries when the call is made through democratic processes, which the United States is trying to inspire. Problems feeding such senti- ment in the former republics might be eased with massive in- fusions of foreign cash, but nei- Associated Press A Sajudis party supporter (right) shows her anger Monday to a representative of the Democratic Labor Party, whose former Communist leaders were swept back into power. ther the U.S. budget nor Ameri-' can voters would support that. It is one of many foreign poli- cy issues the administration may confront more quickly than ex- pected as it tries to keep the American economy its first pri- ority. “The world just keeps hap- pening,’”” Mr. Lowenthal said, predicting that Mr. Clinton’s ability to stay focussed on do- mestic issues will at least ‘‘be tempered”’ by foreign events. While Lithuania almost cer- tainly will slow the pace of eco- nomic reforms, it remains un- clear how broad the changes will be in Lithuania or whether this election portends reversals across the republics. The U.S. State Department reacted cautiously Monday, call- ing the elections free and fair and declaring that Washington looks forward to ‘‘excellent’”’ re- lations with Lithuania. Spokes- man Richard Boucher added, however, that relations will de- pend on whether Lithuania keeps moving ‘in the right direction.”’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 17, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "American women in combat? Don’t count on it soon: Panel can’t decide on marching orders By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — President-elect Bill Clinton is in no rush to join the battle over whether to allow American servicewomen in combat, one of his senior transition aides said Monday. . “In due course, obviously this is an is- sue that will be reviewed,” said Sandy Berger, chief national security adviser of the Clinton transition staff in Little Rock, Ark. “‘A range of views will be solicited and looked at.” As a starting point, Mr. Berger said, the Clinton administration plans to sift through a new 300-page report by a Bush adminis- tration commission that ended up split into hostile camps. One view, backed 8-7 by the commis- sion, held that introducing women into combat air squadrons would “inevitably’”’ subject women fliers to mistreatment as prisoners of war and “disrupt the cohesion of their units, resulting in a lower-quality force.” “‘Many experts and former POWs testi- fied that the presence of women might cause additional morale problems for male prisoners,” said the final commission re- port, sent to President Bush late Sunday. Though it has not been distributed, a copy' was obtained Monday by The Atlanta Jour- nal-Constitution. The commission majority also cited the panel’s survey, which found that 69 per- cent of current American milita pilots Seven members of the panel accused the majority of basing its judgment on “patronizing and antiquated views of women rather than their proven abilities and combat potential.”’ “believed women should not be integrated into air combat units.”’ But a vehement dissent, signed by com- mission Chairman Robert Herres and six other members, called for ‘‘gender-neutral standards” for assigning aviators. The seven-member minority accused the majority of basing its judgment on “‘pa- tronizing and antiquated views of women rather than their proven abilities and com- bat potential.” The minority wrote: ‘““While we recog- nize the horrors that POWs are forced to suffer, we do not believe that women who are willing to accept those risks should be restricted . . . because of the protective ten- dency of others. ... It is time that the American public recognize that women are capable of accepting the risks associated with the opportunity to serve their country.” In a contrasting vote, the commission- ers recommended 8-7 that women be per- mitted to serve on combat ships except submarines and amphibious landing ves- sels. One decisive factor: Shipboard wom- en were seen as far less likely than women aviators to be taken prisoner. But a five-member conservative bloc objected to any combat role for women. “When the whole national security is at stake,’’ they wrote, “‘the need to maintain a strong military must take precedence over concerns about equal opportunity.” The commission reached a 10-5 con- sensus that women should continue to be excluded from all positions in the infantry and other ‘‘direct land combat units.” “The evidence before the commission clearly shows distinct physiological differ- ences between men and women,”’ the final report said. “Most women are shorter in stature, have less muscle mass and weigh less then men. These physical differences place women at a distinct disadvantage when performing tasks... . such as hand-to- hand fighting, digging, carrying heavy loads, lifting and other tasks central t ground combat.” ‘ The Bush commission was created in 1991 by Congress after Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) persuaded the House to drop the four-decades-old ban on women combat aviators. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 17, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Few passport files have juicy data By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The tens of thousands of passport files kept at a records center out- side Washington routinely contain only letters and docu- ments involving passport ap- plications. In the spicier cases, a file will hold documentation on why an American should be or has been denied a passport. Certain criminal acts, includ- ing passport fraud, may make a person ineligible. A suspect charged with a crime and fleeing prosecution might get a red-flagged file — a warning not to issue a pass- port for fear that the person might leave the country. The State Department offi- cials who searched President- elect Bill Clinton’s files appar- ently were hunting for evi- dence that he had inquired Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 19, 1992 about renouncing his U.S. citi- zenship in connection with ef- forts to avoid the draft. They found nothing. Anyone who does renounce citizenship, or even writes a letter about it, probably would have the evidence inserted in his government file. The files include passport applications; documentation that an applicant submits to establish his citizenship and identity, such as a birth certif- icate; and forms that must be completed if a passport is lost or stolen. The Passport Office once kept records provided by the FBI, CIA and other intelli- gence agencies on dissidents and protesters, on the chance that such people might have committed some subversive action making them ineligible for a passport. Officials said Wednesday that those files no _ longer exist. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Defense issues surface By Joseph Albright c.1992 Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Defense issues awoke from their campaign slumber Tuesday and made a mighty lunge for the attention of President-elect Bill Clinton. One of the nation’s most respected liberal defense scholars released a study contending that the taxpayers could save $120 bil- lion from the defense budget over the next five years without running Retired Massachusetts Institute otf Technology professor William Kaufmann said Clinton should mothball six of the Navy’s 13 air- eraft carriers and deactivate all land-based nuclear missiles and bombers. He said the nation could meet all reasonable threats with 1.1 mil- lion troops, compared to 1.4 million in Clinton’s long-range defense lan and 1.6 million in the ‘‘base orce’’ projected by the Bush administration. Kaufmann, a longtime number- cruncher for Democratic members of Congress seeking ways of cut- ting the Reagan-Bush defense bud- get, also called for stretching out the F’-22 fighter project and cutting funds for the ‘‘Star Wars”’ antimis- — shield by at least a 50 percent cut. Six blocks away from Kaufmann’s news conference, the homosexua! advocacy group Queer Nation staged a press conference outside Clinton’s transition office to demand that Clinton quickly implement one of his clearest defense pledges — to drop the mil- itary’s ban on homosexuals. Gay activists including former Navy Lt. J. B. Collier, 28, of Bir- mingham, Ala. decried the call by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., for further study of the ban.

It gives Israelis full control of affairs in Jewish settlements in the territories, while letting Palestinians only partially adminis» ter affairs where they live, she said, Pales- tinians want full Israeli withdrawal from the territories and control over all areas, The Israeli plan, Ashrawi said, pro- duces a model which is unworkable, “and Which does not address the real issues of conflict, but rather prepares for further friction and conflict.” Israeli spokesman Yossi Gal said the Palestinians are refusing compromise and undermining the peace process with in- flammatory statements, “Demands of all or nothing will lead us to nothing for all,” he said, Doubts over exactly what approach President Clinton will take to the peace process next year are blamed in part with stalling progress. Arab negotiators across the board say Israel has been less forth- coming since the presidential election here, suggesting Israelis expect the Demo- cratic administration to favor their argu- ments, (n the other side, Israelis have accused the Arabs of a slowdown to see what change might come from a new White House, So far, only the Israelis have agreed to resume the eighth round of talks on Dee, 7.

It has been a year of hard choices for this 46-year-old woman, who burst into promi- nence at the October 1991 Ma- drid peace conference and quick- ly gained a reputation for being eloquent and unflappable. Long committed to the Pales- tinian struggle for political rights and freedom from Israeli occupa- tion, Ashrawi also is a commit- ted educator, wife and mother. Balancing all this, however, has become a matter of promise, not performance. It is complicat- ed by disappointment that the re- turn on her investment — prog- ress in the peace talks — has been so meagre. Since the Madrid conference, she has spent no more than three months at home in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, managing not to miss what she calls “sacrosanct occa- sions” in her family. Those are Christmas and Easter, “because I'm the Easter bunny,” and the birthdays and piano ‘recitals of her two daughters, Zeina, 11, and Amal, 15, whose name means “hope.” So far her daughters and hus- band Emile, a photographer and artist, back her involvement in the peace process, even though it makes her traipse round the world for the talks and spinoff meetings, “While intellectually and ra- tionally they understand it, they say emotionally, ‘We need you. We're still children and we need our mother,” Ashrawi said in a recent interview. It is exactly because Ashrawi juggles. such diverse interests that she is important to the Pal- estinian cause, This confident lady with good wool suits, silk shirts and ele- gant fluency in English draws more sympathy in the West than do masked youths hurling stones. She is a refreshing change from traditional Palestinian leaders who built careers on terrorism and radical demands, Her father Daoud Mikhail, a prominent Ramallah doctor, helped found the Palestine Liber ation Organization. But Ashrawi was reared to be a Renaissance woman, not a single-minded polit ical militant. Ashrawi Scholar and spokeswoman Educated in Ramallah at a Quaker school, she left home to study literature at American Uni- versity at Beirut, where a politi- cal boot camp supplemented aca- demics for young Palestinians, Ashrawi was stranded when the 1967 war brought first Israeli occupation to the West Bank, then restrictions forbidding most Palestinians from returning there. So she wound up in 1970 at the University of Virginia in graduate school, She finally went home under relaxed rules in 1973. Ultimately she married there, bore chil- dren, and became a professor and dean at Birzeit University, a Palestinian-run school on the West Bank. At home Ashrawi tended to- ward community activism rather than hard-core political organiz- ing. She would not be found at PLO strategy sessions, but run- ning clandestine classes when Is- rael closed down her university during the hottest months of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against occupation. And she worked to better conditions for thousands of Palestinian prison ers arrested without charge or trial. That is partly why she has lim- ited influence in shaping Pales tinian positions in peace negotia tions, according to both Arabs and Americans involved in the process. Ashrawi also is not a negotia tor. Israel refuses to conduct talks with Palestinians holding a Jerusalem identity card, since it claims Jerusalem as its capital with a status that is not nego- tiable. Ashrawi has a Jerusalem ID because her husband is a Jerusalemite. \f"
