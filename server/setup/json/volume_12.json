        "ocr_text": "Berrl Demands Pullback Of U.S. Ships off Lebanon By Marcia Kunstel (9 x Wewsday Special Corresponden de i rri Beirut — Shiite leader Nabih yesterday added a new condition for the release of 40 hijacked Americans — that the U.S. Navy call back the task force cruising off the Lebanese coast with 1,800 marines. The demand was rejected out of hand by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. At the same time, Berri’s second-in- command, Akef Haidar, was hinting new flexibility. Haidar said several times in a press conference that Amal would consider a U.S.-guaranteed “plan” for the release of more than 700 Lebanese held by Israel. Previously, the demand has been for their release, not for a promise or a guarantee of their freedom. “Any proposal coming from the United States, we are ready to dis- cuss,” Haidar said. The Reagan administration has said it will not bargain over the terrorists’ demands. And Berri, speaking with Lebanese journalists, said he had re- ceived a telephone call yesterday from U.S. Ambassador Reginald Bartholo- mew, reiterating that the administra- tion will not pressure Israel to give up the Lebanese prisoners. Israel did release 31 of the 766 pris- oners in question, but Amal leaders said that was insufficient to bring freedom for a single American. (Buying Time for Hostages, Part IiLl/s3.) “israeli army trucks carried the 31 men across the border into Lebanon, where they were turned over to the In- ternational Red Cross. When they reached the Lebanese port of Tyre, they debarked from buses, fell to their knees on the beach and gave thanks to Allah for their freedom. Haidar called release of the 31 “a tiny thing which does not deserve any specific attention on our side.” “The liberation of the 31, since it is not part of an overall plan for the lib- eration of all of them, is not going to be productive,” he said. Amal entered the crisis when the extremist Shiite Moslems who hi- jacked the TWA Athens-to-Rome flight and killed an American sailor asked Berri to mediate. Amal, a some- what more moderate Shiite group, has supported the hijackers’ demand for the release of the prisoners at Atlit, most of them Shiites. Haidar’s comments yesterday were the first sign that Amal would accept — or try to persuade the hijackers to accept — something less than a simul- taneous transfer of the American hos- tages for the Lebanese prisoners. “It is necessary for us to have a plan which is very clear and very certain and very precise,” Haidar said, “which will permit us and others to be very sure that the liberation will be com- plete.” He also said another demand has been dropped, for release of two Le- banese Shiites being tried in Spain for trying to kill a Libyan diplomat. A de- mand for release of Shiites held in Ku- wait for embassy bombings there was dropped earlier. Berri, in issuing the new demand for withdrawal of U.S. ships, said it was not a condition set by the hijackers, but by Amal. The vessels, led by the aircraft carri- er Nimitz, have been steaming at least 25 miles off the coast, well out of Le- banon’s territorial waters, since short- ly after the Boeing 727 landed here for Newsday - June 25, 1985 \fBerri Demands Pullback Of U.S. Ships off Lebanon the third time in its hijack odyssey. In Washington, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger termed the hostage-taking “the beginning of a war” and dis- missed the demand, saying “the U.S. fleet is in international waters, it’s not in Lebanese waters,” He said the maneuvers of the task force ‘should be treated as military movements in wartime, That's what we've been say- ing.” Weinberger added that U.S. intelligence knows “pretty well who the terrorists are,” But he appeared to rule out any immediate military action, Haidar said he does not expect the United States to mount a military action to try to free the hostages, whom Amal has dis- persed, keeping only the three-man crew aboard the jet. As for the release of the 31 Lebanese, Haidar said a promise by Israel to free some or all of the rest would not be sufficient to get freedom for the Americans, | “We do not believe a single word that comes from Israel,” Haidar said. “If the Americans say that, we would consider it, We don’t want any dialogue with Israel, direct or indirect.” The United States reportedly has made contacts with Syria about helping secure release of the hostages. Haidar said any proposal from Syria, from the United States or from the Interna- tional Red Cross would get Amal’s serious consideration, Haidar said that the 31 hostages held by Amal “are having fun” eating the best Lebanese cuisine, swimming at the beach, and watching cowboy movies and films of Lebanese villages hombarded by a U.S, warship, an official said yesterday. Six other hostages are in the custody of the original bi- jackers, believed to be members of Hezbollah, a pro-lranian group of Moslem extremists, The three-man crew is under the control of Amal and the hijackers at Beirut airport, Haidar said, Yesterday morning, one of the hijackers asked the control tower for a doctor because a crew member, later identified as the pilot, Capt. John L. Testrake, 57, was suffering from a severe stomachache, Dr, Alfred Zbouni, the airport physician, went out to the jetliner under a threat from the hijackers “to keep his mouth shut. He should not talk to the press, Otherwise, we'll cut his tongue out,” The doctor came off the plane and said nothing, [Eight grim hostages from TWA Flight 847, seen on a video- tape received by U.S, television networks yesterday, said they were well and hoped to be released soon (‘Tm looking forward to being home with my family as soon as possible,” hostage Robert Peel Jr., 33, of Hutchinson, Kan, (\"T feel OK. 1 feel fine,” said Steve Willett, 36, of Choupie, La. \"T hope to see my family and friends soon.” (On the poor-quality videotape, the hostages answered ques- tions from one of their captors, who asked each if he was being treated well.

        "ocr_text": "Offers Hostage Transte Shiites Free One American By Marcia Kunstel Se \\o Newsday Special Correspondent Beirut — Extremist Moslem hijackers re- leased an ailing American hostage yesterday and offered to turn over the other 39 for con- finement in Damascus or in a western embas- sy here, in a dramatic turn of events believed prompted by Syrian intervention. Washington continued to publicly insist on the immediate release of all the hostages. Nabih Berri, the Amal leader mediating for the hijackers, said they did not withdraw the demand that Israel release 735 prisoners in exchange for the Americans held since the June 14 hijacking of a TWA jet. But they said they would relinquish control over the hostages if a western embassy here or if the Syrian government promises to keep them confined until Israel releases its detain- ees, including more than 500 Shiites and more than 100 Palestinians. Both the Swiss and French governments ex- pressed willingness to meet those conditions. (However, Reuter reported that French Ex- ternal Relations Minister Roland Dumas warned today on French radio that France would not act as “substitute jatlers” if the TWA hostages were handed over to the French Embassy in Beirut pending negotiations on their release. Dumas warned that their “liber- ation must be unconditional. ] The hijackers freed Jimmy Dell Palmer, 48, of Little Rock, Ark., yesterday following a medical examination by a doctor from the In- ternational Committee of the Red Cross, who, according to Berri, warned that continued con- finement would endanger his heart condition. Berri also said he was “studying” the condition of hostage Simon Grossmayer and pledged, “If he’s not in good condition I'll release him today or tomorrow.” ‘ The State Department said that neither Palmer’s release nor the offer to transfer the remaining hostages would soften its demand that all be freed immediately. [In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel will continue to free hun- dreds of Lebanese prisoners, The Associated Press reported. Rabin, speaking in parlia- ment, said Israel has declared since April 2, when the Lebanese were brought across the border, that it will release them in accordance with the security situation in south Lebanon. (Israel released 31 Lebanese prisoners Mon- day, but sources cautioned a new release could be delayed, suggesting that Israel may not want to be perceived as making a payment for the hijackers’ release of Palmer. When Israel freed 31 prisoners, it insisted the release was not linked to the American hostages.) “The kidnapers accept with me that we are ready to put all the hostages inside an embassy in Beirut west,” said Berri, leader of the main- stream Shiite Moslem group Amal. He has con- demned the hijacking, by the more radical Shiite group Hezbollah (Party of God), but sup- ports the extremists’ demand. Berri and Amal have guaranteed the Ameri- cans’ safety. Distancing them from the guns of the edgy hijackers, who killed one hostage and often fire in the direction of news photogra- phers, would make the hostages significantly more secure. It surely would improve conditions for the three TWA crew members who have been held in the confined quarters of the hijacked Being 727 at the Beirut airport. The passengers have been distributed among several locations around the city, according to Berri. The jet’s co-pilot, Philip Maresca, 42, was taken off the plane yesterday for examination at American University Hospital, suffering from a week-old insect bite that had become Newsday - June 27, 1985 \fOLTfers Flostage Transtre infected. Officials said his shoulder and elbow were inflamed, but that he later reported to the tower, “Tm OK now.” , The new proposal seemed a maneuver for Berri to bow out of the situation. His unofficial successor as mediator is likely to be Syrian President Hafez Assad, who already is be- lieved to have been instrumental in bringing this shift in the hijackers’ attitude. Although Assad long has been at odds with US. administrations, he did recently attempt to find and secure release of seven Americans kidnaped in Bei- rut in the last 16 months. They are believed to have been taken by extremist Islamic groups with links to the hijackers. On Sunday and Monday, Assad held talks in Da- mascus with the speaker of the Iranian Majlis, or parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani, who later publicly condemned terrorism and said his government would have worked to stop the TWA hijacking, had it been aware of the plot in advance. According to the Beirut newsletter Middle East Reporter, Rafsanjani also met in Damascus with Sheikh Mohammad Hussein FadlaHah, a fundamen- talist Lebanese Shiite widely believed to be the lead- er of Hezbollah, two of whose members comman- deered the TWA jet on an Athens-to-Rome flight. fsanjani’s condemnation of terrorism made it possible, if not compelling, for the extremist hi- jackers to back down. The fanatical groups idealize the Iranian state. . In his effort to retrieve the seven kidnaped Americans, Assad was quoted as drawing a distinc- tion between “humanitarian matters and politics.” (Quoting Syrian sources, diplomats in Damascus reported that Berri has been in the capital incognito once — and perhaps twice — in the past few days to confer with Syrian officials and presumably ham- mer out the offer he unveiled in Beirut, The Wash- ington Post reported. The report of trips by Berri was corroborated by U.S. officials in Washington. (The official Syrian news agency announced that President Assad will leave for a recently delayed official visit to Czechoslovakia “within the next fev days.” Diplomats and analysts reasoned that Assad, said to be following the hostage crisis with his legend- ary attention to detail, would not risk failure by set- ting off for Prague unless a solution has been found.] At his news conference, Berri said he had not talked with Assad about the proposed transferral of the hostages. But he said he understands the White House has been in touch with Damascus. “I think there are many letters now between President Reagan and President Assad,” Berri said. He also placed some conditions on Washington. “The first thing I ask is that the American ships be far away from the Lebanese coast,” Berri said, referring to the Sixth Fleet warships that have gath- ered in the eastern Mediterranean, well out of Le- banese territorial waters. . Berri also asked for a U.S. pledge that once the hostages are freed, there will be “no attack, no ag- ssion against Lebanese territory from them or m the Israelis.” Berri said yesterday's developments were a re- sponse to the briefing Tuesday in which a White House spokesman said the administration is consid- ering steps to shut down the Beirut airport or to blockade Lebanon. First he sent Red Cross represen- tatives to meet with the hostages and examine any who were ill, Berri said. That resulted in Palmer’s release. Then he devised the hostage transfer plan. As for an ultimate resolution, Berri said that will not be possible until the United States cooperates. ntil now I don’t hear from the United States {more] than the word no,” he said. He also criticized American comments regarding the possible use of force against Lebanon. “After what I heard yesterday from the United States, Iam more able to understand why the kidnap- ers did the attack,” he said. “I am still again this protest, but I understand now more. . . They think exactly like the United States government thinks” Newsday - June 27, 1985 (Continued) \f"

Conwell, 39, of Houston, also urged at the end of an interview Friday afternoon, “Get Texas stirred up. We need their help to get out of here.” . Conwell said in the interview that he had just heard that no coun- try appeared willing to accept what he called Amal leader Nabih Berri’s “very attractive offer ... to get the 39 hostages remaining here into the safety of a Western nation.” Berri said Wednesday that the hijackers would let a Western gov- ernment hold the Americans in its Beirut embassy, if it promised to keep them until the Israelis free 735 Lebanese prisoners. “I can tell you I would be dis- tressed to hear that there isn’t a country willing to stand up and as- sist in this period of crisis,” said Conwell, who has become the hos- tages’ spokesman. “I would not only be disappointed, but I'd be shocked.” Berri leads Lebanon’s main- stream Shiite Moslem group Amal, and he is acting as mediator on be- half of extremist Shiite gunmen who hijacked TWA flight 847 on June 14.

One woman photographer, a Briton, said a male hostage walked up to her, felt her arm and said: “Let me touch you. I can’t believe you're real.” The dinner was held poolside and broke up around 3 a:m.

There was uncertainty, too, over whether mediator Nabih Berri could secure the release of four hostages held by more radical Shiite elements: The Amal chief linked the captives’ freedom to receipt of strong new guar- antees that the United States will not retaliate against Lebanon for the hi- jacking and holding of hostages. “Guarantees must be given to Syr- ia,” Berri said yesterday afternoon. “If they are given tonight, they will be re- leased tonight. “If not, we are not in a hurry. To- morrow, the day after, who knows?” But by 9:30 last night (3:30 p.m. EDT), Amal told journalists gathered around the school where the hostages had been taken that there would be no immediate release. Journalists were told to leave, and the hostages were reported by area residents to have been taken away soon afterward. They are believed to have been dispersed again to separate quarters around the capital. [Last night, NBC News reported the four missing hostages were either en route to or had joined the larger group, and that all 39 hijack hostages would travel by land to Damascus this morn- ing, The Associated Press reported. [The State Department just called us just this minute,” NBC quoted Marianne Roberston of Newbury Park, Calif., daughter of hostage Thomas Murray, as saying earlier in the day. “I spoke with them. They have located the four people that have been missing from the large group and they are either in transit to the large group, or with the large group.” [Late last night in Washington, the State Department issued a one-sen- tence statement that said: “The United States reaffirms its long-standing sup- port for the preservation of Lebanon, its government, its stability and its se- curity and for the mitigation of the suf- fering of its people.” or NN Beirut RAT Mediterranean aeartaasl Bour| @ el-Barajneh International Airport @ Bourj el-Barajneh.

Most of the hostages were gathered about 9 a.m. at a school in the south- western section of Beirut that is con- trolled by Amal militiamen. The network crews and the few re- porters allowed to mingle with the American men, now in their 16th day of captivity, said at least four were missing. They are Robert Brown, 42, of Stow, Mass.; Richard Herzberg, 33, of Norfolk, Va.; Jeffrey Ingalls, 24, of Virginia, and Robert Trautmann, 37, of Laredo, Texas. These men apparent- ly constitute the small group segregat- ed from the others because of assumed military connections. They were believed under control of the Hezbollah (Party of God), an ex- treme fundamentalist Shiite group with which the original hijackers are affiliated. Berri and Amal, generally more moderate than Hezbollah, agreed to mediate on behalf of the hi- jackers and have taken responsibility for the hostages’ safety. Members of Hezbollah, followers of Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomein- i,are less willing to deal with western- ers than is Amal. Hezbollah may wish to keep control of at least a few hostages until it knows Israel has freed 735 mostly Shiite prisoners it holds at the Atlit prison near Haifa. That swap has been the hijackers’ key demand. {In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Shi- mon Peres said freeing the Americans would remove “obstacles” to Israel’s re- lease of more than 700 Arab prisoners as demanded by the hijackers and their allies, the Washington Post reported. [Speaking to reporters before the planned release broke down, Peres said Israel was not involved in “any deal” in connection with the crisis. But he and other Israeli officials strongly indicated that the release of most if not all of the detainees at Atlit Prison could be expected to follow the freeing of the American hostages. [This was apparently a central fea- ture of what Israeli radio described as an “understanding” between the Unit- ed States and Israel on how to bring an » end to the hijacking drama.] AP Photo Hostage William Darras of Illinois, above, is handed food by an Amai militiaman as he sits on his luggage in a Beirut schoolyard, waiting to be freed. Even Friday night, amid talk of the hostages’ being sent to Damascus the next day, one Amal lieutenant raised questions about Berri’s ability to get control of them all. “Mr. Berri has a promise from the hijackers they will be released, but we don’t know for sure,” said Akel Ha- mieh. _ [Yesterday, Hamieh told Reuters at the schoolyard: “We are having talks with the hijackers who are holding the other four hostages.” Asked why the hijackers were refusing to hand over the four men, he said: “They have many brothers among the 735 prison- ers held by Israel and they want them freed now.” Berri also does not control the seven Americans kidnaped separately in Beirut as long ago as March, 1984. Their freedom has also been demand- ed by the U.S. Amal and Hezbollah maintain rath- er hostile relations most of the time, as they compete for the allegiance of West Beirut’s Shiite community. The official media in Syria an- nounced in the early morning yester- day that the hostages were expected to arrive in Damascus about 1 p.m., or 7 a.m. EDT. That prospect lingered throughout a long day and evening Saturday, before Berri dashed it. Some media and the U.S. government even announced that the group had embarked on the three- to four-hour drive from Beirut to Da- mascus, under a plan in which Syria was expected to keep the hostages until Israel released its 735 prisoners. Rather than depart Beirut, the hos- tages were penned in the schoolyard all day, sitting or leaning against the high wall surrounding them, playing cards and essentially just waiting. (TWA pilot John L. Testrake, 57, of Richmond, Mo., told The Associated Press of a “wild ride” the night before that included a television interview and a bath at 3 a.m. [We'd been asking for permission to go and take a bath at the airport fire- house, but for one reason or another they hadn’t allowed us to,” Testrake said. “By last night it had been five days and we were getting a little ripe.” [Testrake, co-pilot Philip G. Maresca, 42, and flight engineer Ben- jamin C. Zimmermann, 45, have been held on the plane since it landed in Beirut-for the last time June 16. (Their captors agreed, “put us in an automobile and took us on this tour,” the pilot recalled. “They didn’t tell us what was going on. It turned out it was an interview for Algerian TV in some apartment in the city. But we drove all over the city. They had us thoroughly lost. (“We didn’t know (whether) they were going to get us out and stand us against the wall and shoot us. After the interview they took us somewhere else and said take your shower. At 3 o’clock in the morning.”] Also at the Bourj el-Barajaneh sec- ondary school were a pick-up truck full of baggage and 11 Red Cross vehi- cles apparently intended to transport the hostages.

        "ocr_text": "Farewell to Beirut: ‘Let’s get out By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to The Herald BEIRUT — The 39 American hostages were reunited in a school yard Sunday, ushered into a caravan of 12 white Peugeots waving Red Cross flags, and escorted out of Beirut by a tank and 15 cars brimming with brash young gunmen. “Let's get out of here!” yelled Jim Hoskins, 22, of Indianapolis. Waiting in a confused limbo for Nearly two days, the hostages wore relieved faces as they waved 00dbye to Lebanese from the neighborhood and to the gunmen who moments before had been their captors. Some of the militia- Men grinned and waved their AK-47s in response. “The ICRE [International Com- mittee of the Red Cross] confirms that all 39 are leaving at this moment,” said a Red Cross spokesman as the cars snaked out of the grimy alleyway in a poor Shiite Moslem section of Beirut at 5:40 p.m. Beirut time. The group had been expected to depart Saturday. But an extremist Shiite group holding four of the hostages separately from the oth- ers apparently blocked the exit. The fundamentalist group Hez- bollah wanted stronger assurances that Israel would free 735 mostly Shiite prisoners it has jailed with- out charge, and that the United States wouldn't retaliate against Lebanon for the hijacking that resulted in one death and the confinement of the hostages for 17 days. The departure Sunday was espe- cially sweet for Jeffrey Ingalls, 24, a U.S. Navy diver from Virginia, who had been among the four Hezbollah captives. “It was a downer when they said the 32 were en route,” said Ingalls, referring to erroneous reports Saturday that 32 of the hostages already had left for Syria. “We were listening to the news all day long and they were making all these arrangements. When they said the 32 had departed for Syria, it was kind of a drag.” But Ingalls was among the men mingling in a dusty, walled school playground Sunday, waiting through the final moments of last-minute arrivals and roll calls — and gifts of roses and gold-em- bossed copies of the Koran, the Moslem holy book. “We wouldn't have gone with- out them,” said Arthur Toga, 33, of St. Louis. A more moderate Shiite group, Amal, had taken over guarding all the other hostages, sort of hijack- ing them out from under the two Hezbollah terrorists who original- ly hijacked TWA Flight 847 on June 14, At a brief goodbye ceremony, Sunday, Ali Husseini spoke on behalf of Amal: “We are very sorry you suffered,” he said. “We want to thank you and say we are sorry and especially sorry for the friend we have lost before Amal entered.” Husseini referred to the killing of U.S. Navy petty officer Robert Dean Stethem, 24. Stethem was shot and thrown off the plane by the original hijackers. Several other military men on board the plane had been the subject of special concern, given the treatment of Stethem. Stuart Dahl, 31, one of the Navy divers from Virginia, said the scariest time for the service men came when the hijackers decided to stay in Beirut and removed the military men from the plane. “We thought we were going to be shot,” Dahl said. “But they loaded us onto a truck and hauled us away.” They lived under the same conditions as the other hostages, who complained not of harass- ment or punishment, but mostly about the boredom of confinement and anxiety of not knowing what was happening. All said at had plenty of food and water, although they would have liked more than the one shower some were limited to. Despite the nice words about the Amal guards, some latent hostility and fear crept into interviews with some hostages. Ingalls, for example, was shocked to see a rifle-weilding gunman sporting an insignia pin from a Navy uniform. “It's a real slap in the face,” saiq the red-haired, red-bearded diver Dahl, seated nearby on one of the several children's desks in the yard, warned Ingalls to cool it. “That's nothing, they came in Wearing our greens one day,” saiq Dahl, referring apparently to na- val fatigues. _ “No problem, no problem, man, just smile at them and be nice.” Dahl said his group had given the militiaman the insignia, but Ingalls said others had gone ‘through the hostages’ baggage and swiped his uniform trim. The group under Hezbollah con- trol had the roughest conditions.

They were not permitted to talk to the prisoners, and had to put towels over their heads whenever they went out of the office to use the bathroom. Capt. John L. Testrake, 57, of Richmond, Mo., said his imprison- ment was “pretty dull and boring. We read when we had newspa- pers.” He said the crew members were not frightened when their captors, among them the original extremist ijackers, often fired into the air. “We knew they just wanted Something. That was their way of telling the world they wanted Something,” he said. 1 just knew my Lord would @ care of me and He did, Testrake said. He and Benjamin C. Zimmer- mann, 45, of Cascade, Idaho, another crew member, managed to keep their Bibles and periodically held devotional services. The 39 had been gathered at the school from diverse hideouts scat- tered around West Beirut. When the roll was taken the first time, nine hostages were missing. Eight walked in a few minutes later to applause, and when the final one entered he got a standing ovation. The next roll call was complete. Within minutes the hostages divided themselves into groups of four, attached themselves to a Red Cross driver and climbed into the line of cars waiting in the narrow street outside. Then they started home. Miami Herald - July 1, 1985 (Also in Dallas Morning News) \f"

The episode of the American hostages was history. Pistol shots, rapid blasts from automatic rifles and the whomp of mortars or rocket-propelled grenades resounded for nearly six hours with only brief respite. Local radio reports said 15 people were killed. The street battle closed shops and halted traffic, Newsday - July 2, 1985 (Also Timi elie (ete 1 Cs) Renew Fight leaving the city in a heavy, hot silence during the moments it paused. Journalists trying to leave Beirut after the hos- tage story ended were penned in the Commodore Ho- tel, one street over from Hamra Street, the main com- mercial thoroughfare of the western sector. From a fourth-floor window, blue-jeaned gunmen posted on street corners could be seen, backs to the wall, guns at the ready. “We live in a forest,” said one disgusted resident, who ducked in the hotel for shelter. The eruption of fighting was a bleak portent for the city; those involved were members of Amal, the mainstreem Shiite group, and of the Popular Socialist Party, the primary organization of the Druse, an off- shoot Moslem sect. The day before, the PSP of the Druse had been enlisted by Amal to help escort the 39 American hos- tages from Beirut to Damascus. Much of the territory en route is controlled by the Druse. The Amal and Druse have been uncomfortable al- lies in past fighting against the Christians of East Beirut, the Palestinians and the Sunni Moslem group, Murabitoun. They are the two biggest and best-armed factions in the west. A protracted fight could be disastrous for what is left of the capital after 10 years of warring. By midafternoon the combatants agreed to a ceasefire, and the western sector began to revive with cars and people cautiously returning to the streets. At the same time, fighting escalated between Christians and Moslems in the west and closed the Green Line, the series of check points that controls access between the two sectors. The closing means that no one can cross from one side to the other. Soldiers stop cars when the security committee decides the danger is too high to risk pas- sage. Resourceful drivers, however, can find an unoffi- cial crossing, still watched over by militia from the west at one roadblock, the central government’s Le- banese army at another, and the militia from the east at a third. If a member of each militia is slipped some money, and if the car’s occupants don’t look too questionable, the vehicle can proceed. This route is a favorite of truck drivers and Leban- ese whose work routinely takes them between busi- nesses or homes in the east and the airport in the west. The city still fights, but it still works.

An airport spokesman said the jet had a crew of four Frenchmen.] \f"

The humiliation of men who were the most powerful in Sudan is but one of many reversals in a country turned upside-down since April.

        "ocr_text": "Black nationalists also want to run S. Africa’s economy By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to The Herald LUSAKA, Zambia — The exiled African National Congress is fight- ing for the power to radically change South Africa, by national- izing its great wealth and erasing all vestiges of racial distinctions. The vision of South Africa’s most influential nationalist group, outlawed for the last 25 years, goes far beyond getting the right to vote and equal opportunities for the majority black population. The South African government steadfastly -resists the kind of changes that the ANC wants. As pressure both inside and outside the country increases, however, black radicals are becoming more optimistic that their long struggle will be rewarded. Two second-generation leaders on the ANC executive council, men in their 40s who have spent their entire adult lives in exile from their homeland, spoke in recent, separate interviews about how the ANC would remake South Africa. : “We have got to destroy and neutralize the power of the whites to control the means of production in our country,’® said Chris Hani, 43. political commissar of the ANC’s military wing. Urmkhanto we Sizwe, or “Spear of the Nation.” ‘Economic underdogs’ “If we are going to be satisfied with political power alone, it means we have got to go on being the underdogs economically,” he said. Thabo Mbeki, 42, the ANC information director, said the ANC wants to nationalize “‘monopolies’”’ such as banks and the multibil- lion-dolilar mining industry in what he called an expansion of the state sector. “We're not talking about your house, your car or your fish ’n’ chips shop. We are talking about the commanding heights of the economy.”” Mbeki said. He cited estimates that 75 percent of the private capital in South Africa is in the hands of three companies. “This is clearly an intolerable Situation, this great concentration of economic power in the hands of ‘We have got to destroy and neutralize the power of the whites to control the means of production in our country.’ Chris Hani a handful of private individuals,” he said. Mbeki spoke passionately of children who are blind or retarded or suffer stunted growth because of poor nutrition, exposure to disease and inadequate medical care. His government would provide new programs to improve housing, health, rural development and education. ““That is what one should do with this wealth to which the state would have access,’’ Mbeki said. Freedom Charter ‘ The comments of Hani and Mbeki were compatible with the Freedom Charter, the document adopted in 1955 by a coalition of anti-apartheid groups and still the framework of change for South African reformers. The ANC was outlawed five years later, and shortly afterward some underground members turned to violent tactics of sabo- taging police and military installa- tions. Today, the exiled ANC still infiltrates trained guerrillas into South Africa, but this summer it adopted a new strategy of extend- ing violence into white residential communities. Also, as mandated in the 30- year-old Freedom Charter, the ANC'’s premier political goal is one person-one vote in ai unitary system. In specifying a uni system, the ANC rejects the wanee moderates have put forth of a confederation of states or regions, which could dilute black power and maintain enclaves of white power. Hani and Mbeki clearly ruled out any minority rights for the white ruling elite, such as the gZuaranteed seats in Parliament that were reserved for whites when Rhodesia became black-gov- erned Zimbabwe. The white minority has concen- trated South African power ancw privilege in white hands, and the ANC wants them dispersed._ ay Electoral districts Mbeki even spoke of creating electoral districts, in which Gach would reflect the population makeup as much as Possible, in an effort to preclude redomi white districts. P een “What we want to do is break down these barriers. We don’t want to say, “That is an area of whe vee *’* Mbeki said. t ani and Mbeki o spoke of aid provided to the ANX by the Soviet Union and other Eastern bloc nations, but neither nee ee a ee Marxist line in escribing their litical iloso- phies. po pats Hani said the Soviet Union supplied weapons, uniforms, nas ing and food but n prescribed ideological i The ANG’.

In a manner, he added, the ANC can afford to be anti-Communist. om Basic tenets Free press, free speech ana freedom of religion are tenets ofr the Freedom Charter the ANC espouses.

Their proof: The country’s killer drought ended when he was kicked out of office in a blood: less military coup last spring. “The trees had refused to flower,” said Sadiq el-Mahdi, a one-time prime minister who was repeatedly locked up, was exiled and sentenced to death in absentia for opposing the 16-year Nimeiri regime. “The river had re- fused to flow,” he said. “The rain had stopped.” Sudan, where many people still con- sult fortunetellers and religious mys- tics, is a superstitious country, and many Sudanese lay their country’s problems at the feet of their former ruler. They are finding, however, that Ni- meiry’s ouster has not alleviated Su- dan’s chronic problems. The country is strapped by payments on a $9-billion debt, is reeling from the impact of the drought, and is torn by a civil war that pits the Arab Moslem northern popu- lation against the African, Christian and animist south. . It is almost as though Nimeiry’s passing turned ran back the clock 16 years, dropping the Sudanese into cir- cumstances remarkably similar to those that prompted the military coup that brought Nimeiry to power. Sudan's efforts to climb out ofa cha- otic past have caught the attention of East and West.

The north and south have been an- tagonistic and culturally distinct — Arab versus African — for centuries. The Arabs’ slavetrading at the ex- pense of black Africans deepened the divisions. Now southern cooperation is necessary not only to build a stable na- tional government. Continued conflict also prevents development of the vir- gin southern oilfields that could pull Sudan out of economic disaster.

        "ocr_text": "Craxi coalition is weakened as defense boss’ party quits By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to The Herald _ ROME Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini withdrew Wednesday from Italy’s fragile governing coalition to protest the release of a Palestinian the United States has accused of mastermind- ing the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro. Central to this dispute, which threatens the government of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi with immi- nent collapse, is Italy's drift away from U.S. interests and into an increasingly pro-Arab tilt. The release last weekend of Mohammed Abbas was the sharp- est sign of Italy’s recent foreign policy bent. It would be the first time since the early days of the republic, just after World War II, that a govern- ment has fallen over a foreign affairs tangie. Continuous domestic disputes, from budgets to labor issues, have agitated this five-party coalition in the 26 months it has held office. But none, till now, has rent it. Spadolini, considered NATO’s man in Italy and a staunch friend of Israel, is enraged not only over the fact of the release of Abbas, but that the Palestinian was freed without himself and other key coalition members being consult- ed. In an interview this week, Spadolini was quoted as saying his Republican Party stands in the government as a guarantee of Western views. “It is clear that if foreign politics undergoes a radical devia- tion from the Western line,” he said, Giovanni Spadolini: Outraged ~ over release of Abbas. In past months leaders of the three smallest parties have com- plained about other foreign affairs maneuvers by Craxi and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti. It is not that the government has drastically veered into an anti- American posture under the lead- ership of Craxi, Italy’s first Social- ist prime minister, and Andreotti, a Christian Democrat. But the two have taken plenty of small steps that rankled the Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats, who all have tended to be strongly pro-Western. They were publicly upset a few weeks ago, for example, when Craxi issued a stinging denuncia- tion of Israel for bombing the headquarters of the Palestine Lib- eration Organization in Tunisia. Other points of contention: Last December, Craxi and An- dreotti both paid a visit to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in Tuni- Miami Herald - October 17, 1985 Sia, lending him a degree of recognition seldom even accorded within the Arab world. In April of 1984, Andreotti endorsed a resolution sponsored by Iraq at an interparliamentary meeting in Geneva that accused ee of “‘terrorism and assassina- on.” The same year he authorized the Italian ambassador to the Soviet Union to officially represent the country at the annual military parade in Red Square. Other Western ambassadors boycotted in protest of Soviet interference in Afghanistan. Craxi and Andreotti have picked up the pace of both trade and diplomatic relations with the Sovi- et Union. Andreotti has twice visited the international maverick Col. Moammar Khadafy in Libya. The Arabist outlook was high- lighted by the entire Achille Lauro episode, in which Andreotti’s very first move was to ask the PLO for help in stopping the hijacking, and the latest was setting free Abbas and a Palestinian cohort. The clear tilt prompted Italy’s two major news weekly maga- zines to focus on the issue. ran close-up cover | Andreotti wearing suit and tie and versy riling the Italian govern- ment is entwined with the ques- tion: “‘Step by step, have we reall been running the risk of detaching ourselves from the West and o redirecting, almost inadvertently toward a type of politics vaguel Middle Eastern, toward Third World adventurism?”’ \f"

        "ocr_text": "PLO maintains uneasy haven in Tunisian capita By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News TUNIS, Tunisia — Seldom does Yasser Arafat or any major figure in the Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion sleep two nights running in the same bed. Even here in their political headquarters, with protection by the Tunisian police and an elite guerrilla security squad, PLO lead- ers know they are not safe. They came to Tunis under duress and continue to live with the threat of death, 1,500 miles away from the soil they consider their homeland. PLO offices and houses are scat- tered around the city and in seaside suburbs, apparently to minimize the impact on the organization of an attack in any one place. The dispersal has worked. When the Israelis bombed a PLO com- pound outside Tunis on Oct. 1, they apparently did not take out any ma- jor figures. They did kill more than 70 peo- ple, some of them Tunisian, some Palestinian refugee families. \\ Arafat was reported to have been at the compound shortly before the air raid, but escaped injury because he was out on the beach for a jog. What the Israelis did obliterate at Hammam Lif, a coastal town 18 miles outside Tunis, were not even centers of the PLO per se, but of the Al Fatah faction that Arafat leads. The Tunisian government was incensed that its sovereignty had been violated and its citizens slain. It easily won a United Nations Se- curity Council condemnation of the attack. are = ‘The ramifications could have been far more severe had the Is- raelis assaulted not Al Fatah, but one of the PLO offices in the heart of urban residential areas in the capital of Tunis, where iniddle-class: Tunisian families skirt police barri- cades to reach their homes and face the inquiring lo of armed Tuni- sian guards every time they walk outside. 7: dy os Tunisia itself is not a radical state, but a pro-Western Arab coun- try that was one of the early nations to gain independence in north Af- Tunisia had been detached from the persistent Middle East conflicts, but took the risk of letting in the PLO in 1982 in connection with a cease-fire agreement the United States negotiated in Lebanon. Beirut had been the center of the Palestinian Movement until the Israelis invaded in June 1982, in a Grive to crush the PLO or at least to Push it away from Israel's borders. Philip Habib, the US. special en- voy to the Middle East, got the fight- ing stopped when he persuaded Arafat to leave Beirut and take the PLO apparatus with him. Habib, in return, secured an Israeli pledge not to attack the Palestinian refu- gee families left in Beirut when the commando units departed. Shortly afterward, the Christian Lebanese militia carried out the massacres at the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps, a tragedy widely be- lieved possible because the Israelis did not stop their Lebanese Chris- tian allies. The Christian Lebanese were paying back the Palestinians for be- coming involved in Lebanon’s civil war on the side of the Moslems. The removal from Beirut began a series of bad times and divisions from which the PLO never has re- covered. Lebanon was the closest thing to a home that the Palestinians had had since Israel became a state in- 1948 and the first rush of refugees fled. Thousands had settled in Leba- non, and that is where the PLO flourished after it was expelled from Jordan in 1970. It was the headquarters, where the newspaper was published, the banking was se- cret, the ports open to guns and ref- ugees. The Palestinians had politi- cal and personal freedom. Some Palestinians blamed Arafat for losing the Beirut base; for mak- ing the deal with Habib, for a poor military showing against the Israeli troops, for weakening the PLO with corrupt lieutenants. , After Lebanon, Arafat brought the PLO bureaucracy and part of his Al Fatah guerrillas to Tunis, while other Palestinians were scattered among other Arab nations in re- mote training camps or cities. Some of the more _ radical branches settled in Syria and por- tions of Lebanon the Syrians con- trol, and in 1983 launched a cam- paign of battles against pro-Arafat forces still in the area. The aim was to end Arafat’s leadership. The split remains, but Arafat still holds the title of PLO chairman and controls the PLO apparatus in Tunis. The PLO news agency, WAFA, is in Tunis, as are the political depart- ment and publicity branch and communications center. But even factions that have not defected to the Syrian groups and are considered “‘loyal’’ to Arafat are not always under his control. They are scattered around the Arab world, much as the PLO has scattered its offices around Tunis. Some drift in and out of the city to keep in touch, while maintaining relatively independent factions elsewhere. Until very recently that had been the case with the now notori- ous figure Mohammed Abbas, the head of the faction called the Pales- tine Liberation Front, who was re- ported to have settled into Tunis onlyin the past three months. It was henchmen of Abbas who pulled the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, killing an American passenger. Abbas is being sought by the U.S. govern- ment as mastermind of the plot. Arafat had dispatched Abbas from Tunis to bring an end to the hijacking. Some observers of the PLO here underscored the divisions that pla- gue the remains of Arafat’s organi- zation, noting that the chairman also directed one of his closest aides to accompany Abbas. Arafat probably did that, they said, not to help Abbas, but to make sure he carried out Arafat’s orders. Dallas Morning News - October 20, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Lax Border Policies Turn Italy Into ‘Guest House’ ! By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to The Blade OME, — Two Arabs were stopped here last week car- Tying fake Moroccan passports. They also carried more than 15 -pounds of explosives in their luggage. But two Palestinians who enter- ed Italy earlier on false Moroccan passports were not caught in time by police. One bombed the British Airways office downtown and the other bombed the popular Cafe de Paris. The Palestinian hijackers of the cruise ship “Achille Lauro”’ proba- bly got into Italy and on the ship with false passports. AITALY’S lax border policies have turned the country into a guest house for international terrorists. These major incidents have Startled the congenial Italians into ‘questioning their traditional open- ness and have spurred the govern- ment.to action. _ ““We are not yet in a panic, but there already is something more than concern,’”’ said the left-wing Rome daily newspaper, La Repub blica, recalling 12 terrorist at- tacks since 1979 believed plotted or carried out by foreigners in Rome alone. AN INTERIOR ministry offi- cial said his ministry has submit- ted proposals to the parliament that would stiffen penalties. against clandestine entrants and illegal alien workers. : Raffaele Costa, ministry under- secretary, has said repeatedly that the government must require vi- sas for citizens of some nations, especially Third World countries, who now may enter Italy without them. That legislation has not yet been submitted, a ministry spokes- man said. None of the three most recent acts of terrorism was directed at Italians, but Italians have suffered because their country was used as a conduit for Palestinian extrem- ists to reach other enemies. Dozens of Italians were injured and one was killed in the two bomb attacks aimed at British and American citizens here. Hundreds of Italians were captives on the cruise ship. THE PALESTINIANS could have found British and American targets in other countries and ships steaming to Israel from other ports than Genoa. But it was simple for them to get into Italy and easier yet to stay hers long enough to plot the most com plicated terrorist action. “Italy is full of Arabs,’ said an Italian diplomat assigned to an Arab country. “Italy is easier for them to go in and out of. There are not many controls.” A Rome police spokesman in the foreigners section said visitor’s carrying passports from Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria (Arab coun-_ tries in North Africa) as well as from Turkey, Senegal, Peru, and -Colombia do not need visas to enter Italy. THE MINISTRY of interior es- timates nearly one million illegal aliens, the majority from Third World countries, mingle among Italy’s 56 million population. Since the mid-1970s_ roughly 100,000 a year have come from the Middle East, Africa, and South America, Mr. Costa has said. He called Rome an “inter- national crossroads” where “a for- eigner can hide and camouflage himself’? because there are so many legal foreigners in the city, both living here and passing through as tourists. Requiring visas might not catch all fakes, such the Palestinian bombers with false Moroccan passports, but it would add anoth- - er layer of screening. Besides adding visa require- ments, better legislation is needed to control foreign visitors and workers, Mr. Costa said. “‘In any case, we need to merge security with the guarantee of full respect of our tradition as a democratic country.”’ LEGISLATION under consider- ation would provide a prison sen- tence in certain cases for a for-- eigner who enters the country illegally. Now he is simply ex- pelled. Likewise, a prison term would be added for a foreigner who remains’ here longer than three months without authoriza-. tion- or if he lets the authorization lapse. Now he is invited to leave and escorted out. This would bring some order to the situation but would not, for example, get terrorism out of the picture, Mr. Costa said. ILLEGAL ALIENS, terrorists or not, have relative freedom to roam the country because of Ita- ly’s rather loose entry procedures. Arriving foreigners do not have to fill out entry cards showing where they will stay and how long they plan to be in the country. Nor do border guards stamp their passports in most cases. That makes it difficult to prove when an alien arrived in the country or if he has exceeded the three- month limit to remain.

We cannot contribute to decisions,” he said, ; The political fallout from the Achille Lauro affair was made worse for Craxi because he had al- ready irritated so many in the past, Ligas said. “Because of this authoritarian manner, to manage the crisis, to manage the Parliament, to manage the government, he now has more trouble,” he said. Communists such as Ligas won- der how Craxi can call himself a so- cialist, after moves such as accept-~ ing the NATO Euromissiles — anathema to the radical left — and leading a bitter struggle to reduce the cost-of-living pay escalator. The actions may defy traditional socialist principles, but then Craxi is much the pragmatist. That is certainly the case in for- eign relations, a field in which Craxi and Christian Democrat For- _ eign Minister Giulio Andreotti have tried to find a new middle ground in the East-West arena, and a new leading role in the Mediterranean ~ basin, They have maintained Italy's Western identity, while actively cultivating relations with the East bloc. Craxi was the first NATO leader to visit Mikhail Gorbachev after he became Soviet leader, and has scheduled trips to Hungary, Romania and East Germany. He also has strengthened ties to Arab and Third World countries. Antonio Badini, Craxi’s diplo- matic adviser, said, “Italy must try to give its contribution to the (At- lantic) alliance and work for the re- covery of detente through North- South as well as East-West bilateral relations.” Craxi’s overtures to the South and the East were a major reason for Spadolini’s Republicans quitting the government. Others outside the Republican Party also are uneasy. If Craxi pulls together and keeps together another government, he may have to change his style, and possibly his personality aswell. But as Ligas noted, the govern- ment collapse may have its effecton Craxi, “When you confront reality like this,” he said, “you can, step by step, change your way of thinking.” Dallas Morning News October 27, 1985 \f"

At 8:15 p.m., the Egyptian unit, of an unknown size, blew in the Fear cargo hold and climbed into the plane.

Fire spread through the aircraft. ; \"In a confined place like a 737. you throw three grenades, you — it was hell,’’ the captain said. Both the pilot and Mifsud esti-. mated 50 people died from the fire, smoke, bullets or shrapnel. Among them were two women flight attendants and eight small children.

A passenger who was among 11 women released by the hijackers said they first appeared about 10 minutes after takeoff, wearing face masks. Flurry of gunshots Loretana Chafik, an Egyptian, said the hijackers told the passen- gers to put their heads down, then started methodically going down the rows, asking for passports. A man in the second row reached for his back pocket as though to retrieve his passport, and pulled out a gun, she said. A - flurry of gunshots ensued. Galal said the commander of the hijackers was with him ‘in the cabin almost the entire time, after the plane was diverted Saturday night. The commander was very ‘‘dis- creet,’’ he said, and would not give his name, his native country or the aim or destination of the terrorists. Once the craft landed in Malta — it was initially refused permis- sion to land, but was guided down after Galal explained he had wounded on board — the hijackers made the pledge to begin killing people if they did not get the fuel they demanded. “*He threatened he will execute a Passenger every 15 minutes,’’ Gal- al said of the hijack commander. The hijacker had taken the Passengers’ passports and singled out first the two Israeli women and next the Americans to be shot, he said. - : yptians take jet “In exactly 15 minutes, he shot the Israeli girl. He shot her at point-blank range. He shot her in the face, and he threw her off the plane,’” said the pilot, who ap- peared calm and steady. Apparently six people were shot in this manner, all of whom the hijackers and the captain believed had been killed. Only one died immediately. Galal said he convinced the hijackers to release some of the women, primarily Egyptians and Filipinos, and then talked the leader into letting the authorities ' retrieve the other passengers who had been shot and either thrown onto the tarmac or remained in the plane. At one point, the captain said, he broke down and asked the Maltese authorities to give the fuel because he could no longer take the shooting of his passengers.

VALLETTA,’ Malta — About 9:30 p.m. Athens time last Satur- day, an EgyptAir Boeing 737 took off from Athens airport, bound for Cairo with 98 people 92 passengers and six crew members. Twenty-two hours later, 59 of them were dead. This is what happened to them. Ten minutes into the air, Capt. Hani Galal says, the leader of the hijackers broke into the cockpit waving a six-shooter and a hand grenade without its pin. “I asked him to put the safety pin in and I would cooperate, if he doesn’t hurt anybody,” Galal re- Shortly after, co-pilot Emad Bahey says, the pilot switched on a silent warning signal called a transponder, which notified the tower that the plane had been hijacked. Almost immediately, according to surviving passengers, the hi- jackers began checking passports and searching people, apparently for weapons. “They knew there was security on board,” said Egyptian passen- ger Mohammad El! Wahil. A plainclothes security guard, pretending to reach for his pass- port, pulled a gun and shot the hijacker nearest to him, killing him, according to passenger Lore- tana Chafik, also Egyptian. The guard, however, was shot by one of the other hijackers, and the exchange of bullets also result- ed in injuries to two flight attendants. A bullet pierced the skin of the fuselage, both pilot and co-pilot reported, and the plane began to lose cabin pressure. Oxygen masks fell out of their overhead compart- ments. The captain dropped alti- tude quickly to about 14,000 feet. Controllers notified Capt. Galal, heading for Malta as the hijacker demanded, notified Malta controllers that he had to make an emergency landing. They at first refused permission, the oe says, but after he ex- plained his problems, they guided him into the airport that had been closed, with its lights turned off. 'At 9:30 p.m. Malta time — one hour after takeoff — the plane Immediately after reaching a remote edge of the airfield, the hijackers asked for fuel and an engineer, then for an ambulance and a doctor, “because they had persons bleeding on board,” ac- cording to Paul Mifsud, the gov- ernment director of information. Within 20 minutes the doctor was on board, and the hijackers then permitted him to leave with the two flight attendants, whom the captain carried out, one by one. Before the plane even landed, Mifsud says, Prime Minister Car- melo Mifsud Bonnici arrived at the control tower where he remained, according to spokesman Mifsud, until the plane was recaptured Sunday night. - Various cabinet ministers and diplomats from countries . whose citizens were involved made their way in and out of the control tower to consult. Prime Minister Mifsud Bonnici says the hijackers asked to speak to diplomats from two countries, only one of which is represented in Malta. In a radio transmission picked up by journalists a control- ler said: ‘“‘The Libyan ambassador is coming. He will speak.” The prime minister says the unnamed ambassador did speak to the hijackers, but refused to go on board for further talks. Threats to passengers The hijackers were asking only to have the plane refueled so they could head for another, unknown destination, threatening to begin killing passengers if the Maltese refused to comply. The Maltese government repeat- edly rejected the demand, promis- ing to give fuel only if the mgers were set free. Not long before midnight, the captain convinced the hijackers to let some women leave the plane, though they granted freedom only to Filipino and Egyptian women, the captain says. The last women to leave were kicked as they exited the plane, and shots were fired in the air. American passenger Patrick Baker says that after these women were set free, the flight attendant _ food, which was sent out to them doing the bidding of the hijackers called for one of the Israeli women to come forward. However, when Israeli Tamar Artzie, 24, reached the top of the stairwell to follow the route out that the other women had taken, she was shot and fell to the ground. Somehow she was not The second Israeli woman got the same treatment, 15 minutes later. Although Nitzan Menders- | son fought back, she was dragged to the front, shot and thrown to | the tarmac. She fell next to Artzie, | who recalls that she knew her | friend was alive because she saw her fingers moving. Mendersson has been described as clinically dead in the hospital. i Artzie then managed to crawl to Maltese security guards, although a hijacker on the plane apparently saw her moving and fired at her, hitting her in the buttock. Shortly after the two Israeli women were shot, the three American passengers were gath- ered together in the front of the plane, Baker says, with their hands bound behind them with neckties. Baker was called up and fol- lowed the steps of the Israelis, although the hijacker failed to injure him seriously, grazing the Peart of Baker’s head with his ullet. First to die Apparently one of the two American women, Scarlett Rogen- camp of Oceanside, Calif., was hext in line to be methodically brought forward and shot, but she _was the first of these victims to die. The precise time of these shoot- ings is uncertain, but a Maltese journalist says he heard a related radio transmission on an air con- trol band at 12:50 a.m. Sunday between the plane and the control! tower. The captain says the or jackers promised to kill another passenger in 20 minutes. At 1:10 a.m. the journalist says he heard a shot ring out. A few minutes later the captain reported a passenger had been executed. It is uncertain which shooting this was. At 3 a.m. Mifsud says Maltese |security forces “at great risk” | went to the plane and recovered |four bodies. These apparently ‘included Baker, Mendersson and |Rogencamp. The fourth might \\have been the body of the Egyp- 'tAir security guard who was shot in the midair gun battle, as he als: was dumped out of the plane. At 6 a.m. the hijackers asked foi of terror ended with flames and death Around 9:30 a.m. Mifsud says the fifth cold-blooded shooting of Passengers took place. Jackie Pflug, 30, of Pasadena, Texas, was tossed out of the plane. She was unable to walk away from the plane and authorities were unable to pick her up for medica! treat- ment because the hijackers warn- ed that they would shoot anyone who approached. About 10 a.m. an Egyptian C-130 Hercules landed with about 25 to 30 special forces soldiers assigned to recapture the airplane. The captain, meanwhile, was making various transmissions to the tower, some of which were designed to help ground authori- ties decide the best assault posi- tions. For example, at one point he told the tower, while the hijacker was in the bathroom, that the main doors were locked from the inside. He was warning them against any rescue plan _ that eopenped on entry through those oors. : Food delivered At 2:45 p.m. Maltese authorities delivered food in exchange for being allowed to pick up Pflug, who had lain on the tarmac fa nearly five hours. AT 7:40 p.m. the airport was closed. A Swissair jet already Positioned for takeoff was called back to the gate, and its passen- gers disembarked. Most lights were doused, on the field and in the terminal. After 8 p.m. the pilot co-pilot saw a red light go on in the cabin, indicating a rear door was opening, according to the co-pilot, who says both thus knew the rescue mission was under way. Co-pilot Bahey says he quickiy snapped off the light before the hijacker saw it. At 8:15 p.m. the E; ian anti- terrorist unit of 25 to 30 soidiers stormed the airpiane, biowing a hole in the rear cargo hold to enter a and through the emergency ts. The hijackers set off three hand grenades and the airpiane turned into a living hell of fire and gunshots. The death toli of 59 included four of the five hijackers.

        "ocr_text": "ital By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to The Blade OME — A new student protest movement has spilled into the streets, where hundreds of thousands of young Italians have demonstrated for better schools and against pro- posed school fee increases. ' It has been largely apolitical and nonviolent so far. But fears repeated- ly have been expressed that the un- expected new wave of activism could evolve into the kind of deadly ex- tremism bred by student movements here in 1968 and 1977. The marches began in October in Milan, where the most serious inci- dent was recorded when 10,000 stu- dents converged on the municipal building and pelted it with eggs. Small groups of radicals became em- broiled in confrontations and several people were injured, none seriously. BUT THE crescendo of demonstra- tions in November in more than 100 cities and villages was remarkably free of trouble and of politics. An estimated 500,000 to 800,000 students boycotted Saturday classes. Only two minor incidents were re- ported, apparently touched off by young right-wing agitators. But in most cases the protesters did not even carry banners or signs of politi- -cal parties, which normally are req- uisite in Italian demonstrations. “We want to study,” is the common slogan repeated by protesters. It may be an innocuous and even commend- able sentiment, but it is the same slogan yelled by activists who later turned revolutionary in the ’60s. Commentators have expressed fears that extremist political groups will try to exploit the movement. THE NEW protest generation, made up of students from high school to university age, are bitterly com- plaining that they do not have enough classrooms, supplies, or laboratories. In some high schools students are so numerous that they are split into groups that attend only three days a week each, or they may go in as many as three different shifts pe ian Students Take Slogan T¢ day. Normally schools meet six days a week, until 1 or 2 p.m. Many schools are filthy, have holes in the walls, and habitually lack not just sophisticated equipment, but suf- ficient toilets and even toilet paper. Students also protested, especially in high-tech Milan, that curricula and teachers are too outdated to prepare them adequately for jobs. New fees proposed by the govern- ment would raise the basic annual fee for the liceo from a nominal sum of less than $5 to a rate of about $45 per student, according to the ministry spokesman. Secondary school attendance is not mandatory in Italy. Toledo Blade Streets: ‘We Want To Study’ _ At the university level, the low tuition would go up by at least 30 per cent. Students at the public universi- ties now pay from about $100 to $150 a year. FLAVIA, a business administration student at the University of Rome, Said she would not mind paying more if conditions were better. She stopped attending classes after one year out of frustration, such as having to arrive as much as two hours early to find a seat. Univ of Rome enrollment is a staggering 150,000 students. “Half the time I had to sit on the floor, and sometimes there wasn’t even room on the floor,” Flavia said . After skipping classes and working at home for a year, she found that lectures are essential to passing ex: ams, This year, she again is fighting the crowds. _ Marcia Kunstel is an American writer - January 5, 1986 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Mrs. Aquino clear favorite of Manila business leaders By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News MANILA, Philippines — The re- ception that Manila’s foreign and local business community gave to President Ferdinand Marcos this week was almost embarrassing. The absence of enthusiasm — there was no applause when he en- tered the hotel banquet hall Tues- day — was in stark contrast to the virtual pep rally the same audience worked up the previous day for Marcos’ opponent in Friday’s presi- dential election. Reform candidate Corazon Aquino, widow of slain opposition leader Benigno Aquino, clearly is the favorite of Manila’s business leaders. She was cheered and applauded riotously Monday by the overflow crowd, who were members and @uests of eight chambers of com- merce and business associations, both foreign and Filipino. The same group extended barely a polite reception to Marcos, offer- ing him scant applause and no cheers throughout his hourlong speech. Nearly one-third of the au- dience left before he finished.

        "ocr_text": "farcos and Aquino Slow vote count shows no trend By Marcia Kunstel i Special to The News yt 2 MANILA, Philippines — While both Presi: dent Ferdinand Marcos and challenger Corazon Aquino said they believed they won Friday’s elections, the vote tally was so slow that it showed no definitive trends by Saturday. B Accusations came quickly that the vote- counting was being delayed so it could be manip- ulated, as reports of ballot-box stealing and other election fraud continued to pour into the capital. US. Sen. Richard’ Lugar, head of an official American observer delegation, said it appeared that Marcos’ government was trying to “shape the returns” in the face of a strong showing from Mrs. Aquino. “My own political judgment is that the gov- ernment conceded that the results from. (metro-, \\- politan) Manila would not be good and at: tempted to hold down the pinraltty and repont ing of it,\"Lugarsaid, . ta Lugar said he thought the ‘government was: also withholding vote returns in Marcos’ homie: epion on northern Luzon Island to allow “some> Dallas Morning News February 8, 1986 Continued from Page 1A. latitude for the plurality they might need to overcome.” “The government is trying to determine, in- what was a fairly close election, what is going to be required” for a Marcos Vector Y: Lu- gar said. Initial returns depended on who did the adding. Mrs. Aquino had an edge of about 10,000 votes out of the 600,000 counted by the Commission on Elections, the offi- cial vote-tallying body. Figures released by the Na- tional Movement for Free Elections, a citizens’ poll-watching group known as Namfrel, also showed Mrs. Aquino leading with 2.2 mil-~ lion votes to 1.6 million for Marcos. But the Media Poll Count ’86, or- ganized by pro-Marcos newspapers, said Marcos had 2.9 million votes to 2.4 million for Mrs. Aquino, out of the estimated 25 million votes cast in the presidential election. The chairman of the Commis- sion on Elections called on the Na- tional Assembly to convene soon so it could review the balloting and name a winner. The speaker of the National As- sembly, Nicanor Yniguez, said he has already sent out notices for the assembly to convene Monday. “We intend to do so right away, to ease up this tension that has built up,” he said. Mrs. Aquino released a state- ment early Saturday, 10 hours after the polls closed, saying, “The trend is clear and irreversible. The people and I have won, and we know it.”’ An aide said she was making plans to call on Marcos ‘‘to arrange an orderly transfer of power.” A Marcos spokesman later is- ‘sued a statement criticizing Aquino for her early claim of victory, say- ing that she was causing ‘“‘confusion and distrust of our election proce- dure.” Marcos said in an interview on government television that the re- sults available “indicate that I prob- ably have won these elections.” In a separate interview with the Cable News Network, Marcos blamed Namfrel for “hiding” elec- tion returns and slowing the vote- tallying. He said the group had claim victory refused to release returns to the elections commission. When asked about reports of fraud and violence — there were re- ports that anywhere from 26 to more than 60 people killed in elec- tion-day violence — Marcos said “soldiers are trying to prevent the opposition hoodlums”’ from stealing the election. Meanwhile, Namfrel called for volunteers to help guard ballot boxes as it received numerous re- ports of armed men stealing the boxes out of the clutch of poll- watchers. In the Makati suburb of Manila, voters chanting “‘Cory! Cory!” sat atop ballot boxes and formed human chains to protect the ballots before they were transferred from the precincts to the municipal hall. The slow pace of returns brought critical comments from Namfrel as well as from Lugar. Jose Concepcion, chairman. of Namfrel, said “‘there is no doubt in my mind that the government is trying to make sure it has the mar- gin to win the election. That is very clear.” Conception also estimated that at least 10 percent of the voters in Manila, a heavily pro-Aquino area, had been denied the right to vote because their names had been re- moved from the registration lists. The tabulation delay pounded yet another wedge between the Commission on Elections and Nam- frel, which had agreed to cooperate on Namfrel’s “quick count” of elec- tion results after weeks of bicker- ing over how the operation would work. The dispute between the two groups broke into the open in early morning hours Saturday. Jaime Opinion, an election com- mission member, told reporters: “We will not hesitate to stop Nam- frel’s quick count to prevent them from misleading the people into be- lieving that one candidate has won.” Namfrel Chairman Concepcion Said that his group’s counting would continue, saying, “There is no damned way this place will be closed.” The problem apparently started \fRichard Lugar “The (Philippine) government is trying to determine, in what was a fairly close election, what is going to be-re- quired” for a Marcos vic- tory. eee when Namfrel couriers bringing in local totals carried some tabulation sheets that lacked the requisite sig- nature by local election commis- sion (Comelec) officials. _ Under the agreement with Comelec, the precinct returns must be taken to municipal centers and checked in by local Comelec offj- cials before they are sent on to Ma. nila for Namfrel’s “quick count’ tabulation. Namfrel charged that local offj- cials often cannot be found or sim. ply refuse toclearthereturns. In the last elections, Namfre] volunteers relayed the count qj- rectly from precincts to a tabulat- ing center. U.S. Sen Frank Murkowski, R- Alaska, one of the U.S. observers, said he visited municipal hall in Quezon City to learn why the vote count was going so slowly. ._ “The problem is that the Comelec officials are not Process- ing the forms given to them by the Namfre] people,” said Murkowski, describing an undermanned Comelec tally room upstairs. ‘They are not doing a damned thing.” Comelec Commissioner Opinion attributed the slow returns to Nam- frel, saying, “The problem is that the Namfrel couriers have not been bringing the information to our re- ceiving station here.” Comelec Commissioner Quirino Martinez agreed. “I am so disappointed the re- sults aren't coming in as fast. . . I’m worried that something is being . done, you know. They (Namfrel) are not doing their job.” While the vote returns were meager, reports of violence and election fraud continued flowing into the Namfrel headquarters all day and night, reaching a pace of practically one per minute around midnight Friday. The Philippine News Agency re- ported that its correspondents cal- culated 26 people were killed in election-related violence. Some Ma- nila newspapers said as many as 62 people had died. In, ne case, fotir communist rebels reportedly were killed when they ambushed an army tank in the southern island of Mindanao. In a second incident, nine Philippine constabulary soldiers and two teachers were killed on another part of the same island in a commu- nist ambush, the news agency Said. In both cases, the soldiers were carrying election paraphernalia to the polls. One poll-watcher was report- edly shot Friday afternoon while guarding a ballot box on an island of the central provinces and died soon after. Many others were bloo- died by beatings or chased away from doing their jobs. Lugar, who initially had said he thought ‘the will of the voters will be expressed” in the election, toned down his positive assessment as re- ports of voting irregularities con- tinued. On Saturday he said he had discerned “frankly a very disturb- ing pattern” of fraud and violence. Among the instances of re- ported election abuses: g@ Armed men burst into the San Antonio polling station in Tarlac province late Friday afternoon. Fa- ther Francis Considine, an Irish priest, said he tried to cling to the ballot boxes but was dragged from the polling center. Local residents said Mrs. Aquino had already received sev- eral votes in the counting that had begun at San Antonio. When the ballot boxes and tally sheets ar- rived at the Concepcion town hall Friday night, the announced result was 367 votes for Marcos, 0 for Mrs. Aquino. @ In Manila’s Tejeros neighbor- hood, about 30 men stormed into an elementary school at 11:30 a.m. Fri- day, rushing past six women who had set up a makeshift altar to say a continuous rosary for honest elec- tions. A witness, Marco Cabarloc, said the men ejected about 250 Nam- frel volunteers at gunpoint and took over 30,000 ballots. “We were overpowered,” he said. m One journalist reported he saw three men, at least two armed and shooting in the air, approacha precinct in metropolitan Manila and scatter the voters and poll- watchers. One man ran into the vot- ing area, snatched some papers and fled. The American journalist said he saw two Namfrel volunteers bloody from being beaten by the intruders. He was later told the man stole blank ballots, which could be used to stuff a ballot box elsewhere; mNamfrel Secretary-General Christian Monsod sent a telegram to the head of the national police, asking for immediate defense at an- other metro Manila precinct where Namfrel volunteers were being beat up by political thugs. He also asked urgent aid for several workers who were jailed or thrown in military stockades. © @ Mansod also sent a telegram. to Comelec officials, asking for im- mediate action to accredit 3,000 Namfrel volunteers assigned to guard the-polls in the province of Antique, because local election offi- cials refused to issue them permits. @ In Mandaluyong, in metro Ma- nila, poll-watchers reported five ci- vilians with M-16s snatched ballot boxes from Namfrel volunteers. The volunteers followed them and saw the boxes dumped into a canal. A local assemblyman, Neptali Gon- zalez, retrieved the ballots later and . vowed they will be counted. |: Despite the reported instances of violence and election frat, re- form leaders and observers were not willing to say the election had been spoiled beyond retrieval. Lugar said-he had to assess the voting irregularities, their number and their impact, before pronounc- ing a view on the validity iof the election. ifs Vicente Jayme, national* vice chairman of Namfrel, said ‘he ex- pected the incidence of trouble to be higher than in the 1984 assembly elections, but not this high. | “I think we need’ to wait and find out the full extent of, cheat- ing,” Jayme said. “If the initial re- ports are any indication of what re- ally happened, then I am afraid af- ter the full reports are in, we will find out the extent of terrorism is very great.” M4 The response of Filipinos, he said, will depend on whether the people feel the election was “rela- tively” honest, or whether they. feel cheated. ¥ “If people feel they ‘were cheated, there may be distur- bances,” he said. ‘ ' Although Namfrel had more, better-trained volunteers this year, Jayme said they could not better combat disruptions because’ “it seems the regime in power has al- lowed independent friends to take action.” i The reports indicate, he said, ‘that both sides in the contest were involved in questionable activities, but the reports indicate o“the greater number came from: the party in power.” 6 ‘ @ i Jayme admitted the reports must be verified before conclusions are drawn, a process he said would take about a week. : “In any situation in which there is a lot of intimidation, harassment, vote-buying and other events that seem to frustrate the will of the people,” he said, “of course there are serious concerns about the future of democracy? : 4 The Associated Press contributed to this report.

        "ocr_text": "Miarcos migh void election Aquino leads unofficial count By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News MANILA, Philippines — Presi- dent Ferdinand Marcos, facing early unofficial returns that showed him trailing opponent Cora- zon Aquino, raised the possibility Saturday that he might declare the presidential election invalid. Mrs. Aquino, meanwhile, re- iterated her claim that she won the election and said she will not accept a Marcos victory. Marcos, in response to a question on what he would doif U-S. election observers found the voting Friday in the presidential election “un- clean,”’ said: . “Tf you’re moving toward the point as to whether I would declare the elections invalid, and either de- clare that no elections had been held and continue (in office) up to 1987, or cancel the election, these are matters which I have thought seriously about, and as of now I am trying to play it by ear.’’ The latest figures released by the government’s Commission on Elec- tions showed Mrs. Aquino leading Marcos with 1,819,896 votes to Dallas Morning News - February 9, 1986 i Vote count criticized.

But although Mrs. Aquino led the tallies, she was faring much worse than expected in her strong hold of metropolitan Manila, which has about 4.3 million registered vot ers. In that critical area, according tc the Namfrel count, she was leading Marcos by SS percent to 45 percent with about 78 percent of the vote, or 2.5 million ballots, counted. Politi cal strategists had projected she would need to carry close to 70 per cent in Manila to win the election.

U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar, head of the American team of observers, charged that “the Manila vote has been held down by systematic harassment” and that the govern- ment is trying to slow the election returns so it can “massage” them. “I’m just saying as of this ‘moment, it’s a very, very suspicious count,” Lugar said. Another member of the US. | team, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said, “It’s obvious to everyone in the world that something has gone fundamentally wrong with this election. ... There is grave con- cern.” Opponents have suggested that should Marcos, 68, find himself in danger of losing to Mrs. Aquino, he might invoke his constitutional powers to halt the process and stay in office. 1 At a news conference Saturday, Mrs. Aquino said even if the official tally of the National Assembly even- tually shows Marcos the victor in Friday’s election, she will not ac- cept the results, declaring her self- proclaimed victory “irreversible.” She said if Marcos is declared the winner, “I will lead daily demon- strations because even now our. bal- lot boxes, too many ballot boxes are disappearing, and I am afraid they are being substituted... .If ] am ar- rested, then maybe my children who are not arrested will lead the daily demonstrations.” Throughout his more than hour- long news conference, Marcos maintained that the election was free and fair and denied charges by Namfrel and by Mrs. Aquino’s sup- porters that wide-scale cheating and violence marred the vote. _ “If there was anybody snatching. at ballot boxes, it has been more on the side of the opposition and Nam- frei,” Marcos said. (Meanwhile, Scripps-Howard News Service quoted Mark Helmke, Lugar's press secretary, as saying that a helicopter carrying Kerry and a top Lugar aide, Graham erman, was fired at — but not — while erat it to land on _ the southern island of Mindanao. _ (Helmke said the two were _ trying to observe voting in the area. The helicopter landed, but took oft after two U.S, Marine guards saw a_ number of men with rifles running _ toward the helicopter. The Marines later reported seeing muzzle fire from the rifles as the helicopter took off.) Mrs. Aquino, the widow of assas- sinated opposition leader Benigno Aquino has claimed victory despite the small number of election re- turns. Marcos has not formally claimed himself the winner, but said he thinks he is ahead, The Philippine electoral process | calls for the National Assembly to | make the official canvass and an- . ‘nounce the winner. All vote counts ~ 80 far are informal and carry no le- gal weight. Mrs. Aquino suggested the United States might “impress upon. Mr. Marcos how very necessary it is for him to concede so that we Will have a peaceful transition of g°V- ernment.” Marcos sent his own quick mes Sage to the American governmet, essentially warning it not to in- terfere. He said he could survive without the United States and its _ two strategic bases in the Philip. . pines, implying he will turn else- where for aid. “If you want to cut the military aid to us, to eliminate the bases, what can we do?” Marcos asked. “We will have to live with that. We will have to make some kind of a modus vivendi with the other pow- ers here in the region.” Mrs. Aquino left her afternoon hews conference to address a group of supporters and election monitors camped around a municipal hall who were refusing to let election of- ficials leave with the ballot boxes. As she left the news conference with an entourage of journalists, Mrs. Aquino cried: “OK, so charge!” - The residents of Makati were holding the ballots to protest al- leged election violations, including the snatching of ballots and ballot boxes. “The Philippine people aren’t” going to be cheated any more,” Mrs. Aquino told the demonstrators, who responded with vibrant cheers. They later agreed to surrender the ballot boxes to election officials, Mrs. Aquino has never endorsed the use of violence. . “Definitely violence will only beget more violence, and so even now I keep reminding the Philip- pine people that we should not go into that,” she said Saturday. “And besides, since Iam winning I do not want to give Mr. Marcos any excuse for maybe declaring emergency powers. So I have been asking the Philippine people to stay calm.” Marcos was clearly concerned at the implications of Mrs. Aquino’s daring stand, generally taking care to appear flexible and conciliatory. For example, asked how he would respond to unauthorized demonstrations, Marcos took a soft line. : “I have issued the order that there is to be maximum order. You know many demonstrations have been started by the opposition and they were never touched,” he said. “If they engage in violence, that’s a different matter.” The president also appealed to Mrs: Aquino “to be prudent about this ... and allow the duly author- ized offices to do their work.” He did at one point, however, question whether Mrs. Aquino “has gone too far to listen to reason,” and warned that irresponsible ac- tions “will strain the fabric of our political life to the breaking point.” If the opposition has a complaint once the votes are Officially tallied, Marcos said, they should file it with the proper appeals board. “This is done in all civilized countries in the world,” he said. “You don’t say, ‘These are my fig- ures and I stick by them.’ Mrs. Aquino appeared firm and determined, showing up in public for the first time since the cam- paign began two months ago in something other than yellow cloth- ing. She was wearing a gray dress. Yellow became the campaign color because supporters of her hus- band had tied yellow ribbons up to welcome him home the day in 1983 that he arrived at the Manila air- - port and was shot and killed. “I am happy that I am finally about to realize Ninoy’s fight to re- Store democracy, human rights and _dignity to the lives of all Filipinos,” she said, referring to her husband by his nickname. “We will again be one nation drawing strength from each other.” - a) ghee Dallas Morning News - February 9, 1986 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Mrs. Aquino criticizes Rea Aquino cautions Reagan ‘She urges U.S. leader not to accept Marcos By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News 2 MANILA, Philippines — Opposi- tion candidate Corazon Aquino on Wednesday cautioned President Reagan against accepting President Ferdinand Marcos as the victor in the presidential election. “I would wonder at the motives B® Habib sent to Philippines. 18A of a friend of democracy who chose to conspire with Mr. Marcos to cheat the Filipino people of their liberation,” she said in a statement. “Not only the Filipinos but the vast majority of the American peo- ple and their Congress would con- demn any such action which so fla- grantly assists in returning a people to their captivity,” Mrs. Aquino Said. Her statement was made in reac- tion to Reagan’s comments at a news conference Tuesday night and his announcement that he would send veteran diplomat Philip Habib to the Philippines to evaluate the post-election situation. Reagan made few critical state- ments about the election, noting that a U.S. team of observers had told him “there was the appearance of fraud” but “they didn't have any hard evidence beyond that general appearance.” He also said it was pos- sible that the fraud “was occurring on both sides.” He said the United States would try to maintain relations with the Philippines no matter who is. named the winner. There was no immediate reac- tion to Reagan’s statements from Marcos, though. the government television station played a video- tape of the Reagan news conference throughout the day. Mrs. Aquino, who has claimed victory in the race although she is trailing in the government’s Com- mission on Elections tally, said she was “alarmed” by Reagan’s sugges- tion that there may have been fraud on both sides. None of the U.S. or Please see AQUINO on Page 26A. Continued from Page 1A. international observers has said that Aquino supporters committed fraud. ; Mrs. Aquino also said that “it would be a delusion of policy to be- lieve that an opposition whose lead- ers and followers have been and are being killed can suddenly settle down to a Western-style opposition role in a healthy two-party system.” “Too many will be dead the moment the world’s head is turned,” she said. — 5 Meanwhile, Marcos continued to lead Mrs. Aquino in the vote tally by the Commission on Elections. Mar- cos led with 7,032,695 votes, or 50.6 percent, to Mrs. Aquino’s 6,859,234, or 494 percent, with two-thirds of the precincts reporting. Asked if he expects that Marcos will be proclaimed the next presi- dent, he said: “By the tyranny of numbers, yes. Because they have the votes in the Batasan (parlia- ment.)” Saguisag acknowledged there is some concern that the campaign is losing momentum in the protracted vote-counting period, but he said the reform movement will not die. “We may not have unseated the dic- tator, but the fact is Mr. Marcos has not defeated the people,” he said. Saguisag said there will be “cer- tain developments” in the next 48 hours or so that will help the cam- paign determine its next moves. He refused to be more specific. Mrs. Aquino’s advisers are debat- ing whether the best strategy in The independent ballot-monitor- ing group National Movement for Free Elections, or Namfrel, had Mrs. Aquino ahead, 7,158.679, or 52.3 percent, to 6,532,362, or 47.3 percent for Marcos, based on 64 percent of the precincts. But Mrs. Aquino’s lead in the Namfrel totals has been slowly whittled back in the past few days. _ Most of the returns yet to be re-~ _ ported by Namfrel are from areas where Marcos is strong, and Nam- frel officials say it is possible Mar- cos will pull ahead in the final tally. In her statement, Mrs. Aquino | said she lost a million or more votes through deliberate removal of vot- ers’ names from voter registration lists, ballot-stuffing, false returns and other fraud. an for remarks on vote face of a Marcos victory would be daily demonstrations, as Mrs. Aquino has threatened, or calls for strikes in an attempt to cripple the country’s ailing economy. One potential hazard to a contin- uing opposition fight is the possibil- ity that Salvador’ Laurel, Mrs. Aquino’s running mate, conceiva- bly could beat his opponent for the vice presidency, Arturo Tolentino. Laurel, who is running 850,000 votes ahead of Tolentino in the Namfrel count, has a wider lead than does Mrs. Aquino over Marcos. In the official poll Laurel also is los- ing by less than she is, and possibly could pull outa victory. Laurel said this week that he would not hesitate to serve with the man who has been the very reason “T would wonder at the motives of a friend of democracy who chose to conspire with Mr. Marcos to cheat the Filipino people of their liberation.” _ — Corazon Aquino The National Assembly, domi- nated by Marcos’ New Society Move- ment party, is meeting this week to begin its official tabulation of votes. Aquino spokesman Rene Sa- guisag indicated that the campaign has little hope for the official tally. for the existence of the opposition. “You see you must distinguis} that from accepting any job fron Marcos,” Laurel said. “One is the mandate of the people which yo cannot refuse.” “sh baal Such a turn of events woulc likely divide the opposition, a tenu OUS Coalition in which Laurel is on¢ of the more conservative leaders - He was a Marcos ally until abou seven years ago. | Laurel said the pairing woulc have advantages for Marcos, as i could ‘“deodorize or sanitize” th charges of fraudulent election prac tices. . * evils of the Marcos administratio if he were in the vice Presidency.

Marcos, at his victory celebra- ion, did not outline any particular rograms he planned to pursue in is new term. But during the day aturday, he met with his top eco- iomic advisers to discuss what he alled the first priority in his next dministration: tackling the na- ion’s grave economic problems. During their news conference, ypposition leaders presented what ney said was proof of massive s=heating by the Marcos campaign to yin the election. They alleged that Mareos increased his vote total by at least 2,5 million votes through cheating. tional Assembly’s official tally was about 1.5 million votes. The totals were 10,807,197 votes for Marcos and 9,291,716 for Mrs. Aquino. The opposition cited as one ex- ample of fraud the returns from northern Luzon’s Isabela Province. The opposition said its election re- port showed Marcos winning the province with 227,000 votes to 97,000 for Mrs, Aquino, a margin of 130,000, The returns recorded in the count by the National Assembly gave Marcos 402,000 votes to 20,000 for Mrs. Aquino, or a margin of 382,000. Opposition leaders also cited vote returns from the middle Phil- ippine city of Danao as another ex- ample of pro-Marcos cheating. The town has a population of 56,000, but the government's returns showed Marcos received 57,000 votes to 342 for Mrs. Aquino. The leaders did not say what their count in Danao was. Supporters of Mrs. Aquino had conceded from the onset of the Na- tional Assembly's official count of votes that Marcos would be de- clared the winner.

Mrs, Aquino herself wondered aloud whether the death of her sup- porter Javier might presage the need for more sacrifices by oppo- nents of the government: She is supposed to announce her campaign's next step at a Manila rally Sunday. She will almost cer- tainly call for mass actions and pos- sibly peaceful resistance to the law. “It may take civil disobedience to unseat him (Marcos), but no one is turning to violence,” said Rene Saguisag, Mrs. Aquino's spokesman. | “It (violence) will never come from us, We have always been at the re- ) ceiving end.” é Marcos, however, has contended that the opposition and the commu. nists are responsible for most of the election violence. A university student, a supporter of Mrs. Aquino’s, seemed to think trouble is inevitable. “If Marcos wins, there will be vi- I tence. If Aquino wins, there will be \\ violence,” the young woman said last week, before Marcos was de- clared the winner, She was tired af. ter several nights of guarding bal- lot boxes in her nearby town, and NALIppines dispirited about the future of her country.

He was attending a pro-Marcos rally, and someone had “molested” his car by taking its antenna. “The policeman with me wanted to shoot them,” the mayor said. “I said no, We have our tolerance.” A police officer has been de- tained in connection with the death of Javier, although he has not been charged, The police and soldiers in more Tremote provinces, where the com- Munist guerrillas are strong, have the worst reputation for unneces- sary use of force, Western diplomats have said that the excesses of government se- curity personnel have driven peo- ple to join the communists, ir- respective of their belief in the reb- els’ ideology.

        "ocr_text": "Aquino cal for boycotts, general strike By Marcia Kunstel and Gregg Jones — Special to The News MANILA, Philippines — Opposi- tion leader Corazon Aquino called Sunday for a barrage of economic boycotts in her continuing battle to rs unseat President Ferdinand Mar- Associated Press but organizers said about 1.5 million at- tended the rally where Mrs. Aquino out- lined a plan'for non-violent resistance. Supporters cheer Corazon Aquino at a rally Sunday in Manila’s Luneta Park. Police es- timated the crowd at a half-million people, Dallas Morning News February 17, 1986 cos, but Marcos declared firmly, “I ain the. president, and they are not going todrive meout.” | Mrs. Aquino, speaking at a rally in Luneta Park before hundreds of thousands of followers, unveiled a Telatively moderate plan of action. She called for a one-day national strike and boycotts of banks, media and a leading manufacturer. But she promised constant agita- tion and possibly more radical steps if the first .phase of her protest failed to persuade Marcos to step aside. Marcos, meanwhile, announced the’ resignation of controversial armed forces chief Gen. Fabian Ver, a move long desired by US. offi- cials. Ver was acquitted in December of covering up an alleged military plot to assassinate Mrs. Aquino’s husband, opposition leader Be- nigno Aquino. Ver’s ouster was sought by US. officials as the first step in a series of military reforms they say ‘are needed for the Philippines to com- bat a growing communist insur- gency. During Ver's tenure as armed forces chief, foreign and do- mestic critics accused the military of widespread corruption jans. Marcos indicated, however, that 2 and ~ . human rights abuses against civil- Ver likely would continue to have a role in his government as a “con- sultant” to the armed forces. During an interview Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation, Marcos said a halt in aid to the Philippines, as suggested by some US. congress- men, might cost the United States its vital military bases in the coun- try. —“If that happens, -we’ll have to talk about renegotiating the bases,” Marcos said, referring to Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. He also rejected suggestions that pressure from Mrs. Aquino’s forces or from U.S. officials might prompt him to step aside. “That’s ridiculous. That’s fool- ish. Why should I step down?” Mar- cos said during the TV interview. “I, am not a dictator. I am_ not’ unwanted and, therefore, I don’t think that will ever happen.” Marcos’ tough talk echoed com-, ments he made at an earlier Manila, news conference when asked about. criticism of the legitimacy of his election victory, proclaimed Satur- day night by the National Assembly. “I am the president, and they are not going to drive me out, because the people are behind me,” he said. (But authoritative Reagan ad- ministration officials said Sunday that they expected high-level resig- nations and defections from the Philippine Cabinet and financial in- stitutions to put added pressure on Marcos to seek accommodations with the opposition, the New York Times reported. (The officials insisted that the administration was not promoting Please see AQUINO on Page 4A. _ \ftii knowledge of mounting unhap- $ among Marcos supporters, imes said.

But the most radical action Mrs. Aquino proposed was a national day of prayer and protest, scheduled for the first working day after Marcos’ inauguration — expected to be within the next 10 days — during which Filipinos are being asked to stage a work stoppage. One of the potentially most dis- ruptive measures was the call to boycott seven banks that she said “have helped the usurper perpetu- ate his hold on power” and have be- come “instruments of oppression and waste.” She asked people to withdraw their deposits and to stop doing business at the banks, which are ei- ther wholly or partially owned by the government, or run by close friends of Marcos’. Arun on these banks could deal another serious blow to the Philip- pine economy, which already is reeling under heavy peso-dollar speculation and uncertainty whether the International Mone- tary Fund will approve anticipated loans. Mrs. Aquino also sought “a mas- sive boycott of the crony media,” in which she included the govern- ment-operated television station and four pro-Marcos daily newspa- pers. Besides not buying or watching them, she asked advertisers to with- draw advertising, threatening that their products in turn would be boycotted if they fail to comply. She told supporters not to pay their water and electricity bills un- til they get cut-off notices, appar- ently to disrupt the cash flow of the government. In addition, Mrs. Aquino asked for a boycott of the giant San Miguel Corp., whose chairman, Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr., is considered Mar- cos’ No. 1 business ally. San Miguel produces beer, soft drinks and dairy products, and owns control- ling interest in the Coca-Cola Bot- tling Corp., according to a 1983-84 business handbook. Mrs. Aquino, who had vowed to lead daily demonstrations if cheated at the polls, also called on the military and police to disobey orders that were “unjust.” “Although unarmed, I feel like the young boy David prepared to face the giant Goliath,” she said. “If Goliath refuses to yield, we shall es- calate our non-violent struggle.” To keep her profile high, Mrs. Aquino promised to deliver a radio address every night at 8, probably on Radio Veritas, the station of the Catholic church. During his Manila news confer: ence, Marcos became visibly irri- tated at repeated questions noting » the opinion of Catholic leaders and USS. officials that he does not enjoy the support of a majority of Filipi- nos. “We're beating a dead horse, talking about whether the people support me or not,” he said. Marcos brushed aside the fires- torm of American criticism, which included a statement by Reagan that the election was so riddled with fraud that the credibility of the results had been thrown into question. “I'm convinced that if there was any fraud at the lower level, this was not authorized by the upper leaders of the (ruling New Society Movement),” he said. He also downplayed Reagan’s criticism of alleged election fraud. “The most that you can say is that he (Reagan) has been wrongly in- formed,” Marcos said. Marcos vowed to investigate fully all cases of election fraud. But he accused the opposition of com- mitting greater fraud than his sup- porters, suggesting that nuns work- ing with a citizen poll-watching group were guilty of illegally snatching ballot boxes, No violent incidents broke out at Mrs. Aquino’s afternoon rally, al- though a small group of radicals not associated with her supporters did demonstrate in front of the U.S. Em- bassy about two blocks away. At the rally site, several support- ers said they planned to go along with Mrs, Aquino’s manifesto for boycotts, “When we arrive at our place, we will convince our neighbors to boy- cott,” said Manuel Sinnung, who said he planned to close his bank account at one of the seven targeted Morning News February 17, 1986 (Continued) \f"

The leaders of the mutiny, for- mer Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, an- nounced Monday that they had set up ao provisional government headed by opposition leader Cora- zon Aquino. But even as Marcos assured Fili- pinos that he remained in power, the scope of the revolt grew. Rebels seized a government television sta- “caretakers” of the provisional gov- ernment. Enrile’s comments came after broadcasts on radio and even some television stations sympathetic to the government said that Enrile and Ramos were in control and that Marcos had fled the country. Denouncing claims that rebel forces were in control, Marcos warned that government troops had orders to use small-arms fire on rebel forces. He warned civilians to stay in their houses, off the streets. “I am directing and ordering that big things like tanks and ar- mored personnel carriers should not be employed as yet,” Marcos Rebels name Aguino to lead provisional government & Communists wait. @ Crowd protects rebels. 111A @ Consul backs rebellion. 1A tion Monday, and a rebel helicopter attacked the presidential palace.

A rebel force led by Col. Mariano | Santiago took over the station after a two-hour battle in which at least four people were wounded. During the fight, rebel soldiers climbed a 150foot transmission tower and fired down at govern- ment soldiers guarding the station, said Glen Alojipan, 21, an opposition supporter. At one point in the assault, Alo- jipan and six other civilians formed a barricade across the road to keep Dallas time), Enrile appeared be- fore about 1,000 soldiers at Camp Crame in suburban Manila and an- nounced that the provisional gov- ernment had taken over. ‘We are declaring the freedom of the people,” Enrile said. Later, he was asked if the Marcos govern- ment had been deposed. “They fled because it crumbled,” he said. “It fragmented, totally frag- mented.” ; He urged all ministers to leave the Marcos Cabinet, asked soldiers to shift their allegiance and re- quested citizens to pay their taxes to the provisional government. Enrile described himself and Ramos as truckloads of soldiers loyal to Mar- cos from passing. The seizure of Channel 4 is con- sidered a significant victory for the rebels since it provides them witha nationwide communications link. Fearful that Marcos forces would try to recapture the station, rebel broadcast appeals for civilians to surround the station to protect it from attack. That tactic worked Sunday after- noon, when tens of thousands of ci- vilians stopped the advance of at least 1,000 armor-supported govern- ment soldiers who were attempting to advance on Camp Crame, the headquarters of the rebel leaders.

Just when the chief justice was about to administer the oath, everything went out, poof.”’ _ Later, what apparently was Mar- cos” acceptance speech was broad- cast on radio. “I promise the power of the pres- idency will be used to free the peo- ple from their own weakness,” he said. -. Mrs: Aquino received the oath: of office at about 10:48 a.m. Tuesday (8:48 p.m. Dallas time) from Su- preme Court Justice Claudio Teehankee after she was pro- claimed president by a rump group of about 60 of the 190-member Na- tional Assembly. Mrs. Aquino called on civil serv- ants to stay in their jobs and to pro- tect all files against destruction. “We became exiles in our own land,’’ she said in her brief inaugu- ral speech. “We Filipinos, who are at home only in freedom, through courage and unity, through the power of the people, we are home again.” The National Assembly, con- trolled by Marcos forces, had nmamed Marcos the winner of the presidential election, an action Aquino supporters said was based on fraudulent election returns. Her inauguration came as fight- ing between forces loyal to Marcos and opposition forces intensified and as diplomatic and military de- fections to the rebel side multi- plied. About a hour before the Aquino ceremony, a spokesman for Ramos announced on the rebel-held Chan- nel 4 television station that a col- uzminm of 20 tanks carrying Marcos loyalists was “neutralized” by an air strike from a rebel helicopter gun- ship. The column was intercepted on a highway north of Manila as it traveled southward, apparently from the Tarlac area. There were no casualties. In the pre-dawn hours Tuesday. soldiers fired om a jeering crowd near Malacanang Palace, as Marcos struggled desperately to remain in reports about Rebel troops maintain a security ring around Manila’s Club Filipino, where opposition leader Corazon Aquino office despite a call by President Reagan that he step down peace- fully. Eight people were wounded in the shooting at the palace, and five were injured while trying to flee the gunfire, hospital officials told The Associated Press. Hundreds of thousands of civil- ians defied a dusk-to-dawn curfew to form human protective shields around the suburban camp of mili- tary rebels and around Channel 4. Witnesses said masses of people at the television station drove back seven armored personnel carriers loaded with loyalist soldiers at mid- night Monday. Later, fighting broke out near the television station shortly before it was to broadcast Mrs. Aquino’s in- auguration ceremony, originally scheduled for 8 a.m. at the private Club, Filipino. in the Quezon ,.City suburb of Manila. A Ramos spokesmen said snipers fired on civilians around the sta- tion from a transmission tower at Channel 9, the private station about 300 yards away that Marcos used af- ter rebels took over the govern- ment channel.

A witness reported a helicopter circling overhead. But Marcos’ 20-year control of the Philippines appeared to be close to collapsing Tuesday, in the wake of crucial military and political de- fections to rebel forces and Presi- Gent Reagan’s declaration that it was “futile” for Marcos to resist the rebellion. Fifteen Philippine Foreign Min- istry officers, including nine am- bassadors, declared supportfor Mrs. Aquino an hour before her inaugu- ration. in addition to the ambassadors, the declaration was signed by four counselors, a consul general, and a ministry legal officer. P Ramos said the First Scout Rangers, an elite army unit had de- fected to his side, as well e First Air Divi- sion based in Zamboanga gin the south. The Philippine Military Acad- emmy, which has 700 cadets, and the Aviation Security Command, rTre- sponsible for airport security, had also joined the rebels, he said_ Members of the airport security unit had been accused of Killing Mrs. Aquino’s husband, Benigne Aquino, on Aug. 21, 1983. when he returned from three years of self \f exile in the United States. His death caused nationwide protests and gal- vanized the splintered opposition behind Mrs. Aquino’s campaign for the presidency. Opposition supporters blocked) key intersections around the city with burning tires, buses, cars and human barricades to discourage an attack by Marcos loyalists on Camp Crame, the rebel stronghold, and on Channel 4. . Rebel leaders said that Marcos could not field any fighter planes because of the defection of air force pilots to the rebels.

        "ocr_text": "Military resistance, ‘people power’ led to fa By Marcia Kunstel Special to The News MANILA, Philippines — Former President Ferdinand Marcos twice ordered loyalist troops to assault the bastion of rebellious soldiers backing a new provisional govern- ment. And twice troops did not do it, according to an opposition leader who said Tuesday that he heard mil- itary radio transmissions of the or- ders. Military resistance, even within the ranks of Marcos loyalists, was an indispensable ingredient in the downfall of the president of the Philippines. The other item in the potent mix was “people power,” or the resist- ance to Marcos among civilians. What resulted was not a coup and not a revolution, but a popular, essentially moderate movement, in which the military and the people complemented and protected each other in a mostly non-violent battle to seize power from Marcos. Ernesto Maceda, a one-time Mar- cos ally and former senator, re ported the circumvented orders to assault Camp Crame, the headquar- ters of rebel troops that peeled off from the Marcos command to sup- _ port opposition figure and new President Corazon Aquino. “I think they were stalling,” Maceda said of the failure to carry out Marcos’ orders. The first order to lob mortar into rebel headquarters cameé at 10:30 a.m. Monday, said Maceda. At 4 a.m. Tuesday a second order was issued to assault the camp and to also take Channel 4, the govern- § ment television station that had fallen to the rebels on Monday. As heard on the radio, Maceda said, the officer on the giving end | of the orders repeatedly asked ifthe | attack had been launched, but received evasive answers. Maceda said. Apparently the troops never got sufficiently positioned to attack either mainstay of the anti- Marcos rebels. Marcos’ failure to regain either the heart of the nation’s military or the airwaves, which had been a vi- tal propaganda tool, was the success of the opposition. Maceda had no explanation of why the government soldiers did not assault the targets as ordered. But soldiers and national police, who are part of the armed services, often expressed reluctance in re- cent days at the prospect of firing upon their fellow Filipinos. One officer of the Philippine’ Constabulary, the national police, expressed shock Monday morning when told that Marcos had aban- doned his policy of “maximum tol. erance” toward demonstrators and authorized his troops to fire upon. them if necessary. “There’s no more maximum re- straint?” asked the major. “Maybe there is no maximum restraint for him. But we are Filipino people. We “They kept saying, ‘We're getting ~ positioned,’ ” or gave other excuses, Filipinos storm the presidential palace in Manila Tuesday night after the departure of Ferdinand Marcos. A group of air force helicopter gunships that had been directed to attack Camp Crame early Monday morning also defied Marcos, Rather than fire their rockets at the fort, where thousands of civilians had gathered, the pilots simply landed inside the camp and joined the op- , position. The people, hundreds of thou- sands of them, arrived at the Camp Crame headquarters and wherever else government soldiers threat- ened to attack, standing in the way of tanks and trucks and M-16s like human shock absorbers, They also worked to convert sol- diers to the opposition. On Tuesday, for example, a group of soldiers from a northern province was sent to Manila. Their first assignment took them to the tail end of a shoot-out between gov- ernment and opposition soldiers over a television transmission tower. - “They were confused about who to side with,” said Frank Belanquit, a local resident who talked with the \"Associated Press They were uncertain who sent them to the site, and didn’t even know from which side their orders had come. 2 “After 30 minutes the people eon- vinced them to go to Camp Crame, Belanquit said. Such impromptu actions pcre common in the drive to oust Mar- cos. In many ways it was an ad hoc campaign. Mrs. Aquino had an nounced that the people must Te sist, but left the form upto the resis: » * ters. af Thousands of people were Vigl - lant, listening to sympathetic radio Stations for reports of locations . where “people power” was needed to stop “enemy” troop movements, or taking the initiative for some preventive tactics, ' _Throughout metropolitan Ma- nila creative barriers were Tai across roads to impede the progress of armored cars and troop trucks trying to reach installations like the television station. Tree trunks and flaming metdl garbage cans blocked traffic, as did hunks of concrete, barbed-wit colls and flat-bed trucks, But it was simply the numbers of bodies that stood, sat or kneeled i prayer in front of hostile troops that proved most effective. & The government soldiers and of . ficers had little stomach for massa-_ cres. And the people seemed to under- stand. “They have guns. We have can- dles,” said Tommy Serrano, a senior | computer programmer for one of the banks owned by a Marcos “crony” boycotted by the Aquino forces. Serrano, 26, said he had heard on the Catholic station Radio Veritas that people were needed “to be a buffer” at an access road to Camp Crame. “I wasn’t going to come. I’m only one,” he said. \"But then J thought, if a lot of ones come together, maybe we can do it.” 5 ’ : + Dallas Morning News - February 26, 1986 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Return of politics to Pakistan may bring with it civil unrest By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to the St. Petersburg Times ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Less than four months after the end of martial law, partisan politics is sweeping across Pakistan, Some fear the political fervor could lead to civil unrest, That fervor is sure to rise by the middle of this month if Benazir Bhutto returns from exile as she has vowed, Benazir is the daughter of former President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown in a 1977 military coup and later hanged, She has vowed to recapture power for the political party her father founded. , Political parties were outlawed under martial law, which ended last Dec. 30, Already, however, some politi- cians are pressing for early parliamentary elections so they can try to oust the pro-American regime crafted by Gen. Mohammed Zia al-Haq, Zia, the military leader who remains Pakistan's presi- dent, has scheduled elections for 1990. Bhutto is expected to take her appeal for immediate elections to mass rallies around the nation, according to Meraj Khalid, a member of the central committee of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) that Bhutto's father found- ed, TEN OTHER PARTIES in a loose coalition with the PPP also are pressing for the chance to place themselves before the voters, but no one political figure is viewed as having the same popular attraction Bhutto is expected to enjoy, at least during her first several months back home. “We foresee millions of people will come out to support her in this campaign,” Khalid said. “We know the present government will not do it (call elections) unless forced by the masses of the country, (unless) the entire people come out and life is fully paralyzed.” The appeal of Benazir Bhutto's party was demonstrat- ed Friday when more than 50,000 people turned out at her father’s grave site to mark the anniversary of his execu- tion, They turned the memorial service into a political rally, chanted his trademark slogan, “Roti, Kapra, Mak- an,” (Bread, Clothes, Shelter) and vowed to fight for full democracy. Plenty of complaints exist to draw out the crowds, from the regime’s pro-Western tilt to what politicians call a feudal system of land ownership. Disenchantment is grow- ing over millions of Afghan refugees Zia has harbored here, and aid he has funneled at U.S. behest to Afghanistan’s anti-communist rebels. Lesser political figures than Bhutto already are attract- ing thousands to political meetings, In Karachi, protests by youths demanding jobs and better education have grown violent. Such pent-up anger has long been present, and even ZIA AL-HAQ BENAZIR BHUTTO partisans like Khalid acknowledge the risk that demon- strations may get out of control and bring on a resumption of martial-law restrictions, The PPP was careful enough, for example, to back off its plan to bring Bhutto back from exile in London for Friday’s anniversary of her father’s execution. Although Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was despised by many as a ruthless leader, many others idolize him to this day as a martyr and hero of the common man. A homecoming coinciding with the date of his death could have been too emotional to discipline. “It is of utmost concern to her not to make people violent, to give these military rulers a chance to have martial law,” Khalid said. The 32-year-old Bhutto, educated at Oxford University in Britain, must prove savvy enough to control competing political interests within her own party, as well as the potentially emotional demands of the masses, Pakistanis from a Peshawar banker to a judge in Lahore expressed fears that Bhutto could sweep chaos across their country. Banker Khalid Tirmizey cited the influence of continu- ing illiteracy and poverty in his country, where only 23 percent of the population can read and the average annual income is about $350 a person. “Anyone who comes along with a readily understand- able political solution, they will follow,” he said. But there also are fears the government may overreact to what is merely the democratic process, “She will be able to parade around the country and oy large, maybe even massive crowds,” said a diplomat ere, “The challenge for her will be to deal with the structure now in place, The challenge for the government will be to sit back and to relax, to remember they have the power and will have for four more years,” he said, Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo, placed at the head of government last year by Zia, has promised Bhutto will be free to politick without fear of jail or house arrest or exile — all of which she has suffered in the last six years — as long as she respects the law. Junejo also has stood firm in his commitment to elections in 1990, but not before, He has support from much of the National Assembly, which came into office just last year through elections Gen. Zia called. Zia prohibited candidates from running by party affiliation, so most parties boycotted and the win- ners primarily were political unknowns, who had the personal cash to run a campaign. Zia began the transition to democracy by circumvent- ing the traditional power centers. Now the assemblymen and Junejo welcome the years till 1990 to build a base strong enough to make them viable opponents of those established party leaders. The PPP is the most popular political party of the moment, but a recent Gallup Poll shows that even it is favored by only 25 percent of the population in Pakistan’s traditional mosaic of interests. No other party drew more support. Another 50 percent support some form of an Islamic religious party, which could work against Bhutto. There exist rare precedents in which Moslems have acceded to political leadership of a woman, but the faith emphasizes a preference that women take a sheltered family role. “We foresee millions of people will come out to support (Benazir Bhutto) in this campaign. We know the present government will not do it (call elections), unless forced by the masses of the country, (unless) the entire people come out and life is fully paralyzed.” — Meraj Khalid, member of the central committee of the Pakistan Peoples Party St, Petersburg Times Mian Tufail Mohammed, leader of the fundamentalist’ Jamaat-e-Islami party, said some Pakistanis will reject Bhutto simply because she is a woman, although his party has not made that a public issue. In private conversations, however, strict Moslems like Tufail question her lifestyle. “IT GOES AGAINST her that she is not married up to now,” said Mohammed Aslam Saleem, the party’s second-in-command, The Jamaat, the most popular of the Islamic parties, has kept its distance from the coalition formed around the. PPP, known as the Movement for Restoration of Democ-’ racy. Jamaat has not called for early elections and has kept- criticism of Zia and the government at a low level, . Tufail said he is convinced that Bhutto will bring “very minor turbulence” to Pakistan and will not attract a large following. If she does build a momentum, however, even the a leaders may find themselves carried up in her wake. “The mullahs may not be for Benazir, but they would have to join in,” said Mohammed Hanif Ramay, a former party theoretician and finance minister who split from the PPP to form his own party. “They know if this government is toppled without them, they would not be in a very good position to face their people,” he said. \f"

Everyone, it seems, has in- ted some radiation. - Mostly tourists and diplomats who found themselves in the East- ern Bloc near the Soviet nuclear ore have sat in the reclining hair for a 35-minute session with “Total Body Counter,” the ma- chine that tells how much radioac- tivity is inside the human body. © But even people who got no closer to the Chernobyl fire than Rome — nearly 1,000 miles away — show measurable amounts of fadioactive iodine and cesium in their bodies. ~ “Normally we wouldn't have any,” said Dr. Giovanni Ingrao, a physicist who has worked since 1978 with the radiation counter at the Energy Research Center in Casatcia, a suburban complex of laboratories 18 miles north of Rome. The center is part of the Italian Commission for Nuclear and Alternative Energy Sources, the state agency that both regu- lates and promotes nuclear ener- e Radiation shows up now, he Said, because people have been inhaling radioactive dust or eating vegetables or milk that was con- taminated after a reactor explosion released the Chernobyl cloud April 26. It is “‘not too dangerous,” he Alt - As Ingrao spoke, a worker from the center sat back in a base- ment cubicle shielded by lead and concrete, with the cylindrical arm Of the counting machine lowered to Within inches of his neck. That is where iodine concentrates, in the thyroid. He had been collecting plant samples to be tested for radioactiv- ity and was having a count taken of himself. ~ “He has the same as anyone else — two to three nanocuries of iodine,” said Ingrao, looking at the électronic graph lines plotted by the counter. - That now is the norm for this area, a place that until Chernobyl had seen no measurable counts of either radioactive iodine or cesium for more than a decade. The nucle- ar test ban rapidly brought down radioactivity from the peak of fall- out in 1964, and there have been only traces since the early 1970s. Since Chernobyl, cesium in Ita- ly is at similar levels to iodine, he said, usually under three nanocu- ries, Much higher readings have been taken from travelers and dip- lomats who were closer to the site of the nuclear disaster, he said, with the highest coming from peo- ple who were in Kiev and Warsaw. They checked out at 10 to 40 times the readings from Italy. Among the highest were results of 40 nanocuries of iodine-131 and 75 nanocuries of cesium-137. As for what that means, it may be compared to the safety limits set by the International Commis- sion on Radiological Protection, It says the maximum annual expo- sure allowed for people who work in the field should be 54,000 nano- curies of iodine-131, but ten times less than that, or 5,400 nanocu- ries, for the general population. The limit for cesium-137 is set at 160,000 nanocuries per year for workers, and 16,000 for the gen- eral population. commission is viewed by some experts as setting unreason- ably liberal standards. They are more than 1,000 times higher than the intake experienced by the average Italian resident and sub- stantially above the intake of peo- ple who were in the the Ukraine at the time of the accident. “They were a little worried,” Ingrao said of the latter group, “but we have told them what the facts are. Yes, they have some radiation, but it is not too danger- ous.”\" While there is no immediately discernible physical response to the radiation, even the low levels could mean trouble in the future through what the physicist called “the statistical effect.” There is a conceivable risk of getting a tumor from any amount of radiation, he said. ‘In this case = increase the risk by just a little ¢2” The machine that measures in- ternal body radiation is surrounded by concentric circles of protection to keep it free from cosmic radia- tion and natural background radia- tion.

When the crystal is struck by gam- ma rays from a radioactive sub- stance deteriorating inside the body, the crystal produces a light pulse that is comparable to the intensity of the gamma ray. The light pulse then is convert- ed to an electric signal that is read and analyzed to learn what sub- stance produced the gamma rays and how much of it is present in the body. It always picks up something, Ingrao said, even if just the ever- present isotope potassium 40 that makes a peak on everybody's chart. “We are never clean of radia- tion,”” he said.

The ambassador said he has no first-hand evidence, but believes dissident elements might have been responsible for some of the unexplained ground fire in the days after the U.S. assault.

One Westerner suggested get- ting Khadafy out of the picture quickly would be as difficult as it was to de-Stalinize the Soviet Union. “A majority of the Libyans are under 30 and they’ve been fully indoctrinated,” he said.

        "ocr_text": "Afghan Fighters Grow Weary By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to The Blade ESHAWAR, Pakistan — Hun- dreds of pounds of munitions bulged under two tents at a border camp of Afghan rebels. They were testimony to the trials borne by the Moslem guerrillas known as Mujahidin (holy warriers) in the seventh year of their fight to destroy the Soviet-backed commu- nist government of Afghanistan. Several weeks earlier a caravan had tried to carry the boxes of armaments to their base inside Af- ghanistan. They had climbed across the border’s 10,000-foot, snowbound mountains, but they were blocked inside by heavy fighting. They had nowhere to go, so they walked their load all the way back out. THE WAR increasingly is taxing the rebels. One development that could change the equation is the delivery of “Stinger” anti-aircraft missiles that the Reagan administration is talking about sending to the rebels, who would hold a weapon to fight against devastating air attacks, to which their most effective response s0 far has been running for cover. It is not that the Afghan rebels are without arms. Near the tents seen at the border camp stood an earth-covered bunker chock-full of heavier weapons, including Chinese- made rockets and crates of land mines. REBELS worked late one night, heaving a new delivery of ammuni- tion, explosives, and rocket-pro- pelled grenades from 10-ton trucks to a new underground hideout. They had spent weeks tunneling the series of five shafts, 90 to 120 feet deep, into the mountainside to secure their munitions against in- tensified bombing by Soviet jets and eli nships. It was one of the few defensive steps the guerrillas can take against border-area air raids that have been punishing them all year. Their weapons are almost useless against air invasions. RESISTANCE fighters inter- viewed at border camps and at their headquarters in Peshawar ex- pressed a weariness. Some are be- ginning to wonder how long they can hold out. “Two years, a maximum of three ‘years, is how long we can continue in this condition,” said Zabet Karim, a commander in one of the seven resistance groups. He husbands weapons and supply depots for thou- sands of Mujahidin passing from Peshawar to battlegrounds in their homeland across the border. He and other resistance figures ® Supply routes periodically are closed. ® Fewer and fewer civilians re- main in the war-torn countryside to extend the rebels’ food and shelter. & Money is scarce for the most basic needs, from boots to tea. “I have a depot full of ammuni- tion, but not enough is moving in- side,” Commander Karim said. “Everybody is asking for money. Every commander is saying, ‘I go long distances. I am dying. But you don’t give us money for transport.” ” Money not only buys mules or pack horses to carry weighty loads of weapons, but essentials that are impossible to find now in long, still- growing stretches of depopulated Only an estimated 7 per cent of Afghanistan's bomb-pocked land — less than half the arabie land — is farmed these days, according te a new report by the Institute of Stra- tegic Studies in Pakistan. Food is scarce and costs more. Fighters report that the relentless air raids even have driven off sup- stocks of dried fruits and nuts, of animals that provided guerrillas fresh meat and yogurt, an infusion of protein. “IF YOU ASK about our inten- tions, that we can answer — we will go on till the last drop of our blood,” Mohammed Es'’hagq said. ““But physi- cally, we are threatened — by fam- ine, by increasing Sovietization” of the countryside. Soviet expansion of the war is not all bad, said Mr. Es’haq, political officer of the Jamiat-i-Islami group — it makes more Afghans feel the enemy has come to occupy their land, thus more people are fighting. Abdul Qadeer Karyab, a leader of the group, said at least the refugee flow has slowed to a trickle now, because the close, easy places al- ready have been abandoned. The resistance now seems better supplied than ever with arms ¢ keep the people fighting. Most are believed to come through covert aid by the CIA, Egypt, and China. Even Commander Karim's pessi- mistic assessment of a three-year outer limit is subject to changing conditions. The day after he lament- ed the total absence of supplies for his Mujahidin, he received a sur- prise shipment of sleeping bags, socks, shoes, and blankets from the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent. They are not enough, but at least these supplies will equip some fighers who have been awaiting pro- visions to re-enter the country and prepare for the government's usua spring offensive.

He spoke on an airplane carrying mostly Italians back home. The first bump of wheels on the Rome land- ing strip brought a grateful burst of applause and cheers. All nine remaining families of Fiat auto company employees were out by Sunday, and executives said expatriate families of Peugot, the French car manufactuer, and from smaller Italian and German compa- nies were planning exits. It was not the April 15 American bombing of Libya that convinced them to pack their bags, although that, the Italian said, was the reason he gave to the Libyan who approves exit visas. “SOMETHING isn’t right,’ the Italian businessman said, drawing on his 10 years of experience here to conclude that there is more trouble inside Libya than the devastation wrought by American bombs. It is a tension, he said, a disturb- ing sense that something serious is brewing behind the facade of unity that Libyan leaders typically raise in times of crisis. The U.S. attack was intended partly to provoke domestic political turmoil, even a coup, American offi- cials have said. That seems a long- shot, but foreign diplomats and oth- er observers of the Libyan power scene do see hints of trouble and confusion: > Big demonstrations, the life- blood of the continuing revolution in Libya, have been strangely absent since the Americans bombed two major cities. ®» Muammar Kaddafi has not ap- peared personally before a popular gathering. pm He has not appearcd before the international press (except for a conference with Soviet journalists). » He and other radical Libyan leaders have backed off initial threats and adopted an uncharacter- istically moderate tone in replying to the devastating U.S. raid. » Governmental figures have made contradictory statements in the aftermath of the attack.

The uncertain military situation all week was an example of the confusion. After the raid, three con- secutive nights were disrupted by black-outs and the firing of anti- aircraft missiles and sometimes ground fire. The Libyans said they were shoot- ing at U.S. aircraft, but planes were not visible and Americans have de- nied making flights. This continued for one night after Colonel Kaddafi had declared the crisis ended, the blackouts over, and life normal. “TI think the CIA n playing sir nerve 2 4 Marcia Kunstel, an Am- erican journalist based in fiome, arrived in Tripoli the night before the U.S. bombing raid, her third visit to Libya. said. He guessed that electronic simulations fooled the Libyans into thinking planes were on the way. ONE EMBASSY was called by the Libyan army four nights after the U.S. attack and told to evacuate within 20 minutes, because Americ- ans were going to bomb their area, a western diplomat reported. There was no evacuation nor any bombing. The state-controlled media boast- ed that at least 20 U.S. aircraft were shot down and several crew killed after crashing. They have not produced an air- plane carcass or an American battle casualty. Twice authorities took busloads of journalists to view the fruits of Libyan air defense, but were unable to locate the crashed plane that they were seeking. One information official said the army must have hauled the wreck away for study. ANOTHER SIGN of confusion is how Libyan leaders have back- tracked from early threats against the West. Americans heard at first that they should expect attacks on their mili- tary installations in the Mediterra- hean area if they bombed Libya. Afterward, Colonel Kaddafi said Libya had decided to respect the requests of friendly governments to let the conflict cool. The attacks were canceled. But two days after his statement, the Libyan news agency, JANA, warned that there would be attacks on the Italian and Belgian embas- sies here, a diplomatic source said. These were Singled out because the Italian embassy houses the rem- nants of Britain's diplomatic delega- tion and the Belgians have the U.S. special interests section, Britain and the United States, the two nations branded as terrorists for the air attack, do not have their own free.

The question of maintaining con- trol over fractious elements may be behind both the lack of massive demonstrating, a staple of the Liby- an political diet, and the fact that Colonel Kaddafi has not appeared before crowds. The only mass gath- ering was the funeral for 20 bomb- ing victims, which drew about 5,000 people, not a big rally by Libyan standards. : Coionel Kaddafi has shown up mostly on television and in the newspapers.

        "ocr_text": "Afghan peace talks hampered by ‘indirect’ diplomacy » By MARCIA KUNSTEL . Special to the St. Petersburg Times GENEVA, Switzerland — For almost ‘four years, the United Nations has been ‘acting as mediator in talks designed to end ’ the civil war in Afghanistan and arrange the - withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country, One of the most striking features of the “Negotiations is that the representatives of ‘Pakistan and Afghanistan don't even look each other in the face, much less talk peace ‘together, ' Last Friday, the negotiations recessed - until July 30 with all sides agreeing that the “indirect” talks are almost over. The ques- - tion of whether they will finish in success or failure is still very much up in the air, “There is still a wide gap,” said U.N. Undersecretary General Diego Cordovez, who has tried to wring an agreement out of the Communist government of Afghanistan and its neighbor, the Moslem, Western-lean- -ing regime in Pakistan, The big issue remaining is the timetable for withdrawal of 118,000 Soviet troops, who have been shoring up the Afghan army in its battle against Moslem rebels with bases in Pakistan, The Pakistanis insist on a withdrawal ‘over three to six months, according to sources close to the talks, while the Afghans want a withdrawal taking considerably lon- ger, apparently closer to two years, On the plus side, this negotiating round marks the first time the two sides have agreed to discuss details of the pullout. The deal, if it can be struck, essentially ‘would call for the Soviets to leave and the Pakistanis to close their border to Afghan rebels, who stock up on arms and provisions in Pakistan so they can continue fighting in their homeland, The more than 3-million Afghan refugees in Pakistan also would be helped to return home, provided they want to go back. The other key provision still in dispute is whether to do all this under auspices of a third-party observer group that would verify whether everyone is living up to the agreement, The Pakistanis want one; the Afghans refuse, “We've covered ground which is important, but a chasm is in front of us,” said one participant, who added he was unable to pre- dict whether the differences ever can be bridged. Cordovez was moderately op- timistic in announcing the tempo- rary adjournment Friday, He said he now sees an attitude that both sides ‘are moving toward one ob- jective” in an atmosphere he talled “very good and very con- structive.” But the Peruvian diplomat said “very great problems” remain. And he added: “‘T feel 1 have to express my disappointment at the slow pace at which we have been moving.” Both governments and Cordovez agreed in March that it was time to finish, one way or another. The negotiations have been bump- ing along since June 1982, They decided this seventh round of talks must be the last one. It began May 5:and was supposed to end May 16, but was extended for a week. Now it has been strung out longer. The strange negotiating style, which the United Nations has employed in only a few extreme cases, has U.N, intermediaries shut- tling from the room of one delegation to the room of the other, suggesting compromises and relaying responses, Iran % Tehran Afghanistan Soviet Union Kabul & China * Islamabad Pakistan Nepal St. Petersburg Times — NELDA BARLOW Moslem rebels battling the Communist Afghan government have bases in Pakistan. The technique was devised in 1949 by Ralph Bunch, who used it to eke out an armistice between Arabs and Israelis during “indirect” or “proximity” talks on the island of Rhodes, He won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, In this case, it is the Pakistanis who refuse face-to-face talks, because they have. refused to recognize the Communist govern- ment of Afghanistan, which took power with the aid of Soviet military intervention in 1979, For four years the two delegations have been coming to the Palais des Nations in Geneva, sitting down separately in the same two rooms on the second floor, and talking in turn to the intermediaries led by Cordovez. Relations are so delicate that one side always arrives one-half hour before the other delegation walks up the marble staircase to its appointed room, One participant remem- bers a “close call,” in which one delegation got confused and both arrived at the same time, An alert U.N, security team saw disaster on the make and quickly rerouted one entou- rage to a different entrance, Confusion is easy to understand, as the delegations take turns coming first and al- ternate rooms every session to make sure nobody gets preferential treatment. Participants in the talks claim the two sides never see each other and never talk directly, even informally on the telephone. “The only place to meet each other is in the men’s room,” said one, and everyone is careful to make sure that doesn’t happen. While the Afghans and Pakistanis are the formal parties to the talks, the Soviet Union and United States — the powers behind the scenes — are kept current. In one of the most important provisions of the agreement already settled, both nations have pledged to act as its “guarantors,” In practical terms, that means the Soviets will keep their military out and the Americans will stop supplying arms to the rebels, One U.N. source close to the talks said the technicalities of the process sometimes overshadow the goal: saving lives and return- ing millions of homeless people to their land, But there is also a broader aim, which he feels epitomizes the most basic work of the United Nations, “We have got to work for a system of international relations based on the non-use of force, It is the final objective of this organization,” he said.

SUCH COMMENTS, amid a flur- + ry of mutual recriminations out of * Moscow and Washington, hardly * sustain the benign “‘spirit of Gene- ‘ ya” that welled up around the _ November meetings of President Reagan and Soviet General Secre- tary Mikhail Gorbachev. The two issued a closing state- ~ ment on Nov. 21 that called on their _ negotiating teams to hasten pro- gress, of which there had been very . little since the talks began in early _ 1985. Six months after the summit, ' there still has been very little. | . At least they do continue talking » about how to shrink the massive _ nuclear arsenals that could reduce _ the world to a wasteland. A FEW obstacles to agreement have been removed, mostly by the Soviets. For example: Mr. Gorbachev had _ Made a ban on nuclear testing a key item in the arms proposal that he i ~ personally laid before the world in January. The Russians have ob- served a test ban since August, “while the Reagan administration ‘has refused to call a hiatus. . The Soviet negotiator interviewed here, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, clarified after repeated questions that the test ban is not a condition for reaching an arms-reduction agreement. “We are not setting requirements for that,” he finally said. “Should an ‘accord be reached to stop testing,” 3 Categories The Geneva talks, formally called the Nuclear and Space Arms talks, are divided into three components: > Space and defense, which includes “Star Wars.” > Strategic weapons, which are primarily long- range arms capable of reaching from the territory of one superpower to the territory of the other, plus missiles on submarines and bombers. > Intermediate-range nu- clear forces (INF), which roughly travel 600 to 3,300 miles and are also called medium-range missiles: he added, “it would, first, stop the nuclear arms spiral and, second, increase trust and make a more conducive situation for reaching other accords.” THE SOVIETS also clarified — partially lifting — what had been interpreted as another condition im- peding progress: that no pacts would be signed unless the United States abandons its strategic defense ini- tiative (SDI), or “Star Wars,” re- search, From the time the two countries decided to resume talks in January, 1985, the Soviets had implied they would enter no agreements in any of the three categories in the talks (see box) unless the United States stopped work on what the Soviets call “space strike weapons,” or SDI. American negotiators got mixed signals on this until February, when Mr. Gorbachev definitively said dur- ing a visit by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D,, Mass.) that an agreement on medium-range missiles was not con- tingent on stopping SDI. AMERICAN negotiators in Gene- va refuse to discuss the talks with the press, but U.S. officials else- where, who have detailed knowl- edge. of developments, say the one faintly promising area for agree- ment satan on the INF, or 1 um-range weapons. Paul Nitze, special adviser t the President on arms negotiations; Con- jectured recently that Soviet ingness to make progress i arms talks anytime soon “maybe . manifested first or perhaps © INF. ” _ Thespace and defense categs ry i and have not budged from that tacl The Americans refuse. Negotiators are believed to most of their time defining and repeating arguments, wi substantive changes in positio: on the table. NEGOTIATIONS on strategic weapons have fared little better. The two sides have talked num ben but remain vastly far apart on pre cisely how to cut back the mighty arsenals that include ICBM’s, launched cruise missiles, and si marine-launched ballistic and c missiles. Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev, at the close of their summit, said these weapons should be cut backby . 50 per cent. Even if the two sides could come close to discovering an acceptable mix of reductions, signing of jan agreement may not be possible The Soviets still say they cannot give up strategic weapons while medium-range and “space stri weapons are alive, So the strategic pact is being “held hostage,” as {he Americans say, to success in | : other two arenas, THE SOVIET leader did offepa grand plan for getting rid of nuclear weapons by the end of century, but that was beyond Max Kanes (left), head of the U.S. negotiating team, and Viktor Karpov (right), leader of the Soviet negotiators, at the start of current talks in Geneva scope of these talks and even would Tequire cooperation by countries that are not party to them. American leaders viewed it as a propaganda ploy, and more perti- nently, Mr. Reagan said he cannot buy a “no-nukes” scenario until a lot of other world conditions change. These range from an equalization of conventional forces to the settle- ment of regional disputes (such as Afghanistan and Angola) to a “dem- onstrated commitment by the Soviet Union to peaceful change.” An agreement on INF or medium- range missiles may be the only thing on the horizon, but that is not around the corner, either. It will take big _ Shifts of positions. THE LATEST US. proposal is to eliminate all Soviet and U.S. medi- um-range missiles by 1990. They would start with a ceiling of 140 missile launchers by the end of 1987. That, however, is how many - launchers the United States is be- lieved to have in place right now, | which means the Americans would not cut out anything in the first round. Toledo Blade - June 8, The Soviets would be required to jettison an estimated 301 of their 441 launchers, with their warheads, of which 310 are believed within range of the European NATO allies and remaining 131 in Soviet Asia. In 1988 half the remaining launchers, 70 of them, would be dismantled, and all the rest would be gone by 1990. THE SOVIETS, however, want to get rid of only the medium-range missiles in Europe, They say they need their Asian weapons to counter the missiles held by China and the U.S, bombs at air bases and sub- marines in the Far Hast, which don’t come under the purview of INF talks. The Americans remain adamant in demanding that the Asian mis- siles must go, because they are mo- bile and easily could be moved to strike European targets. Plus, the Soviets say the British and French must pledge not to in- crease their stocks of medium- range missiles. That is a significant easing of the original Soviet posi- tion, which called for more than 200 French and British medium-range missile launchers to be counted among the U.S. arsenal and subject- ed to INF reduction provisions, ONE MORE area of heated dis: agreement is the Soviets’ insistance that an INF treaty include a US. pledge not to “transfer” its nuclear technology to third countries. That means it would agree not to give nuclear weapons or improve the stocks of other nations. Soviets clearly are aiming this at the American Trident moderniza- tion program with Britain, to which the Reagan administration forceful- ly has repeated its commitment. Despite these and other disagree- ments, neither side so far has ex- pressed a wavering of intention to keep talking. “Tt is not our intention to bang the’ door in anyone's face,” the Soviet negotiator said. The Americans, too, have prom- ised to keep at it — for one day longer than the other side. Marcia Kunstel is an American writ- er based in Rome. 1986 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Italy cracks down on Mafia, but mob’‘s influence linge By MARCIA KUNSTEL Special to the St Petersburg Times PALERMO, Italy — Michele Greco, the reputed “boss of bosses” of the Sicilian Mafia, portrayed himself as a peaceable gen- tleman farmer during his day in court last week, Rabbit-hunting or skeet-shooting is as close as he ever got to violence, said the silver-haired Greco, who wore a navy pin- striped suit and an aura of unrestrained self-righteousness, as he proclaimed inno- cence to charges of complicity in more than 90 homicides, It is the kind of self-portrait that Sicily’s most ruthless Mafiosi used to g@ away with, no questions asked, No longer is that so, The Mafia’s patina of respect and, more important, of invulnerability has been cracked with this trial in which Greco is but one of 475 defendants, In some respects what Italians call the “maxi-trial” has changed the way of life, and certainly the way of politics, on this semi-au- tonomous island province off the southern tip of Italy. The indictment, 40 volumes of finan- cial documentation and eyewitness testimony from admitted crooks and killers turned state's evidence, struck at what investigating magistrate Giovanni Falcone calls “the head of the serpent” that has coiled through so much of Sicilian life. The indictment named not only common rogues, but leaders including the 12 heads of families believed to have formed the “com- mission” that is the top policy council of the Mafia, also known as the Cosa Nostra, The “maxi-trial” has not dried up all the seemingly infinite channels of Mafia influ- ence and power. And some Sicilians think this trial is scarcely a beginning, “The super-trial, it isn’t serious,” said a young policeman on duty at the Palermo airport. “It's buffoonery,” said his colleague, Skepticism is not hard to understand among people who have spent lifetimes amidst the fear and periodic bloodbaths gen- erated by the Mafia. This will blow over, they say, and the Mafiosi will retrench, But some things are changing, and re- trenchment will not be so easy. One of the most visible develop- ments is in politics, In campaigning for the June 22 region- al assembly elec- tions, all the parties are talking anti-Ma- fia, It used to. be only the commu- nists who made or: = crime a po itical issue, ha- Gree ranguing that the Cosa Nostra could not exist without a politi- cal support system proffered by officials and administrators, There are chariges, too, inside the Chris- tian Democratic party here, the center-right party that normally wins a plurality of votes in both the region and the country, Some Sicilian party leaders have been linked both openty and less publicly to the Mafia. There was the arrest, for example, of former Palermo Mayor Vito Ciancimino, Greco said in court last week that his brother Salvatore, who was indicted but re- mains at large, was involved in Christian Democratic politics for years, The party has moved to clean up its image, For the June 22 elections, local lead- ers excluded from the Christian Democrats’ list of candidates 12 of the 38 incumbents, Party leaders pushing for the “renewal” admit they are taking a political risk. “If we lose, the renewal loses, If we win, all the (party) wins,” said Palermo Mayor Orlando Cascio, Calogero Mannino, the regional party secretary, had a big hand in forcing change. He uncovered a long-forgotten party rule that no one can run again after serving four terms, and he battled all the way up to the national party leadership to enforce it. A major target, according to sources here, was Salvatore Grillo, the vice president of the assembly from Trapani, who caused a sensation by going to the funeral last January of an accused Mafioso who was killed before the trial, Although Grillo was forced off the ballot by the four-term rule, his political allies nominated his 23-year-old son in his place, The fact that attending a Mafia funeral raised a public stir — it even was reported in the local press — is another sign of change. Indeed, simply talking openly about the Mafia.is something that was not done here a few years ago, residents say. The sight of the state finally cracking down, in a big way, has influenced attitudes of Sicilians who would not use the word Mafia to strangers, And the crackdown is very much in sight, Almost 2,000 more state policemen have been brought here for the trial, which began in February and is expected to last at least a year, It takes place in a concrete fortress called “the bunker hall,” that was built alongside the Ucciardone prison so authorities needn't risk transporting the accused to trial, The bunker is guarded by dozens of police with automatic weapons, some in armored person- nel carriers, Judges and key figures arrive to the scream of sirens, accompanied by plain- clothes officers who sometimes travel with pistols held up to the car window, ready to fend off attack, They hardly escape public notice, The trial and police presence does not mean Mafia activity has stopped. A respected construction executive was gunned down in Palermo last month in a killing police said bore “'the Mafia stamp.” Investigators speculated he had refused to pay the “pizzo” or protection money that is more important than ever to the Mafia today, now that the state has curtailed its work, And there are signs of lingering fears, such as restaurants that keep their doors locked even during peak dining hours, open- ing up for guests only after scanning the street outside for trouble, But a lot of people have been taken off the streets, people like Michele Greco, who used to wield a great deal of power here, Greco was first linked to the Mafia in a 1982 investigation of organized crime that was a precurser to this trial, Until then, he was treated like the gentleman farmer he professed to be in court last week. “This guy, until 1981, was walking the halls of the regional assembly lobbying for | farming subsidies, And getting them,” said one source familiar with the investigations, “He was a respectable figure,” he added, “in terms of a society that walks around with a blindfold on.” Now, he suggested, the blindfold is begin- ning to come off.

As vice-mayor in the Commu- nist administration of Lampedusa, Nicolini was among islanders who had demanded earlier that the two dozen Americans be evicted from the station, which was the de- clared target of Col. Moammar Gadhafi’s two Scud missiles that churned up the Mediterranean Sea a mile or so short of solid ground on April 15. . Gadhafi had attacked in retali- ation for the U.S. bombing raid on Libya a day earlier, claiming the Coast Guard station was a sophis- ticated NATO spying center. Then at the end of May, the Liby- an news agency JANA published a threat that Libya will destroy Lampedusa if the base remains. Times =e 9 a + = The hostilities have scared fish- ermen from some of their favorite southerly waters. And they may wreck the upcoming tourist sea- son, the economic mooring of this seven-square-mile dot in the sea that is too arid to farm and too small and far from its mainland to industrialize. The quick assignment of Italian troops, including paratroopers, didn’t calm all the fears. “It appears to people that the Libyan threats are not made against Italy, but against. the American base,’’ said Father Giu- seppe Policardi, the Catholic priest for Lampedusa’s 4,500 in- habitants. LO GRAZIE “The general population be- lieves it would be more secure (if the Americans left). It’s the gen- eral opinion,” he said. But the Americans are not leav- ing, and Italy’s center-left national government seems happy to keep The Italian and U.S. govern- ments devised a clever plan to calm the rattled Lampedusans as well as send a message of their own back to Gadhafi, without in- terfering with operations at the Coast Guard station, which trans- mits radio navigation beacons known as Loran (LOng RAnge Navigation). Lt. Col. Alessio Pucciano, com- St. Petersburg Times An American Coast Guardsman, teft, pulls duty at the U.S. station at Lampedusa. Map above shows the Italian island. jeopardize relations with the coun- try that has been his best Western friend. Pucciano now is in charge of external defense at the Loran sta- tion, is the conduit for rapport between the Americans and Ital- ian government, and verifies that the st Guard is doing what it is supposed to do under terms of the 1972 agreement that brought it here. It is one of four Loran stations im the Mediterranean, which send out constant electronic signals by which ships and planes can fix their exact position. It was moved to Lampedusa after Gadhafi kicked it out of Libya. The addition of an Italian com- mander probably should have hap- pened long ago, according to Lt. Ernest Del Bueno, the Coast Guard commander. “It brings us in line with the rest of the NATO bases in Italy,” said Del Bueno, who insists his men and women do nothing more than the public service of trans- mitting signals. The Loran station is a NATO base by virtue of financing, but not in chain of cormmand, he explained. *“I don’t want to burst anyone’s bubble, but for us things haven’t Please see ISLAND 16-A changed at all,’”” he added, in re- sponse to implications in the Italian press that base operations have been taken over. The local residents seem mol- lified, for the moment at least, with the change. Even Lampedusans who say they would feel safer with- out the Americans usually add they feel no personal animosity, and say they quite a bit like the friendly Del Bueno. The addition of what amounts to an Italian overseer even satis- fies the local Communist Party, which has objected to U.S. military installations elsewhere in Italy. “The Italian government has demonstrated effectively that this base has purposes that cannot be used for supporting military at- tacks by the United States,’’ said Nicolini. Less-political islanders are more worried about what will hap- pen here in July and August, the height of the tourist season that normally brings as many as 20,000 people, mostly Italians, for leisure- ly vacations at this quiet outpost. Giandamiano Lombardo, whose family runs a hotel, said the island usually is fully booked by June for the following 2¥2 months. Last week reservations stood at about 50 percent, although they were beginning to pick up. mander of the 135th Radar Squad- ron of the Italian Air Force here, this month was named the first Italian commander of the Loran station. He is quick to admit he is not the Americans’ new boss. “My responsibility is assurning command of the installation, not of cent interview. ““The significance is, that whoever launches missiles against the Loran Station in Lam- pedusa launches missiles not against the United States, but against Italian territory.”’ Pucciano’s appointment showed that Gadhafi did not cow Italy into dumping thé Americans, and was a warning that further attacks will ernment to rebate taxes here and order special air and ship fares to entice tourists back. Tourism is not only an affair for the families that run restaurants or simple, white-washed hotels in Lampedusa, but is as porous as the brown sponges that divers pull from the sea bottom for souvenir shops. “‘When the fishermen catch a fish, they sell it to buy a brick and build a house,”’ he said, claiming most fishermen have at least two housés, one to rent out in high season. _ All of them will suffer, he said, if Gadhafi’s menacing actions keep the tourists away.

In that time her sister never left their apartment except to get food, She didn't even go to modeling assignments, “She was afraid I guess, Paris is a big city,” Donna Broome said.

Real estate flopped, and boredom in South Carolina dragged on. Donna Broom offered another airplane ticket, this time to be with her in the fashion center of Milan, provided Terry came with $1,000 in her pocket, Terry Broome got it, working in a drugstore. But her re-entry to Europe in April 1984 snagged immedi- ately when a subway thief grabbed her nest egg. She had been en route to the bank on her second day in Mi- lan. “With her money stolen, it was the beginning of the end,” Donna Broome said. Her marginal efforts at modeling did get Terry Broome hooked into a fast, moneyed crowd in Milan, of which her sister at least skirted the edges.

        "ocr_text": "Rescue try cost lives in hijacking, official says By MARCIA KUNSTEL to the St. Times VALLETTA, Malta An Egyptian rescue team caused the deaths of 56 hostages aboard a hijacked plane in Malta last fall, a government investigator has con- cluded. According to the investiga- tor, the deaths were caused by gunfire and explosives the Egyp- tians planted as a backup measure to kill the hijackers. In courtroom testimony, the chief investigator also questioned the conduct of several Egypt Air sky marshals. They hid their weap- ons to avoid detection, he said, and helped the hijackers by binding and bringing forward five Americans and Israelis who then were shot. Conflagration engulfed the Boeing 737 that windy November night only after the Egyptian com- mandos tried to shoot the hijack- ers, firing randomly at people in the Egypt Air plane and those clambering down to the tarmac, according to the testimony of Dr. Anthony Abela Medici, a forensic expert who heads the police crime laboratory. Abela Medici, the Maltese gov- ernment’s chief investigator into events surrounding the Nov. 23-24 hijacking, said he was uncertain The findings were revealed duringa little-known court proceeding that has been going on behind the thick stone walls of a 16th-century seaside fortress since January. whether the commandos intention- ally or mistakenly detonated the explosives they had planted inside the plane’s cargo hold. But he testified the leader of the commandos revealed that the charge was placed there as a back- stop, should Egyptian sharpshoot- ers fail in their mission to pick off the hijackers, according to an unof- ficial, detailed report of court pro- dings. oO The shooting and explosion re- sulted in the deaths of 56 passen- gers and crew and to one hijacker, while the hijackers had killed two le, Abela Medici concluded. He said the explosives never were intended simply to blast an opening through which comman- dos could enter the plane. That has been the explanation of the Egyptian government, which has maintained that a deadly inferno swept the aircraft when the hijackers realized they were under assault and hurled three phosphorous hand grenades inside the Boeing 737 plane. Abela Medici said no grenades went off inside the aircraft. “There was one big explosion in the plane by the Egyptian com- mandos. It was not meant to open the door of the plane because they had instructions to explode the plane if the firing did not kill the hijackers, even if they have to kill everyone,”’ he told the court. An Egyptian government spokesman, contacted in Cairo by telephone, was asked for an official response to the findings. ‘This is not true,” he said after contacting his Defense Ministry. “There was no instruction to the commandos to explode the plane.” Abela Medici’s findings were revealed during a little-known court proceeding that has been going on behind the thick stone walls of a 16th-century seaside fortress here since January. Maltese officials refused to be quoted regarding the hearing, called a compilation of evidence. The court has prohibited local news accounts of the hearing, which nonetheless has been open » to the press and other interested observers. The substance of the unofficial, . detailed record of hearing testimo- ny, has been confirmed by persons who heard it. After this proceeding a magis- trate will decide whether to indict or to set free the lone survivor believed to’ have been one of the three hijackers. One hijacker was killed during the storming of the plane and an- . other died in a shoot-out in the air with the only sky marshal who tried to stop the hijacking. Four - marshals were on board. Witnesses and evidence includ- ing fingerprints identified the young Arab who calls himself Hijacking from 18-A Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq, 22, as the surviving hijacker. More than that, witnesses identified him as the gunman who cooly ordered a procession of five passengers — three Americans and two Israelis — up to the front of the plane to be taken outside, shot at point-blank range and tossed down the steps to the pave- ment. Rezaq, who says he is a Pales- tinian from Lebanon, has pleaded innocent to charges that he killed the two women, an Israeli and an American. Egypt Air flight 648 had taken off from Athens about 9 p.m. Nov. 23, and was hijacked on the way to oO. Three of the Egypt Air sky marshals, two posing as passen- gers and one as a crew member, did nothing to stop the crime, ac- cording to testimony. One hid his identity card with his gun in a bag under the seat, and another wrapped his weapon in a brown jersey and pushed it under another seat when he saw the hi- jackers searching passengers, ac- cording to the account of testimo- ny. Mustafal Methal is the only marshal who pulled his gun, blast- ing the hijacker believed to be the leader and killing him some 20 minutes into the hijacking. Methal sustained multiple wounds from retaliatory shots, and he was shot again after the plane landed, while he was unconscious. Somehow, he survived. “There were only three hijack- ers, but they were helped, too much, by the security guards,”’ said Abela Medici. Two sky marshals were pressed into service by the hijack- ers, one of them helping to search passengers. Also, after one Israeli woman was taken out to the top of the exit stairway and shot, the second Is- raeli refused to step forward when called. The two marshals dragged her out, according to Abela Medici. “She was trying to catch her hands in the chair, so she strug- gled,”’ said a Egyptian passenger Mohammed el-Wakeel, who re- turned to Malta to give testimony. “They pulled her out and at this point I cannot say what hap- pened,” he said. “‘I did not want to look, but she was crying and say- ing, ‘Please, please,” and pleading with the accused (hijacker.)’’ Israeli Nitzan Mendersson was shot in the head and thrown from the plane. She later died. en the two sky marshals, Abela Medici reported, carried out the order to gather up the three American passengers, tie their hands ind them, and seat them in the front. Two Americans survived the subsequent shootings, but Scarlett Marie Rogencamp died immedi- . ately. Of the four marshals, Methal and one of the cooperating agents survived. The controversial commando mission, which eventually made this hijacking the bloodiest on record, was authorized by Maltese officials who said they were prom- ised a quick operation with minimal loss of life. The rescue squad arrived from Cairo in the early morning of Nov. 24. With them were three U.S. military advisers, who were de- scribed officially as liaisons, not participants in the assault or its planning. ° It eg at 8 p.m., when two commandos crawled into the cargo hold and planted the explosives, just two inches below the cabin floor. Then at least three others burst through the emergency doors and a window, and began shooting, according to Abela Medi- ci’s account. . The hijacker identified as Re- zaq started to flee down the pas- senger stairway, but encountered Egyptian raiders running his way. He threw a hand grenade at the foot of the stairs, blasting the legs off the lead commando, who also was the group commander. Rezaq was shot by other com- mandos, and also was wounded by shrapnel from the explosion inside the plane, which Abela Medici be- lieves went off just after Rezaq hurled his grenade. The hijackers’ two other grenades were found in the plane, unexploded. he commander who lost his legs told the investigator that if the shooting attack did not succeed, the Egyptian team had plans to explode the plane. Abela Medici theorized that the Egyptian at the detonator, be- hind the plane’s tire, may have been startled into setting off the explosion by the grenade the hi- jacker threw. Or, he surmised, “‘The one at the detonator would have realized that the plan did not succeed be- cause he saw his own colleagues, the Egyptians, being blown up.”’ St. Petersburg Times - July 2, 1986 (Also Dallas Morning News) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Yugoslavia cracking down on Arab terrorists By MARCIA KUNSTEL tothe &t. Timea BELGRADE, Yugoslavia — Authori- ties have tightened their control over Arab residents of Yugoslavia after police learned that terrorists who carried out some of last year’s worst attacks apparently used the country as a staging area, Nothing was announced, and the aver- age Yugoslav probably has no knowledge of any change in the friendly relationship between his government and the estimated 12,000 to 15,000 Arabs who are here as students or for business or for less defin- able reasons, But the government clearly has in- creased internal surveillance and passport controls, according to diplomats and to foreigners subjected to the new restric- tions, The tightening comes after a series of terrorist suspects were found to have visit- ed or passed freely through Yugoslavia. They include: Y Four terrorists who opened fire in the Rome airport last December, killing 18 people and injuring more than 100, flew from Lebanon to Damascus to Belgrade, then went by train from Belgrade into Italy, according to investigating Italian Magis- trate Domenico Sica, “We have noticed there is a certain pattern — movement through Yugosla- via,” Sica told an interviewer. V Palestinian Omar Ali Rezaq flew from Belgrade to Athens last November, according to a Greek travel agent who reported changing his ticket. Then he caught the Egypt Air flight that he is accused of hijacking to Malta with two accomplices who were among the 60 killed during the hijacking and rescue attempt. V Mohammad Abul Abbas was allowed to fly from Rome to Yugoslavia and then out of Belgrade after the Achille Lauro hijacking last October. Italian and Yugoslav ‘authorities refused American requests to hold him as the mastermind of the opera- tion, He later was charged in Italy and convicted in absentia to a life sentence for the hijacking, On arrival in Yugoslavia, Abbas told the Reuter news agency he was making plans to free his captured comrades in Italy. V In December, police in Verona, Italy arrested Omar Saadat Salem Abdel Fatah with an arms cache including 44 pounds of explosives, timers, a remote-control deto- nator and two Polish-made machine guns. They said he went to Belgrade in October, apparently to meet with Abul Abbas, then traveled around and returned to Italy in late November. Police quoted in Italian newspapers said wiretaps and surveillance led to suspicions he was plotting to spring the Achille Lauro terrorists from prison. Y Palestinian teen-ager Itab Givara traveled from Damascus to Belgrade be- fore flying to Rome in September where he bombed the British Airways office, He was convicted of the attack in which one woman died and 20 people were wounded, V Mohammad el Mansouri, said to be a member of the Lebanese Armed Revolu- tionary Factions, was arrested in posses- sion of 17 pounds of plastic explosives in August 1984 in Trieste, Italy as he got off a train arriving from Yugoslavia, He later was indicted in the February 1984 killing in Rome of Leamon Hunt, the American di- rector of the Multi-National Force and Observers, the Sinai peacekeeping unit. Yugoslavia’s Communist, nonaligned government has been under increasing pressure, in large measure from the United States, to do something to stop terrorist transits through this pivot point between the Middle East and targets in Western Europe.

It is a delicate problem i Yugoslavia, whose leaders have condemned interna- tional acts of terrorism, but also are among the strongest supporters of the Palestinian cause as a “national liberation movement,” Yugoslavia has given full diplomatic recognition to the Palestine Liberation Or- ganization (PLO), Further, it provides mili tary training for the PLO, according to reliable Western sources, It also has vital trade relations with both Libya and Iraq, which supply it oil on a highly favorable barter basis. Politically and economically, Yugoslav leaders have reason to step cautiously and quietly in any hunt for terrorist suspects, Diplomats say they have seen no evi- dence that the Yugoslav government has abetted terrorist activities, The pressure has been to gain better control over the Arab population here, to identify elements that apparently have abused policies of openness and easy access, One Western diplomat speculated ter- rorists transit Yugoslavia rather like crimi- nals launder drug money. “Ina sense, it masks them some way,” he said, “If you're coming from a European country, even East European, you are less suspect,” Another said he believes terrorists use the country simply because it is close to the places they want to go and has easy border crossings, Yugoslav officials refused to discuss either the pattern of terrorists transiting their country or any measures they may have taken to stop it, It may not be highly touted here, but the changes have been felt by the young, dark-haired students who form noticeable clusters in the sprawl of tables at the Hotel Moscova’s popular sidewalk cafe, Foreign students now at all times must maintain a passport valid for a full year. The restriction will weed out students not in good graces with their own government and also persons with false or stolen pass- ports, who cannot get them renewed or replaced easily. More stringent security also is felt at the Belgrade airport, where on a recent afternoon more Arabs than Slavs awaited international flights, One foreign resident told of friends denied permission to board because they did not have visas for the destination country, which he said is a new requirement this year. He also has had to show visas before getting on a plane, Airport weapons checks are among the strictest in the world, with all bags of arriving travelers X-rayed at customs, and all baggage of those departing X-rayed before the passenger gets a boarding pass. Authorities also are said to have stepped up surveillance of Arab residents, including through the use of informants — foreigners who get in trouble, then are given the choice of watching their neigh- bors or leaving the country. The measures adopted so far are re- ported to have produced results, Robert Oakley, director of the U.S, State Department's office for counterter- rorism, said at a seminar in Washington, D.C. this month that Yugoslavia is among several countries that recently have de- terred or pre-empted terrorist acts, St. Petersburg Times July 23, 1986 (Also Dallas Morning News) \f"

Rabbis dispense justice in the same municipal courthouse where civil judges sit, public slaughter- houses have kosher sections, anda Jewish businessman is the elected city councilman ina 10,000-person district where only 600 Jews live. “There are absolutely no prob- lems. We exercise all our tradi- tions,’” said Boris Toledano, the councilman and Jewish communi- ty leader- “We have absolute confidence in the king.”” The climate in which King Hiassan II, a leading Arab figure, can send his son to a Yom Kippur ceremony and confer national medals on Jewish citizens has been fostered by nearly 2,000 years of mostly peaceful Arab- Jewish coexistence in Morocco. “Jt is a climate that helps to explain how Hassan could venture to play host to _ Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres for two days of Middle East talks last month, causing mew breaches in the Arab world, but not one known display of discontent in Morocco. A tradition Hassan has carried on the tradi- tion of his sultan ancestors, who rotected the Moroccan Jewish minority and also made use of its talents, often selecting Jews to be among their advisers. Early feelers for the Peres visit, for example, reportedly were ex- tended by David Amar, the elected head of Moroccan Jews and a business associate of the king. Wassan’s relationship with Amar has been well-known and some- what controversial here. Amar and the king bought the conglomerate Omnium Nord Afri- cain from a French concern about six years ago, according to very reliable sources in the Jewish community and in diplomatic cir- cles here. The firm grossed $747 million in 1985 from 72 subsidiary companies in fields from shipping to agriculture to finance. Ali Bennis, an ONA spokesman, confirmed that the king ‘is a shareholder’’ in the company, but said his exact holding is secret. Hassan’s cousin, Prince Moulay Ali, is listed in the national business directory as president of Omnium Nord Africain (OQNA). Amar, secretary general of the Council of Jewish Communities of Morocco, until recently was ONA administrator, the equivalent of TE Tart maladie About a month ago Amar stepped down and sold out his shares, at the king’s request, leaving Hassan holding 78 percent of ONA, according to a Moroccan Jew with close knowledge of financial activities here. He said that Amar called Jewish leaders together at the time to stem rumors, telling them that the king asked him to cede his share in the company, and he did. Amar’s relations with the king are Significant for the 9,000 Jews still living in Morocco, for Hassan has made clear his interest in the community leadership. “Re-elect Mr. Amar’ Amiar’s initial selection as secre- tary general of the national Jewish council ‘‘was a bit forced,’’ said one participant in the delibera- tions, describing ‘‘pressures”’ that he would not further define. At the council’s annual election meet- ings, said another knowledgeable figure, King Hassan always has sent an envoy who makes it known that “‘the king would be very pleased if Mr. Amar is re-elected.”’ Hassan usually has employed his power in considerably more be- nign ways in relation to the Jewish population, which in turn has supported him openly. Synagogues operate freely, rab- binical studies are pursued, and Jewish shopkeepers display signs in Hebrew, Arabic and French. The traditional Jewish quarter is hard to distinguish from _ the marrow alleys and tiny shops in older Arab sections of town.

But that trade route may be in trouble. Mozambican security offi- cials have reported that South Af- rica was airlifting military supplies to rebels in Mozambique to disrupt the Beira route, the official Mozam- bique news agency AIM reported Friday. The improvement of the Beira is a long-term, expensive project, though work on upgrading already has begun and will begin to in- crease the handling capacity of both port and railroad by the end of this year.

The Americans were astonished, they said, because they had made a deal with the Foreign Ministry: No speeches that day. In the absence of an apology, the Reagan administration halted all new U.S. Aid for International De- velopment money. That means $13.5 million budgeted for this year won’t come to Zimbabwe, although programs worth $7 million will be carried out because the contracts already had been signed, said Alli- son Herrick, the AID director here.

Internally, Syria’s economy has suffered several devastating years with inflation ranging toward 100 ercent annually, imports more than double exports, and a billion- dollar-a-year black market, ac- cording to the 1988 economic sur- vey by the American Embassy in Damascus. Yet Minister of Economics Mo- hammad Imadi was optimistic in an interview that Syria is turning its economy around. The World Bank has agreed to restructure Syria’s debt, on which the country is $130 million in arrears, and by early next year Syria should be a net exporter of oil, he said. But, Imadi admitted, the big- gest drain on the budget — defense — still stands at more than 50 percent of spending. “We have to build a defense system able to cope with the Israe- lis in the south,” he said.

Glover EDITOR-IN.CHIEF COX NEWSPAPERS Stolen Childhood, a series of articles on child labor, is the first comprehensive look by a team of American journalists at this acute global problem. To get their story, Cox reporters traveled 65,000 miles, making two full trips around the world. In nine months they interviewed more than 200 people in 11 countries on five continents. Their first report appears today in the Dayton Daily News and Joumal Heraid The series continues for the next five days. The reporters are Joseph Albright, the Rome-based chief foreign correspondent of Cox Newspapers, and special corre- spondent Marcia Kunstel, his wife. Rick McKay, illustrations editor for the Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau, accom- panied them on many of their travels. Almost everywhere the team went, dip- lomats, local government officials and so- cial workers said they could not see — let alone photograph — young children doing potentially harmful work. The reason: Fac- tory owners, brothel operators and others who employed children knew that what they were doing was illegal. Nevertheless, using techniques learned on the police beat, Albright and Kunstel got the story — from the factories of Mo- rocco to the back alleys of Bangkok. Mc- Kay got the photographs.

Macy's department stores, for instance, buy hand-made rugs from the Moroccan manufactur- er Mocary SA, selling them for $100 a yard and up. A new stack of thick, earth-toned woolen carpets had just arrived at Macy's in New York City last month. Mocary says it also sells rugs to Bloomingdale's and other retailers in Europe and the United States. Mocary is successful enough that its mid- level executives drive Mercedes Benz sedans. Hiyat, 11, @ fine-boned girl who is small for her age, makes rugs for Mocary in the capital city of Rabat and doesn't get to go to school. Perched on a low wooden bench in front of a loom, cutting knife at her side, Hiyat is an autom- aton with whirring hands. Her days are an end- less blur of movements — loop, wrap, pull and slice — repeated over and over In mind-numbing monotony. SEE SHAME/10 \f Shame CONTINUED FROM/14 Forty years ago, carpet knotting was a handicraft that little Moroccan girls learned at home from their mothers. Now it is big busi- ness and little girls as young as 4 work in factories here. Hiyat knots rugs six days a week with 200 weavers In a concrete box of a factory. It was built five years ago when her company was broadening its foreign markets with the aid of loans from a government development bank. Hiyat would have to tie one strand of wool- en pile onto the loom every 2.43 seconds to keep up with what her supervisor says is the factory's pace of knotting. Because she is learning, she is a little slower. Mocary supervisors wouldn’t say how much, if anything, Hiyat earns. Throughout the carpet industry, apprentices commonly re- main unpaid while learning. She earns at most 15 cents an hour, judging from government figures on rug workers’ piecework rates. The monotony tears on her. “I wanted to Stay in school,” she said, “not work here.” Hundreds of millions Many governments acknowledge privately that children are being exploited, but don't know what to do about it, according to Dr. M.A. El Batawi, chief of the World Health Organization's office of occupational health in Geneva. Their dilemma, as he described it at an in- ternational conference two years ago, is: “If you say, ‘Let’s ban child labor,’ what are you going to do with the millions of kids? There are not enough schools to put them in.” What they do, Batawi says, is “close their eyes to it, and the situation goes on with chil- dren being maimed and dying.” In 1979, the United Nations’ International Labor Organization estimated that 56 million children between 11 and 15 served in the world’s work force. Last year, the ILO raised that estimate to 88 million. The ILO figure doesn’t include many forms of children’s work, such as piecework in the home or street peddling. Nor does it count any ' children under 11. If “informal” child labor were counted, “the estimate would run into the hundreds of millions,” a UNICEF staff pa- perreported last year, Sweatshop tide Little wonder. Since 1950, the world’s pool of potential child workers has nearly doubled asThird World population has soared until now there are 1.1 billion children between 5 arid 14 years, ‘Cheap health techniques, including mass vaccinations and oral rehydration for diar- rhea, are keeping multitudes alive who would have died in their first year a generation ago. New schools are not being built fast enough to ahead of the tide of 15 million extra -age children every year. And for what sort of life are these millions gest that children who take on factory, con- struction and other heavy jobs grow more slowly, suffer from work-related diseases and never learn to read. “They tend to be disadvantaged throughout their lives,” said Assefa Bequele, the ILO's chief specialist on child labor in Geneva. Disadvantages come in gradations, of course. Four out of five children work in fields, not cities. Ultimately, a boy who hoes 12 hours a day will be better off if he’s working his fa- ther’s plot, which he may later inherit, than if he’s working a landlord’s plantation. Defining exploitation Some child workers go to school, some don't. A girl who sells cigarettes on the street after school gets a far better start on life than a girl who runs a sewing machine and never goes to school. Exploitation needs a narrower definition than merely children working. To Britain's Anti-Slavery Society, exploitation involves children working under conditions which are harmful to their maturing. To Francis Blan- chard, director-general of the ILO, it’s “the denial to children of their right to play, to learn, to enjoy a normal childhood,” Definitions such as these fit in countries where children's toughest challenge is getting into college. They don't work, however, in Third World countries where a Western-style childhood is a luxury for a tiny elite. A more tangible definition — one which contains less Western cultural bias — comes from the Geneva-based advocacy group De- fense for Children International. It defines child exploitation this way: WeExtraction of excessive profits from a child's labor; Using child labor in a way that could in- flict physical or mental suffering or damage; Denying a child its liberty or access to its A Moroccan carpet, pro- duced by Mocary SA using child labor, is sold in Macy's for $499.

How does the hand-made carpet industry in Morocco measure up against that standard? King Hassan II's government says it has all but eliminated child labor in carpet making over the last two decades. “There are very rarely girls less than 12 years old,” Fouad Lahlou, secretary general of Morocco's Ministry of Handicrafts and Social Affairs, said in an interview. “Very rarely.” During 1985 and 1986 there was nota single prosecution in the carpet industry under Mo- rocco’s law against hiring children under 12, Lahlou said. To check whether conditions had really changed, Cox journalists visited 14 Moroccan carpet factories in five Moroccan cities, in most cases without making any advance arrangements. Eleven of the 14 welcomed the visitors and arranged tours. In all 11 factories, children who looked unmistakably under the age of 12 were found working on looms. Grimness common Roughly 350 rug-knotters under 12 were counted, out of an estimated 2,500 total of girls and young women found working in those factories. For Yebbous, labor inspectors are no deter- rent against hiring his 7-year-olds. Asked if inspectors ever interfered with his use of children, Yebbous said, “No, not at all. They don't try to force their way in here.” The conditions in all the factories, large and small, were similar: areas too dimly lighted to work without strain, fat wool fuzz balls skit- tering across the floors, the dank odor of wool and dye. In some, light shafts breaking through a window defined the haze of dust that the young workers breathed. Dirtiest of all was the Makina rug factory in Fez, a former ammunition plant where about ®@ Marrakech ALGERIA MAURITANIA ee Population: 24 million — 99 percent Arab-speaking Moslems. 60-year life ex- pectancy (75 years in U.S.).

Gobs of oatmeal-colored wool dust clung to whitewashed pillars. Reporters found their nasal passages itching 10 minutes into their visit. One Makina worker, Issiya, was only 4 years old, said Hassaniya, her loom boss. So intent was Issiya on the flower pattern she -was knotting that she never looked up at visi- tors who stopped to talk with Hassaniya a foot away. No Moroccan study has ever been published on whether wool dust or low light might have health effects on young rug makers. Assistant Professor Aicha Belarbi of Mohammad V Uni- versity in Rabat, an authority on child devel- opment, said it is unlikely the government would grant permission for such research. Intense effort At all the plants girls sat on low wooden benches, dwarfed in the narrow channel be- tween their own seven-foot-high loom and the one behind their backs. In the more intense plants, all the girls acted, like little Issiya, as if they were afraid to look up from the loom. Their fingers sped in and, out of the strings and their eyes were locked on the yarn they tied and clipped. At Mohammad Talbi’s plant in Fez, the 10. under-age children and 80 teenagers and.. young women workers appeared relaxed and giggly. It was Saturday afternoon and the boss . was away. Not so at the Lazrak factory in Fez. The. work pace at Lazrak was fast and constant. One Lazrak woman supervisor disciplined a girl of about 10 by slapping her on the shoulder. But there was no sign of children being kept against their wills. They were working, super- visors said, because their parents sent them. Yebbous of Marrakech Tapis was not the only factory manager who said openly that he preferred 7-year-olds. Plant supervisor Mohammad Benour of the, 600-employee Martex SA carpet factory in Sale said in an interview: “To do this work you have to have experience. It's better if we can get them when they are 7.” Hiding the girls In contrast to such forthrightness, Hiyat’s bosses at Mocary tried to hide their employ- ment of under-age children. When the journalists drove up to the factory gates 10 minutes ahead of their scheduled vis- it, a male supervisor was seen escorting three girls who looked about 9 out the front door. Another male supervisor was gently pushing a girl, about 10, into a closet. Another half-doz- en children, including Hiyat, remained at their looms. Half an hour later, as the tour ended, a doz- en of the plant’s temporarily-exiled work force were seen waiting in a field across the street. One girl had her finger wrapped with yarn, a technique many knotters use to protect against cuts. As the reporters were driving away, they watched in their rear-view mirror as the exiles scampered back into the factory. “Oh, I'm sure no one did that,” insisted Mo- cary executive Abdulila El Idrissi when asked why some under-age workers had been re- moved from the factory. He maintained all of Mocary's workers were 13 — even though he had been filling in as the translator when Hiyat said she was 11. Morocco's hand-made carpet industry em- ploys about 200,000 workers, including ap- prentices, in 100 sizable factories and 10,000 small workshops. Of the $45 million worth of carpets exported in 1985, more than 10,000 carpets costing importers $2.3 million found their way to the United States. As low as labor standards seemed in the factories, several Moroccan carpet executives complained that Moroccan carpets were suf- fering in the world marketplace because of foreign child labor, especially in India. “We cannot compete with them,” said Mo- cary executive Idrissi. “In India they pay with a bow! of rice for two rugs.” @ ALSO CONTRIBUTING to this series were researchers Diane Fraser and Maria Voles of the Cox Newspapers Washington bureau.

These wretched little boys in rub- ber-thonged sandals cannot be found darting around the furnaces of Boro- sil Glass Works, the Indian affiliate of Corning in Bombay. Indian technicians wearing labora- tory coats, safety shoes and protec- tive glasses work on Borosil’s spot- less floors, just as the Corning safety teams from the United States demand. The children work instead for a Borosil subcontractor whose primi- tive factory looks like a tintype in a Moscow museum of capitalist horrors. Every year, the Corning affiliate orders thousands of test tubes, bea- kers and other laboratory glass from the subcontractor, West Glass, whose factory is in Firozabad, 650 miles northeast of Bombay. Borosil then sells the Firozabad glass, without labels, to customers in Africa, the Middle East and South- east Asia. Cheap Rajesh J. Vyas, the marketing manager of Borosil, said buying glass from Firozabad enables him to fill a niche in his overall export strategy: meeting the demand of “countries where price is the main criterion, such as Egypt or Kenya, which have foreign exchange problems.” Borosil manufactures in its modern Bombay plant about 98 percent of the glass it sells to its domestic and for- eign customers. Chemically identical to Corning’s Pyrex and pharmaceutical lines, glass carrying the Borosil label doesn’t crack when heated and isn’t corroded by laboratory acids. Its one drawback is that it is too expensive for some Third World markets. Borosil gets the remaining 2 per- cent of what it selis from Firozabad, exclusively for export customers. It is cheap laboratory glassware made of “soda glass,’ the same material used in tumblers and beer bottles everywhere. Laboratory vessels made of soda glass are neither heat-resistant nor etch-proof nor accurately calibrated. But they are cheap. It's only a sideline for Borosil. For Corning — a blue-blood company that last year sold $1.9 billion worth of products ranging from fiber optic cables to Steuben vases — the impact on bottom line is infinitesimal. Ethical? Is it proper for Corning and its af- filiate to derive any benefit from the illegal labor of li-year-old boys? There was no hint in conversations with Borosil executives in Bombay that anyone had ever considered this to be an ethical question. Back in the United States, John Abrams, manager of corporate infor- mation for Corning, said in a tele- phone interview: “The child labor which is utilized in Firozabad is done with the full knowledge of the Indian government and as far as we know complies with Indian law ... As of now, we have no reason to believe the child employment laws are being flouted” at West Glass. After an exchange of messages be- tween Corning headquarters and Borosil, Abrams said that as far as he knows, the youngest employees at West Glass are 14 years old. It's clear that the Borosil orders make a huge difference to one ambi- tious factory boss in Firovabad — both in profits and prestige. His face wreathed with smiles, the proprietor of West Glass, Bihari Lal Sharma, told visiting reporters in Fir- ozabad that Borosil is one of his most important customers. He said at times fully 20 percent of his 1,500 workers are making labora- tory glass for Borosil and that he re- ceives at least $100,000 worth of or- ders from Borosil every year. West Glass may well be, as Sharma boasted, ‘the biggest compa- ny in Firozabad, quality-wise, diver- sity-wise and labor-wise.\" But it is not the sort of place where the lumi- naries on Corning's board, including civil-rights leader Vernon Jordan and former World Bank chief Robert Mc- Namara, would feel comfortable. Arsenic In the factory, a visitor flinches from unexpected surges of heat on the back of the neck. The heat radi- ates from orbs of molten glass car- ried by Indian boys criss-crossing the crowded factory floor. Breathing is another worry. Among the chemicals the factory uses to make colored glass, Sharma volunteered, is arsenic. When pressed about the use of arsenic, he changed the subject. About one-third of the 500 work- ers on duty looked no older than 12. The factory proprietor at first ac- know ledged hiring boys under the le- gal minimum age of 14. He said boys are “at least 11° when they come to work. He amended that by saying, “at least 13 or 14.\" It can be no surprise to Borosil that its supplier illegally hires under-age children. Borosil officials have visit- ed the West Glass plant periodically on buying trips, as both Sharma and Vyas of Borosil confirmed. Vyas estimated that every year Borosil exports about $250,000 worth of goods made by subcontrac- tors. The “bulk” of the goods consists Dayton Daily News - June 22, 1987 (Continued) \fof soda glass ordered from the West Glass factory, Vyas said. Borosil views itself as closely affil- iated with Corning. Even though Corning owns only 39.5 percent of the Borosil stock, Borosil manufac- turing manager Ranjit Mehra called this “controlling interest.” Indian investors, many of them now or formerly part of the company management, hold the non-Corning shares. Corning aware “Corning is very, very conscious about safety,” Mehra said. “They keep coming here to personally in- spect our safety practices. We have to send them periodic audits on safety.” Mehra said the 1984 disaster at Union Carbide’s Bhopal chemical plant led Corning officials to demand that Borosil change the way it cali: brates the scientific instruments it makes. “After Bhopal, Corning came down on us like a ton of bricks,\" Mehra said. “They told us that il you're using mercury, you've got t stop or else shut down the plant.” A Borosil catalogue says the com: pany was incorporated in India in 1963 “with technical and financial collaboration from Corning Giasi Works.” A Corning spokesman it New York described Borosil as “a lit tle Corning Works,” adding tha from Corning’s viewpoint it was ; “joint venture.” During its first decade, American from Corning worked alongside Indi an executives in running Borosi!

Governments, businesses and the poor themselves insist they cannot afford to do without the labor and income of children. India — with an annual per- capita income of $260 a year and estimates that one of every five children aged 5 to 15 is employed — is a fitting place to examine conditions and causes of the most abusive child work. Poverty has made a tradition of child labor here. Widespread child labor in India assures that the poor stay poor, partly because many working children fill jobs while millions of adult Indians — often their own fathers — search fruitlessly for work. Children get jobs because they are cheap and docile hires. Mohammad, for example, said he makes 11 rupees a day at the Emkay Glass Works, which comes to about 86 cents a day, even less than India’s meager minimum wage of $1.25 daily. An adult at the same shop working one of the more skilled jobs said he made 150 rupees — almost 12 U.S. dollars —a day. With three day’s pay, Moham- mad could buy his mother enough cheap cloth for one sari and his father one package of local cigarettes. “In the long run, if children are thrown out of jobs, the businesses will have to continue by employ- ing adults at better wages.” said Swami Agnivesh, a well-known Indian social reformer. A large force of child laborers depresses the wage scale as well as perpetuates adult unemploy- ment, he said. It becomes a vicious circle as adults making a pittance look to their children to supple- ment the family income, then have more and more children who not only raise family costs, but contribute to low wages. Employers take advantage of these conditions, Agnivesh said, especially unscrupulous ones who make loans for pledges of work. With usurious interest rates, en- tire families effectively become serfs to a system of bonded indebtedness. Estimates of children working in India vary from nearly 18 mil- lion — the government figure for children aged 5 to 15 who work for wages — to 44 million. Sucial agencies say the larger numbe: is more realistic because it includes children who do piecework jobs with their parents, or are not paid directly by employers for other reasons. Many of India’s 200 million children from 5 to 15 hold occa- sional jobs or else sacrifice school attendance so they can keep house and tend younger siblings while parents work. They are not count- ed in the work force. The only country that may rival India in child laborers is China, which the United Nations’ Inter- national Labor Organization esti- mates has 39.6 million children working between the ages 10 and 14. Since so much of China re- mains impenetrable to Western- ers, it is impossible to gauge inter- nal work conditions there. Dayton Daily News - June 22, 1987 (Continued) \f"

Borosil then sells the Firozabad glass, without labels, to customers in Africa, the Middle East and South- east Asia. Cheap Rajesh J. Vyas, the marketing manager of Borosil, said buying glass from Firozabad enables him to fill a niche in his overall export strategy: meeting the demand of “countries where price is the main criterion, such as Egypt or Kenya, which have foreign exchange problems.” Borosil manufactures in its modern Bombay plant about 98 percent of the glass it sells to its domestic and for- eign customers. Chemically identical to Corning’s Pyrex and pharmaceutical lines, glass carrying the Borosil label doesn’t crack when heated and isn’t corroded by laboratory acids. Its one drawback is that it is too expensive for some Third World markets. Borosil gets the remaining 2 per- cent of what it selis from Firozabad, exclusively for export customers. It is cheap laboratory glassware made of “soda glass,’ the same material used in tumblers and beer bottles everywhere. Laboratory vessels made of soda glass are neither heat-resistant nor etch-proof nor accurately calibrated. But they are cheap. It's only a sideline for Borosil. For Corning — a blue-blood company that last year sold $1.9 billion worth of products ranging from fiber optic cables to Steuben vases — the impact on bottom line is infinitesimal. Ethical? Is it proper for Corning and its af- filiate to derive any benefit from the illegal labor of li-year-old boys? There was no hint in conversations with Borosil executives in Bombay that anyone had ever considered this to be an ethical question. Back in the United States, John Abrams, manager of corporate infor- mation for Corning, said in a tele- phone interview: “The child labor which is utilized in Firozabad is done with the full knowledge of the Indian government and as far as we know complies with Indian law ... As of now, we have no reason to believe the child employment laws are being flouted” at West Glass. After an exchange of messages be- tween Corning headquarters and Borosil, Abrams said that as far as he knows, the youngest employees at West Glass are 14 years old. It's clear that the Borosil orders make a huge difference to one ambi- tious factory boss in Firovabad — both in profits and prestige. His face wreathed with smiles, the proprietor of West Glass, Bihari Lal Sharma, told visiting reporters in Fir- ozabad that Borosil is one of his most important customers. He said at times fully 20 percent of his 1,500 workers are making labora- tory glass for Borosil and that he re- ceives at least $100,000 worth of or- ders from Borosil every year. West Glass may well be, as Sharma boasted, ‘the biggest compa- ny in Firozabad, quality-wise, diver- sity-wise and labor-wise.\" But it is not the sort of place where the lumi- naries on Corning's board, including civil-rights leader Vernon Jordan and former World Bank chief Robert Mc- Namara, would feel comfortable.

The heat radi- ates from orbs of molten glass car- ried by Indian boys criss-crossing the crowded factory floor. Breathing is another worry. Among the chemicals the factory uses to make colored glass, Sharma volunteered, is arsenic. When pressed about the use of arsenic, he changed the subject. About one-third of the 500 work- ers on duty looked no older than 12. The factory proprietor at first ac- know ledged hiring boys under the le- gal minimum age of 14. He said boys are “at least 11° when they come to work. He amended that by saying, “at least 13 or 14.\" It can be no surprise to Borosil that its supplier illegally hires under-age children.

Borosil views itself as closely affil- iated with Corning. Even though Corning owns only 39.5 percent of the Borosil stock, Borosil manufac- turing manager Ranjit Mehra called this “controlling interest.” Indian investors, many of them now or formerly part of the company management, hold the non-Corning shares. Corning aware “Corning is very, very conscious about safety,” Mehra said. “They keep coming here to personally in- spect our safety practices.

Governments, businesses and the poor themselves insist they cannot afford to do without the labor and income of children. India — with an annual per- capita income of $260 a year and estimates that one of every five children aged 5 to 15 is employed — is a fitting place to examine conditions and causes of the most abusive child work. Poverty has made a tradition of child labor here. Widespread child labor in India assures that the poor stay poor, partly because many working children fill jobs while millions of adult Indians — often their own fathers — search fruitlessly for work. Children get jobs because they are cheap and docile hires. Mohammad, for example, said he makes 11 rupees a day at the Emkay Glass Works, which comes to about 86 cents a day, even less than India’s meager minimum wage of $1.25 daily. An adult at the same shop working one of the more skilled jobs said he made 150 rupees — almost 12 U.S. dollars —a day. With three day’s pay, Moham- mad could buy his mother enough cheap cloth for one sari and his father one package of local cigarettes. “In the long run, if children are thrown out of jobs, the businesses will have to continue by employ- ing adults at better wages.” said Swami Agnivesh, a well-known Indian social reformer. A large force of child laborers depresses the wage scale as well as perpetuates adult unemploy- ment, he said. It becomes a vicious circle as adults making a pittance look to their children to supple- ment the family income, then have more and more children who not only raise family costs, but contribute to low wages. Employers take advantage of these conditions, Agnivesh said, especially unscrupulous ones who make loans for pledges of work. With usurious interest rates, en- tire families effectively become serfs to a system of bonded indebtedness. Estimates of children working in India vary from nearly 18 mil- lion — the government figure for children aged 5 to 15 who work for wages — to 44 million. Sucial agencies say the larger numbe: is more realistic because it includes children who do piecework jobs with their parents, or are not paid directly by employers for other reasons. Many of India’s 200 million children from 5 to 15 hold occa- sional jobs or else sacrifice school attendance so they can keep house and tend younger siblings while parents work. They are not count- ed in the work force. The only country that may rival India in child laborers is China, which the United Nations’ Inter- national Labor Organization esti- mates has 39.6 million children working between the ages 10 and 14.

Of all crude open the working children in India, the glass workers of Firozabad may have the most dangerous jobs. Most commonly, the job of a young boy is carrying a six-foot- long metal pole that had been dipped into a furnace to retrieve a gob of the molten glass. The carri- ers run the hollow poles to an old- er glass blower who shapes such products as beakers for laborato- ries and drinking glasses for some of India’s finest hotels.

Growing numbers of Indians agree more must be done. Besides taking jobs from adults, they say child labor sabotages the future of the children themselves. “A child starts working at 7 or 8.\" said Neera Burra. a researcher on child labor for UNICEF and for the Indian Social Institute. “He is burned out by the time he is 30 to 35.

It maintains the ban on factory and hazard- ous work, but the problem. according to crit- ics, is that it makes no effective provision for enforcing either the new standards or the old ones that have been ignored since they were enacted 35 years ago.

Among th longest-established Philippine exports to th United States are rattan furniture,-decorativ baskets and hand-embroidered baby dresses. About 70 years ago, when the Philippine was a U.S. territory, American entrepreneur began contracting with Filipino women in Ma nila suburbs for production of baby dresses i their homes. The Filipino contractors, called cabecilla subcontracted the work to their neighbor who in turn subcontracted the work down t lower and lower levels of subcontractors. B 1930, embroidered articles had become one < the top 10 exports in the Philippines. Then, : now, much of the work was done by children Baby dresses are still being exported to tt United States, and by some of the same porters, including Manhattan's Feltman Brot! ers, who have been active since the 1930s, The wages Philippine children earn for sev ing in their homes range from one cent to fir cents an hour, according to a 1985 study by tt Institute of Industrial Relations at the Unive sity of the Philippines. Most of the childre found by researchers worked between 15 ar 30 hours a week. Depressing pattem The profits from child labor are often ol scure.

The factory's profit margin about $3 on a dozen shirts, judging from fi ures provided by Cruz. any factory worker can be made to work in a week without overtime pay. Both have a mini- mum wage — $2.75 a day in Manila, $2.92 a day in Bangkok. As for hiring minors, Philippine law says it's illegal to hire children under 15 unless they are directly supervised by a parent, and there is no interference with a child's education, Thai law permits children up to age 12 to work in light jobs such as flower selling, newspaper delivery, and waiting on tables, However, it bars factory work before the age of 15 without governmental permission, But, in both countries, laws are one thing and enforcement is another. In Thailand, Vor- avaun of the Interior Ministry said she knows of only three cases in 1985 where employers were charged with working young employees for excessive hours. Shortage of inspectors There are not enough factory inspectors to go around. By a 1982 count, Thailand had 40,951 licensed factories and uncounted thou- sands more illegal shophouses, It had only 115 factory inspectors. Sabilano of the Labor Ministry says the Aquino administration has at least taken a step in the right direction by recognizing that child labor exists in the Philippines and should be monitored. In Thailand, the government says the oppo- site — at least when dealing with outsiders. “Now the situation of child labor is not a worry,” asserted Voravaun, who is in charge of the Thai Interior Ministry's women and child-labor division, “We cannot find a lot of child labor, Sometimes we look and inspect the factory all day and they cannot find Cruz says in a busy week the 25 sewers and | silk sereeners in the factory and 20 more seamstresses who work at home can make 360 dozen shirts, suggesting a potential profit of up to $1,000 a week. Eliza says it takes her about six hours to make a dozen shirts, netting her 13 cents an hour. The factory where Sarapa makes six cents an hour also appears to be a miniature money machine. Export manager Komol said he expects to export one million plastic toys this year. He said the company charges 48 cents wholesale for its biggest seller, a 16-inch-long plastic Uzi machine With chad rica tally 26 employees end high Volume, the factory would have a diffi- cult time losing money.

ANGKOK — For thousands of Thai children, the Hua Lampong train station has : been a gateway to exploita- . tion. Once a year itis a gateway out. The_ happy time is the Chinese ‘New Year, when ethnic Chinese ‘owners of shops and factories givea ‘holiday to their workers, many of . whom are migrants from debt-ridden farms or landless families in the im- _ povertished northeast. ' Seven girls clustered on a bench were going home last January for the _first time in the year they had been working at a tiny Bangkok garment factory. Not_ only was it their first trip back: This was their first full day off in a year. Ladda Pimwan, 15, leaned against a girtfriend. The seven had arrived early, and had yet to endure a nine- hour train ride and then an hour's bus drive to their village of Baan As Kaew. It would be a wearying trip, but yes, Ladda nodded shyly, before turriing her face into her friend's shoulder, she couldn't wait to see her family at the end of the line. The girls came to the city, they said, because their families need the ‘money. Their wages were only about $24 a month — a little more than seven cents per hour for working 74- hour weeks — but one girl said she managed to send half of it home. Prowling for hires The outbound trains were filled with youngsters like Ladda last Chi- nese New Year. The rest of the year. especially during the dry season, when northeastern families become desperate for even meager earnings, children travel inbound to jobs that sap their strength for pennies an hour. The Hua Lampong train station is often the interchange that gets therm from the farm to the factory. 3 Ae outbound trains were filled with youngsters like Ladda last Chinese New Year. The rest of the year, especially during the dry season, when north- eastern families become desperate for even mea- ger earnings, Children travel inbound to jobs that sap their strength for pennies an hour. The Hua Lampong train station is often the in- terchange that gets them JSrom the farm to the Jactory. That is when it becomes the gate- way to exploitation. Bangkok's main train station is haunted by “fisher- women” and “fishermen, the job brokers who cast ab’ _| in streams of migrants for naive children come to find work in the city. These agents prow! the piatform when the dawn train pulls in from the northeast. “Fisherwomen” are kind to the new arrivals, offering to help them find work. Too often, they find them jobs with 15-hour work days. They and Bangkok employers know the children will be cheap hires. The brokers may be independent agents. But, more likely, they repre- sent one of the dozen joh apencies which line grimy nearh, str Newspapers here periodically re- port stories such as the rescue by po- lice last year of 18 girls working ina textile factory. The girls, most aged 12 to 14, said they worked 15 hours a day for food scraps and a few cents pay, and were locked in a room to sleep. The owner, who was arrested on charges of child slavery and false im- prisonment, told police he got most of the children from a job agency near the Hua Lampong station. 6 a.m. to midnight A year earlier, 64 children aged 13 to 15 were rescued from a mosquito net factory where they had labored from 6 a.m. to midnight every day. The train station agencies were re- ported to have paid the nts $80 to $160 for each child, which commit- ted the children to a year's work in the factory. The few job agency bosses who agreed to talk to reporters ali claimed they place only young people 16 or older in factories, in compliance with Thai law. Thongma Sonboonom, wife of the head of Swai Job Agency, said her biggest problems are with the girls she places, not the employers. “A lot of times giris don't keep their con- tracts,” she complained, so the agen- cy must replace them at no charge to the employer. She said her agents do find young workers among the migrants at the train station, which is just around the corner from her second-story office at the top of a filthy. unlit stairway. Her agency was cited in a human rights newsletter as placing a 10- year-old girl in a factory, where she vorked for seven months. Then she became a domestic servant and was raped by her boss. Asked about her age policies, Thongma said: “I never place anyone Dayton Daily News - June 23, 1987 (Continued)  FesrcK MCKAY (COX WASHINGTON BURESA Gints wait in the office of job broker near BanskKOoOK train station; for many, a harsh year looms in a factory whois under 16.” Sexual advances She does send younger children tc domestic work, Thongma said, ther volunteered that employers some times make sexual advances towarc the giris. She maintained the bosse: mever do anything too serious. “Nobody I've ever sent has eve! been raped,”* she said. The Center of Concern for Chil« Labor in Bangkok has found that in dependent brokers make $11 to $1! for each child they _ bring from rura villages to a Bangkok job placemen agency. Brokers who work direct! for an agency payroll get half the ser vice charge the agency collects fo placing a child. The center found that stricter law regulating employment agencie have produced more agenty registra tions im recent years, but its 198 study showed they continue placin children in bad jobs with fong hour and little pay The problem, the study said, is that the Thai Labor Department only checks whether employment agen- cies have permits. The Thai govern- ment has insufficient inspectors to determine whether the agencies are placing children in safe, legal jobs and are charging fair fees The center has recommended that the government set up an informa- tion booth at the train station to tell migrating children their rights to a minimum wage and limited hours and to warn them about unscrupu- lous job agents The Thai Trade Union Congress has gone further, recommending the government field its own job agents at places like the Hua Lampong train station to help children find reason- able jobs and to investigate on-the- oer YP ‘Inappropriate’ Even the almost Thai government, which never admits there is exptoi- tation of child labor in Thailand, said in «a paper submitted to an interna- tional conference last fall that “‘un- scrupulous job agencies “have con- tributed to inappropriate treatment of working children They charge high make illegal contracts chiltiren in commissions, and put the jobs with low wages and improper working conditions, ac- cording to the pepper by Voravaun Thanaphibul, director of the Interior Ministry's child laber division im an interview she was asked what actions the government has taken te mmbat exploitation by job agencies She said the government had a meeting with these employ mer agents tast year to explain the law on child tabeor amd to make it ar that children are a valuable re surce of the countr She thinks, she said. that this will help \f\f"

What they don’t show is their hid- den minor league of unlicensed subcontractors | that churn out low-cost merchandise, Links also exist between child labor and the export market in the Philippines, Among the longest-established Philippine exports to the . bbs pieone rattan ae me Links also exist between child labor and th export market in thé Philippines. Among th longest-established Philippine exports to th United States are rattan furniture,-decorativ baskets and hand-embroidered baby dresses. About 70 years ago, when the Philippine was a U.S. territory, American entrepreneur began contracting with Filipino women in Ma nila suburbs for production of baby dresses i their homes. The Filipino contractors, called cabecilla subcontracted the work to their neighbor who in turn subcontracted the work down t lower and lower levels of subcontractors. B 1930, embroidered articles had become one < the top 10 exports in the Philippines. Then, : now, much of the work was done by children Baby dresses are still being exported to tt United States, and by some of the same porters, including Manhattan's Feltman Brot! ers, who have been active since the 1930s, The wages Philippine children earn for sev ing in their homes range from one cent to fir cents an hour, according to a 1985 study by tt Institute of Industrial Relations at the Unive sity of the Philippines. Most of the childre found by researchers worked between 15 ar 30 hours a week. Depressing pattem The profits from child labor are often ol scure.

Both have a mini- mum wage — $2.75 a day in Manila, $2.92 a day in Bangkok. As for hiring minors, Philippine law says it's illegal to hire children under 15 unless they are directly supervised by a parent, and there is no interference with a child's education, Thai law permits children up to age 12 to work in light jobs such as flower selling, newspaper delivery, and waiting on tables, However, it bars factory work before the age of 15 without governmental permission, But, in both countries, laws are one thing and enforcement is another. In Thailand, Vor- avaun of the Interior Ministry said she knows of only three cases in 1985 where employers were charged with working young employees for excessive hours. Shortage of inspectors There are not enough factory inspectors to go around. By a 1982 count, Thailand had 40,951 licensed factories and uncounted thou- sands more illegal shophouses, It had only 115 factory inspectors. Sabilano of the Labor Ministry says the Aquino administration has at least taken a step in the right direction by recognizing that child labor exists in the Philippines and should be monitored. In Thailand, the government says the oppo- site — at least when dealing with outsiders. “Now the situation of child labor is not a worry,” asserted Voravaun, who is in charge of the Thai Interior Ministry's women and child-labor division, “We cannot find a lot of child labor, Sometimes we look and inspect the factory all day and they cannot find Cruz says in a busy week the 25 sewers and | silk sereeners in the factory and 20 more seamstresses who work at home can make 360 dozen shirts, suggesting a potential profit of up to $1,000 a week. Eliza says it takes her about six hours to make a dozen shirts, netting her 13 cents an hour. The factory where Sarapa makes six cents an hour also appears to be a miniature money machine. Export manager Komol said he expects to export one million plastic toys this year. He said the company charges 48 cents wholesale for its biggest seller, a 16-inch-long plastic Uzi machine With chad rica tally 26 employees end high Volume, the factory would have a diffi- cult time losing money.

ANGKOK — For thousands of Thai children, the Hua Lampong train station has : been a gateway to exploita- . tion. Once a year itis a gateway out. The_ happy time is the Chinese ‘New Year, when ethnic Chinese ‘owners of shops and factories givea ‘holiday to their workers, many of . whom are migrants from debt-ridden farms or landless families in the im- _ povertished northeast. ' Seven girls clustered on a bench were going home last January for the _first time in the year they had been working at a tiny Bangkok garment factory. Not_ only was it their first trip back: This was their first full day off in a year. Ladda Pimwan, 15, leaned against a girtfriend. The seven had arrived early, and had yet to endure a nine- hour train ride and then an hour's bus drive to their village of Baan As Kaew. It would be a wearying trip, but yes, Ladda nodded shyly, before turriing her face into her friend's shoulder, she couldn't wait to see her family at the end of the line. The girls came to the city, they said, because their families need the ‘money. Their wages were only about $24 a month — a little more than seven cents per hour for working 74- hour weeks — but one girl said she managed to send half of it home. Prowling for hires The outbound trains were filled with youngsters like Ladda last Chi- nese New Year. The rest of the year. especially during the dry season, when northeastern families become desperate for even meager earnings, children travel inbound to jobs that sap their strength for pennies an hour. The Hua Lampong train station is often the interchange that gets therm from the farm to the factory. 3 Ae outbound trains were filled with youngsters like Ladda last Chinese New Year. The rest of the year, especially during the dry season, when north- eastern families become desperate for even mea- ger earnings, Children travel inbound to jobs that sap their strength for pennies an hour. The Hua Lampong train station is often the in- terchange that gets them JSrom the farm to the Jactory. That is when it becomes the gate- way to exploitation. Bangkok's main train station is haunted by “fisher- women” and “fishermen, the job brokers who cast ab’ _| in streams of migrants for naive children come to find work in the city. These agents prow! the piatform when the dawn train pulls in from the northeast. “Fisherwomen” are kind to the new arrivals, offering to help them find work. Too often, they find them jobs with 15-hour work days. They and Bangkok employers know the children will be cheap hires. The brokers may be independent agents. But, more likely, they repre- sent one of the dozen joh apencies which line grimy nearh, str Newspapers here periodically re- port stories such as the rescue by po- lice last year of 18 girls working ina textile factory. The girls, most aged 12 to 14, said they worked 15 hours a day for food scraps and a few cents pay, and were locked in a room to sleep. The owner, who was arrested on charges of child slavery and false im- prisonment, told police he got most of the children from a job agency near the Hua Lampong station. 6 a.m. to midnight A year earlier, 64 children aged 13 to 15 were rescued from a mosquito net factory where they had labored from 6 a.m. to midnight every day. The train station agencies were re- ported to have paid the nts $80 to $160 for each child, which commit- ted the children to a year's work in the factory. The few job agency bosses who agreed to talk to reporters ali claimed they place only young people 16 or older in factories, in compliance with Thai law. Thongma Sonboonom, wife of the head of Swai Job Agency, said her biggest problems are with the girls she places, not the employers. “A lot of times giris don't keep their con- tracts,” she complained, so the agen- cy must replace them at no charge to the employer. She said her agents do find young workers among the migrants at the train station, which is just around the corner from her second-story office at the top of a filthy. unlit stairway. Her agency was cited in a human rights newsletter as placing a 10- year-old girl in a factory, where she vorked for seven months. Then she became a domestic servant and was raped by her boss.

She maintained the bosse: mever do anything too serious. “Nobody I've ever sent has eve! been raped,”* she said. The Center of Concern for Chil« Labor in Bangkok has found that in dependent brokers make $11 to $1! for each child they _ bring from rura villages to a Bangkok job placemen agency.

The center found that stricter law regulating employment agencie have produced more agenty registra tions im recent years, but its 198 study showed they continue placin children in bad jobs with fong hour and little pay The problem, the study said, is that the Thai Labor Department only checks whether employment agen- cies have permits.

RICK McKAY/COX WASHINGTON BUREAU Chupeta, 10, in ‘bed’ — a park bench; his country, Brazii, has 7 million homeless children Street kids are wily fighters in savage ‘war’ By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE SAO PAULO, Brazil — Chu- Peta, 10, was on the lam. He ran like an unleashed fox across the tree-lined city plaza and out of sight, fleeing from the family he and his buddy had just robbed of a $30 watch. The exile was brief. Marcelo Veiera, known by the nickname Chupeta, and his young partner in crime were back to their pleza routine half an hour later, playing in the fountain and begging food and cigarettes while awaiting the next heist. They had just made $7 to split between thern. “I'm a street kid. I'm a thief,”’ Chupeta had told a reporter a few days earlier. “‘I smoke marijuana. STOLEN CHILDHOOD @ FOURTH OF SIX PARTS I smell glue. I'm tough.” He was being matter-of-fact. not boastful. Chupeta steals to live. He has no parents, no home. He does have a fence, an adult who sells what he steals. That is who made the most on the morn- ing’s watch robbery, roughly $10 or $15 in low-risk profit. Chupeta said most of the pro- ceeds of his thefts go for getting of survival Marcelo ‘Chupeta’ Veiera high on glue. He was asked what else he buys. SEE STREET KiDS/4 \f Street kids -. “I buy food. You know what my food is? Glue,” he said with a laugh. “I have lunch or dinner here or there. But if I don’t have any food, that's OK. I just sniff glue.” Chupeta’s fence is like other adults around the world who turn poor children into thieves, burglars or prostitutes because the authorities neither stop them nor find the children a bet- fer way to live. In cities such as Sao Paulo, in fact, some . police seem to vie with criminals to make the ‘most off street children. “If a boy doesn’t have enough money to give a cop, he may beat him,” said Gerlene Veras, counselor at a shelter for street children. With » the proper payoff, she said, a kid can keep out of the reformatory. Or he can keep his space on the park bench for another night. Analto Jose Galvao, who works with juve- ~ niles released from the reformatory, said chil- dren also get squeezed by crooks. “Sometimes adults force the child to do it,” he said. ‘They put a knife to the boy’s ribs and threaten to kill him if he doesn’t steal.” Meal might be enough , Few children require such extreme persua- __ Sion. A meal might be sufficient. Adult crimi- ., Mal gangs have good reason to draft child ac- complices. They are quick and wily, desired _ attributes for street theft and house burgiar- _ des. They are attractive also for high-risk jobs _ such as drug smuggling because they cannot be sent to prison. Until age 18, the worst they face is a few months in the reformatory. , Chupeta is one of 7 million Brazilian chil- . dren who are considered abandoned, estimates . by government officials show. The majority of them live, literally, on the streets. Plying the streets beside them are other poor children who are not homeless but are in search of money for family survival. _,. The World Health Organization says 80 mil- _ lion street children exist around the world. . They mass in cities as diverse as Istanbul, Ma- __ mila and Mexico City. . In some cities they are well-organized, such as the children who pose as beggars in Italy . and France, then pick the pockets of unwary tourists. These thieves are trained and run by adult criminals, who may have kidnapped them or bought them from their parents in _ Yugoslavia. The lives of street children differ little from one country to the next. They are, like Chu- peta, tough. They also are destitute, detached _ and exploited. “The street is their space. The first week it is a novelty, but after that it’s a war,” said Sister Maria do Rosario, who heads Pastorale do Menor, a conglomerate of projects for treet children in Sa The cycle begins when a farm family moves to the city in search of work, but lacking the necessary skills and unprepared for the high cost of urban life. “Physically, the transition takes only two weeks. Culturally, it is a transition of 200 years,” said Sister Rosario. “What happens is the women get jobs as maids and the men are unemployed. Either they drink and become al- coholics at home, or they just leave the family behind.” Everyone must contribute to the family pot. Children are sent out to the streets. Chupeta said his family came to Sao Paulo from the town of Rio Claro in the neighboring state of Minas Gerais when he was a baby. Somewhere along the way, he lost both parents. “Some guy shot my father. My mother died of a heart attack,\" he said. He has been on the streets for years. Street worker Maria Dos Santos, who has known Chupeta a year, has seen no sign of a family or a home. Chupeta himself said the park bench is his typical bed and that home is the plaza of foun- tains and trees and broad walk ways sprawling around the main downtown church, the Ca- thedral of the Assumption. The busy plaza serves equally well for beg- ging or for stealing. Tourists here invariably visit the church and park-like surroundings and so do thousands of locals a day. The plaza is a magnet for poor children with y nothing to do during the day and for a smaller, ever-changing troupe of habitues, like Chu- peta, who have nowhere to go at night. Boys like this do not always begin their street time by stealing, but rather by begging or cleaning windshields or selling candy or fruit. Good intentions “He has good intentions in the beginning, to do these little odd jobs,” said Gildo Datre, chief investigator in Sao Paulo’s downtown police precinct. “Usually these indigent boys are guided by the intrujoes. They introduce the boys to crime.” The Portuguese word intrujoes, which translates as “intruders” or “deceivers,” com- monly is used here to describe adults or older teenagers who run small, informal syndicates of child thieves, burglars or prostitutes. They lead the children into crime, sell the fruits of their work and pay them a fraction of the take. “These guys are the receivers,” Datre ex- plained. ‘They stay on the side streets or are on the plaza selling fruit or clothes. When a boy steals a watch, he runs to one of the intru- joes and quickly throws it on his stand to get rid of it.” Chupeta, who ran from the plaza crime scene that day with speed unexpected for his spindly frame, said he gets a flat rate of $7 for each watch he steals. “I get what I should,” he said, expressing no dissatisfaction with the fence system. He said he thinks the watches resell on the black mar- ket for only about $14. Datre said they are re- sold for $20 to $300, depending on the quality. At first, Chupeta wouldn't talk about who sells his hot goods, which include radios, cal- culators and gold chains — claiming in one conversation that he is an independent operator. Later, he opened up a bit. “Mother India is behind me. I give her some stuff. She resells it,” he said, refusing, howev- er, to talk more about “Mother India.” Finding a fence in the human stew that melds at the plaza isn't difficult. The network of kids is surrounded by companion networks of prostitutes, vendors and itinerant minstrels. Yet another window on the criminal world, for those who want such an entry, are the men who walk the main city squares with signs on sticks advertising ouro. It means “gold,” and they aren't selling, they're buying. More exactly, they are agents who will lead a seller down nearby alleys to an unmarked pawn shop, where deals are made. “I know about this problem,” said Alda Marco Antonio, the newly named secretary for minors in Sao Paulo state. “When the boy gets the necklace, he chews it immediately to see if it's gold,” she said, speaking of boys who snatch chains. “Then he goes to the guy with the placard and sells it. But he gets very little for that.” Layers of intermediaries may separate the young thieves and the buyer. Sometimes, said one worker at Pastorale do Menor, the pawn broker himself may urge children to steal for him, promising a big return, but paying as little as $2 for a gold chain. The numbers of minors sent to the Sao Pau- lo reformatory as lawbreakers have more than tripled between 1975 and 1985. The institution does not even admit first offenders under the age of 14. Nazih Meserani, president of FEBEM, the government foundation responsible for both abandoned and delinquent children, said: “Ten years ago we saw more attempted crimes. Now more of the crimes are successful. We also are seeing more repeaters. And the age group of those committing crimes is going down.” Dayton Daily News June 24, 1987 (Continued) \f L] Street kids Chupeta claimed to have been held in the FEBEM reformatory 16 times, a figure that did not appear excessive to the social workers who know him. Police beatings The streets expose children to dangers, whether the children steal or just shine shoes. Getting beaten up by police is one such dan- ger. The files of the Sao Paulo section of the Order of Lawyers of Brazil hold complaints of child torture in the early 1980s including elec- trical shocks, palm crushing, punching, kick- ing and unexplained deaths at the hands of police officers. Even Brazil's turn from military to demo- cratic civilian rule in 1985 has not stopped police beatings and torture of common crimi- nals, human-rights groups say. The govern- ment-run shelter, Project Street Children, helped children file at least 15 complaints of major police abuse in 1986. At the shelter, Anna Luisa de Jesus Macena, 13, still bore the marks of what she said was a police beating six days earlier. The two nar- row slashes on her neck were from the stick the policeman used to hit her, she said. Other bruises and lacerations marked her arms and legs. She had been with a group of street girls who stole some jewelry and some food, she said, and the police officer was taking the stash away from them, forcibly. Children such as Kuiel, 9, also demonstrate the vulnerability of street children. A man re- cently had raped him, and, according to a street worker of Pastorale do Menor, two oth- er bovs as well. a ~ § § 8 8 ‘ 3° ree After stealing a watch on square in Sao Paulo, Chupeta races away, seeking his fence, ‘Mother India’ When kids like Chupeta and Kuiel and Anna Luisa grasp for a life preserver here, most often it is a can of glue. “When a child is hungry or is very cold, he just smelis glue to forget the cold, to forget the hunger,” said street worker Alec Pauchet. “At the hospital they say it causes damage to the brain.” Reporters saw Chupeta high on elue three times in 10 days of intermittent visits to the plaza. Chupeta estimated he and his best friend Alexander consume four seven-ounce cans of glue each day. The four cans cost them $10. Alda Marco Antonio, the new secretary for minors, has heard the stories of police brutal- ity and corruption, she said, and wants a new police unit of officers trained in psychology and social work to handle juvenile violations. It is an ambitious wish list, considering thal the government now sponsors only one shelte for the thousands of street children, and il accommodates only about 180 per night. When there is so much to be done, almos' anything can help. Chupeta, for example, when last seen by visiting journalists, had just returned to hi plaza base from a night at the governmen shelter. He was carting a shoe-shine box anc talked about working for his money. Medics a the shelter had treated his ear infection — he still had an ear stuffed with cotton — and streaks of iodine covered scratches on his foot and leg. It was treatment a kid might get back home. cena a eee \f"

        "ocr_text": "Thai system uses innocence for Popular sex trade means of investment By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE PATTAYA, Thailand — Pen was surprised the second time her father sold her into prostitution. She was only 13. But this time she managed to escape from a brothel in this coastal town ‘and find refuge in a Bangkok “safe house” for fugitive child prostitutes. Now Pen worries the pimps are hunting her and will take out their loss on her father, a peasant farmer. “My father was depressed because he was in very huge debt. My mother was sick,” she l t a STOLEN CHILDHOOD @ FIFTH OF SIX PARTS said, expressing only sorrow, not anger at what her father did to her. Conservative estimates place 30,000 child prostitutes in Thailand, many of them kept against their will. The Christian home that RICK McKAY/COX WASHINGTON BURESA Khomnoi ‘Joy’ Yajai, 16, a prostitute took in Pen had been open less than two months when she was interviewed earlier this year. It housed six young refugees from the flesh trade. Sex is a big-profit industry in Thailand. It is an accepted investment for even respected businessmen, just as frequenting brothels is an accepted pastime. Ownership of the house where Pen worked, Baan 150 (House 150), was traced through land records at Pattaya City Hall to Arkhom Thephasadin, a philanthropist in a Thai family that has been prominent in business and government. Baan 150 and the stories of the girls who work there reveal in microcosm the outrage of child prostitution in Thailand. Such conditions exist because the government denies their ex- istence and because police are bribed to turn their backs to them. They are conditions rooted in a history of slavery, polygamy and concubinage, and they are nourished today by cultural biases attach- ing low esteem to women in general and to the people of a particular region of the country — Thailand’s northern peasants. Child prostitution exists all over the world, from Bombay to Atlanta. Nearly everywhere it happens because people with money and power are allowed to accrue more at the ex- pense of people who have neither. In Thai- land, it appears to have gone further than any- where else. “There are a lot of foreigners who ask me about child prostitution,” Voravaun Thana- phibul, director of the women and child-labor division of the Thai government’s Interior Ministry, told Cox Newspapers reporters. SEE THAI/8 Dayton Daily News - June 25, 1987 (And Other Cox Papers) \f At the sound ofa bell, girls must get on hands and knees, enter through low door and wait Thai CONTINUED FROM/1 “| want to tell you, there are no statistics on child prostitution in our country because we ~€an say we have no child prostitution.” - That is the official government stand, the Same as the one taken last year when the Thai “delegate to the UNICEF Executive Board [\"Iédged an official protest against a UNICEF- “fanded publication citing ‘100,000 prostitutes ‘win Bangkok alone, many of them no more than \"92 or 13 years old.” = One scholarly survey published by the Unit- ~séd Nations’ International Labor Organization ~in 1982 estimated 500,000 Thai women © worked as prostitutes.

I have seen a very ‘poor family with three beautiful daughters make a very big house, and buy land for grow- ing rice and vegetables.” The young girls in the sex trade do come primarily from the depressed north, where there are many landless families and little eco- nomic development. Although the north has been a disfavored stepchild in Thailand, the women there traditionally are held to be the most beautiful in the country. The combination makes them beacons for exploitation. Pen and Joy The cases of two girls found at Baan 150 in Pattaya, about 75 miles south of Bangkok, il- lustrate how the system works. Pen became an unwilling hooker at age 13. An agent came to her village last year and told the families about jobs for their daughters in the cities. Her debt-ridden peasant father grasped at the chance for cash and climbed on the bus with the agent and Pen. He left her at ‘he house in the honky-tonk beach resort of Pattaya in return for the local equivalent of $240. Pen spent three-and-a-half months servic- ing Baan 150’s tourist clients — mostly men from Arab countries and Asian neighbors, with a smattering of Europeans and a few Americans. Then the debt was declared paid off and Pen returned home. But not for long. “My father said, ‘You have already sold yourself. Don’t embarrass us by being here. Go back.’ \"’ And so, she said, he sold her services to the same house in Pattaya again, this time for $400. Although Pen was let out of Baan 150 to spend nights with customers at hotels and beach houses, she said she was afraid to flee and didn’t know where to go. She finally got out with the help of a cus- tomer, an Arab man who asked about her sad- ness and found her story too compelling to ignore. He brought her to Bangkok and turned her over to a private children’s welfare group. Not all the girls are coerced into lives of prostitution, at least not physically coerced. Khomnoi “Joy” Yajai, 16, was found among the crew of prostitutes at Baan 150 by a Cox photo-journalist, who went there to photo- graph the interior of the place and to pay to get out a girl who might be interviewed. Joy agreed to be interviewed about herself and life at Baan 150. Joy's story was different. She, too, came from a poor family in a northern village, but voluntarily entered the sex business when she was 15 to help her relatives. “I sold my virginity, at Sattahip,” she said, referring to the coastal town with a Thai naval base. Joy got $200 upon arrival, which she said she immediately sent home to her father. She said her bosses never explained the pay sys- tem at that brothel, but when she asked the management to settle her account five months later, she was $80 ahead. She took the money and went home. $240 loan, 100 men A month later, Joy met a woman agent from Pattaya, who recruited four girls from her vil- lage to work at Baan 150. Joy was one of them. “When we arrived, the agent was paid 10,000 baht ($400)” for the four girls, Joy said. Joy calculates she has sent her father at least $800 from loans she took at Sattahip and at Baan 150, then worked off. The management of Baan 150 made an esti- mated return of at least 12-to-1 from Pen and more than 2-to-1 from Joy, who kept close watch on the books. Pen arrived as a virgin. Her childlike, inno- cent looks brought higher-than-normal fees. Pen said she usually was sold for $60 a night. She worked for three-and-a-half months on her first stint. She estimated she went to bed with nearly 100 men before the original $240 loan to her father was declared repaid. Even if she had slept with only 50 men, Baan 150 would, at that rate, have made $3,000 from its original $240 loan to Pen’s father. Pen, who personally received only tips giv- en at the whim of customers, said she thinks the management often failed to credit her debt account. That is why, she says, it took her so long to work off the debt. Joy, by contrast, kept account of her loans and made sure she was credited for all her work. Apparently because she was older, the boss decided he could only charge $20 for each all- night session. Of that amount, Joy said, $6 was credited to her account and the house kept $14. Joy took loans totalling $680 over six months at Baan 150, which means she made an average of $113 a month for her work, and the house made $264. RICK McKAY/COX WASHINGTON BUREAU as customers peruse them At least 50 girls were used by Baan 150, the two girls said. If the 50 worked as much as Joy — and watched their accounts more closely than Pen — the math suggests the house should gross nearly $160,000 a year. The girls were fed two meals a day and given floor mats for sleeping. But they had to buy their own clothes, makeup and birth-con- trol pills from tips, as well as pay for medical checkups. So who got the profits? Honored family Files in Pattaya City Hall show that Arkhom Thephasadin Na Ayudhya of Bangkok had reg- istered the house number known as Baan 150 in 1980. The title Na Ayudhya is an honor granted to a family by Thailand’s royalty. Arkhom was described by a Thai criminal investigator as a 61-year-old businessman who runs a string of small shops in Bangkok and who is known as “‘a very charitably mind- ed person” involved in the Red Cross. In a Bangkok interview, Arkhom acknowl- edged he still owned the house called Baan 150 and that a man named Sayan manages it. Told that there were young girls working at the house, Arkhom asked a reporter, “How many girls are there there?” “About 50. They are prostitutes,” porter replied. Arkhom, not disputing that prostitution went on at Baan 150, asked, “All very young?” The reporter said, ‘Some young. Some not.” Arkhom said he would talk to Sayan about the young girls there, and thanked a reporter for his concern. Col. Sornsee of the Thai police said there isn't much that can be done about child prosti- tution, nor about the people who profit from it. “In 99 percent of the cases, the parent sold the re- \fthe children,” he said. “If it is like this, who will make the complaint to police?” The girls themselves seldom will testify against their bosses, and almost never against their parents, he said. They are silenced by the strong bond of family loyalty. The Children’s Rights Protection Center in Bangkok, where Pen was first taken upon es- caping from Baan 150, confronts the same problem of girls refusing to make complaints. The center’s director said in Pen’s case, for example, he had no doubts about her story, but would take no further action once she was safely placed. “Her conditions were not so bad. She had some freedom. Some can’t ever see any sun- light. They never go outside,” said the direc- tor, named only Sanphasit. “Even in the bad brothels, where they keep the girls inside day and night, I cannot do anything. So I can't act against this one.” Only in the worst cases of coercion will Sanphasit try to get police action, he said, and usuaily that is limited to freeing the youngest girls. His group rescued 19 girls from brothels in the last half of 1986, the youngest of whom was 12. The previous year, they freed an 11- year-old. But Sanphasit said he seldom can move against the owner or get a place shut down. “Most of the police are sympathetic to brothel owners,” Sanphasit said, charging bribes are passed to police throughout Thailand. “We know it happens,” said Col. Sornsee, when asked about police bribes. He said the penalties are severe — up to life imprisonment Prostitution profits paying for new house By Marcia Kunstetl COX NEWS SERVICE AE KHAO TOM, Thailand — The new wooden house sitting on stilts back from the dirt road is a tribute to the 16-year-old gir! — but that harsh penalties have not stopped police corruption anywhere in the world.

She admitted knowing only a little about AIDS, from reading the newspapers. Management at Baan 150 never talks to the girls about those things.

        "ocr_text": "Thai system uses innocence for Popular sex trade means of investment By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE PATTAYA, Thailand — Pen was surprised the second time her father sold her into prostitution. She was only 13. But this time she managed to escape from a brothel in this coastal town ‘and find refuge in a Bangkok “safe house” for fugitive child prostitutes. Now Pen worries the pimps are hunting her and will take out their loss on her father, a peasant farmer. “My father was depressed because he was in very huge debt. My mother was sick,” she l t a STOLEN CHILDHOOD @ FIFTH OF SIX PARTS said, expressing only sorrow, not anger at what her father did to her. Conservative estimates place 30,000 child prostitutes in Thailand, many of them kept against their will. The Christian home that RICK McKAY/COX WASHINGTON BURESA Khomnoi ‘Joy’ Yajai, 16, a prostitute took in Pen had been open less than two months when she was interviewed earlier this year. It housed six young refugees from the flesh trade. Sex is a big-profit industry in Thailand. It is an accepted investment for even respected businessmen, just as frequenting brothels is an accepted pastime. Ownership of the house where Pen worked, Baan 150 (House 150), was traced through land records at Pattaya City Hall to Arkhom Thephasadin, a philanthropist in a Thai family that has been prominent in business and government. Baan 150 and the stories of the girls who work there reveal in microcosm the outrage of child prostitution in Thailand. Such conditions exist because the government denies their ex- istence and because police are bribed to turn their backs to them. They are conditions rooted in a history of slavery, polygamy and concubinage, and they are nourished today by cultural biases attach- ing low esteem to women in general and to the people of a particular region of the country — Thailand’s northern peasants. Child prostitution exists all over the world, from Bombay to Atlanta. Nearly everywhere it happens because people with money and power are allowed to accrue more at the ex- pense of people who have neither. In Thai- land, it appears to have gone further than any- where else. “There are a lot of foreigners who ask me about child prostitution,” Voravaun Thana- phibul, director of the women and child-labor division of the Thai government’s Interior Ministry, told Cox Newspapers reporters.

I have seen a very ‘poor family with three beautiful daughters make a very big house, and buy land for grow- ing rice and vegetables.” The young girls in the sex trade do come primarily from the depressed north, where there are many landless families and little eco- nomic development. Although the north has been a disfavored stepchild in Thailand, the women there traditionally are held to be the most beautiful in the country. The combination makes them beacons for exploitation. Pen and Joy The cases of two girls found at Baan 150 in Pattaya, about 75 miles south of Bangkok, il- lustrate how the system works. Pen became an unwilling hooker at age 13. An agent came to her village last year and told the families about jobs for their daughters in the cities. Her debt-ridden peasant father grasped at the chance for cash and climbed on the bus with the agent and Pen. He left her at ‘he house in the honky-tonk beach resort of Pattaya in return for the local equivalent of $240. Pen spent three-and-a-half months servic- ing Baan 150’s tourist clients — mostly men from Arab countries and Asian neighbors, with a smattering of Europeans and a few Americans. Then the debt was declared paid off and Pen returned home. But not for long. “My father said, ‘You have already sold yourself. Don’t embarrass us by being here. Go back.’ \"’ And so, she said, he sold her services to the same house in Pattaya again, this time for $400. Although Pen was let out of Baan 150 to spend nights with customers at hotels and beach houses, she said she was afraid to flee and didn’t know where to go. She finally got out with the help of a cus- tomer, an Arab man who asked about her sad- ness and found her story too compelling to ignore. He brought her to Bangkok and turned her over to a private children’s welfare group. Not all the girls are coerced into lives of prostitution, at least not physically coerced. Khomnoi “Joy” Yajai, 16, was found among the crew of prostitutes at Baan 150 by a Cox photo-journalist, who went there to photo- graph the interior of the place and to pay to get out a girl who might be interviewed. Joy agreed to be interviewed about herself and life at Baan 150. Joy's story was different. She, too, came from a poor family in a northern village, but voluntarily entered the sex business when she was 15 to help her relatives. “I sold my virginity, at Sattahip,” she said, referring to the coastal town with a Thai naval base.

These days, the youngest “child laborer” who lives at the hostel is 17. It is a testimonial to how far South Korea’s drive for mass education has gone in one de- cade toward wiping out the shame of child exploita- tion in the workplace. “Ten years ago, the child laborers were 12 to 13 years old.”” said the Rev.

HINE/LIBRARY OF CONGRESS Lest we forget and adopt a holier- than-thou attitude toward other na- tions. . . the United States, in its own rush to industrialize, was not above the use of child labor in diffi- cult and dangerous situations. We, too, were guilty on a large scale of stunting childhoods. A forlorn little la- borer (above) toils in the Globe Cot- ton Mill, Augusta, Ga., in January 1909. Boys (left) labor in an Indiana glass factory in this August 1908 photo. CONTINUED FROM/1 Korea, Kenya [aah We = formed Congress this year when it reported that child labor abuses in Thailand “are con- fined to” small manufacturing enterprises pro- ducing “for the local market.” The U.S. embassy in Bangkok, which draft- ed the statement, had reason to know this was wrong. The embassy’s files contained a 1985 report to the Thai government by the United Nations’ International Labor Organization which said explicitly that child labor had grown in Thai- land as a direct result of the expansion of ex- ports. The human-rights report cited the ILO document to make a different point but ig- nored the description of children working in export-oriented factories. The skimpiness of the labor sections con- trasts with the State Department's franker, more effective reporting on political prisoners, treatment of refugees and press liberties. In some countries, just the prospect of a critical report has been enough of an incentive for leaders to lighten repression. @ Western governments could signal:their disapproval of child exploitation whenever they get the chance. This doesn’t always happen. Last October, for instance, Nancy Adams, the head of the Middle East branch of the White House trade office, held a two-hour seminar for businessmen in Fez, a center of See ee ee a Te Moroccan carpet making, on how carpets and other Moroccan handicrafts could be exported to the United States duty-free. Adams did not, she confirmed later, mention the U.S. legal requirement that countries have a minimum age for work in order to qualify for duty-free trade. She said the U.S. embassy in Morocco had not briefed her on widespread child labor in Fez carpet factories. The Navy also could send more signals. It could, for instance, declare off-limits to sailors on shore leave certain hangouts — suchas the Baan 150 house of prostitution in Thailand and the Firehouse girlie bar in the Philippines — which have been shown to hire 13-year-old girls. ‘ @ Above all, UNICEF, the world agency de- voted to protecting children’s rights, could put the issue of exploited working childrem back on the world’s agenda. , UNICEF posters in the 1970s used to call attention to children working in factories. But in the last five years UNICEF has turned its attention almost exclusively to less controver- sial issues, such as spreading vaccines and oral rehydration therapy against diarrhea. With its size and prestige, UNICEF is-in a position to apply leverage to help eliminate well-documented outrages such as open child prostitution or 7-year-olds weaving in carpet factories. Why not UNICEF? Kenyan sociologist Onyango says, “The In- ternational Monetary Fund does it, the World Bank does it, why not UNICEF? If I could influence a situation, I would try to do it. I would tell Morocco to clean up its act (in the carpet factories) or else. We should not treat these people gently.” UNICEF executive director James P. Grant disagrees. He prefers to direct UNICEF’Ss ef- forts toward less controversial health projects that reach more children. “Where you have to really bring about structural change, where people will fight you in the process, it is obviously going to take much more effort than in those areas where you can bring tremendous progress to children where there is relatively little outright opposi- tion,” Grant said. In Bangkok, one of the world centers of child prostitution and sweatshops filled with children, UNICEF maintains an 8C-person re- gional office to administer progr.ms through- out East Asia and Pakistan. When asked why UNICEF keeps the head- quarters in Bangkok, Grant said that not only is Bangkok a convenient hub, but also Thai- land has a good record in areas other than prostitution, such asdowering infant mortality and spreading literacy.

Not all of these children were working, but Fer- min, 5, steadily carted burlap sacks to his mother and collected cut onions off the ground. He was wet and cold. The onion odor was perva- sive. All the workers would wear it for days. ‘Normally he goes to pre-school, Fermin said, but this morning his mother brought him and his two younger brothers out to the field. “I don’t have any place to leave them,” said his mother. _ Juanita Valdez Cox, an organizer with the United Farm Workers of America here, said the economics of piecework pay — so much per bag or box picked — often forces parents to take their children out of classes to work. The contribution of even small children can help. ~“*The onion season is only four to six weeks long. What else can you do but pull your kids out of school one or two days a week?” she said. “They have so little money they have to use their kids.” Thousands of migrant and seasonal farm workers are based here on the rich land of the Rio Grande Valley. Their children often begin work illegally when they are 6 or 7. If they don't start in Texas Dayton Daily News fields, then they begin in the citrus groves of Florida or harvesting vegetables in Ohio, Georgia, New York or Washington state, wherever the hunt for work leads their parents. On all but very small farms, children under 12 cannot work the fields legally. In almost every state it is also illegal for children under 16 to work during school hours. Many migrant farm worker children do both. They are the biggest and most identifiable remnant of child labor in the United States. But they are not the only remnant. While youngsters work throughout the United States, efforts to protect them from abusive condi- tions have been extensive and largely successful. With the exception of migrant farm workers, children rarely hold jobs before their teen-age years and seldom work instead of going to school until they are 16. Luxuries Again except on farms, when children work in this country it usually is not because their families need the money to survive. Authorities who enforce child-labor laws “gs a pd ebomelf = of es is quisitiv t ey for CK Pear WASHINGTON BUREAU An ary harvest in south Texas — the economics of piecework often forces parents to use their children in the fields Child labor remains stubborn crop Old problem lingers in fields; violations pop up elsewhere, too luxuries. In 1986, the U.S. Department of Labor took ac- tion in cases involving 12,662 minors working ille- gally, three-quarters of them age 15 and under. Only 301 of the cases involved agricultural jobs, according to department statistics. “T've found them as young as 9 years old,” said Philip LaLena, a federal labor inspector based in Grand Junction, Colo. He normally finds illegal child workers during his wage-and-hour inspections in the 23 counties he covers in western Colorado and eastern Utah. Or he discovers them, he said, when they are injured on the job, most often from operating kitchen slicers or other machinery that by law they are too young to use. In Massachusetts, accidents raised the alarm over child labor in the state Department of Labor and Industries in 1985. In one, a 14-year-old illegally driving a 27-ton earth-mover ran over and killed a fellow construction worker. Sampling injury records to check the extent of child work in the first nine months of 1986, the department found 1,508 cases of youths age 14 to 17 who were injured on the job, and nearly every case involved illegal work. perience in the work - June 26, 1987 (Continued) \fChild labor remains stubborn crop place. They don't understand the dangers they're dealing with,” said Andrew Currie, director of in- dustrial safety in Massachusetts He estimated 6,000 or more minors age 17 and under are injured at work every year in his state Blitz A recent blitz of nighttime work places produced about 200 citations for child-labor violations, and Currie said his inspection teams are getting set for more action during peak summer employment In Georgia, officials over the last two years switched to a more intensive, systematic inspection Maria Gomez has hope for Maribel, 9 Last year Georgia inspectors turned up illega child labor in 48 percent of the 2,465 places inspect: ed, said Ginger Blackstone, the department’s publi: information director. Countless children all over the country also ari involved in criminal work, from the girls age 10 t 15 caught in February working a sex-for-drugs rinj in Paterson, N.J., to a 9-year-old boy in Columbus Ga., arrested by the Georgia Bureau of Investigatioi in 1985 for selling marijuana for his mother, Drugs, sex Authorities in major cities from Miami to Atlant; to Denver say they are finding younger childrei drawn into both drug and sex sales today. Ofte: they are runaways who are easy targets for pimp! or pushers | One area still controversial is work that keeps children on the streets to sell candy or kitchen wares or to deliver newspapers, These jobs often are regulated by less-stringent state laws, The em- ploying companies are too small to come under fed eral law or, as in the case of newspapers, have been exempted, Managers of sales networks often do violate even the most permissive state laws, using children who are too young or keeping them out too late at night, Legally-run operations still get criticized for taking young children to strange neighborhoods to knock on strange doors with no adult protection nearby, In the case of newspaper delivery, old questions of children’s exposure to crime and traffic may be more urgent in today’s high-crime, high-speed society, A survey of newspaper carriers of California's San Jose Mercury News found one-third of them had experienced at least one “scary” situation on the job. Two newsboys from the Des Moines Regis ter in Towa have disappeared since 1983, and are presumed kidnapped, That problem is withering for other reasons, however, as newspaper circulation departments In- creasingly turn to more reliable and available adult carriers and as coln boxes gain popularity. Whatever the job, work conditions in the United States rarely degenerate to the scandalous dangers, low pay and endless hours of work suffered by children in places such as India and Thailand, But it Wasn't 80 long ago that they were as bad It's the law Improvements in the United States have been Critical just in the last 80 years, since the days when children labored in Pennsylvania coal mines and glass-manufacturing plants across the country, It has been only 49 years since the Fair Labor Stan- dards Act set a national minimum work age of 16 for normal work and 18 for dangerous jobs covered by federal law The law says teen-agers 14 and 15 may work for limited hours in various jobs, but not in manufactur: Ing, mining and most processing work, Younger children may deliver newspapers, perform as actors and work In non-hazardous jobs In their parents’ husinesers Federal laws cover non-farm employers in each state who do more than $362,500 in business a year or who are involved in interstate commerce. They also cover farms with an employee work force large enough to require federal minimum wage pay. State laws regulate other employers, and in about half the states are stronger than the federal laws, While many occupations have been declared off- limits for children, one new job has appeared for youngsters in recent years. Fast-food restaurants hire teen-agers in droves, Reverse trend It is the burger bins and chicken shacks of the country that helped spawn efforts to reverse the long trend of giving more and more protection to young workers, So far, moves to set a lower minimum wage for teen-agers and to lengthen the hours they may work have failed, A 1982 proposal by the Reagan administration to extend work hours for 14- and 15-year-olds drew quick, wide opposition, Within days after the De- partment of Labor presented its plan to Congress, resolutions were filed in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to prohibit it from taking effect. “That was when everyone was talking about Reaganomics,” said Gordon Claugherty, the depart- ment's director of farm and child labor programs, “They accused us of practicing ‘Faginomics,’” The reference was to Fagin, the oily old crook in Charles Dickens’ novel Ol/ver Twist who made money by training pauper boys in crime, The department dropped its proposal. Sometimes the courts also have acted in chil- dren's behalf. Federal law, for example, empowers the Labor Department to grant waivers for children under 12 to be hired for farm work. But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington ruled the depart- ment cannot issue waivers unless it shows there is no danger to children from pesticides, “We don’t know the effect of chemicals and pes- ticides, especially on young kids,” Claugherty said, “Unless the grower shows he doesn't use any chem- icals or can prove there is zero risk, we won't grant a waiver.” There are no waivers in effect now.

In the fields That does not mean there are no small children in the fields, Young Fermin in McAllen is an example. His mother said a crew leader had warned her that morning not to bring her children again, but that is not always what happens, Pressures often bear on migrant farm workers from landowners or crew leaders who want fields stripped quickly. In Homestead, Fla., for instance, social workers tell of one crew leader who will give housing only to people with at least six workers in the family, If there are enough children, they can take turns going to school. The great majority of farmworker children do not labor fulltime during the school year. But sum- mer work often begins for them In April or May and sneaks on into September or October. “They come late Into the system and leave early,\" sald Wendell Rollason, director of the Redlands Christian Migrant Association in Florida, “The first time the kids hit school may be in November,” Most are Hispanics whose families have retained cultural traditions and speak Spanish as their first or only language, which also contributes to school dropout rates among Hispanics as high as 45 per: cent in Texas. Pedro Gomez, 17, who lives near McAllen, is one of the boys who quit school because his family was desperate for money. His father had léft home and his mother could not earn enough In farm work to keep up with the needs of four children, Gomez dropped out when he was 15, before he even entered high school. “They tried to keep me in school, but I told them Wwe needed the money,” he said, At least the work of her older children may save the future of her youngest. Gomez sald with some pride that her year-old daughter Maribel has bares ly worked at all, \f"

These days, the youngest “child laborer” who lives at the hostel is 17. It is a testimonial to how far South Korea’s drive for mass education has gone in one de- cade toward wiping out the shame of child exploita- tion in the workplace. “Ten years ago, the child laborers were 12 to 13 years old.”” said the Rev. Cho Seung Hyuk. “Now the child laborer we are talking about may be 18 to 20.\" Cho, who heads the workers hostel, is a Korean labor rights activist who has been arrested 15 times for his labor activities.

CONTINUED FROM/1 Korea, Kenya [aah We = formed Congress this year when it reported that child labor abuses in Thailand “are con- fined to” small manufacturing enterprises pro- ducing “for the local market.” The U.S. embassy in Bangkok, which draft- ed the statement, had reason to know this was wrong. The embassy’s files contained a 1985 report to the Thai government by the United Nations’ International Labor Organization which said explicitly that child labor had grown in Thai- land as a direct result of the expansion of ex- ports. The human-rights report cited the ILO document to make a different point but ig- nored the description of children working in export-oriented factories. The skimpiness of the labor sections con- trasts with the State Department's franker, more effective reporting on political prisoners, treatment of refugees and press liberties. In some countries, just the prospect of a critical report has been enough of an incentive for leaders to lighten repression. @ Western governments could signal:their disapproval of child exploitation whenever they get the chance. This doesn’t always happen. Last October, for instance, Nancy Adams, the head of the Middle East branch of the White House trade office, held a two-hour seminar for businessmen in Fez, a center of See ee ee a Te Moroccan carpet making, on how carpets and other Moroccan handicrafts could be exported to the United States duty-free. Adams did not, she confirmed later, mention the U.S. legal requirement that countries have a minimum age for work in order to qualify for duty-free trade. She said the U.S. embassy in Morocco had not briefed her on widespread child labor in Fez carpet factories. The Navy also could send more signals. It could, for instance, declare off-limits to sailors on shore leave certain hangouts — suchas the Baan 150 house of prostitution in Thailand and the Firehouse girlie bar in the Philippines — which have been shown to hire 13-year-old girls. ‘ @ Above all, UNICEF, the world agency de- voted to protecting children’s rights, could put the issue of exploited working childrem back on the world’s agenda. , UNICEF posters in the 1970s used to call attention to children working in factories.
