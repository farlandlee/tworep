        "ocr_text": "Tension over speech builds in S. Africa By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE CAPE TOWN, South Africa — With the whereabouts of political prisoner Nelson Mandela suddenly a mystery, South Africans awaited to- day’s pivotal speech by President F.W. de Klerk spelling out how far South Africa's 5 million whites are ready to go in sharing power with the 25 million-strong black majority. As night fell Thursday, hawkers sold newspapers carrying the banner headline “FW, Mandela Fever.” pers were reporting, based on an of- ficial background briefing, that de Klerk had invited Mandela to the meeting to “iron out problems” relat- ed to his release. As the day sweltered on, camera crews from around the world staked out de Klerk’s 300-year-old Tuyn- huys office, where the last session between the two took place Dec. 13. After nightfall, a spokesman for de Klerk issued a bland statement that said, “In response to numerous me- dia queries and widespread specula- tion, it can be stated that a meeting did not take place today between State President F.W. de Klerk and Mr. Nelson Mandela. Furthermore, no such meeting is planned before the opening of parliament Feb. 2.” While no explanation was forth- coming, it seemed probable that Mandela spent much of the day in secret talks with de Klerk’s top aides, and that these initial sessions failed to “iron out” disagreements, By midafternoon, Mandela’s bun- galow was still being guarded by two khaki-uniformed white guard Even an announcer on South Africa's government-controlled television re- ported that interest in de Klerk’s speech to parliament “is running at a fever pitch.” There was a sense among all races that this is a moment of great agony for the white Afrikaaner establish- ment, which has dominated the country since its creation. De Klerk, backed by the young, more moderate Afrikaaners, has been striving to end South Africa's status as. an interna- tional pariah by projecting what he has called a “new and totally there had been no sign of a motor- cade returning the world’s most fam- ous political prisoner to his barbed- wired luxury confines. A quick release was so widely an- ticipated that White House spokes- man Marlin Fitzwater was forced to revise a statement that President Bush would invite the black leader to Washington as soon as possible “if Mandela is released tomorrow, as is expected.” Pressed by reporters lat- er, Fitzwater said that although Man- dela’s release was “widely expect- ed,” Bush had no independent knowledge of the timing. Mandela's wife, Winnie, said last week that problems had arisen in Mandela's talks with government ne- gotiators about the terms under which he would accept release from his life term for plotting to overthrow the government. She said her hus- band would not cooperate in his re- lease unless the government met a series of conditions. She said Mandela, the former lead- er of the military wing of the African changed South Africa.” But Mandela, patient after nearly 28 years in prison, was showing that he was in no hurry to settle on a new deal for South African blacks just be- cause the white president was due to make the most important speech of his six-month career as president. De Klerk will address parliament at 11 a.m. today (4 a.m. EST) and the speech will be carried live on radio and television. Thursday was full of last-minute talks between de Klerk and his parliamentary allies, and ap- parently also between Mandela and National Congress, had insisted that de Klerk announce the lifting of the three-year-old state of emergency, the lifting of the ban against the ANC, and the repeal of restrictions on more than 30 anti-apartheid organizations. Of these demands, lifting the state of emergency would be the easiest, and the most difficult would be the lifting of the ban against the ANC, which still commands widespread loyalty among blacks even though it has been officially erased from the country’s political life for three decades. One sign of the awe whites hold for Mandela’s power was a newspaper report that a French-made television documentary on his life had been ap- proved for broadcast in South Africa by the government's Publications Control Board. De Klerk moved quickly on Wednesday to avoid a political crisis over the recent death in police custo- dy of Clayton Sithole, the reputed former lover of Mandela’s daughter, Zindzi. De Klerk used his broad powers to begin an immediate judicial inquiry. aides to de Klerk. At 4:30 a.m. Thursday, a motor- cade sped out of the Victor Versster prison farm, in the wine country 35 miles from Cape Town, where Man- dela, 71, has lived in a palm-shaded bungalow since December 1988. Waiting journalists quickly con- cluded that the two midsized cars and a minivan were carrying Man- dela to a climactic meeting with de Klerk.

        "ocr_text": "S. African blacks closer to freedom De Klerk ends ANC ban, but apartheid still intact By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondents CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Joyful blacks spilled into South African streets Friday, celebrat- ing the new freedom President Frederik W. de Klerk granted the black majority and crying out for one thing he did not grant: imme- diate freedom for Nelson R. Mandela. “I want to put it plainly that the government has decided to re- lease Nelson Mandela uncondi- tionally,” Mr. de Klerk said in a historic speech opening a session of Parliament. “Unfortunately, a further short passage of time is unavoidable.” If Mr. Mandela’s confinement stretches from days to weeks, it seemed likely that the initial ela- tion in the black townships would turn to flery rage. In his speech, Mr. de Klerk also lifted the three-decade ban on Mr. Mandela’s African Nation- al Congress (ANC) and legalized three dozen other anti-apartheid groups. However, he left intact many central provisions of apart- heid, the official policy of racial separation. Mr. de Klerk also vowed to free political prisoners, call a moratorium on executions, ease media censorship and withdraw other provisions of the state of emergency in effect since 1986. Although Mr. de Klerk said Mr. Mandela will be released “soon,” he left the world guessing about the precise time. The hopes of tens of millions of people throughout the African continent are bearing down on the shoulders of Mr. Mandela, 71, a former trial lawyer and revolu- donary who has been kept in prison for 27 years. * Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu we Friday he fully expects Mr. ndela to be equal to the chal- nese of uniting and leading the agmented black majority in t@lks with the dominant whites. +, “His role is indispensable,” id Archbishop Tutu, who was arded the Nobel Peace Prize if 1984 for his anti-apartheid ef- forts but never has challenged Mr. Mandela’s stature as the pre- eminent South African black leader. “Nelson won’t ‘be alone, t he is crucial. ’ “I think when he comes out, is going to be seen as the one rson who is able to hold togeth- people of divergent views,” Archbishop Tutu said. »» Meanwhile, Archbishop Tutu ve Mr. de Klerk credit “for be- i@g very brave” in initiating meaningful changes. The cleric said, however, that it is too soon rescind his call for internation- economic sanctions against South Africa. *, Other opposition leaders also ve mixed reviews to Mr. de erk’s effort to begin easing cks into the political system, lcoming the changes while crit- igizing them as too limited. ‘tg In an authorized march in ntown coke Town, more than seo apartheid protesters peace- ly trod past the 300-year-old brick building where Mr. de éerk was speaking. e, ANC leaders in this demon- tion, including Mr. Mandela’s fe, Winnie, chided Mr. de Klerk r not cutting deeper into the bric of apartheid with his reforms. * “We are not prepared to ac- t a bone with no meat,” Mrs. ndela said. ‘‘Unbanning the C and leaving apartheid as it ig'is no deal.” ’ Meanwhile in Johannesburg, POlice used force to break up cel- Frederik W. de Klerk told South Africans that the “season of violence” ‘is over in the racially divided land. ebrating crowds in several places, employing tear gas, rubber bul- lets, dogs and batons. A police statement said groups of blacks were disrupting traffic, throwing stones and burning objects. The United Democratic Front, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups that once again will be- come legal under Mr. de Klerk’s announcement, welcomed the reforms. UDF leaders said they “con- cede the boldness of some of the steps of the government” but that . they insist upon satisfaction of all demands made in the Harare Declaration, a document drawn up last year in Harare, Zimbabwe. The Congress of South African Trade Unions also criticized the government for failing to meet conditions of that declaration. These include removing troops from the townships where non- whites live, ending the state of emergency, releasing all political prisoners and detainees, and end- ing all repressive legislation. “This will serve as a real plat- form to forge a permanent and lasting peace,” the unions’ state- ment said. Mr. de Klerk also vowed to free political prisoners, call a moratorium on. executions and ease media censorship. Mr. de Klerk’s proposals drew ositive comments from world eaders, including President Bush and British Prime Minister Mar- garet Thatcher, and from reform- minded whites at home. “He’s done a hell of a-lot com- pared to previous presidents,” said Luigi Battiston, 23, a white clerk at Cape Town City Hall. “Everything he has promised, he has delivered. De Klerk made a promise for reform, and he is sticking by it.” The reaction from the small ultra-right white opposition was predictably vitriolic. Eugene Ter- re’blanche, leader of the Afri- kaanse Weerstandsbeweging, said legalization of the ANC means the government is being handed over to the ANC and Communists. In swéeping away decades of banning orders and restrictions that have kept 25 million blacks from speaking out freely for an end to white rule, Mr. de Klerk held out the prospect of free- wheeling negotiations with emerging black leaders on how to share power. | De Klerk aides said Oliver Tambo, long-exiled president of the ANC, is free to return to South Africa immediately. Hours later, there were reports at Mr. Tambo’s formér home in Wattville that members of the ailing lead- er’s family are negotiating to buy back his old home, apparently in preparation for his return.

Shantytowns wait for new freedoms to trickle down Albright Journal-Constitution correspondents CROSSROADS TOWNSHIP, South Africa — When people awoke here Saturday in crude shacks spread across acres of sand and muck, one thing was dif- ferent: a green, yellow and black flag of the African National Con- gress flapped in breezes high over their heads. Blacks engulfed in the most anguishing poverty in this country still had no electricity in their wobbly homes of boards and tin. And some still had to trek 30 min- utes round trip to standpipes for fresh water. Filthy stagnant pools dotted the rugged grounds. “I saw the flag this morning for the first time,” said Jeffrey Nongwe, 64, an unemployed truck driver. ‘‘I don’t know where it came from, but it brought me great joy.” The reforms announced Fri- day by President Frederik W. de Klerk will not soon change the terrible life in Crossroads or in the hundreds of other ghettos where most of the country’s 25 million blacks are crowded. But Mr. de Klerk legalized the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups. He promised to release impris- oned ANC leader Nelson R. Man- dela “soon.” And he imposed a moratorium on hangings. In Crossroads, 20 miles east of the well-scrubbed Parliament building in Cape Town where Mr. de Klerk spoke, it was the pros- pect of new political freedoms that gave the most hope to blacks who said that for the first time in 30 years, they looked up at the ae flag without fearing a police raid. “We were surprised,” said .

There are no playgrounds, no hospital. We don’t even have fields for netball or rugby for the children.” Mr. Nongwe, chairman of a Crossroads civic group, agreed that the problems are huge. “What the president said is only a step toward change. There's still a lot to be done,” he said. “But if the president lives up to what he said yesterday, I'll be happy because it will be easier for the organizations to operate openly.” Mr. de Klerk’s government Saturday implemented some of his promises, publishing in the of- ficial gazette a notice that the ANC, the South African Commu- nist Party (SACP) and other groups had been “unbanned” and are free to operate. A Justice Department spokes- man said later Saturday that all organizations declared unlawful now are legal, as are all their publications.

The government also pub- lished 175 names that were re- moved from the Internal Security Act list of people who are not al- lowed to speak in public in South Africa, to be quoted in the media or have their writings published. They include Oliver Tambo, 72, the ailing president of the ANC who is recovering from a stroke in exile in Sweden; Joe Slovo, a leader of the SACP and member of the ANC executive council, also in exile; Tom Se- bina, the ANC spokesman in ex- ile; Helen Joseph, 84, a liberal white former member of Parlia- ment; Donald Woods, the former newspaper editor whose experi- ence was the basis of the movie “Cry Freedom”; and Govan Mbeki, 79, an ANC leader who was released from prison under severe restrictions in 1987 There was no indication when the government would deliver on Mr. de Klerk’s promise to release Mr. Mandela, but on the evening rv news. an announce prred off-handedly to his release as be- ing “imminent.” There was front- page speculation in Cape Town's Weekend Argus that Mr. Mandela might have been moved from the Victor Verster prison to an undis- closed location.

Even the government-controlled South African Broadcasting Co.re- flected the new freedom, report- ing the official response that the ANC gave to Mr. de Klerk’s pro- gram for political change. The ANC statement said the president ‘made important an- nouncements that go a long way toward creating a climate condu- cive to negotiations” but added that the group remains committed to changing apartheid “by all means,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 4, 1990 \f"

For his part, de Klerk declined to discuss when Mandela might be re- leased when Cox Newspapers re- porters approached him as he was leaving church. Later in the day, he said ina South African radio interview that the gov: ernment would not allow negotia- tions to be “undermined by vio- lence” during the coming quest for a new constitution in which all races would share power. In his historic speech to parliament on Friday, de Klerk only partly lifted emergency restrictions imposed more than three years ago. He legal- ized Mandela's African National Congress, placed a moratorium on executions and lifted restrictions on hundreds of individuals and scores of anti-apartheid organizations. But among emergency regulations that remain in effect, the government can detain anyone for up to six months without charge, police have wide powers to ban meetings or speeches and restrict television or photo coverage of their own actions in dealing with political unrest.

Government leaders, who have yet 10 set a date for Mr. Mandela's release, reversed years of custom and heaped compliments on Mr, Mandela Meanwhile, opposition leaders indicated that the further reforms “i have demanded of South Africa's system of raclal segregation, known as apartheld, are not necessarily prerequisites for Mr. Mandela's departure from prison, And, in-a sign that Mr. Mandela may be released during the Rev, Jackson's two-week visit, which be: fins today, Foreign Minister RF, “Pik” Bolia went Out of his way to try to keep the American from get: ting any of the credit “There 1s nothing that the Rev.

He can come and enjoy the aftermath but certainly not claim any credit.” The Rev. Jackson said in Zam- bia that he and the other foreign politicians in his tour group plan to use his second visit to South Africa “to see South Africa from Mandela’s point of view.” In his prison cottage in Paarl, Mr. Mandela described the gov- ernment’s recent reforms as “cou- rageous and bold and hopeful,” and said he wants to leave prison even if some of his demands for change are not met, said the Rev. Allan A. Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. “Mr. Mandela is a prisoner. You must never forget that,” the Rev. Boesak told reporters after several hours with Mr. Mandela at the Victor Verster prison farm near Cape Town. “If they come in here and tell him, ‘Now we are releasing you,’ he will not hold onto the chairs and the tables and kick and say, ‘I won't come out,’” said the Rev. Boesak, a leader in the mixed- race community. “But he will say, ‘If you release me, and the condi- tions we have put have not been met, I will be obliged to make a statement on those conditions.’ ” His remarks were softer than those made Sunday by Mr. Man- dela's wife, Winnie, who suggest ed afler meeting with her hus- band that he was reluctant to leave, prison unless I demands werd satisfied, The Rev.

Mr. Botha said the govern- ment also wants to end the state of emergency as soon as possible but needs the help of Mr. Mande- la's African National Congress. Mr. Botha noted approvingly that over the weekend the former ANC secretary-general, Walter Si- sulu, a close comrade of Mr. Man- dela, said the ANC will try to keep peace in black townships that routinely break out in violent confrontations. On Tuesday, however, Mr. Si- sulu sounded much less concilia- tory when he returned to Johan- nesburg from a meeting in Sweden with ANC leaders from around the world. Saying the government's re- form package “was a progressive step, but unfortunately it was a half measure,” he said the ANC isn't ready to give up its armed struggle unilaterally or to engage in direct negotiations with the government. said. “We are going to make at- tempts to contact him and have a full statement from him as to, - what he expects when.” The Rev. Jackson's hosts, in- cluding the South African Council of Churches, kept details of his schedule sparse. That minimized the chance of disturbances: by right-wing white groups, such as the one that attacked the British, embassy in Pretoria earlier this week, The Rev. Jackson’s continuing support for economic sanctions against South Africa by foreign countries irritated Mr. Botha. “Jt is a pity that he made his remarks about sanctions, because he made exactly the opposite re- marks to my ambassador, exactly the opposite, when they had pri- vate talks,” Mr. Botha said, The Rey. Jackson has said in public that he wants sanctions to end when South Africa is ruled by all its people instead E by an en- trenched white mindrity. However, Gerrit Viljoen, min- | ister of constitutional govern- ment, described Mr. Mandela as a “leader of stature” who can deal with such sticking points. And, in another refusal to lim- it Mr. Mandela’s options, Mr. Si- sulu refused to say what condi- tions the ANC will recommend as a prerequisite to Mr. Mandela's RF. “Pik” Botha the Rev. Jesse Jackson to get credit for Nelson R. Mandela's release. \f"

One newspaper columnist here recalled that Jackson “angered many people and had many oth- ers spellbound” on his two-week trip 11 years ago. After that visit, the newspaper said, the American civil-rights leader was considered an arch enemy of white South Africans. | Jackson and his wife, Jackie, were welcomed by several top- level opposition leaders, includ- ing Frank Chikane, the general secretary of the council of churches, who said Jackson was invited “so that he can learn for himself that apartheid is alive in South Africa in spite of recent moves bythe government.” \f"

He said these capital outflows came about mainly because South African corporations and individ- ‘uals were compelled to dip into Savings to repay loans that could ‘not be rolled over. _ Since 1985, almost 50 percent of South African savings that would otherwise have been available for phoned” off to repay foreign loans, Stals said at a news con- ference. One result, he said, has been an artificially low economic growth rate of between 1.5 percent and 2 percent annually. In the past, South African eco- nomic experts have said it would take a national growth rate of nearly 5 percent to stay ahead of the burgeoning growth of school- age blacks. Over all, the country’s population is growing at about 2.5 percent a year, but improvements in health care and the flow of people out of rural villages has put increasing pressure on serv- ices, most notably the segregated black school system. — Stals said foreign sanctions and campaigns to reduce investment have not hurt South Africa nearly as much as bankers’ decisions to stop lending to South Africa. In addition, he said the economy has suffered ‘‘a certain additional ef- fect’’ from overseas anti- apartheid campaigns that pres- sured governments and interna- tional lending agencies to deny loans or trade financing to South Africa. He said foreign disinvestment campaigns have had only a lim- ited effect on capital flow because South Africa’s currency rules ef- fectively block foreign sellers from sending their cash out of the country. ; Stals said South African au- thorities made a costly error five years ago when they assumed that the flight of capital following imposition of the state of emer- gency would be only a ‘“‘tempo- rary’’ phenomenon. “The excessive utilization of bank credit led to large increases in the money supply, which made the economy more vulnerable to inflationary pressures,’’ he said.

A delegation of 22 anti-apartheid campaigners said after visiting Man- dela that the jailed leader still does not know when or where he will be released. But several hours after the visit, some South African media reported- ly received a ‘Mandela alert” from government sources, an indication his promised release might come over the weekend. However, there have been media “‘alerts”’ in the past, sources cautioned. Meanwhile in Namibia, an assem- bly of 72 members who were on op- posite sides of a 23-year war unani- mously adopted a democratic constitution Friday in the last major step to independence from South Af- rica. It guarantees fundamental individ- ual rights and limits a president to two five-year terms, a rarity on a con- tinent where leaders often serve for life. The constitution will take effect with independence March 21. A spirit of compromise and recon- ciliation was evident during the 80- day drafting process, although the members’ constituents ranged from black Marxists to right-wing whites.

In the past 10 days, his move- ment to end segregation and win blacks a share of South Africa’s riches has been knocked into disar- ray by the boldness of State Presi- dent F.W. de Klerk, the white Afri- kaaner who has been in office less than five months. Mandela, 71, son of a tribal chief and a natural leader since his student days, plans a Cape Town rally today before returning to his home in Soweto. Dullah Omar, Mandela’s lawyer and confidante, said he had talked to Mandela after de Klerk’s news conference. “He is excited,” Omar said of his client. “He is looking forward to being reunited with his family and his people. He says it is one of the greatest days of his life. He was surprised he was not given more notice. He was only told late yes- terday afternoon that he would be released.” Omar envisioned Mandela’s plans: “He comes out of Victor Verster shortly after 3. He will be brought to Cape Town for a press conference as near as possible to 4. After the press conference, he will address a mass rally on the Grand Parade in Cape Town.” The Grand Parade is a large open parking lot between City Hall and the railroad station and is the largest open space in the center of town. Mandela “will in all likelihood remain in Cape Town’: his first tree toda ‘The eyes of the world are presently focused on all South Africans.’ F.W. de KLERK night out of prison, Omar said. When Mandela finally returns to Soweto, he probably will spend the night in the same modest five- room brick house he and his wife, Winnie, shared before he gave up his successful career as a lawyer in Johannesburg's first black legal partnership in 1961. That is when he left the law to command Umk- honto we Sizwe (Spear of the Na- tion), the underground military wing of the African National Con- gress. At the Mandela home, a fierce- looking guard dog and a cadre of ANC loyalists were ready to pro- tect him from assassins. His more than 2 million Soweto neighbors were celebrating his impending re- turn with victory songs well into the night Saturday. At the Victor Verster prison farm, reporters and photographers from around the world were poised to beam out the first words from Mandela, as if he were the first astronaut stepping on the moon. A fleet of chartered planes was prepared to wing network crews to wherever Mandela chooses to go after events in Cape Town.

His old five-room cottage is revamped and painted a deep sien- na red, topped by a black, green and yellow African National Con- gress flag on its roof. Saturday night a huge banner in the same colors, perhaps 6 feet long by 3 feet wide, was raised on the wall in front of the house. People believe he will live in this house once he is freed. Mandela's wife, Winnie, stopped briefly at the house — she has been living in a larger home in a more upscale section of the black township — and expressed her hap- piness at her husband’s release. Before entering a car, she raised a clenched fist salute and said, “I am very glad.” Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, from his home down the - ee ‘He is a friendly man.

He commended de Klerk for what the president has done and what he has promised to do. “You have done well,” said Tutu, the archbishop of Cape Town, who had returned to his Soweto home to baptize a grandchild. At one point, he leaped into the air in glee. While driving away, he leaned out the window and shouted, “Yaaaaaaaaay.” Philip Matthews, a Mandela contemporary who spent time with him in prison, said now it will be possible to put into effect the prin- ciples of the Freedom Charter, the ANC’s credo, which calls for equal rights and democratic government in which all South Africans share a voice. “Mandela is the only man to implement the Freedom Charter. We can’t do it without him, because he is the mastermind, the spear- head behind it all,” Matthews said. “The people shall govern, but we need Mandela to lead us.” But reaction differed in some quarters of South Africa. The country’s most powerful right-wing politician, Andries Treurnicht, said his official opposi- tion Conservative Party would stage protests across the country. “It is amazing that such a man could be treated as a hero.” Mandela may go to Zambia for ANC policy meetings — MANDELA/from 1A eq fears that the world will fatget that de Klerk hasn’t aban- = sao segregation. this fear, the Rev. Jese Jackson, visiting South Afri- ca, said Saturday on hearing that de Klerk had called his news con- fefence: “At home, our people will sep it in far more romantic terms, because they have reduced the stfuggle to Mandela’s trying to get out of jail. ” + One of Mandela’s first decisions will be whether to stay close to h@me for the next few days or fly to resting Zambia, to participate in a ting of the African National gress’ executive committee 7 has | been called to begin Mon- to decide how the organization id answer de Klerk. « Saturday afternoon, de Klerk uid the 3-year-old emergency po- lige powers will remain in force despite last-minute arguments by Mandela for their abandonment. De Klerk said Mandela made the case for dropping the emergency rules during a face-to-face meeting late Friday involving the two of them as well as two South African white Cabinet ministers. “The discussions really took place in a very civil atmosphere,” said de Klerk, who was a provincial lawyer of 25 when Mandela was sent to prison in 1962. “He is a friendly man. I think that I am also a friendly man. Yes, the discussions took place really in good spirit. He is an elderly man. He is a dignified man. And he is a leader.” Echoing the much-advertised fears of his minister of law and order, de Klerk said there is legiti- mate “reason for concern” that Mandela might be the target of assassination once he sets foot out- side prison. He made clear that Mandela, like other freed ANC prisoners, has not asked the gov- ernment to provide him a security detail. “There are all sorts of people who might threaten his life,” de Klerk said. “Radicals from the far left might be tempted to do so. And I think there is also a risk that it might come from radicals from the right. I think, yes, there is a real risk, and one must take every pre- caution to make sure that nothing happens to him.” De Klerk said the government will decide on its own when to end the emergency based on its own “scientific” assessment of whether South Africa is experiencing more politically motivated violence or ess after his release. As for Mandela's other main demand — quick release of all political — de Klerk said that would be one of the issues to be negotiated between his govern- ment and various groups in the anti-apartheid movement, includ- ing the ANC. It means former Prisoner 0221141011 will have to thread a delicate path between frightening the white minority by protesting too loudly and losing the black majority by acquiescing too easily. In recent months, Mandela has held himself out as willing to play the role of “facilitator” between the government and the ANC. His private talks have raised suspicion among many young, militant black activists inside South Africa and in the exile guerrilla camps in Tanza- nia. De Klerk said Mandela’s re- lease, coupled with his earlier moves, would lift “the most impor- tant stumbling block in the way of negotiations” toward forming a new sharing of power between South Africans. “The eyes of the world are pres- ently focused on all South Afri- cans,” de Klerk said. ‘All of us now have an opportunity and the re- sponsibility to prove that we are capable of a peaceful process in creating a new South Africa.” Palm Beach Post - February 11, 1990 (Continued) \f"

Mandela was coming home, an event that many have anticipated will set free miraculous change upon the land. And home, according to: conventional wisdom, will be Vilakasi Street. ‘dancing all afternoon’ “We are going to camp here,” said Rose Sekhuthe, 57. ‘‘We want to be the first to see him.” Her daughter Adeline, 30, stopped briefly to check in with her mother, sweat beads glistening all over her smiling face, then went” back to join the celebrations in the, street. “I’ve been dancing all after- noon,” she said. A car drove by, and the smiling driver asked, “Is this where the new state president lives?” Others drove past and beeped long, tinny calls on car horns, an- swered by the crowds with cheers and raised fists. The revelers had gathered out- side a small brick house where Mandela had lived when he was a lawyer in Johannesburg, before he » was jailed in August 1962. The™ Please see SOWETO/5A Palm Beach Post - February 11, 1990 > By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Paim Beach Post Staff Writers PAARL, South Africa — After serving 10,053 days in prison, Nel- son Mandela walks out of Victor Verster Prison about 8 a.m. EST today to tell his story. In the past 10 days, his move- ment to end segregation and win blacks a share of South Africa’s riches has been knocked into disar- ray by the boldness of State Presi- dent F.W. de Klerk, the white Afri- kaaner who has been in office less than five months. Mandela, 71, son of a tribal chief and a natural leader since his student days, plans a Cape Town rally today before returning to his home in Soweto. Dullah Omar, Mandela’s lawyer and confidante, said he had talked to Mandela after de Klerk’s news conference. “He is excited,” Omar said of his client. “He is looking forward to being reunited with his family and his people. He says it is one of the greatest days of his life. He was surprised he was not given more notice. He was only told late yes- terday afternoon that he would be released.” Omar envisioned Mandela’s plans: “He comes out of Victor Verster shortly after 3. He will be brought to Cape Town for a press conference as near as possible to 4. After the press conference, he will address a mass rally on the Grand Parade in Cape Town.” The Grand Parade is a large open parking lot between City Hall and the railroad station and is the largest open space in the center of town. Mandela “will in all likelihood remain in Cape Town’: his first tree toda ‘The eyes of the world are presently focused on all South Africans.’ F.W. de KLERK night out of prison, Omar said. When Mandela finally returns to Soweto, he probably will spend the night in the same modest five- room brick house he and his wife, Winnie, shared before he gave up his successful career as a lawyer in Johannesburg's first black legal partnership in 1961. That is when he left the law to command Umk- honto we Sizwe (Spear of the Na- tion), the underground military wing of the African National Con- gress. At the Mandela home, a fierce- looking guard dog and a cadre of ANC loyalists were ready to pro- tect him from assassins. His more than 2 million Soweto neighbors were celebrating his impending re- turn with victory songs well into the night Saturday. At the Victor Verster prison farm, reporters and photographers from around the world were poised to beam out the first words from Mandela, as if he were the first astronaut stepping on the moon. A fleet of chartered planes was prepared to wing network crews to wherever Mandela chooses to go after events in Cape Town. The intensity of excitement about Mandela’s release has trou- bled the rest of the anti-apartheid movement, with midlevel leaders Please see MANDELA/5A \fTown wants ‘to be first to see him’ SOWETO/from 1A house has stayed in the family, and it had been prepared for his return in October, when the government released from prison eight elderly anti-apartheid activists, most of them contemporaries and col- leagues of Mandela’s. His old five-room cottage is revamped and painted a deep sien- na red, topped by a black, green and yellow African National Con- gress flag on its roof. Saturday night a huge banner in the same colors, perhaps 6 feet long by 3 feet wide, was raised on the wall in front of the house. People believe he will live in this house once he is freed. Mandela's wife, Winnie, stopped briefly at the house — she has been living in a larger home in a more upscale section of the black township — and expressed her hap- piness at her husband’s release. Before entering a car, she raised a clenched fist salute and said, “I am very glad.” Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, from his home down the - ee ‘He is a friendly man.

He commended de Klerk for what the president has done and what he has promised to do. “You have done well,” said Tutu, the archbishop of Cape Town, who had returned to his Soweto home to baptize a grandchild. At one point, he leaped into the air in glee. While driving away, he leaned out the window and shouted, “Yaaaaaaaaay.” Philip Matthews, a Mandela contemporary who spent time with him in prison, said now it will be possible to put into effect the prin- ciples of the Freedom Charter, the ANC’s credo, which calls for equal rights and democratic government in which all South Africans share a voice. “Mandela is the only man to implement the Freedom Charter. We can’t do it without him, because he is the mastermind, the spear- head behind it all,” Matthews said. “The people shall govern, but we need Mandela to lead us.” But reaction differed in some quarters of South Africa. The country’s most powerful right-wing politician, Andries Treurnicht, said his official opposi- tion Conservative Party would stage protests across the country. “It is amazing that such a man could be treated as a hero.” Mandela may go to Zambia for ANC policy meetings — MANDELA/from 1A eq fears that the world will fatget that de Klerk hasn’t aban- = sao segregation. this fear, the Rev. Jese Jackson, visiting South Afri- ca, said Saturday on hearing that de Klerk had called his news con- fefence: “At home, our people will sep it in far more romantic terms, because they have reduced the stfuggle to Mandela’s trying to get out of jail. ” + One of Mandela’s first decisions will be whether to stay close to h@me for the next few days or fly to resting Zambia, to participate in a ting of the African National gress’ executive committee 7 has | been called to begin Mon- to decide how the organization id answer de Klerk. « Saturday afternoon, de Klerk uid the 3-year-old emergency po- lige powers will remain in force despite last-minute arguments by Mandela for their abandonment. De Klerk said Mandela made the case for dropping the emergency rules during a face-to-face meeting late Friday involving the two of them as well as two South African white Cabinet ministers. “The discussions really took place in a very civil atmosphere,” said de Klerk, who was a provincial lawyer of 25 when Mandela was sent to prison in 1962. “He is a friendly man. I think that I am also a friendly man. Yes, the discussions took place really in good spirit. He is an elderly man. He is a dignified man. And he is a leader.” Echoing the much-advertised fears of his minister of law and order, de Klerk said there is legiti- mate “reason for concern” that Mandela might be the target of assassination once he sets foot out- side prison. He made clear that Mandela, like other freed ANC prisoners, has not asked the gov- ernment to provide him a security detail. “There are all sorts of people who might threaten his life,” de Klerk said. “Radicals from the far left might be tempted to do so. And I think there is also a risk that it might come from radicals from the right. I think, yes, there is a real risk, and one must take every pre- caution to make sure that nothing happens to him.” De Klerk said the government will decide on its own when to end the emergency based on its own “scientific” assessment of whether South Africa is experiencing more politically motivated violence or ess after his release. As for Mandela's other main demand — quick release of all political — de Klerk said that would be one of the issues to be negotiated between his govern- ment and various groups in the anti-apartheid movement, includ- ing the ANC. It means former Prisoner 0221141011 will have to thread a delicate path between frightening the white minority by protesting too loudly and losing the black majority by acquiescing too easily. In recent months, Mandela has held himself out as willing to play the role of “facilitator” between the government and the ANC. His private talks have raised suspicion among many young, militant black activists inside South Africa and in the exile guerrilla camps in Tanza- nia. De Klerk said Mandela’s re- lease, coupled with his earlier moves, would lift “the most impor- tant stumbling block in the way of negotiations” toward forming a new sharing of power between South Africans. “The eyes of the world are pres- ently focused on all South Afri- cans,” de Klerk said. ‘All of us now have an opportunity and the re- sponsibility to prove that we are capable of a peaceful process in creating a new South Africa.” Palm Beach Post - February 11, 1990 (Continued) \f"

The stately, slim black nation- alist leader, 71, directed compli- ward democracy is rapic terrupted. We have waited too long for our freedom! We can no longer wait. “Now is the time to intensify the struggle on all fronts. To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive. The sight of freedom looming on the horizon should encourage us to redouble our efforts. It is only through disci- plined mass action that our victory can be assured. What was supposed to be a buoyant welcoming rally was de- ments to South African President F.W. de Klerk, the man who set him free. But Mandela made it clear that he had not traded his hard political line for the opportunity to walk in freedom again before he dies. “The mass campaigns of defi- ance and other actions of our or- ganizations and people can only culminate in the establishment of democracy,” Mandela told a throng of cheering supporters within hours flated by repeated violent encoun- ters between white police and black youths who smashed win- dows and looted stores lining the rally site. Thousands of peaceful demonstrators surged away from the outbreaks in fright, and several dozen people were injured by po- lice birdshot. Two people were reported killed: one an alleged looter shot by police and the second a black man in the crowd who was stabbed to death by other black spectators in the sight of an American camera after he strode down the drive of the Victor Verster Prison. “The factors which necessitated the armed struggle still exist today. We have no option but to continue,” he said, his bearing that of a long- time leader rather than a man who has just finished more than a third of his life in prison. “Our struggle has reached a decisive moment,” he said. “We call on our people to seize this moment, so that the process to- crew. The off-and-on violence forced Mandela’s presentation to the crowd to be delayed almost 3 hours. Aides said Mandela will fly this morning by private plane to Johan- nesburg, where most of the anti- apartheid groups have headquar- ters. For security reasons, they would not disclose when he planned to return to his old home in the black township of Soweto, where he is awaited by friends and young- sters to whom he has become a national hero.

Jackson ealls on de Klerk S. African president compared to Lincoln By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Paim Beach Post Washington Bureau CAPE TOWN, South Africa — The Rev. Jesse Jackson paid what was described as a ‘“‘courtesy call” Monday on President F.W. de Klerk and was quoted as compar- ing de Klerk to Abraham Lincoln. The South African Press Agén- cy, an independent news ageney, quoted Jackson as saving that both de Klerk and Lincoln “rose above history and tradition at the risk of losing themselves.” The agency said Jackson also met with Nelson Mandela “‘briefly”’ Sunday night within hours after the black nationalist leader walked out of prison. It provided no details except to say that Jackson was “given little time” in his first en- counter with Mandela. Jackson, who has called for the continuation of economic sanctions against South Africa, also met Monday with South Africa’s desig- nated sanction-hitter, Foreign Min- ister R.F. Botha. Last week, Botha lashed out at Jackson for allegedly misleading the South African ambassador to the United States about his true position on sanctions while Jackson was seeking a visa to visit. “I think the time has come that Jesse and I must talk straight to each other,” Botha said then. Whatever Jackson and Botha may have said was fuzzed up with assembly-line diplomatic verbiage.

Police reported Tuesday that black-on-black violence had de- clined throughout the country. They said that in Natal Province, scene of the worst carnage last weekend, township leaders loyal to Mandela had attended a peace meeting Monday with backers of a rival political group, the Zulu tribal organization of Chief Man- gosuthu Buthelezi. Also Tuesday, in a totally un- “<.| expected compromise, the white- run South African cricket orga- nization reached a compromise agreement to end*the boisterous anti-apartheid protests that have dogged a British cricket team touring the country in defiance of boycott efforts abroad. After a meeting with protest leaders, sponsors of the cricket tour agreed to cut the remaining schedule of matches in half. In exchange, the anti-apartheid protesters agreed to refrain from mounting protests at the match- es that will be played. Mandela's speech at Soccer City stadium marked his formal homecoming after 27 years in South African prisons. Speaking in front of a pha- lanx of black protest leaders and two white lawyers who helped defend him at his 1963 treason trial, Mandela pledged to end “the dark hell of apartheid,” but also appealed to his countrymen to stop ‘mindless violence.\" He asked the audience to avoid the looting that spoiled the joy at his first rally in Cape Town on Sunday. “Let not a single hair, not a window be broken, when you leave this place,\" he said. In calling on the warring fac- tions in Natal to revive peace talks, he also said the white gov- ernment’s security forces must play a role in restoring calm. Calling on the police to ‘join our march for a new South Africa,” he said they ‘‘must be compelled to act with absolute impartial- ity’ and must arrest those who are guilty of destroying public order, It was a stunning departure from the usual black South Afri- can protest rhetoric laden with strident attacks against police brutality. Although Mandela restated his support of the African Na- tional Congress's policy of “armed struggle,\" his litany of demands was notable for their moderation. He called for better schools, better housing, and a share of South Africa's economic prosperity for its 28 million blacks, ‘Our people need better housing, not ghettos like Soweto,”’ he said. Addressing the fears of South Africa's 5 million nervous whites, Mandela said, ‘I and the ANC are as opposed to black domination as we are to white domination.” Indianapolis Star - February 14, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "TOYI-TOYI: TH S. African dance unites emotions as ANC symbol SOWETO, South Africa — You put your right hand up and clench it in the power sa- lute. You put your left hand up and let it flow with the beat. You hop three times on your left foot, then three times on your right. _ You are doing the toyi-toyi, South African blacks’ dance of joy and defiance. Though it de- rives from traditional African tribal dances, the toyi-toyi (pro- nounced TOY-yee TOY-yee) has been a high-voltage politi- cal symbol of the African Na- tional Congress (ANC) through- out most of the organization’s 78-year history. Boys do it. Girls do it. Blue- jeaned activists in their 20s do it. Even the Rev. Jesse L. Jack- son did it during his visit to Soweto last week. Toyi-toyi steps can vary from hopping on one foot, to rhythmic jumping in place, to jogging in military-like forma- tion. It can be danced to words of joy, anger or determination, depending on the inclination of the chant leader. The fist salute is accompa- nied by the chant “Amandla,” the Zulu word meaning “pow- _er.” It is followed by the re- sponse “Ngawetu,” meaning “it is ours.” The toyi-toyi often is danced to liberation lyrics by hed Black South African teachers do the toyi-toyi at a rally Wednesday. The dance often is used as a rallying local poets, or sometimes just to a melodic recitation of ANC luminaries. There is enough lilt in names such as Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Walter Sisulu to give the danc- ‘ers cadence without any other words. “Over the years, it has helped us build our will,” said businessman Norman Mapela, who was waiting outside Mr. Mandela’s house the other day for a glimpse of his leader. “It is something we all learned when we were kids.” Many whites find the dance unnerving or even scary. Yet in a way, the toyi-toyi is very much like the jogging, chanting calisthenics used by U.S. Ma- rine Corps drill instructors to build esprit de corps during basic training. For the most part, the toyi- toyi is viewed even by ardent ANC activists as a dance for the young. Those who aspire to leadership in the anti-apart- E BEAT GOES ON Boda Th i) eee te _ a ie W.A.

Soweto writer and business- man Themba “Hector” Burhali said, “It probably comes from a Zulu dance of joy and war called the Indlamu. It has been part of the symbolism of ANC since it was founded in 1912.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 16, 1990 \f"

Jackson will cut short his visit to South Africa so he can fly to Zambia today to tell African National Congress leaders what Nelson R. Mandela told him in a one-hour private meeting in South Africa, ANC of- ficials said Thursday night. — The’ Rev. Jackson was due to arrive from South Af- rica at midday by private plane and go immediately to a meeting with 27 members of the ANC’s ex- -ecutive com- mittee. The group has been meeting for two days to thrash out a response to South African President Fre- derik W. de Klerk’s offer for power-sharing negotiations. . On Thursday morning, the Rev. Jackson met for about an hour with Mr. Mandela at his home in Soweto, Johannesburg’s black suburb of 2 million people. Talking later to reporters in South Africa, the Rev. Jackson hailed Mr. de Klerk’s moves toward reform but stressed that apartheid must be abolished be- cause South Africa’s 28 million blacks are far from free. “The misnomer around the world is that Mandela is free,” he said. “That is not true. Man- dela is out of jail, but he is not free.” On Thursday = afternoon, Thabo Mbeki, who holds the for- eign affairs portfolio for the ANC, told reporters in Zambia that the Rev. Jackson was flying in to address the ANC executive committee before it adjourns this afternoon. Other top ANC officials said the executive com- mittee agreed to delay its planned closing time by several hours so it could hear from the . Rev. Jackson. When a reporter asked why the ANC wants to hear from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 16, 1990 Rev. Jackson, an ANC official said Thursday night, “Jesse has seen Mandela, and we haven't.” He said ANC leaders have spoken by phone with the freed leader but that the conversa- tions could not be frank because everyone assumes that outsiders are monitoring phone calls. After meeting with the Rev. - Jackson, the ANC leaders are expected to hold a news confer-\" ence to announce their official response to the release of Mr. Mandela and the unbanning of the ANC. The ANC statement has been awaited eagerly in South Africa as an important indicator of whether there is a basis for ear-. ly negotiations between whites and blacks. By flying to Zambia to meet with the ANC leaders after his— session with Mr. Mandela, the Rev. Jackson apparently has achieved something that South . African Foreign Minister R.F. “Pik” Botha sought avidly to. deny him: a moment in the his- tory of the dramatic changes of . South Africa. In Soweto, Mr. Mandela said Thursday that his guerrilla movement considers government. installations legitimate targets. for attack and that civilians in-. evitably will be caught in the: cross fire. Mr. Mandela said there has been no decision to suspend the armed struggle, which has been largely dormant in recent: months. “Our objective is that the tar- gets are government installa- tions,” Mr. Mandela said in an: interview with The Associated Press. “In a conflict, civilians must be caught up in cross fire.” Mr. Mandela helped launch the ANC guerrilla campaign in 1961, a year after the organiza- tion was outlawed. The official policy always has been to limit attacks to government facilities and personnel, though some ANC leaders have expressed a desire to hit civilian targets. \f"

The 27 ANC leaders planned to go back into session today to choose a delegation which they want to send “as soon as possible” to meet South African President F. W. de Klerk. One question facing the leaders is whether to appoint Nelson Mandela to head the ANC negotiating team. South African journalists, here to cover the closed meeting of the ANC's top leadership, said they ex- pect the ANC’s statement to be taken up at de Klerk’s weekly cabinet meeting in Cape Town on Tuesday. Thus by the middle of next week, “This is a very big departure for us.

The ANC executive council met de Klerk’s bold steps toward reform with what they considered a dramat- ic step of their own: dropping all the .ANC’s unmet “preconditions” for joining the white government at a peace table. These included a de- Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - February 17, 1990 meet de Klerk mand for an immediate end of the state of emergency in South Africa, the removal of troops from black townships and the unconditional re- lease of “political prisoners.” “This is a very big departure for us,” said Joe Slovo, who for years was a leader of the ANC’s under- ground military wing. “It was a concession.” The decision to return — taken after daily telephone calls to Man- dela back in Soweto — means the ANC will begin reestablishing its presence inside the country with offices, fund-raising efforts and po- litical activities for the first time in since it was banned in 1960. ANC delegates said Mandela may extend his stay in South Africa for another week, rather than flying here immediately, as he had first indicated. According to some dele- gates, Mandela may take a personal ' hand next week in trying to stop the : black factional bloodshed in Natal ~ Province that has claimed more than : 2,000 lives over the past three years. The ANC leaders said that hence- ' forth their long-faltering “armed struggle” inside South Africa would be defensive in character. They said the ANC was prepared to discuss with de Klerk how to create “a climate conducive to negotiations.” The outlook, in other words, is for a protracted period of what the ‘white government has referred to as “talks about talks,” in which the ANC and de Klerk trade demands about removing “obstacles” toward full-scale negotiations. That stage could take several years, since the only real deadline facing the de Klerk government is the next white national election due in 4% years. The roughly 5,000 ANC guerrillas now waiting in training camps in Tanzania will not be demobilized, nding what will certainly be lengthy wrangling aimed at obtain- ing a negotiated end of hostilities between blacks and the white au- thorities, the leaders made clear. Since Feb. 2, when de Klerk un- banned the ANC and its rival black- power group the Pan Africanist Congress, pressure has been building on the anti-apartheid movement to ‘ab the chance for peace talks efore the white government changed its mind. But there have been counter-pres- sures within the ANC’s milita wing, especially because South Afri- _can pe officials have said that any ANC exile suspected of involve- ment with “terrorism” might be jailed upon return to South Africa. Alfred Nzo, acting president of the ANC, sought to allay nervousness prevailing in the military camps by Saying one priority to be sought by the ANC bargaining delegation would be a “general amnesty,” per- mitting all AN s to go home. \f"

ANC leaders are discussing opening a radio station, offices around the country and news- papers and magazines, said an in- formed source, . The ANC National Executive Council announced Friday that it has agreed to send a delegation to South Africa to open preliminary talke with the white South African government. The ANC hopes those talks will lead to broader negotia- tions for a democratic government, including blacks for the first time. But plans for the ANC to return tion began percolating when South African President Frederik de Klerk said on Feb. 2 that he was le- galizing the ANC and other out- lawed groups, ANC officials said. Among the schemes under consi- deration are a media campaign that would use professionally designed materials to carry the ANC’s politi- cal message throughout South Africa, It would travel via an assortment of vehicles, from T-shirts to pos- ters to leaflets scattered from bal- loons, one source said, The ANC already runs Radio Freedom here in Lusaka and pub- lishes an exile magazine, but ANC . leaders consider the quality of these products too poor to carry ‘the ANC into the highly competi- tive political atmosphere inside ‘South Africa. Albert Nzo, the ANC general | secretary and acting president, an- ‘nounced Friday that a committee ‘had been established within South Africa to begin laying the ground- work for rebuilding the ANC internally, The committee, headed by for- mer ANC general secretary Walter Sisulu, has started a fund raising drive, Executive council member Joe Slovo said the committee, which is expected to open offices around the country, was set up while ANC leaders were meeting in Sweden in the first week of February. — The ANC already has a signifi- cant following within South Africa, having been promoted especially within the last decade by legal, ‘multiracial organizations such a8 the United Democratic Front. However, the ANC now seems to be preparing for a role that it never before has held, as a political party seeking supporters who one day will be able to vote for its candi- dates in democratic elections.

        "ocr_text": " Black education lags in S. Africa By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of Cox News Service KHAYELITSHA, South Africa — Six young blacks in a college classroom diverted from their English lesson to debate another subject that was stretching their curiosity to impatient limits: evo- lution. ‘‘What do you think of that?’’ one of them asked a visitor from America, as his colleague passed around a drawing showing evolu- tion from the ape to the ape-man to the man. “*How can this be so? Are we the same as animals?’’ the first man asked. Clearly, none of these students at a black teachers’ college — their ages ranging from about 22 to 29 — had ever heard of this notion of the beginning of mankind. They are products of a black education system that has been kept inferior in every respect, from the quality of teaching to the numbers of clasrooms to the sub- ject matter taught. The shoddy conditions, as well as larger political issues, have fired frequent strikes keeping stu- dents out of the classroom and compounding the ineffectiveness of black education. . It is an issue that quickly cap- tured the attention of black nation- alist Nelson Mandela after he was freed from prison last week. With- in two days of his release, Mandela was exhorting students to show some discipline and get back to school, the key to their future. The instructors here at Good Hope College, located in the black township of Khayelitsha about ten miles from Cape Town, are trying to bolster the meager skills with which most of their 780 students entered college. They are trying to recycle these students back into the system as trained teachers. The college staff seems well- intentioned, but they work against formidable obstacles. Willem Scholtz, the white rector of Good Hope, said the physical plant itself is wanting. ‘“‘We have no facilities such as laboratories or a good library. This is an old primary school,” he said. ‘‘Our training is very practi- cal. The facilities we need are just not there.”’ There was no study space in the library — a small converted class- room — and half the bookshelves were empty. The science teacher had scavenged a couple of makeshift burners and some bits of tin for experiments. At least ten classroom buildings were prefa- bricated, temporary structures that Scholtz said leave the students icy in winter and sweating all summer. There was no hostel or dormit- ory space for the students, so those who did not have family or friends nearby were living in shanties they built themselves in a squatters’ area that had no electricity or plumbing. They were not ideal study conditions. It should not be surprising, considering the pattern of spend- ing on black education over the years. In the 1987-88 school year, for example, the white government spent 2,722 rands (about $1,134) per capita on educating white primary and secondary students, and 595.29 rands (about $248) to educate each black child, accord- ing to a study by the South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR). That included capital construction spending. Less was spent on children in the black homelands, which are sup- posed to finance and run their o education systems but do get a subsidy from the central govern ment. Those spending ratios existe even after the government had publicly committed itself to impro ving black education, but the administration of President F.W de Klerk has promised to do more Education Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said earlier this mon‘ that the government has been able to increase spending much less than it would like, because interna tional sanctions have leveled suc a debilitating blow at the econom The Press Tribune (Roseville, California) - February 19, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Neutrality, balance now watchwords as S. Africa eases controls on media By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondents CAPE TOWN, South Africa — South African radio and television, until last year part of the fabric of apartheid, are moving with breathtaking speed toward a new role as promoter of racial reforms. On Feb. 10, the day before Nelson R. Mandela was released from prison, drivers all over South Africa were startled when their car radios played “Welcome, Mandela,” a black liberation chant whose lyrics had been banned as terrorist filth. The next day, millions watched in joy, anger and disbelief as Mr. Mandela walked out of pris- on and into their living rooms, clenching his fist on live television. The state-controlled South African Broad- casting Corp. took a giant step toward free ex- pression Feb. 2 when President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted most media restrictions. But the change at SABC had begun with the addition of two key men several months before Mr. de Klerk’s speech. One is a liberal Afrikaner professor, Christo Viljoen, 52. Last summer, Mr. Viljoen won guar- antees from the government that he could over- see government broadcasting without being what he calls “the master’s voice.” ; Mr. Viljoen said his international travels — he lived in Atlanta in 1975-76 while a visiting pro- fessor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, taught in China for another year and lived in Brit- ain for two years — allowed him to see a variety of television coverage. All this left him with “clear views of neutrality and balanced presentation,” he said in an interview Wednesday. Not everyone has wanted to hear the range of opinions now coursing through the airwaves. “I am under extreme pressure from the far right in this country,” he said. “I am blamed for showing black faces on Channel One. There have been telephone calls, threats, newspaper arti- cles. I've got a pile of them in front of me here. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 23, 1990 The pressure is there, and it is consistent. And I get very, very little encouragement from the other side.” The top news professional reporting to him is Carel van der Merve, 59, also a white Afrikaner. A newspaper and television journalist for 25 years, Mr. van der Merwe became SABC news di- rector last summer with a goal of offering news that is “fair, understandable and gripping,” he said Wednesday. Compared to South African TV five years ago, he has clearly succeeded. Mr. van der Merwe spearheaded South Afri- ca’s first-ever televised debates leading up to September's elections, in which all political par- ties got their share of exposure. Over the past six months, more blacks have begun appearing on the main newscasts — and not just the few blacks, such as Zulu chief Mango- suthu Buthelezi, in favor with the government. Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was seldom shown speaking on South African television before, in October was allowed 15 un- edited minutes to discuss religion and politics. After the legalization of the African National Congress, former “terrorists” were shown in suits and ties and talking quietly in Oxford accents. “One day we were talking about the [African National Congress] as a banned organization,” the news director said. “And the next day we were interviewing for a full hour, worldwide, the black faces of those ANC terrorists talking to the people of South Africa.” Sometimes the new dimension of coverage a caused problems for journalists used to doing ess, SABC ran into trouble when it took on the challenge of live coverage of Mr. Mandela’s re- lease. He walked out of the Victor Verster prison farm more than an hour later than had been scheduled. Commentators were subjected to re- viewers’ catty critiques for “fluffing” the empty time instead of filling it with substantive analysis or history of Mr. Mandela and his ANC. “We were promised it wouldn’t take more than 10 minutes,” Mr. van der Merwe explained. \f"

Africa is ‘like Beirut’ Mandela’s test: End rampant black-against-black bloodshed By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau MPUMULANGA, South Africa — On the day Nelson Mandela walked free, Jerome Ngubo, a 22- year-old black police officer, found out his family had been decimated by fellow Zulus who lived just 500 yards away. “I am very ashamed,” Ngubo said, as he helped defend the no man’s land that divides what may be the bloodiest of al] South African black townships in what used to be called Zululand. “I have lost my two brothers and my father, and I But on Ngubo’s side of no man’s land, people said they are staying away from the Mandela rally — which he has billed as an attempt to bring an end to “mindless violence” that has killed more than 2,000 blacks in Natal Province in three years. More than a quarter of all South Africans live in Natal Province. “We won't go,” said Baluxolo Luthuli, 40, the neighborhood boss of the Zulu nationalist organization Inkatha. “If we do, there will be havoc. We know that. When they see me there, definitely they will kill me there.” “The way things are going, it is going to be like Beirut here,” said Luthuli, whose great-grandfather Chief Albert Luthuli was one of the first leaders of Mandela's African National Congress. Baluxolo Luth- uli left the ANC and is now a rising star of Inkatha, On the other side of the no man’s land, Noel Mtsele, a leader of the opposing faction and member of a local “peace committee,” said he has tried without much success to stop a new eruption of rifle and spear battles in Mpumulanga in the weeks since Mandela was freed. “The Inkatha vouths invaded our homes, killed people and looted our households,” claimed Mtsele, a Zulu who is affiliated with the United Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid organization linked to Mandela's ANC. “The peace committee just couldn't do anything. You couldn't go between the fighting factions, or you would be killed yourself.” Mtsele said the community remains on the edge of i new battle despite a peace mission to Mpumulanga rriday by an ANC delegation headed by Walter Sisulu. “Our houses were looted, and the people here want to get back their goods — their TVs, their radios, even their fridges,” he said. can't revenge them. I am a police- man, and my job is to keep law and order.” | In this one black township of 200,000 people, at least 236 people have died within three years in factional warfare that shows no sign of ending. Ngubo’s relatives were killed when their white BMW was firebombed as they drove through the enemy side of town., “This violence is not good for us,” Ngubo said. “We are all blacks. We do not like such a thing. But the problem is that a non-violent per- son and a violent person cannot come together easily.” Mpurnulanga is one frame in a three-year-long reel of blood-spattered film. Not only this township, but much of the surrounding Natal region has been a battleground for a power struggle between Inkatha and UDF, a struggle in which political ideology is being eclipsed by gang wars over turf. The statistics tell a gruesome story: More than 2,000 people have been killed in Natal since 1987; at least 20,000 shops and homes have been burned to the ground; and an estimated 100,000 people have been left without homes and possessions, according to Graham Howe, editor of Indicator South Africa, a quarterly report from the University of Natal. All sides agree that it is primarily blacks who are attacking each other, rather than blacks dying at the hands of white security forces, The political competition between the Inkatha and the ANC-aligned UDF began after the UDF was formed in 1983 as a progressive opposition to the white-run status quo in South Africa. It was a surro- gate for the ANC, which had been banned since 1960. Inkatha was entrenched on the scene, serving as a nationalist organization for South Africa's roughly 8 million Zulu tribesmen who are concentrated in Natal. Inkatha had opted to cooperate with the white govern- ment’s view of limited black power by running the homeland known as KwaZulu, adjacent to the Durban metropolitan area, as well as the local black govern- ments in townships not included in the homeland. Under Chief Executive Mangosuthu Butheleai, In- As he said this, youngsters could be heard on the other side of town chanting encomiums to Mandela in Zulu. They were dancing through the streets making joyous prepara- tion to attend Mandela’s speech at a mass rally today in Durban, a half-hour’s drive away.

Natal is the fastest-urbanizing area of South Afri- a, a8 blacks from rural countryside stream into squatter camp shanties, This brings them closer, they believe, to jobs and better conditions around cities, said Gavin Woods, executive director of the Inkatha Institute for South Africa, When they arrive, they find a 40 percent unemploy- ment rate in the townships, he said, with the rate among youth zooming up to 80 percent. “There are no services, No garbage removal. Where do you bury your dead?” Woods said. “We have people who have to sleep in shifts.” The townships and squatters camps are riddled with protection rackets, and residents who used to be harassed by Inkatha envoys for contributions for the Zulu king are intercepted by gangs vaguely aligned with UDF, which demand money to support their street soldiers. “When an incident occurs, the local people take the situations into their own hands,” admitted Archie Gumede, co-president of the national UDF. tions with the white minority gov- ernment on a post-apartheid South Africa. BLACK AFRICAN GROUPS B AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS — Formed in 1912 to press for basic rights, it became increasingly militant after 1948 as the white government institutionalized apartheid. The ANC includes some whites and Indians among its leaders and has been allied with the South African Communist Party. The ANC launched a limited ‘armed struggle’ in 1961. B INKATHA — A political organization of about 1.7 million members based in the Zulu tribe, Inkatha works within the limited framework the white government has permitted. It seeks an end to apartheid but not through such ANC- approved tactics as strikes, boycotts, foreign sanctions and demonstrations. @ PAN AFRICANIST CONGRESS — A militant nationalist group, the PAC split from the ANC in 1959 with the aim of retuming all African land to blacks. With ‘‘Africa for Africans”’ as its slogan, it does not work with either whites or Indians. @ AZANIAN PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATION — A descendant of the black consciousness groups of the late ‘60s, AZAPO's best-known member was Steve Biko, who died in police custody in 1977. B UNITED DEMOCRATIC FRONT — A coalition that arose as an ANC surrogate to function inside South Africa, the UDF began in 1983 to protest creation of two new houses of parlia- ment which gave limited political powers to Indian and mixed-race populations while con- tinuing to deny the vote to blacks.

Mandela at what was probably the largest political gathering in South Afri- ean history. “My message to those of you involved in this battle of brother against brother is this: Take your guns, your knives and your pan- gas [spears], and throw them into the sea,’’ Mr. Mandela declared. “Close down the death factories. End this war now.”’ The audience of at least 150,000 never broke out in fight- ing or looting, as had been widely feared. Nor were any major dis- turbances reported in the poor townships and squatters’ camps to which the mostly black rally- goers returned. Three hours after nightfall, a radio operator at the Durban Red Cross said there had been no calls for ambulances, and the largest hospital said it received no casualties. Mr. Man- dela planned § to leave South Africa today for a ‘three- week trip to see ANC col- leagues Zambia, on weden. spite reports Neison that Mr. Man- Marniate dela would visit the’ United States, his longtime ANC co)- league Walter Sisulu said that wold not be possible on this trip. In Durban, Mr. Mandela sought to end bDiack-on-black warfare between factions affili- ated with his ANC and a rival Zulu nationalist organization known as Inkatha.

Mr. Mandela praised Inkatha for its demands that the white government lift its bans on the ANC and release political pris- oners, and for what Mr. Mandela said was its refusal to participate in a negotiated governing scheme until the proper condi- tions were met. Inkatha had been negotiating for a provincial Natal govern- ment that would unite the black homeland KwaZulu and the white city of Durban, but would not have given blacks power pro- portionate to their numbers. The negotiations failed. Mr. Mandela gave unexpect- ed praise to that Natal plan, which has been stridently criti: cized by most anti-apartheid forces. He said it ‘‘addressed the question of the exclusion from political power of the African population of Natal and sought to make regional change pioneer national change.”’ It was a clear bow to Mango: suthu Buthelezi, president of In: katha and chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland, who was en route toa scheduled visit with President Bush today. In the last few days, Mr. Buthelezi told his aides it was best for him to keep a low profile during Mr. Mande- la’s appearance. ‘ In offering a reconciliation with Mr. Buthelezi, Mr. Mandela continued his strategy of trying to have black leaders united be: hind him when he enters expect+ ed talks with whites on demo- eratic reforms. Mr. Mandela is expected to meet soon with Mr; Buthelezi and said he hoped one day to share a platform with him: Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 26, 1990 \f"

Such a snub would be a pain- ful setback to Israel, which has been making a major \"effort to ex- tend its diplomatic and economic presence in Africa. A huge influx of foreign digni- taries, including Secretary of State James A. Baker III, is ex- pected to descend upon this sleepy capital to mark its transi- tion in one year from civil war to independent democracy. First word that Israel was be- ing excluded surfaced in a local press interview with Dirk Mudge, _. who will head the largest opposi- tion faction in the new Namibian parliament. 7 Mr. Mudge said repressnta- tives of President-elect Sam Nu- joma’s South West African Peo- ple’s Organization (SWAPO) had told opposition. groups that “many other countries would not come” if an Israeli representative was present. “We think it is stupid,” said Mr. Mudge, a farmer who is Na- mibia’s most prominent white po- litical leader. “It is silly. It doesn’t make sense.” He said his p ,a coalition of whites and anti- SWAPO blacks, had asked Mr. Nu- joma’s party to reconsider. Mr. Mudge’s group also pub- lished a stinging editorial titled “‘Apologies to Israel” in its news- Atlanta Constitution - March 1, 1990 paper, declaring that Namibia “will make a fool of itself if it at the eve of independence starts to play stupid propaganda tricks in world theaters.” ' A smaller opposition group, headed by black leader Moses Katjiuongua, said it had been told by a high SWAPO official that Is- rael would not be allowed to at- tend the ceremony because it has _ refused to negotiate with the Pal- estine Liberation Organization. The SWAPO official was reported to have said it was Mr. Nujoma who insisted on Israel’s ex- clusion. Mr. Nujoma reportedly is also refusing to invite Jonas Savimbi, _ head of the U.S.-backed UNITA guerrilla movement in neighbor- ing Angola, according to — tion party leaders. Fis 3g .

        "ocr_text": "Weary of war, Namibians hope independence brings harmony By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondents WINDHOEK, Namibia — With a $15,000 fireworks display and a parade of world dignitaries, this last black colony in Africa is ready to claim its independence after 75 years of South African rule. Namibia, a sparsely populat- ed desert treasure house five times the size of Georgia, will be- gin an experiment in multiparty, multiracial democracy that will be watched closely by the rest of the continent. What evolves as 5,900 U.N. peacekeeping troops depart will shape black and white attitudes ‘in neighboring South Africa: Can old racial antagonisms be con- tained and democracy survive in a new post-apartheid govern- ment? Just before midnight March 20, South African President Fre- derik W. de Klerk, along with tens of thousands of Namibians in the country’s largest soccer stadium, will watch as the South African flag is lowered for the last time. Then, just after midnight, the Namibian flag will be raised in its place. Sam Nujoma, 60, a black rebel fighter with a third-grade education, will be sworn in as Na- mibia’s first president. Then the fireworks, imported from Taiwan and paid for by the South Africa-owned Standard Bank, will light the sky in the col- ors of Namibia’s new flag. “For about 20 minutes, the sky will turn blue, red, green and gold,” Information Minister Hadipo Ha- mutenya said. South African black leader Nelson R. Mandela is expected to be among the 1,600 guests. Mr. Mandela once shared a jail cell at Robben Island prison with Toivo ya Toivo, the Namibian rebel _leader who will be the country’s new minister of mines. U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected, along with representatives from gov- ernments and freedom move- ments worldwide. Windhoek © ~\\ NAMIBIA ‘Sam Nuioma Rebel will become ruler During the five-day indepen- dence ceremony, all public work- ers will get a holiday, and resi- dents have been warned that there will be no garbage collec- tion. Optimism prevails among most of the nation’s 80,000 whites and its 1.2 million blacks that Na- mibia could become one of Afri- ca’s few economic successes. Few whites are leaving the country, and the price of prime farmland is holding steady. “It didn’t even come to my mind to move away,” said El- marie Doman, 33, a white Namib- ian-born housewife of German and South African parentage. “We all just want one thing: peace.” Preserving peace and racial harmony seems to be the main ob- jective of Mr. Nujoma and his col- leagues in the leftist South West Africa People’s Organization. SWAPO, as the organization is called, won a 57 percent majority in a November parliamentary election, which international monitors said was fair. SWAPO gained 41 of the 72 seats in the As- sembly, a’ majority but less than the two-thirds needed to write a constitution on its own. Despite the risk of a constitu- tional gridlock, talks between SWAPO and other parties pro- duced a model democratic consti- tution in record time. To the as- Rick McKee/Staff tonishment of whites, SWAPO yanked the rug out from under the defeated white-backed par- ties by embracing constitutional guarantees, including an inde- pendent judiciary and an en- forceable bill of rights, which whites long had demanded. “I must admit that I was very surprised at their very reason- able attitude,” said Dirk Mudge, a white farmer who is chairman of the Democratic Turnhalle Alli- ance (DTA). “You know, they have had to make all the concessions.” The multiracial party has cooper- ated with South Africa’s colonial administrators and is Namibia’s second-largest party, with 21 seats in the Assembly. SWAPO leaders have tried to encourage’ reconciliation be- tween whites and blacks by going slow in phasing out the leftovers of South African apartheid. Blacks have begun turning up in white classrooms, but there has been no move to send whites to the inferior black schools. “We have not rushed to inte- grate schools,” Mr. Hamutenya said. “We will come to that, but it will be done in a way so as to not create panic and confusion. We aw been trying our level best on a Bd Because South Africa domi- nated the economy, Namibia faces a shortage of engineers, computer operators, doctors, ar- chitects and bank tellers. Another crucial problem is that the white minority controls virtually all the best farmland, the mines and the factories. 7 The country has some of the world’s richest uranium and dia- mond deposits, as well as vast grasslands that support a lucra- tive sheep-farming industry. Its coastline is rich in crayfish’ and other exportable seafood. After fighting for 23 years in the bush to liberate the country, SWAPO is not about to leave the riches permanently in white hands. But the problem is how to redistribute wealth without caus- ing the kind of economic havoc that has befallen neighboring Zambia since its independence three decades ago. . When asked to sketch out Na- mibia’s economic policies, Mr. Hamutenya cited Sweden as a welfare state where private en- terprise has been allowed to flourish. “The state is entitled to have some ownership of land to ad- dress the needs of those who were dispossessed of it,” he said. “But that does not mean the complete nationalization of the land, just the rationalization of the distri- pation and ownership of the land.” The South African-owned mining industry provides 73 per- cent of the country’s foreign ex- change earnings. One of the con- troversial questions facing the government is whether to nation- alize the country’s mineral and land wealth, as SWAPO frequent- ly promised to do while it was fighting for independence. Recent indications from SWAPO officials are that Namib- ia will not nationalize white- owned properties aggressively unless they are left unused or have absentee owners. By leaving productive industry in private hands, SWAPO officials hope they can persuade foreign donors to help lessen Namibia’s budget def- icit, estimated at $200 million in the first year of independence.

        "ocr_text": "New Namibia government may seek gem of a deal for diamond profits — SWAPO takes over as 2 major mines opening in nation Bea tee Kunstel Albright Journal-Constitution correspondents :. ELIZABETH BAY, Namibia — Only 80 years ago, prospectors pawed on their hands and knees along the coastal sands to gather ‘diamonds glittering in the moon- light. In the 1920s, hundreds of Ovambo tribesmen, quartered in slavelike conditions, dug and hauled tons of ore and then took brooms to the barren bedrock to dislodge any shiny remnants for their bosses. Today, sand dunes rippling back from the icy Atlantic still hide billions of dollars worth of diamonds. Armed guards keep covetous beachcombers at bay while miners employ increasingly sophisticated method unearth glinting rocks that are harder and more expensive to find. Soon, more change may con: front Namibia’s diamond indus: try, which has been almost exclu. sively the domain of a single com. pany. Consolidated Diamond Mines (CDM), one of the jewels ir the diadem of the worldwide De Beers syndicate, faces the risk oO! having to share much more of its profits with the government thal takes power when Namibia be comes independent Wednesday. CDM isn’t ready to give up the diamond fields. Despite ques. tions over the intentions of the new government, led by the leftis! South-West Africa People’s Or. ganization (SWAPO), the diamond company has plowed ahead with start-up work on two major new mines, the first to open since the mid-1980s. “It’s very much a vote of confi- dence in the future of the coun- try,” said Gino Noli, a company spokesman. “The circumstances are forcing everybody to be rea- sonable.”’ By “‘circumstances,”’ he means the fact that CDM supplied nearly 13 percent of all public revenue collected in Namibia in 1988 and took in more than 30 percent of Namibia’s export earnings. At the same time, the company, accounts for only about 2.5 per-: cent of total production of its wealthy parent, De Beers Con- solidated Mines Ltd. That means De Beers could decide to jump ship, Mr. Noli suggested, if the government saw fit to pass confis- catory taxes, demand an unrea- sonable share of the company, or nationalize the ' diamond in- Atlanta Constitution - March 19, VW .A. Bridges Jr./Statt This ral line, now rusty debris, hummed with activity when the Port Eliza- beth mine supplied “diamonds to jewel-hungry markets far across the Atiantic. “Essentially, this mine is more important to the govern- ment than to the owners,’”’ Mr. Noli said of the new mine being readied for production in Eliza- beth Bay. Still, Namibia’s diamonds are more important to De Beers than the 2.5 perpent production figure suggests. More than 90 percent o the diamonds mined in Namibia are gem quality, while the stones | unearthed in more difficult con- ditions in neighboring Botswana, which supplies more than half o De Beers’s production, are mostly the less valuable industrial-quali ty diamonds. CDM public relations directo Clive Cowley acknowledged tha the company would put up with a bit of a squeeze from the govern ment, saying officials expect tha it at oaat will ask for some com ah}: [te \fnibi Namiubia pany stock. In Botswana, the gov- ernment and De Beers own the mining company in equal part- nership. Namibia needs CDM’s techni- cal and managerial expertise, while CDM needs the diamonds. Mining today is a skilled en- terprise, unlike the early days when manpower took precedence over mechanics. In some places, it was possible literally to sift the sand and find diamonds deposit- ed centuries ago by tides and winds, back when the shoreline was miles inland from where waves lap the coast today. Shortly after the first rich dis- coveries, colonial authorities de- clared a coastal strip 50 miles: wide to be prohibited territory. Armed conservation wardens still patrol the strip, which CDM has a concession to mine for the next 20 years. The company says that, even if passage were freer, the casual prospector these days wouldn’t find many diamonds with a buck- et and sifting pan. It says the easy ones are gone. Nonetheless, access by ap- proved visitors and even compa- ny personnel is tightly controlled. On a recent visit by Mr. Noli, a re- porter and a photographer to the Elizabeth Bay site, where ore testing was under way, Mr. Noli. refused to stop his van within 20 feet of a cluster of workers who had been handling diamond ore. Company policy prohibits getting near the stones, he explained, out of fear that a worker might hand a package to an outsider or secretly attach it to a hidden part of a ve- hicle. At Elizabeth Bay, large-scale mining ended in 1931, when dia- monds got fewer and deeper and the return stopped justifying the expense of mining. Now, CDM has machines that can pick up, haul and sort thou- sands of tons of ore daily. It also can gauge the concentration and quality of diamonds under the sand and the size of the field, and thus the cost-benefit ratio of mining. So it has decided to take a sec- ond crack at Elizabeth Bay, at a start-up cost of about $56 million. It plans to process 4.1 million tons of ore a year, from which it ex- pects to extract, over 10 years, a haul of more than 2.5 million car- | ats of diamonds. As before, the workers will be Ovambo tribesmen, but today one man running a bulldozer with a vacuum machine can cover the same territory that 200 men swept with brooms 60 years ago. The whole operation will require a work force of only 300 to 350, com- pared with about 1,000 managers and miners who worked Eliza- beth Bay before, Mr. Noli said. Nor will the miners stay in the = accommodations used by their predecessors: grim blockhouses, still standing, each sleeping 50 men in double-tiered concrete slots little more than shoulder width. This time, everyone is ex- pected to be quartered in the nearby coastal town of Luderitz. The new crews also won't be subjected to as many intimate body searches as the earlier ones suffered, because now CDM uses a combination of searches and X- rays to detect stones clandestine- ly slid into pockets or even swal- lowed, Mr. Noli said. And if the workers object to being zapped with radiation, or to some other working condition, these days they will have re- course. Besides having sturdy coveralls and helmets and boots, most also carry another protec- tion: a membership card in the miners’ union that is affiliated with SWAPO, the party that will be running Namibia.

        "ocr_text": "Census takers hit the streets to count homeless Under bridges, over vents, in abandoned slums, Uncle Sam’s helpers adding up hidden problem: By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Washington | Bureau WASHINGTON — City slums and lonely rural riverbanks will become hunt- ing grounds tonight as 15,000 census tak- ers spread out to mount what may be the most far-reaching social experiment in recent American history: a nationwide head count of the homeless. From 6 tonight until 8 Wednesday morning, census takers will visit more than 22,000 public shelters, condemned buildings, unauthorized tent camps and cardboard boxes propped beneath bridges. “Don’t matter to me; I’ll talk to them,” _ said James, 52, a Washington panhandler who lives under a plastic sheet atop a hot air vent across from the State De- partment. The Census Bureau estimates it will spend $2.7 million to carry out what is be- lieved to be the first nationwide homeless census any country has conducted. Up to now, estimates of the U.S. home- less population have fluctuated wildly, from 250,000 to 4 million. By giving shape to a largely hidden problem, the census will frame a piece of the American political landscape for the coming decade. It could make homeless- ness,a pre-eminent issue in the 1992 elec- tion campaigns, or it could consign the homeless to the status of political non-en- tities if the count comes in low. That is why a few advocates of the homeless, such as David Hayden of the Community for Creative Non-Violence in Washington, are refusing to cooperate. Mr. Hayden said its shelters in Washing- ton and in Roanoke, Va., will bar enumer- ators from entering tonight. “We are destined for a gross under- count. The resources they are devoting _ are too meager,” Mr. Hayden said. “That sets up a scenario where the political con- sequences of the undercount will be dev- astating to the homeless.” Cynthia Taeuber, Census Bureau spe- cialist on the homeless population, would not explain Monday how her counters will be instructed to proceed at block- aded shelters except a say they will “deal with that” at the sites. “If we only included [in the census] everyone who loved government or Joved filling out forms, we wouldn’t have a true picture of the nation,” she said. Most agencies have helped willingly,. Ms. Taeuber said, by responding to letters. the bureau sent to more than 39,000 local. governments and to additional queries made to advocacy groups. These feelers resulted in lists of more than 11,000 shel- ters and about an equal number of more casual sites where the homeless are known to spend nights. . Because federal funding of some pro- grams will spring from the head count of homeless, most agencies are trying to help the census takers get as accurate a count as possible, said Ed Abrahams, di- rector of the Food and Hunger Hotline in New York and former director of the Co- alition for the Homeless there. “You have to hold your nose and coop- | erate,” he said, noting that the numbers emerging from the census will become | the accepted total that defines the prob- | lem of homelessness, accurate or not. Logistically, the count will be broken | down into three segments: 6 p.m. to midnight, people in shel- ters and homeless-designated hotels. 2-4 a.m., people on the streets, a48 am., people emerging from abandoned buildings or other known sites of congregation. Officials decided it is too dangerous for census takers to wander inside aban- doned buildings or peer into trash dump- sters or vehicles, so they set up the 4-8 a.m. stakeouts. Except for a few potential confronta- tions at homeless shelters, the most dicey part of the job will be counting people on the streets. Homeless people don’t neces- sarily look like they’re homeless, nor will they always admit it. “So we're telling the enumerators to count everybody they see except people in uniform or those engaged in obvious moneymaking activities,’ Ms. Taeuber said. The latter includes prostitutes. Around the country, census takers are ‘being briefed on whom to approach and. how to do it. Those people sleeping or uncoopera- tive will be counted, and the enumerators will be told to guess at characteristics such as age, race and sex. Those willing to respond will be asked James, 52, is a panhandier who says he will talk to census takers at his makeshift seven questions, similar to queries on the short census forms going out to millions of American households. In most places, police departments are not expected to provide special pro- tection to enumerators but will be on the lookout for trouble. “We'll be doing some extra patrol- ‘ling,” said Maj. J.L. Mullins, commander of Atlanta’s downtown police district. “We want to assist them in any way we can.” In Atlanta, census takers will wear white vests with black letters that say “Census 1990” and will be equipped with whistles and flashlights. The totals won't be tallied for public consumption until 1991, when the rest of Rick McKay/Washington Bureau home. He has lived seven years across from the State Department in Washington. the census figures are released. Even then, there will not be a single | number assigned to the homeless popula- | tion. To avoid controversy over exactly | what constitutes homelessness, the Cen- sus Bureau has decided to present its fig- ures in categories. For example, the population in home- less shelters probably will be listed under the category of group quarters popula- tion, along with students living in college dormitories, and prisoners, said Ray Ban- croft, a bureau spokesman. There proba- bly will be another category for those sleeping on the streets. “People putting together a homeless bare will have to pick and choose,” he said. Atlanta Constitution - March 20, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "D.C. homeless shelter shuts the door on census, but counters aren’t daunted By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Census Bureau sidestepped a confronta- tion with a homeless advocate Tuesday evening and pushed on into the night to assemble the first national portrait of the hundreds of thousands of people cast adrift in America. Under a glare of TV lights six blocks from the Capitol, veteran homeless lobbyist Mitch Snyder told a crew of a dozen red-vested US. census takers that they were not welcome to count the home- less inside one of Washington’s largest shelters. Protesting that politicians would use the nation’s first-ever homeless count as justi- fication to cut funds for the poor, he told the enumerators, “Most people inside are not all that ex- cited about being counted,” Ralph Calhoun, a census crew leader, told Mr. Snyder, “We are going to thank you very much,” then led his crew away to count at another shelter. Elsewhere throughout the country, early reports showed that the Census Bureau was meet- ing little if any resistance in its ef- fort to determine the magnitude of one of the nation’s ugliest so- cial ills, “Tn Dayton, Ohio, 31-year-old Aletta Calhoun said she wel- comed the queries posed by a pair of census takers visiting her shelter at the Parkside housing complex. “It’s not an intrusion to an- swer these questions if the person asking them is trying to help me,” Ms. Calhoun said. “Some people here will be embarrassed be: cause they're homeless. But I think most will cooperate.” Census officials welcomed the . cold snap that covered much of the eastern half of the nation, say- ing it was driving the homeless out of sleeping places on the streets and into the warmth of shelters, where they were easier to find. Attractions used by local gov- ernments and advocacy groups across the country to entice the homeless to shelters ranged from a free movie and T-shirt at a Dal- las shelter to soap and shampoo in California. In West Palm Beach, Fla., the murder of a 14-year-old girl com- plicated the hunt for homeless Americans, after police an- nounced they believed a home- less man may have been involved and said they would ask the cen- sus takers to help their investi- gation. Census officials said that even if one of the 350 enumerators in Palm Beach County found the man, they would be prohibited from telling police because all in- formation they receive is confi- dential. But they feared the po- lice investigation would make homeless people more frightened than usual of cooperating with any officials, including census takers, The 15,000 people counters, some equipped with walkie-talk- ies for safety on crime-ridden city streets, were expected to com- plete most of their mission today by 11 a.m. EST (8 a.m. on the West Coast). This morning, they would be waiting to see how many home- less walk out of abandoned build- ings on their way to breakfast. Some counting might spill over to tonight, said Census Bu- reau Director Barbara Everitt Bryant, if enumerators fail to visit all designated locations on “S- Night,” or street and shelter night, as the bureau calls this first special census of the homeless. “This will not count the per- son who has isolated him or her- self,” Ms, Bryant said Tuesday. “It is going to count the vast majority, and it is.going to give us what we statisticians call the order of mag- nitude of the size of this problem. Are we talking about a problem that is in the hundreds of thou- sands or are we talking about a problem in the millions?” The census will produce “be- lievable numbers,” she said. Esti- mates of the homeless have ranged from 250,000 to 4 million. The Census Bureau will not come up with a single number of homeless people, Ms. Bryant said, because that would call for an of- ficial definition of homelessness, “That is the role of other agencies and other providers,” she said. Assistant Census Director Pe- ter Bounpane said the census re- ports, to be issued in late 1991, will carry a series of separate en- tries such as those found in shel- ters, those outside in the streets and those seen leaving aban- doned structures. It will be possi- ble to identify and total all those counted in “S-Night,” he said, but the Census Bureau will not make the tally.

        "ocr_text": " ‘Castofis’ roam streets of Europe, Soviet Union as homelessness grows By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau . WASHINGTON — When the world’s first homeless census is tallied next year, it likely will confirm the dismal U.S. reputa- tion for leading the industrial- ized nations in the number of peo- ple living on city streets. But other industrial nations are catching up. And in develop- ing countries, the twin problems of the homeless and the housing crunch are reaching disastrous proportions. “It’s an American disease. We have it, and now we're looking to you to see how you deal with it,” said Madeline Drake, a London consultant who specializes in Eu- ropean -housing and _ home- -lessness. A few years ago, seeing a homeless person on a London street or in an underground rail station was rare. No longer. Card- board and wooden shelters under Thames River bridges now hold teenage fugitives from economic depression in the countryside or tattered, disoriented “bag peo- ple” who were freed to roam be- cause of the dismantling of large mental institutions. In Moscow, where three years ago leaders said there was no homelessness, despairing Soviets can be found on bitingly cold win- ter nights behind the darkened windows of an empty train parked at the Kiev station. Or they head for the southern warmth of Uz- bekistan, where police in Tash- kent will house and feed them for a month while trying to establish their identities. On the outskirts of Hong Kong, where opportunity has knocked harder than in most Asian cities, an estimated 500,000 people live in what the government calls. “squalor huts,” shanties cobbled together from scrap metal and wood. They keep tion ‘ hea T] 3,000. The actual numbers of the homeless worldwide are just as elusive as figures have been in this country, where estimates range from 250,000 to more than 3 million. In France, 2.5 million is the number commonly cited, while a television documentary a year ago said it found 8,000 people liv- ing on the streets of Paris. In Lon- don, the Salvation Army, after surveying the streets, hostels and cheap hotels used to put up poor families, estimated 75,000. Five years ago, the U.N. statis- tical office circulated question- naires to all its member countries to review the homeless popula- tion by sex and age. “We only got two or three [es- timates] back,” said Felicia Pons at the United Nations. “It’s not only because the statistics aren't available, but it’s a sensitive po- litical issue, too.” England and Canada plan to make homeless counts next year, but not as extensive as the one in the United States last week. Nei- ther the United Nations nor oth- er statistical or social agencies contacted could cite a similar census already conducted. But some believe the problem of homelessness is on the rise. There is a pattern of causes, at least in the industrial world: drugs and alcoholism, young peo- ple untrained for the demands of modern technology, older work- ers in a market that no longer has a place for their skills, skyrocket- ing housing costs, deinstitutiona- lization. Ms. Drake calls it a problem of “castoff people.” In Russian, they are called biches, an acronym that stands for “formerly cultured people.” Because housing is so critically in demand in the Soviet Union — | and often assigned through the workplace — one misstep such as losing a job or getting a divorce can land a Soviet out in the cold. In some ways the problem is more visible in more structured, industrially developed nations than in the poorest countries, where housing shortages ap- proach crisis proportions. In the Middle East, Africa and, to an extent, Latin America, large extended families of chil- dren, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins share what food, shelter and money is available. Homelessness is not an overt problem in a Palestinian refugee camp, but up to 20 people may live in a two- or three-room house. A family in Nairobi, Ken- ya, will put up distant cousins from the countryside for years if asked. Many cities have unofficially designated spots where the homeless can spread their few possessions and try to fashion protection for their families. In Cairo, Egypt, as many as a million people eat and sleep on the graves of their ancestors in the City of the Dead. In Manila, Philippines, families make per- manent camp atop Smokv Moun- tain, a massive garbage dump where stinking smoke spirals to the sky from patches of spontane- ous combustion. Governments in developing countries cannot simply turn away peasants rushing to cities in uncontrollable urbanization, but they try to keep them from squat- ting in the central business and tourist core. Peruvian peasants have crammed into Lima until it holds one-third of the country’s popula- tion. They have been allowed to cluster in “young towns” like those that creep around the edges of cities from Hong Kong to Mana gua, Nicaragua. Technically, they may not be considered homeless. And some social activists say they may be better off than the poorest of the poor in the United States. “A poor person in a develop ing country can somehow acquire land — maybe without officia tenure — and gradually with his or her hands can build some sort of shelter,” said James Upchurch, president of the Cooperative Housing Foundation in Wash- ington. Building codes are so strin- gent in Washington that poor peo- ple cannot afford even to build a house slowly, brick by brick or plank upon plank, as is possible elsewhere, said Mr. Upchurch, whose foundation sponsors hous- ing projects in less developed “We've got a lot of vacant land, but you can’t build on it,” he said. “Here, you can’t do anything to help yourself.” Contributing to this article were Journal-Constitution corre- spondents Bob Deans in Hong Kong, T.

Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — On Monday, _ the taxpayers wired $74.9 million to Joplin, Mo., to complete the ’ bailout ofa savings and loan asso- . ciation that had sunk too much depositors’ money into Florida real estate and Texas ware- houses. It was one in a batch of nine ' wires — totaling more than $550 . ' million — that zipped out from . ' the white stone headquarters of _ the federal Resolution Trust » Corp. (RTC) within 24 hours. f The transfers were part ofOp- , | -@ration Clean Sweep, the govern- ment’s plan to spend $1 billion a “day from now through July 1 to sell or liquidate insolvent S&Ls that are being kept alive under ‘temporary federal management. What led upto these nine run- | , of-the-mill savings and loan bail- . outs conducted in a single day? ' Will anyone be punished? , Regulatory secrecy conceals , some answers. But much of what ‘happened can be discovered ; through documents and_ inter- . views with dozens of bank execu- _ tives, federal regulators and real estate brokers. , In two of the nine cases, RTC ‘ officials uncovered information ' that led them to refer the cases to ‘ the Justice Department to deter- ' mine whether there is a basis for criminal prosecution, said RTC ' spokeswoman Nancy - Schwertzing. ‘ She identified the two as Guardian Federal Savings and ; Loan of Bakersfield, Calif., and » Westco Savings Bank of Wilming- ton, Calif. Reached in California, a former executive of Guardian ; Federal said, “I have no knowl-. . edge of this or any reason to see ‘ ‘ why it would be referred to the | Justice Department.” Efforts to. : reach an official of Westco were ' unsuccessful. | Seven other S&L bailouts trig- + gered no referrals for investiga- ‘tion — just a drain of taxpayer « money and a loss of banking com- ' petition. Some failed when their offi- cers made “go-go loans,” depart- _ing from the tradition of lending ‘home mortgage money to middle- ‘class families. Others got caught 1 up in the competition to draw de- 'positors once deregulation al- | lowed them to offer higher inter- ‘ est rates and other services that ' formerly were prohibited. in the Missouri case, for exam- ple, the directors of. Financial *‘ Federal S&L were described by a ‘ Joplin business writer as “all civ- ic stalwarts, successful business- ‘men.” The chief executive was a ‘ local man promoted through the ‘ranks, Over the years, Financial ‘ Federal is said to have financed _ half the houses in Joplin. But once S&Ls were freed in the early 1980s to try to offset losses on old, low-interest mort- gages by dabbling in a wide range of riskier deals, Financial Feder- al’s officers bankrolled multimil- lions of dollars worth of Florida land, Texas warehouses and strip shopping centers, according to the RTC. Joplin Chevrolet dealer Hen- ‘ry Robertson, the S&L’s former board chairman, said that in ret- rospect, “All the directors have outside business and so didn’t have much to do with the day-to- day operations.” The lure of distant, lucrative loans also seems to have trapped a Key West, Fla., S&L, the First Federal Savings & Loan of the ‘Florida Keys. First Federal lent money to high-flying developers who crashed in Texas and Hilton Head, S.C. Even more disastrous- ly, the S&L backed a group of now-departed Venezuelan inves- tors who were promising to build a luxury fishing club condomini- um in Key Largo, Fla., for time- share buyers. “Their problems apparently stemmed from a decision to go out of their market area,” said Harry Wooley, president of the Key West bank that on Monday took over the healthy portion of the S&L in a federally subsidized bailout. HeritageBanc Savings of Dun- eanville, Texas, needed a bailout after it bought large blocks of va- cant land and moved into risky commercial loans. Among _ its failed projects now in govern-: ment hands are two multimillion- dollar self-storage warehouses that were constructed in the al- ready overbuilt Dallas suburbs. “These buildings were built to get a tax break,” said a Dallas real estate agent handling the two properties. “They over-loaned on some of these things. Everybody was doing it.” Some S&Ls, however, got into Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 6, 1990 difficulty without leaving the rel- ative safety of simple home loans. First Federal Savings and Loan, also of Bakersfield, Calif., was what Paul Condon of the RTC called a “traditional, paternalis- tic” operation. The .institution continued financing homes and safe loans in its community, but it got into trouble when it began paying top-of-the-market interest rates to attract big depositors. The crunch hit when the fed- eral government changed its ac- counting system and capital re- quirements last year, Mr. Condon said. Under the tighter new rules, intended to prevent more insol- vencies, First Federal’s position suddenly looked much worse. The half-billion dollars wired Monday by the RTC cinched intri- cate bailout transactions with lo- cal banks or healthy S&Ls, which agreed to pay off the people who had deposits in the failed S&Ls. In coming years, the government expects to recover nearly half the up-front expenditure in those six sales and three liquidations by selling off the rest of the nine S&Ls’ assets, ranging from single- family houses to Key Largo time shares to junk bonds. If that hap- pens, the taxpayer cost will be about $300 million, plus interest. Records that might better ex- plain where the money went are kept secret from the taxpayers, who are picking up the bill. For. example, Frank Realy of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), which inspects federally insured S&Ls, said Thursday that the agency refuses to disclose the pay and fringe benefits of direc- tors and officers of the nine S&Ls on grounds that this is “privileged commercial information.” The OTS also declines to make public its thick, year-old packets of “decision documents” written by bank examiners. These documents lay out each failed S&L’s bad loans, questionable in- a and any indications of ud. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Neil Bush, a Denver oil man, was an outside director of Silverado Banking of Colorado. President Bush’s son may face TV cameras in thrift inquir of an S&L By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The. president's 35-year-old son, Denver oil man Neil Bush, plans to tell a House committee that he is not at fault in the collapse of a Colorado savings and loan whose failure in 1988 Will cost taxpayers about $1 billion. Neil Bush faces tough questions, though, about where the money went and what he did about it, Serving as an outside director of Silverado Banking, Neil Bush voted for multimillion-dollar land deals in the mid-1980s between the now- defunct S&L and Denver developer William L. Walters. During that time Walters was also a partner in Neil Bush’s oil prospecting venture. A House Banking Committee spokesman insist- ed the hearing was not aimed at the president's son but rather at laying out the entire chain of responsi- bility for one of the country’s costlier S&L failures. “We are looking at the Silverado case because it appears to us to be a good case that failed because of conflicts of interest and loans to insid- ers,” said the spokesman, ina preview of the May 22-23 hearing. The prospect of the Democratic-controlled House Banking Committee grilling the president's son before television cameras has emerged at an awkward moment for the Bush administration. This week a swelling budget deficit forced President Bush to signal a retreat from his no-new- taxes pledge, The deficit is being driven in part by the estimated §1 billion a day now being spent to bail out hundreds of insolvent S&Ls. Neil Bush said through a lawyer that he plans to deny that he did anything improper and to answer all committee questions, His lawyer, James Nesland, complained in a PIENNONE INLeTViIAW Chal INVESstizato QM tile Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have refused to give Neil Bush access to minutes of Silverado board meet- ings that Bush needs to prepare his congressional testimony, The minutes are tied up in closed hearings before an M administrative judge on unspecified civil charges against Bush growing out of the Silverado failure, House Banking Committee chairman Henry Gonza- lez, D-Texas, this week listed 21 witnesses besides Neil Bush. They included the three top former officers of | Silverado, who together collected $2.5 million in sala- ries and bonuses in 1986 while the S&L was sliding oward collapse. Another expected witness is Kermit Mowbray, the #4 federal regulator in charge of overseeing Silverado, He % was reportedly forced into retirement when his superi- rs in Washington discovered that he had OK'd many of -| the questionable transactions and accounting practices = that put Silverado in financial jeopardy. ? Links with land developer to be probed But the most politically sensitive name on the Witness list, besides Bush, was the land developer, Walters, who supplied more than half of the seed money when Neil Bush founded the Denver oil company called JNB Exploration in 1983. The committee witness list identified Walters as president of JNB Exploration, but Bush's lawyer characterized that as “inaccurate.” Many of the committee's questions are likely to revolve around Bush's role at Silverado in approving loans and other transactions with Walters that ended as money-losers for the S&L. In three instances, pieces of land sold by Walters to Silverado turned out to be grossly overvalued because Of faulty appraisals accepted by the Silverado board, according to regulatory records, As an S&L director, Bush did vote on_certain transactions with Walters, his lawyer confirmed. “Whatever proposals that were brought before the board between 1985 and 1987, he would have voted on them,” said Nesland. “He didn't believe he had any conflict of interest since he had no interest in the transactions or the borrowers.” Colorado partnership records show that when Neil Bush founded JNB Exploration, Walters put up $150,000 in cash and became a limited partner with a claim to 6.25 percent of the profits or losses, Bush, who was then 28, put up $100 and became the financial general partner, with a 33 percent share and a $66,000 salary, In 1985, when he was 30, Bush joined the board of Silverado as an outside director. By then, Walters was already a major borrower as well as a big stockholder in the S&L, and his borrowings escalated by tens of millions of dollars while Bush was on the board. Nell Bush's job was In oll exploration Meanwhile, Silverado was only a sidelight for Bush, | His fulltime business interest was managing JNB Exploration, whose main focus was seeking potential oil tracts in the Powder River Basin of northeast Wyoming. Walters remained a partner in the oil company and reportedly became a primary source of its financing The Denver Post has reported that a Walters-con- trolled bank supplied a $1.25 million revolving line of credit to JNB Exploration, When his father won the GOP presidential nomina- tion in August 1988, Neil Bush resigned as Silverado director, saying he wanted to avoid conflicts of inter. ests with his father’s position. A few days later, heavy loan losses led to the disclosure that Silverado was insolvent. Silverado was put in receivership by federal regulators in December 1988, a month after George Bush was elected president, Palm Beach Post - May 11, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "FBI tells of backlog on thrifts 21,147 complaints listed as inactive By Joseph Albright Cox News Service WASHINGTON — The FBI has counted a backlog of 21,147 “unad- dressed” complaints of possible fraud in savings and loans, banks and credit unions, a senior FBI of- ficial told Congress Friday. Anthony Adamski, chief of the FBI financial crimes unit, said FBI supervisors use a “triage” process to rank thousands of incoming fraud complaints to see which will be investigated and which will be put aside. He said that as of February, 6,993 of the 21,147 “unaddressed” complaints originated in the na- tion’s S&L crisis, including 169 al- legations in which the alleged irregularities exceeded $1 million. A large number were criminal re- ferrals from regulators examining books of defaulted S&Ls, with the heaviest concentrations in New York and Los Angeles. “What happens to a referral is that it comes into the office and it is reviewed in a triage process,” he said. “And either because the allega- tions within the referral, or the po- tential of it on its face not being a federal allegation, we defer acting on it and put it in an ‘unaddressed work’ file to recall at some later date, unless we can immediately clear the thing (by deciding it is not a federal crime).” House Democrats coaxed Adamski to give the details of the “unaddressed” S&L fraud com- plaints to buttress their contention that the Bush Administration is less in its efforts to prosecute S&L felons. Austin American-Statesman - May 12, 1990 “The American peop with the specter of a $500 billion dollar bailout of the thrift indus- try,” said subcommittee chairman Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. “They are being asked to foot this stagger- ing bill. They demand in return that the SOwernant put to justice the criminals who looted and stole as the thrift industry burned.” Defending the administration, Assistant Attorney General Ed- ward Dennis told the hearing that the Justice Department’s current budget of $50 million is all that can be prudently spent on investigating and prosecuting S&L fraud cases. “They were reviewed,” he said of the complaints listed in FBI files as unaddressed. “They were not put in a drawer someplace and ignored.” Some of these cases were put aside because “we want to look for the cases that involve the larger sums of money,” Dennis said. ‘When today you get into half a million, or a million dollars, if you are talking about a loan that might be involved, or the project that might be involved, that is really not a large amount of money in today’s world,” he said. Eventually all 21,147 complaints be investigated and either prose- cuted or dropped, he promised. He counseled against congressional pressure to spend more on S&L prosecutions, saying the Justice Department was investigating and prosecuting cases as fast as it rea- sonably could. “You can give me a billion dol- lars and you can’t do it in six months,” Dennis said of the cur- rent backlog of S&L complaints. Up to 60 percent of the bankrupt thrifts taken over so far by the gov- ernment were victimized by crimi- nal activity, according to L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., which ad- ministers those thrifts. \f"

        "ocr_text": "RTC struggling to sell houses it took from S&Ls By Marcia Kunstel Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Up to 18,000 homes that must be made available for sale to middle- and _ low-income Americans — the families desperate for housing — are hung up by the agency bailing out failed savings and loans. So far the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency han- dling these houses and other property left by defunct sav- ings and loans, has sold only about 30 of the homes that Congress said last August must be priority offerings to low- people. Officials say 100 proper- | ties have been put on the market. They were selling briskly in Texas, but encoun- tered problems elsewhere, especially in the RTC’s East- ern region, headquartered in Atlanta. A cumbersome bureau- cracy, unrealistically high prices and the lack of low- cost financing were cited by real estate agents and others as reasons for the slow start. — An agency spokesman said that the RTC can’t sell some of the properties it manages because it doesn’t yet have Journal- Constitution May 13, 1990 > and moderate-income clear title to them. “The Resolution Trust has real good ideas, but they don’t know what to do with the ideas,” said Alice Genest, a real estate broker in Seminole, Fla. “Their follow-up is atrocious.” The law governing the S&L bailout allows the RTC to lower prices and provide discount fi- nancing to help potential pur- chasers cinch a deal. However, the RTC has not done that. Stephen Allen, director of the RTC affordable housing program, said the estimated 18,000 houses and apartment buildings in the hands of the RTC fit the price re- quirements and must be part of a special marketing program. They cannot be sold until the RTC finalizes regulations for af- fordable housing sales, although the agency has begun a pilot pro- gram in which 100 properties were placed on sale, Mr. Allen said another 1,000 are in the proc- ess of being placed on sale. The pilot program, however, is riddled with snafus and ham- pered by poor local economic conditions. The experience points to trouble for the effort — mandated by Congress — to sup- ply affordable housing to Ameri- cans who have been shut out of the housing market for years. In the pilot program, single- family homes and condominiums with an appraised value no great- er than $67,500 are offered exclu- sively for 90 days to people who meet low- and moderate-income . guidelines. In Texas, most of the 30 houses offered were sold. But the RTC Eastern region, ~ which covers 26 states from Flori- da to Maine, is so disorganized that some brokers said they were ’. not even aware that they were . listed as participants. Atlanta | “I don’t know what properties I have that are in the program,” said Bruce McMorran, a broker listed as handling two single-fam- ~ ily homes and a fourplex in Baton Rouge, La. “We're waiting to get - instructions from the RTC.” In Columbia, S.C., real estate _ broker Carolyn King said she . knows nothing about the afford- Mortgages $91.6 able housing program, although the RTC lists her as trying to sell five condominiums in the pilot project. The only RTC communi- cation in her files, Ms. King said, is an ethics statement she was asked to sign. Other brokers complained that they have spent months try- ing to get the RTC to approve forms they must use for contracts and other paper work. Several said the RTC appraised values far exceeded the worth of the proper- ty. In at least one case, the RTC price is almost $2,000 higher than the price had been before the RTC took over the property. Back in Washington, Mr. Allen of the RTC expressed concern that any brokers in the pilot pro- gram would claim ignorance of The New York Times how it works. He said he would look into the situation. “To some degree I can under- stand people just coming on board and needing more informa- tion on this,” he said. “But there should be no brokers who we’re working with who state they know nothing about it.” In the RTC central region, based in Kansas City, Mo., and en- compassing 12 states, real estate brokers in the affordable housing program were well-versed in how it works. But they haven’t sold many houses. “The ones we have are very in- expensive houses and it’s hard to obtain financing,” said Ruby Mc- Mahon, who is trying to sell five houses in Coffeyville, Kan. “The people who would live in them \fdon’t have the money to buy them.” The story was the same in Mal- vern, Ark., where Muriel Howard said the RTC personnel “have been very helpful as far as they can go,” but that unemployment is high there and financing “is a ma- jor thing.” She hasn’t sold any of the four homes she has listed. Houston-area brokers, on the other hand, had mostly praise for the affordable housing program. Most of the 30 houses and condo- miniums sold have been located in Texas. “It’s been great,” said broker Beverley Dawson. “I have nine listings with the RTC and eight of them sold within three weeks.” There, the RTC held two ex- tensive training sessions for bro- kers, made sure the properties were placed in multiple listings, advertised the program among non-profit and community agen- cies, and acted quickly when of- fers were made. RTC: Avency strugeles to sell homes to low-income families There also is more subsidized mortgage money available in Tex- as than in many states, through public agencies that issue bonds and offer mortgages to moderate- and low-income, first-time home buyers at interest rates as much as two percentage points below the market rate. Mr. Allen of the RTC said his agency is trying to persuade more public-housing authorities to make low-interest mortgage mon- ey available. The RTC Oversight Board has allocated $6 million for Mr. Allen to offer a fee to agencies that will issue such bonds and re- serve the mortgages for purchas- ers of RTC housing. Advocates of lower-cost hous- ing expressed disappointment that the RTC has not used the au- thority Congress gave it to dis- count housing prices or to pro- vide subsidized financing. Simply making houses avail- able exclusively to middle- and lower-income people for 90 days won’t necessarily help them pur- chase it, said John McEvoy, exec- utive director of the National Council of State Housing Agen- cies. After the 90-day period, the houses will be on the open market available for anyone to buy. - “We had rather hoped that out of that [S&L] mess, some people who otherwise couldn’t buy any house will be able to get one,” he said. : Frank Shafroth of the Nation- al League of Cities was among critics who said the RTC will save money in the long run if it dis- counts prices immediately, so housing can be sold before it de- teriorates further . Eventually, the price will ee i to be dropped anyway, he said. “It will create a crazy situa- tion,” Mr. Shafroth said, “in which a speculator or an investor would have access to this [hous- ing] at a lower price than the low- or moderate-income person.” Family beats odds, gets financing for home By Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Brenda and Keith Starkey and their three young children are the kind of people the federal Resolution Trust Corp.’s af- fordable housing program was created to reach. And the RTC program for selling homes from insolvent S&Ls to ordinary families did reach them, in spite of itself. After nearly a decade of renting, the Texas family was in the market to buy a home. Around the same time a new baby strained their two-bedroom house to the limit, they also received a small inheritance and Keith Starkey got a new job with higher pay. That meant they could afford a down payment and monthly pay- ments of around $570. When a real estate broker told Brenda Star- key about a great three-bedroom house in a Hous- ton suburb, she agreed to take a look. But after she told her husband it cost $66,000, they decided it would be a futile visit, because monthly pay- ments would normally be close to $700. “We weren’t even going to look at the house,” said Mrs. Starkey. “But when we called to cancel the appointment, the real estate agent had al- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 13, 1990 (Continued) ready gone.

        "ocr_text": "RTC struggling to sell houses it took from S&Ls By Marcia Kunstel Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Up to 18,000 homes that must be made available for sale to middle- and _ low-income Americans — the families desperate for housing — are hung up by the agency bailing out failed savings and loans. So far the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency han- dling these houses and other property left by defunct sav- ings and loans, has sold only about 30 of the homes that Congress said last August must be priority offerings to low- people. Officials say 100 proper- | ties have been put on the market. They were selling briskly in Texas, but encoun- tered problems elsewhere, especially in the RTC’s East- ern region, headquartered in Atlanta. A cumbersome bureau- cracy, unrealistically high prices and the lack of low- cost financing were cited by real estate agents and others as reasons for the slow start. — An agency spokesman said that the RTC can’t sell some of the properties it manages because it doesn’t yet have Journal- Constitution May 13, 1990 > and moderate-income clear title to them. “The Resolution Trust has real good ideas, but they don’t know what to do with the ideas,” said Alice Genest, a real estate broker in Seminole, Fla. “Their follow-up is atrocious.” The law governing the S&L bailout allows the RTC to lower prices and provide discount fi- nancing to help potential pur- chasers cinch a deal. However, the RTC has not done that. Stephen Allen, director of the RTC affordable housing program, said the estimated 18,000 houses and apartment buildings in the hands of the RTC fit the price re- quirements and must be part of a special marketing program. They cannot be sold until the RTC finalizes regulations for af- fordable housing sales, although the agency has begun a pilot pro- gram in which 100 properties were placed on sale, Mr. Allen said another 1,000 are in the proc- ess of being placed on sale. The pilot program, however, is riddled with snafus and ham- pered by poor local economic conditions. The experience points to trouble for the effort — mandated by Congress — to sup- ply affordable housing to Ameri- cans who have been shut out of the housing market for years. In the pilot program, single- family homes and condominiums with an appraised value no great- er than $67,500 are offered exclu- sively for 90 days to people who meet low- and moderate-income . guidelines. In Texas, most of the 30 houses offered were sold. But the RTC Eastern region, ~ which covers 26 states from Flori- da to Maine, is so disorganized that some brokers said they were ’. not even aware that they were . listed as participants. Atlanta | “I don’t know what properties I have that are in the program,” said Bruce McMorran, a broker listed as handling two single-fam- ~ ily homes and a fourplex in Baton Rouge, La. “We're waiting to get - instructions from the RTC.” In Columbia, S.C., real estate _ broker Carolyn King said she . knows nothing about the afford- Mortgages $91.6 able housing program, although the RTC lists her as trying to sell five condominiums in the pilot project. The only RTC communi- cation in her files, Ms. King said, is an ethics statement she was asked to sign. Other brokers complained that they have spent months try- ing to get the RTC to approve forms they must use for contracts and other paper work. Several said the RTC appraised values far exceeded the worth of the proper- ty. In at least one case, the RTC price is almost $2,000 higher than the price had been before the RTC took over the property. Back in Washington, Mr. Allen of the RTC expressed concern that any brokers in the pilot pro- gram would claim ignorance of The New York Times how it works. He said he would look into the situation. “To some degree I can under- stand people just coming on board and needing more informa- tion on this,” he said. “But there should be no brokers who we’re working with who state they know nothing about it.” In the RTC central region, based in Kansas City, Mo., and en- compassing 12 states, real estate brokers in the affordable housing program were well-versed in how it works. But they haven’t sold many houses. “The ones we have are very in- expensive houses and it’s hard to obtain financing,” said Ruby Mc- Mahon, who is trying to sell five houses in Coffeyville, Kan. “The people who would live in them \fdon’t have the money to buy them.” The story was the same in Mal- vern, Ark., where Muriel Howard said the RTC personnel “have been very helpful as far as they can go,” but that unemployment is high there and financing “is a ma- jor thing.” She hasn’t sold any of the four homes she has listed. Houston-area brokers, on the other hand, had mostly praise for the affordable housing program. Most of the 30 houses and condo- miniums sold have been located in Texas. “It’s been great,” said broker Beverley Dawson. “I have nine listings with the RTC and eight of them sold within three weeks.” There, the RTC held two ex- tensive training sessions for bro- kers, made sure the properties were placed in multiple listings, advertised the program among non-profit and community agen- cies, and acted quickly when of- fers were made. RTC: Avency strugeles to sell homes to low-income families There also is more subsidized mortgage money available in Tex- as than in many states, through public agencies that issue bonds and offer mortgages to moderate- and low-income, first-time home buyers at interest rates as much as two percentage points below the market rate. Mr. Allen of the RTC said his agency is trying to persuade more public-housing authorities to make low-interest mortgage mon- ey available. The RTC Oversight Board has allocated $6 million for Mr. Allen to offer a fee to agencies that will issue such bonds and re- serve the mortgages for purchas- ers of RTC housing. Advocates of lower-cost hous- ing expressed disappointment that the RTC has not used the au- thority Congress gave it to dis- count housing prices or to pro- vide subsidized financing. Simply making houses avail- able exclusively to middle- and lower-income people for 90 days won’t necessarily help them pur- chase it, said John McEvoy, exec- utive director of the National Council of State Housing Agen- cies. After the 90-day period, the houses will be on the open market available for anyone to buy. - “We had rather hoped that out of that [S&L] mess, some people who otherwise couldn’t buy any house will be able to get one,” he said. : Frank Shafroth of the Nation- al League of Cities was among critics who said the RTC will save money in the long run if it dis- counts prices immediately, so housing can be sold before it de- teriorates further . Eventually, the price will ee i to be dropped anyway, he said. “It will create a crazy situa- tion,” Mr. Shafroth said, “in which a speculator or an investor would have access to this [hous- ing] at a lower price than the low- or moderate-income person.” Family beats odds, gets financing for home By Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Brenda and Keith Starkey and their three young children are the kind of people the federal Resolution Trust Corp.’s af- fordable housing program was created to reach. And the RTC program for selling homes from insolvent S&Ls to ordinary families did reach them, in spite of itself. After nearly a decade of renting, the Texas family was in the market to buy a home. Around the same time a new baby strained their two-bedroom house to the limit, they also received a small inheritance and Keith Starkey got a new job with higher pay. That meant they could afford a down payment and monthly pay- ments of around $570. When a real estate broker told Brenda Star- key about a great three-bedroom house in a Hous- ton suburb, she agreed to take a look. But after she told her husband it cost $66,000, they decided it would be a futile visit, because monthly pay- ments would normally be close to $700. “We weren’t even going to look at the house,” said Mrs. Starkey. “But when we called to cancel the appointment, the real estate agent had al- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 13, 1990 (Continued) ready gone.

        "ocr_text": "Thrift agency finds few buyers for failed S&Ls RTC’s ‘Operation Clean Sweep’ unable to sell biggest institutions By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Halfway through its “Oper- ation Clean Sweep,” the agency trying to sell off or close defunct savings institutions is not finding: lots of buyers. The Resolution Trust Corp. has managed to dispose of fewer than one-third of the 141 S&Ls in the bailout’s accelerated sales campaign, and few are the hard-to-market big ones. - Although the RTC has substantially picked up its former pace by selling or closing 42 S&Ls in seven weeks, it must dispose of another 99 insti- tutions in the next seven weeks if it is to meet a self-imposed June 30 deadline for completing the _ effort. The biggest headaches are expected over of the biggest S&Ls, such as Great Southern ederal in Savannah, Royal Palm Federal in West Palm Beach, Fla., and Murray Federal in Dallas. They are among about 20 S&Ls that each made loans or investments of more than million. : One S&L, CenTrust Bank in Miami, has loans and investments of more than $8 billion, com- pared with the $5 billion total in similar assets for all 42 of the S&Ls disposed of so far in “Operation Clean Sweep.” The sale or closing of 42 S&Ls in seven weeks is a dramatic advance for the RTC, which had dis- posed of only 52 in the previous seven months. In, some cases no bids were considered ac- ceptable, so the RTC ended up simply transfer- ring the deposits of the failed institution to an- other bank or S&L rather than selling it intact. That has left the RTC holding lots of the failed institutions’ loan§ and foreclosed property. Frank Anderson, senior financial institutions analyst at Stephens Inc., an investment banking firm in Little Rock, Ark., said the elimination of tax breaks and other incentives has narrowed the market for S&Ls.

        "ocr_text": "Bush’s son on House hot seat over S&L collapse By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — After four years of shaky loans, cozy land deals and fan- cy bonuses to its officers, one of the shooting stars of the savings and loan: industry — Denver’s Silverado Banking — was about to flame out. Terrified depositors were swamp- ing every branch of Colorado’s third- weren’t happy. They said they would check it with Washington. But first they insisted that Silver- ado’s board agree to cut executive salaries and avoid risking anoth- er $100 million speculating on hourly interest rate changes on Wall Street. There was another problem. Wasn’t it a little awkward for Sil- verado’s board of directors to get an emergency bailout when one of the board members was the vice president’s son, Neil Bush? Although Mr. Bush, 33, was just an outside director, he was bound to be noticed: His father, George, was due to win the GOP presidential nomination in only 10 days. On Monday morning, Silvera- do opened its doors and kept pay- ing off its depositors. By after- noon, Neil Bush resigned from the Silverado board, saying he wanted to avoid a possible con- flict of interest with his father’s campaign. The next day — Aug. 9, 1988 — Silverado got the word from To- ka that it could borrow up to 50 million more in federal funds. That line of credit, approved by the three-member Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Wash- ington, was more than. enough. Silverado drew down $164 million of it to keep its doors open until one month after George Bush was elected president. largest S&L, pulling out $86 million in three days. When the doors ‘finally closed for the weekend, the silver- tongued Silverado chairman, Michael R. Wise, knew that the last $5 million could be gone from the tills by Monday afternoon. Ar. Wise needed a friendly banker, someone who would extend a $450 mil- lion line of credit to an S&L that had just publicly declared it was insolvent. Then, on Dec. 9, the friendly bankers in Topeka pulled the~™ plug. Silverado was placed in re- ceivership, and a news release from Washington said the trans- action would require $1.05 billion in “federal assistance.” That sequence of events, and the financial high jinks leading up to the collapse, are going to be under a congressional spotlight this week as the House Banking Committee attempts to question Mr. Wise, Mr. Bush and a score of other witnesses who played sup- porting roles in the Silverado de- bacle. The hearings Tuesday and Wednesday will be the first full- scale congressional inquiry into an S&L failure since congression- al auditors disclosed in March that taxpayers ultimately may spend as much as $500 billion in bailing out defunct S&Ls. All 50 committee members can take turns as interrogators, and there will be no shortage of zingers: = Mr. Bush is expected to be pressed on why he voted to ap- prove Silverado loans to William Walters, a Colorado land develop- er who also happened to be his partner in the oil business. m Mr. Wise can expect lively questioning about why he and two other Silverado officers shared $1.4 million in salaries and $1.1 million in short-term incentive bonuses for a year in which Sil- verado had to use accounting He picked up the phone and called the institution that already had lent $533 million to Silverado. It was the To- peka, Kan., regional office of the Feder- al Home Loan Bank, a little-known arm of the federal government that had the conflicting tasks of policing and pro- moting the S&L industry. The federal. bankers in Topeka tricks to show even a meager profit. =@ Mr. Wise’s friendly banker, Kevin Mowbray, former president of the Home Loan Bank of Tope- ka, is expected to be grilled on whether he kept Silverado afloat to spare candidate Bush from em- barrassment. Beyond these attention-grab- bers, committee sources said the hearing is likely to throw new light on one corner of the S&L cri- sis that stayed largely in shadow. That is the government’s 60-year practice of serving as banker of last resort to the nation’s S&Ls. The government has been lending money to S&Ls at least since 1932, when Congress acted to keep home mortgage credit from drying up during the De- pression by creating a network of 12 Federal Home Loan Banks. They sell bonds and lend the pro- ceeds to S&Ls. Congress still believes govern- ment lending to S&Ls is neces- sary, much as the Federal Re- serve Board is needed to back- stop banks. Yet Congress last year directed the Home Loan Banks to Atlanta Journal- Constitution May 20, 1990 > \fFailure: Neil Bush may be asked why he voted for Silverado loans to his oil business partner, William Walters. tighten their lending practices, and the Silverado hearing could lead to further restrictions on federal loans to S&Ls, Over the first half-century of Home Loan Bank lending, loans to S&Ls gradually rose to a total of $66 billion by 1982. Then, over- night, the pace of lending jumped when the new S&L deregulation freed S&Ls from the old rule that they could use the borrowed mon- ey only to finance home mort- gages and for seasonal cash needs, Suddenly S&Ls started draw- ing out multimillion-dollar “ad- vances” from the Federal Home Loan Banks , By 1988, the Federal Home Loan Banks had increased their outstanding loans to S&Ls from $66 billion to $153 billion. When the S&L house of cards began col- lapsing, the government gradual- ly began cutting back. But even now, the government’s outstand- ing loans to S&Ls total $132 bil- lion, including $17 billion in loans to failed S&Ls that have been seized by federal authorities. Government officials insist the government didn’t lose a pen- ny on the loans to Silverado — or on loans it has made to other S&LS that went bankrupt. The reason, they say, is that the Home Loan Banks always demand enough collateral to protect them in case of default. Defenders of loans to S&Ls also note that federal loans were not the main conduit of the funds sucked up by S&Ls to feed their aa to rapid growth in the A much more widely used — and abused — source of money was the network of private depos- it brokers who rounded up buyers for their $100,000 certificates of deposits, By paying big fees to these brokers, S&Ls could obtain virtu- ally unlimited supplies of cash from outside their communities — provided they offered top in- terest rates, But a few big S&Ls apparently did prefer to deal with their friendly bankers at the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, where the interest was lower. Some, including Silverado, got overextended through easy ac- cess to these federal loans. Silverado’s financial state- ments show that its debt to the Home Loan Bank in Topeka rose from $49 million in early 1984 to 56 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 20, Colorado savings and loan limps to House hearing $533 million in July 1988, just be+: fore the panic withdrawals started.

Here is the new math Treas- ury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady gave to Congress: Needed to bail out up to 1,030 S&Ls that have failed or might fail: $90 to $130 billion. The old estimate was that taxpayers could bail out the 450 to 550 S&Ls thought to be dead or ailing by pavsne out $50 billion to $82 bil- ion Not mentioned in the new projection: =The estimated $40 billion spent or committed to rescue the first batch of 215 S&Ls — ing Denver’s Silverado Banking — that collapsed late in the Rea- gan administration. = The interest charges to pay off the bonds the government is floating to pay for the S&L bail- out. Between now and the year 2020, the interest could run up to $200 billion or more, according to congressional estimates. includ-. The old administration esti- mate, which formed the basis for last summer’s S&L bailout legis- lation, called for $8 billion to be spent in the next fiscal year. The new projection increases this to $61 billion. “One could make even bleak- er assumptions and make an esti- mate based on even higher popu- lations of failed thrifts,’ Mr. Bra- dy said. But he called that ‘‘quite unlikely.” President Bush’s new chief S&L regulator, Timothy J. Ryan, later said the costs are higher be- cause new studies by the Office of Thrift Supervision show that more of the nation’s 2,502 S&Ls have slipped into financial trou- ble in recent months. Mr. Ryan, who has been OTS director for one month, disclosed that 299 operating S&Ls are so close to failure that they are con- sidered likely to be seized by the government’s S&L bankruptcy manager, the Resolution Trust Corp. These teetering on the brink of failure include 42 in Texas, 29 ‘in Florida, 25 in California and 25 in Illinois. Mr. Ryan said another 15 “likely” to be taken over by the RTC are in Ohio, which has not been never asa oa with a high collapses. He did not provide a list and said he could offer no fur- ther explanation. Beyond the “likely” failures, Mr. Ryan said another 315 operat- ing S&Ls are “troubled,” many showing recurrent losses and holding too many delinquent mortgages. Those in the “trou- bled” category rose by 42 percent in athree-month period ending in December, he said. He began by expressing relief that fully half of the operating S&Ls remain strong. But when pressed, he said, “I worry that we have not examined these institu- tions, some of them, in the last six to nine months ... and that trou- bles me.” Asked what he could say after one month in office to give the public faith in the S&L system, Mr. Ryan pondered and then said, “I teel comforted by the fact that the healthy part of this industry, at least between these last two quarters, has been healthy and stable. As to the lower end of the industry, which, as I said, has got- ten worse, I have no real positive message: I wish I did.” « Atlanta Constitution - May 24, 1990 \f"

That sent ripples of laughter through the hearing room. As a director of Silverado Banking, Bush was involved in loaning $106 million to Walters, who was a limited partner in Bush’s JNB Exploration, an oil and gas company. Walters de- faulted on all the loans. Sound practices Bush and four other directors of Silverado, testifying before the House Banking, Financ@jand Ur- ban Affairs Committee, all de- fended themselves and their managers as following sound business practices. They took no blame for the failure of Silverado, which was bloated with bad loans, went belly up in 1988, and could cost taxpayers more than $1 bil- lion. The committee spent two days trying to figure out where Silver- ado went wrong, but some former government regulators, institution officials and big borrowers re- fused to appear. Yesterday the committee took the somewhat unusual action of voting to subpoena 10 of them to testify about Silverado, along with another four men who oversaw the collapse of four other mega- ‘bucks S&Ls. No disclosure In answering questions, includ- ing allegations by a federal regu- lator that he improperly failed to disclose conflicts of interest, Bush admitted he never officially dis- Associated Press Neil Bush, testifying at a House committee hearing, denies wrongdoing in the failure of Silverado Banking. closed his relationship with Wal- ters or his early dealings with developer Kenneth Good. Bush, a Silverado director from August 1985 to August 1988, said a $100,000 loan he received from Good in 1984 wasn’t expected to be repaid — and in fact was writ- ten off this year — so he didn’t need to disclose it. “It may sound a little fishy,” Bush conceded, explaining that Good is a multimillionaire who expected to get paid back only if the investment for which Bush used the money succeeded. It didn’t. Other members of the defunct Silverado board said they had not been aware of the $100,000 loan to Bush, who wrote a letter on Good’s behalf requesting a $900,000 line of credit from Sil- verado. son denies S&L conflict The most pointed questions came from Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Il., who revealed a 1985 letter from the former chairman of Sil- verado. It explained to preferred stockholders that Bush was being asked to sit on the board, and said he had agreed to abstain from any board considerations regard- ing Silverado’s relations with Walters and Good. . Bush said he never had made such an agreement. Annunzio said the former chairman also will be asked about the agreement, and if he confirms it, ‘‘one of you will be lying under oath, and that’s perjury.” “Do you still insist that you never agreed to the conditions in the July 1985 letter that I have here?’’ Annunzio asked. “Yes sir,’’ Bush replied. Hot exchange Other members repeatedly grilled Bush about his transac- tions with Walters and Good and attempted to get some explana- tion of why his dealings did not pose a conflict. Bush always said, simply, that they did not. Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., engaged in a long, hot exchange about the loan from Good, finally charging in an exasperated tone: ““A $100,000 no-risk loan is tanta- mount to a self-interest that ought to be reported. Maybe those weren’t big numbers in your book, but in the regulatory book they are.” Bush also said under question- ing that he never used political influence to hold off regulatory actions against Silverado, al- though he admitted he would be ‘naive’ to assume there were no political motivations behind the invitation to him to serve on the S&L’s board. The most direct defense of Bush came from Rep. Jim Leach, R- Iowa, who said, ‘‘It’s conceivable that mischievous people with mischievous motives wanted to use the son of the then vice pres- ident. It’s inconceivable that Neil Bush willingly committed any wrong.”’ Berkshire Eagle (Pittsfield, Massachusetts) - May 24, 1990 \f"

After it was disclosed earlier this month that Mr. de Klerk would hold talks with President Bush on June 18, aweek before Mr. Mandela meets the president, anti-apartheid activists ‘promised to demonstrate against Mr, de Klerk. Mr. Mandela is deputy pres- ident of the African National Con- ress, the main black activist group fighting to change the white minority government. Some members of Con- gress said they would refuse to meet with the South African leader, Mr, de Klerk’s decision “is a vie- tory for TransAfrica and for other anti-apartheid activists in the U.S.,” declared Randall Robinson, execu: tive director of TransAfrica, the group coordinating Mr, Mandela's trip and spearheading efforts to dis- rupt Mr, de Klerk’s visit, Mr. Mandela said the order of ap- pearanice is not important, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there was no U.S, pres- sure on Mr, de Klerk to back off from his visit. | A State Department official who asked not to be identified called the postponement unfortunate, because it denies Mr, Bush an opportunity to press Mr, de Klerk to continue or even speed up his reforms of the apartheid system, \"It makes the United States less relevant” to the peace process un- folding in South Africa, he said.

        "ocr_text": "Hospital clears Mandela for 45-day global journey By Joseph Albright Cox News Service JOHANNESBURG — Nelson Mandela, saying “I feel on top of the world,” prepared Saturday to walk out of the hospital and begin a global marathon of anti-apartheid appearances in least 21 African, European and North American cit- ies in 45 days. Mandela had a non-cancerous cyst removed from his bladder Monday. Shortly after daybreak on Mon- day, the deputy president of the African National Congress is due to fly north on the rigorous trip. Mandela intends to articulate his case for keeping economic pressure on the white government of South Africa until apartheid is dismantled. Along the way, he will star at fund-raisers designed to gather a major portion of the $20 million the ANC is seeking to rebuild itself as a newly legal political organiza- tion inside South Africa. On Saturday, Mandela’s physi- cian, urologist Dr. Gus Gecelter, called the 71-year-old activist “a very fit young man for his age” and said his recent surgery should not cause problems during the journey. Despite the medical assurances, some Western diplomats have ex- pressed worry that the trip could prove too exhausting to the former political prisoner, who they regard as an essential player in the recent- ly initiated peace talks between the Austin American-Statesman - June 3, 1990 ANC and the white government. “I hope they don’t try to overschedule him too much,” said one diplomat. “He is absolutely vital.” Mandela showed no trace of sec- ond thoughts about his itinerary. - “I feel on top of the world and I am looking forward to the trip with eagerness,” Mandela said. Aides said Mandela plans to leave the hospital today and to be- gin his trip Monday morning. His first stop will be Gabarone, Botswana. After a transit stop in London, Mandela arrives in Paris on Wednesday and then travels to Switzerland and West Germany. Mandela’s major forum in Eu- rope will be appearances June 13 and 14 in front of assembled dele- gates of the European Parliament and the European Community in Strasbourg, France. In late June, the European Community is to vote on whether to loosen sanc- tions against South Africa. After Strasbourg, Mandela flies to Rome to meet Pope John Paul II and Italian leaders, then rests for a weekend and flies to Canada. Then, on the morning of June 20, a chartered airplane will carry the Mandela party to New York. He will remain in the United States for 10 days. From then on it is Dublin, Ire- land; London; Uganda; Ethiopia; ‘Kenya; and Mozambique. _ The trip is due to end on Mande- la’s 72nd birthday, July 18. \f"

        "ocr_text": "CIA tip led | to ’62 arrest of Mandela Ex-official tells of U.S. ‘coup’ to aid S. Africa By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — For nearly 28 years, the U.S. government has harbored an increasingly embarrassing secret: A CIA tip to South African intelligence agents led to the arrest that put black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela in prison for most of his adult life. But now, with Mr. Mandela en route to the United States and a hero’s welcome, a former U.S. official has revealed that he has known of the CIA role since Mr. Mandela was seized by agents of the South African police special branch Aug. 5, 1962. The retired intelligence offi- cial said that within hours after Mr. Mandela’s arrest, Paul Eckel, then a senior CIA opera- tive, walked into his office and said approximately these words: “We have turned Mandela over to the South African security branch. We gave them every de- tail, what he would be wearing, the time of day, just where he would be. They have picked him Nelson Mandela He'll get hero’s welcome in U.S. up. It is one of our greatest coups.” With Mr. Mandela out of pris- on, the retired official, who re- quested anonymity, decided there no longer is a valid reason for secrecy. He called the Ameri- can role in the affair “one of the most shameful, utterly horrid” byproducts of the Cold War struggle between Moscow and Washington for influence in the Third World. Mr. Mandela, 71, arrives in the United States on June 20 as part of an international tour to bolster the anti-apartheid move- ment. Deputy president of the African National Congress (ANC) and widely regarded as the world’s pre-eminent political prisoner before being released in February, he will be honored with a ticker-tape parade on Broadway in New York and ad- dress a joint session of Congress. Such honors would have been unimaginable three decades ago, when Cold War fears dictated. Washington political life. That summer in 1962, the Kennedy administration began receiving the first reports of So- viet missiles in Cuba, a develop- ment that in a few months would put President John F. Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita S. Khru- shchev “eyeball to eyeball” on the brink of nuclear war. U.S. covert activity was being played out all over the globe, in- cluding South Africa, though it was not a front-burner issue at the time and Mr. Mandela was not yet an international figure. In Johannesburg, the CIA’s co- vert branch saw the ANC as a threat to the stability of a friend- ly South African government. At the time, that government not only had just signed a military cooperation agreement with the United States but also served as an important source of uranium. Five years earlier, the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria cabled Washington that South Africa’s educated black elite was ‘‘psy- chologically susceptible to the extremes of Black Nationalism or Communism” and had influ- ence “extending beyond the bor- ders of South Africa into and among the Native leadership of other African countries.” A bit- ter, open conflict pitting these blacks against whites in South Africa ‘‘could become a cardinal threat to American security,” the cable warned. Interviews in the United States and South Africa por- trayed a CIA covert branch in Jo- hannesburg that by 1962 devoted more money and expertise to penetrating the ANC than did the fledgling intelligence service of the South African government. In an interview last week at his avocado farm in South Afri- ca’s eastern Transvaal region, retired South African intelli- gence operative Gerard Ludi re- called, ‘‘South Africa had recent- ly withdrawn from the British Commonwealth, and we had lost our support from MI-5 and MI- 6,” the British intelligence agen- cies. “At that time, we never had the funds. So we didn’t have a proper intelligence department. There were only about three of us in 1962. But the CIA at that time was flush with funds. They helped us a lot.” Mr. Ludi disclosed that at the time of Mr. Mandela’s arrest, the CIA had a highly successful “deep cover” agent in the inner circle of the ANC branch in Dur- ban. That agent provided his American case officer with an ongoing account of ANC activi- ties there. Mr. Ludi said the case officer was his longtime friend Millard Shirley, whom he identi- fied as the CIA’s chief undercov- er agent in southern Africa. “Millard was very proud of that operation; he told me that later,” Mr. Ludi said. Asked about the tip about Mr. Mandela to South African au- thorities, CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield replied, “‘Our policy is not to comment on such allega- tions.” Nor, he said, will the agency either confirm or deny employment or association with the CIA or discuss any allega- tions about its intelligence activi- es. CIA involvement in Mr. Man- dela’s arrest has been rumored since the mid-1980s. But Mr. Mandela’s' associates have known only that on Aug. 4, 1962, the night before his arrest, he came out of hiding to attend a dinner party in Durban with 12 to 15 longtime confidants affiliat- ed with the local ANC branch. Mr. Mandela’s authorized bi- ographer, Fatima Meer, was among the guests. In her first- hand account of the dinner, she wrote: “Nelson cut a large figure in khaki, his laugh booming and the familiar welcome as he em- braced each friend. ... They laughed a lot, excited by their in- trigue. The police were looking for Nelson and here they were partying with him, virtually un- der their noses. If Nelson had any apprehensions, he did not show them.” The next morning, Mr. Man- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 10, 1990 > Mandela: CIA mum on reported role in 62 arrest dela was arrested at a police roadblock as he drove out of Dur- ban in an Austin owned by a white theatrical producer. The Meer biography quotes Mr. Man- dela as remembering that a South African police sergeant in- stantly saw through his false identity: ‘‘He said he knew that I was Nelson Mandela and he had a warrant for my arrest.’’ Mr. Ludi said he doesn’t know whether the arrest resulted from information the CIA ob- tained from its Durban ‘‘deep cover’? agent. Mr. Ludi said that during the summer of 1962 he was working as an undercover agent outside South Africa. The retired U.S. official who told of the CIA connection said he raised the matter again sever- al years later with Mr. Eckel, the CIA operative. Who’s Who in America has described Mr. Eckel as a noted Far Eastern scholar who served in the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria and, later, as a National Security Council staffer during the Johnson ad- ministration. Encountering Mr. Eckel after a South African court sentenced Mr. Mandela to life imprison- ment for sabotage, the official The retired official who told of the CIA’s involvement in Mr. Mandela’s arrest alerted others at the time. He told Deputy As- sistant Secretary of State Henry Taska, who was then responsible for liaison between the CIA and the State Department’s African Affairs Bureau, that Mr. Man- dela fundamentally was an Afri- can nationalist, though he had worked with the South African Communist Party. Mr. Taska agreed. A few days later, Mr. Taska said, he took up the issue with “higher authori- ties’’ and, as a result, South Afri- can dissidents no longer were to be turned over to police without prior State Department approv- al. To the official’s knowledge, such approval never was given, though it was requested for at least three other South Africans. Another source, a U.S. aca- demic expert on Africa who served as a junior U.S. Embassy political officer in Cape Town during the late 1950s, said he has heard reliably about a U.S. role in the arrest of,Mr. Mandela, though he has no firsthand proof. the relationship that then existed between Washington and the South African government. “In June 1962,” Mr. Schle- singer has written, “in connec- tion with the establishment of a United States military tracking station in South Africa, we had agreed to sell South Africa arms for use against communist ag- gression; this limitation was meant to exclude arms which could be used to enforce apart- heid, but the distinction was not always clear.’’ Reached at his New York of- fice, Mr. Schlesinger said he had no knowledge about whether the CIA played a role in Mr. Mande- ‘la’s capture. ‘‘I wasn’t involved in South Africa at all,’” he said. At the home of Joseph Sat- terthwaite, who was the U.S. am- ‘bassador to South Africa in 1962, ‘Mr. Satterthwaite’s wife said he was too ill to comment. She said’ that after Mr. Mandela’s arrest, “I have a good deal of confi- dence that some CIA pérson did indeed pass on the information,”’ her husband made repeated en- asked how the CIA happened to ’ treaties to the government for know where to find Mr. Mandela. He remembers Mr. Eckel telling him the information had come — from a paid CIA informant in South Africa who had been taught to communicate with his CIA superiors there through an elaborate series of indirect con- tacts known as ‘‘cutouts.”’ Mr. Eckel retired to the Atlanta area about 10 years ago and died in 1986. His son, the Rev. Paul T. Eckel, former pastor at First Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, said his father spoke very sym- pathetically about the problems of black South Africans and ex- pressed concern that failure to grant them basic rights would re- sult in revolution. But he said he knew no details of his father’s work in South Africa or else- where. “‘He was, of course, related with the CIA and could not talk about it and could not confide in anyone, at least not in the family, about the things which he did,’’ the Rev. Eckel said. : the academic said. ‘‘I feel it is es- sentially true.” Scant detalis are available about who knew what in the Ken- nedy administration and what they did about it. likely did not reach the highest levels. Dean Rusk, who was then secretary of state, said he is “completely blank’’ about the matter, having no knowledge of whether the CIA was involved. “I’m not aware that I was ever aware of this fellow Mandela’”’ back then, said Mr. Rusk, now a professor at the University of Georgia in Athens. Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who served in the Kennedy administration and later had ac- cess to many internal docu- ments, has provided a glimpse at The matter permission to visit him in prison but always was refused. One of Mr. Mandela’s sched- uled events later this month is a luncheon at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, which is one repository for still-classified Na- tional Security Council papers and U:S. intelligence cables from Africa covering the period when ‘he was arrested. The luncheon at the library has been arranged by the late president’s brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a leading U.S. foe of apartheid. A spokesman for Mr. Man- dela, Ahmed Kathrada, said the ANC long has been aware of ru- . mors of a CIA link to Mr. Mande- - la’s arrest but that he is sure Mr. ‘ Mandela bears no resentment. Mr. Kathrada said, ‘“‘He ac- cepted the invitation [to the Unit- .ed States], didn’t he?’’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 10, 1990 (Continued) \f"

On another issue, Mr. Wilkins confirmed that the Coca-Cola Co. had offerred to help support the Mandela visit and said it was turned down because it is among the companies “that still do busi- ness in South Africa.” \f"

It was part of a day in which he tried to cajole, charm and shame Western Europe’s Parlia- ment into continuing the sanc- tions until his African National Congress gives the world a signal to drop them. Mr. Mandela addressed the 518 parliamentarians en masse, in small groups and one by one, answering more than four hours of questions from delegates and journalists. His appearance came on the eve of a debate in the 12-nation assembly on whether to approve a conservative Italian delegate’s proposed resolution calling for “cancellation” of sanctions against South Africa, imposed in an effort to break the country’s system of apartheid. The resolution, which also urges the ANC to renounce its proclaimed policy of “armed struggle,” carried the signatures of 80 delegates by nightfall.

But no matter how it goes on record, the Parliament’s position will weigh formidably when European heads of state meet June 25 in Dublin, Ireland, and try to ham- mer out a consensus on whether sanctions should be eased. In his talk to cheering dele- gates from the 12 West European countries, Mr. Mandela lauded South African President Freder- ick W. de Klerk as a man of integ-. rity. He said Mr. de Klerk and his National Party Cabinet ministers “speak honestly” when they say they want to end apartheid. Mr. Mandela later was pressed on whether he would promise that the ANC never would use violence. He replied, “The methods indications of free political activ- ity ... the people are entitled to turn to violence to defend them- selves,” he said. “And that is what has happened in South Afri- ca.

They had breakfast in their suite at Strasbourg’s most ex- pensive hotel and then walked side by side through the lobby to their waiting motorcade. Ac- companied by a French motor- cycle escort, their limousine took them to the modernistic headquarters of the European Parliament. Outwardly, it was just the start of another 14-hour day in their hectic journey to lobby for support of the African Na- tional Congress. But it was also a rare day for them. “While I was in prison, we never had a proper situation to celebrate,” Mr. Mandela said earlier. He was released Feb. 11 after more than 27 years in prison. After one news conference, a reporter stopped the Mande- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 15, 1990 las to congratulate them on their impending 32nd anniver- sary. They looked at each other and smiled. Mr. Mandela, thanking the reporter for re- membering, said, “If I’d known you were going to say that, I would have taken 30 minutes to answer your question.” Mr. Mandela, now 71, was 38 when he met Winnie Madi- kizela, then a 23-year-old social worker at Soweto’s Baragwan- ath Hospital. It was 1957. Mr. Mandela was getting a divorce from his first wife, Evelyn, that became final that year. By then, Mr. Mandela al- ready was a rising star in the ANC and one of South Africa’s first black lawyers. The police long since had decided he was dangerous and, at the time, he was out on bail during a four- year trial on treason charges. One day in 1957 he invited Miss Madikizela to the court- room in Johannesburg. During a recess, he introduced her to the other defendants. Fellow defendant Moses Katane is said to have quipped on seeing her, “Such intimidat- Nelson and his wife, Winnie, met in 1957. ing and seductive beauty does not go with a revolutionary.” On June 14, 1958, they were married in a nearby mission church. At the wedding dinner, they ate a tribal feast served from three-legged iron pots and heard the bride’s father, Kokani Madikizela, give a speech of love mixed with fore- boding. “This marriage will be no bed of roses,” Mr. Madikizela said. “It is threatened from all sides, and only the deepest love can preserve it.” In August 1962, two months after their fourth anniversary, he was arrested again and put on trial, then sentenced to life for sabotage. They have two children, daughters Zeni, 31, and Zindzi, 29. Neither is accompanying the Mandelas in Europe. \f"

        "ocr_text": "European Parliament endorses keeping sanctions on S. Africa By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent STRASBOURG, France — The European Parliament hand- ed Nelson Mandela a significant victory Thursday by voting for continuing full sanctions against South Africa until apartheid is “irrevocably abolished.” The deputies from 12 Euro- pean countries voted 177-47 to reject an effort by Italian and German conservatives to sup- port a relaxation of sanctions as a reward for South Africa’s recent steps toward loosening its segre- gation policies. The vote came 24 hours after Mr. Mandela had appealed to the European parliamentarians for continued sanctions. Many of the deputies’ desks were draped with flags of his African National Congress (ANC) to herald his ar- rival. Mr. Mandela delivered what he called a “serious warning” that even a slight weakening of sanctions could undercut the ANC in peace negotiations with the white-run South African gov- ernment. Such a step would be “disastrous,” he said at a news conference. The ANC flags were gone during Thursday’s debate, but it Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 15, 1990 was obvious Mr. Mandela had left a powerful impression. Pleading for continued sanc- tions, Scottish delegate Winifred Ewing of the Rainbow ecologist bloc said, “He is a pillar of hu- manity. He is a man singularly free of bitterness.” French socialist Jean-Pierre Cot agreed that it was no time to reward South Africa. “The man we honored yesterday still has no vote in his own country,” he said. They spoke for the left-of- center bloc that pushed the measure through in a secret elec- tronic ballot. Their resolution calls on the European heads of state to continue ‘“‘all sanctions, including economic, cultural and sporting sanctions” at the forth- coming European summit June 25 in Dublin, Ireland. Though the pro-sanctions vote is not binding on European governments, it is expected to have a noticeable political im- pact both in Europe and in South Africa. Among blacks, it could strengthen Mr. Mandela’s politi- cal position against leaders of in- creasingly popular Pan African- ist Congress, which criticizes Mr. Mandela for negotiating with whites. . Within South Africa’s white community, the vote will be tak en as a blow to President Fre derik W. de Klerk, who recentl visited Europe to urge leade there to begin relaxing sanctions By a separate vote, the Par liament also called on unnamec member countries to “reconsid er” plans to ask the Dublin sum mit to relax sanctions. It was an attempt to isolate British Prime Minister Margare Thatcher, the only Europea head of government who has come out for easing sanctions Britain dropped its ban on ne British investments in South Af rica after the white minority gov ernment released Mr. Mandelz on Feb. 11, after more than 2 years in prison. The only call for a total elimi nation of sanctions came fro Marco Pannella of Italy’s neo fascist Radical Party. Mr. Pan nella was hissed by other dele gates when he compared Mr Mandela’s imprisonment to tha of Italian fascists who were jailed as war prisoners after World War II. Mr. Mandela — now in the 11th day of a six-week anti-apart heid tour of Africa, Europe and North America — was flying te Rome to meet Pope John Paul I today. His U.S. tour is scheduled to begin June 20 in New York. \f"

Members of the House Banking Committee, both Republicans and Democrats, bristled with political ire as they grilled Treasury Secre- tary Nicholas Brady, Housing Sec- retary Jack Kemp and Federal Re- serve Chairman Alan Greenspan 17,000 cases Brady said various agencies working on the S&L scandal have referred to the Jus- tice Department for possible pros- ecution. So far few prosecutions have emerged. And Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., summed up the sentiment: “There’s an appearance to the public that the RTC is floundering and the Oversight Board isn’t do- ing what it can.”’ More than one congressman prefaced sharp questions with comments that the voters are ha- rassing them increasingly about the savings and loan cave-in. about the steadily growing failures of savings and loan institutions. After Brady testified that anoth- er 299 S&Ls will probably be seized by the government, while another 315 look shaky, Ohio Rep. Chalmers Wylie, the ranking Re- publican on the committee, asked, ‘Why weren’t these identified earlier?” Democratic Rep.

        "ocr_text": "Peace talks South Africa’s biggest change in 3 decades By Joseph Albright “. JOHANNESBURG — On the day: Nelson Mandela left for his world tour, the Johannesburg Star nonchalantly reported, “Bedtime apartheid on trains is over.” Under a small-type headline on an inside page, the 124-word item said that the South African railway network had ended sepa- rate “black” and “white” coach- es on long-distance trains. It was just another ripple in the river of revisions that is now coursing through South Africa. Common people of all races grew up measuring change like rainfall: in fractions of an inch r year. Now, many say they are gntused. They don’t know ere the current of change is *eading. They are perplexed be- se igause some of the ripples are ingining upstream. «2. : For instance, on the same day cas. ‘the item on train desegrega- | appeared, the South African ication and culture minister mised the principals of Afri- *kaans public high schools that t@itites needn’t fear losing con- -of the country’s white public school system. Behind the confusion, the most important change in 30 years is simply that peace talks have begun. A conservative Afrikaaner- dominated government has opened negotiations about the fu- ture of South Africa with the Af- rican National Congress. For the moment, they have decided that there will be only two parties at the table — the government rep- resenting the whites and the ANC as the surrogate of the country’s 28 million voteless blacks. “We were all of us a bit sur- prised at how foolish all of us have been,” ANC foreign affairs director Thabo Mbeki said dur- ing the opening talks May 2-4. “Within a matter of minutes, ev- erybody understood that there was nobody in the room who had horns.” The first fruit of the ANC- government working group was the June 7 partial lifting of the state of emergency. The next round of ANC-government talks are expected in July, and ANC sources hint that they will be capped by the freeing of hun- dreds of political prisoners and the return of thousands of exiles. The downside of the talks is that they have accentuated long- standing jealousies that have ful- minated into combat between the ANC and its political rivals. In Natal Province, gun and spear battles have escalated among the country’s largest eth- nic group, the Zulus. The Zulus are split between factions in the ANC camp and other factions dedicated to the Zulu nationalist organization Inkatha, which is headed by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Outside the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu, another power strug- gle is spilling over into gunfire between the ANC and two more militant black organizations, the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the late Stephen Biko’s black consciousness movement, now called the Azanian People’s Or- ganization. At angry PAC rallies, mem- bers wearing T-shirts embla- zoned with the slogan “One Set- tler, One Bullet,” deride the ANC as “sellouts” for talking to the “colonialists” about “One Man, One Vote.” Mr. Mandela, when first re- leased from jail, devoted his prestige to pleading for an end to black-versus-black _ violence, telling a rally in Natal that every- one must throw their guns and spears into the sea. It didn’t work. Violence sub- sided for only a few days, then South Africa’s major black political organizations rose to a grim new plateau, with 500 blacks killed in Natal just this year. After initially trying to arrange peace talks with Mr. Buthelezi, Mr. Mandela has re- treated from that idea, reported-: ly because he found too much re-- sistance and hatred of Mr. Buth-- elezi among key leaders in the: ANC hierarchy. Against this background of. black turbulence, the white gov-’ ernment has moved on its own to desegregate public white hospi- tals and the country’s prisons. - It also disclosed that it was in- troducing a bill in the white par- liament to end one of the hated pillars of apartheid, the Reserva- tion of Separate Amenities Act. If passed without major loopholes; the new bill would end legal seg: regation.in most restaurants, ho- tels and campgrounds. The government has said that next year it will consider chang- ing or dropping two of apart- heid’s other pillars: the Group Areas Act, which decrees resi- dential segregation, and the Land Acts, which guarantee that the white majority can own the bulk of the country’s land. : African National Philosophy: The ANC’s credo, the Freedom Charter, is a blueprint for a non-racial South Africa and mandates a redistribution of land and wealth. Membership: Claims support from at least half of South Africa's 28 million blacks. Pan-Africanist Congress Philosophy: Espouses black self-reliance in the struggle against apartheid, and complains that whites play too large a role in ANC- aligned groups. Membership: Unknown. Believed to be much smaller than the ANC’s. United Democratic Front Philosophy: Multiracial coalition of some 600 church, student, civic and trade groups. Closely aligned with the ANC and embraces many of the ANC’s political views. Membership: Claims at least 2.5 million. Congress of South African Students Congress of South African Trade Unions Philosophy: More radical than the UDF, its leadership envisions a socialist future for South Africa. Membership: Unknown. Azanian People’s Organization Philosophy: Espouses the ‘black conscious- ness” philosophy popularized by Stephen Biko, who died in police custody in 1977. Preaches non-violence but believes blacks should fight apartheid without white help. Membership: Unknown. Inkatha Philosophy: Made up almost exclusively of Zulu tribesmen. Its leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has long opposed economic sanctions against South Africa and has been Called a sellout by rival black leaders. Membership: Claims up to 1.5 million. Philosophy: South Africa's largest labor fed- eration. Has organized workers in the food, construction, chemical, domestic service, metal, transport and mining sectors. Originally focused on labor concerns, but has since taken a more political role and pursued a so- cialist ideology. Membership: Estimated at 650,000 to 700,000. South African Youth Congress Philosophy: Closely aligned with the ANC, but has taken more militant positions on anti- apartheid issues. Membership: Claims at least 250,000 members and support from at least 2 million black South Africans. Compiled by Steve Harvey Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 17, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "White House studies easing sanctions Sununu predicts | ‘evolution’ in policy By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON — Signs are appearing that the White House is considering dropping some U.S. sanctions against South Af- rica, a change that black nation- alist leader Nelson Mandela will be trying to block on the coast-to- coast visit he begins this week. The White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, when asked recently whether reforms begun by South Africa’s white government are sufficient to bring a moderating of U.S. poli- cy, confirmed that sanction revi- sions are in the works. Mr. Sununu said President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III will be re- viewing the issue, and that he ex- pects to see “an evolution” of policy in the next few weeks. Congressional staffers who helped draft the 1986 sanctions law said the Bush administration «has aired several possible changes. They include extending ‘landing rights in this country to *South African airplanes, which snow are prohibited from touch- fing down on U.S. soil, relaxing ‘the sanctions against agricultur- sal imports from South Africa and seven lifting the ban against new U. S. investment there. : _Mr. Mandela is expected to ~make his tour of the United “States a running argument against any such moves. And the ‘emotional tributes that will pour *out to him at mass rallies around -the country will be a powerful in- ‘fluence on political stands here, in an election year. “Once Mandela gets here and! addresses the joint session [of' Congress], has a chance to talk to congressional leaders and meets with the president, I think it would tend to give considerable pause at least in Congress,” said Francis Kornegay, who works for the House subcommittee on international development and trade. President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa has begun the proc- ess of reform, most notably by letting Mr. Mandela out of prison and by legalizing opposition groups. But most South African laws institutionalizing segrega- tion remain on the books, and Mr. de Klerk himself has not made a commitment to a one- Staff person, one-vote democracy. White House officials have expressed the view that Mr. de Klerk should get some reward for the steps he has taken toward reform, both to encourage him to continue and to give him ammu- nition to fight South Africans who are resisting change. The opposing view, espoused by Mr. Mandela, is that contin- ued sanctions are necessary to convince resistant whites that re- form is the only option open to them. The 1986 law allows the pres- ident to relax sanctions if certain conditions are met by the South African government. These in- clude releasing all political pris- oners, repealing the state of emergency, “unbanning” demo- cratic political organizations and entering good-faith negotiations with the black majority. “T think in terms of the law, the ability to remove sanctions is there,” Mr. Sununu said. But many members of Con- gress say those conditions are far from being met. They note that some, but not all, political pris- oners have been released, the state of emergency has. been re- pealed in only part of the coun- try, and only preliminary discus- sions have begun between the government and Mr. Mandela’s African National Congress. Even some State Department officials seem less inclined to modify American sanctions than Mr. Sununu indicated the White House may be. “Our policy remains the same,” said a State Department official who asked not to be iden- tified. Nor has most of the business community been lobbying for quick changes that would let American corporations begin new investment or trading ties with the South Africans. That is partly because a seg- ment of South Africa’s white pop- ulation is promising to fight changes granting power to the black majority. The prospect of dramatic political change or in- creased violence does not attract foreign investors. “I think American business is sort of in a pause mode — wait and see what shakes out,” said Whitney Shneidman with the In- vestor Responsibility Research Center in Washington. “For some businesses, political stabil- ity is a question. It’s not like they’re clamoring to get in.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 17, 1990 \f"

Africa sanctions without more progress, By Julia Malone and Joseph Albright Cox News Service WASHINGTON — President Bush won't consider easing U.S. sanctions until South Africa takes more steps to end apartheid and frees hundreds of political prison- ers, White House officials said Monday. The White House comments come just two days before anti- apartheid leader Nelson Mandela arrives in the United States to urge fast to the sanctions. Mandela, freed early this year af- ter more than 27 years in South African prisons, arrives in New York on Wednesday to begin a 12- day visit to the United States. He will meet with Bush at the White House on June 25. White House officials say Bush will reas- sure Mandela that the administra- tion intends to keep up pressure for South African reforms. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that “there are no plans” to lift American sanc- tions “at this time.” officials say Meanwhile, in Canada on Mon- day, Mandela urged the country that has championed economic sanctions against South Africa for nearly three decades, to “walk the last mile” with him in the struggle against apartheid. In a moving speech, Mandela spoke of black men and women who, during years of oppression, “met torture without flinching” and “met the hangman’s noose with songs of freedom.” He was assured by Canadian the Bush administration to hold national pressure on the white gov- ernment in Pretoria. While acknowledging that South African President Frederik de Klerk is “honestly committed” to a peaceful transformation to demo- cratic rule, Mandela said that South African police and white ex- tremist groups, backed by black vigilante groups who are “willing to serve their white paymasters,” con- tinue to kill and maim blacks to protect white minority rule. “The fact of the matter is, the apartheid system is still in place,” the 71-year-old leader of the Afri- can National Congress told a joint session of Parliament in Ottawa before flying to Toronto for a round of rallies and parades. Canada’s minister for external affairs, Joe Clark, assured Man- dela: “It would be wrong now to re- lax those pressures. We have stood with you in your own remarkable walk to freedom, and we intend to be with you along that walk until the people of South Africa are free.” At a news conference earlier in Ottawa, when asked whether he thought a democratically-elected government in South Africa could be negotiated as early as next year, Mandela said he was optimistic as long as economic sanctions were maintained. U.S. policy toward South Africa Austin American-Statesman - June 19, 1990 leaders they would not relax inter- has been highly contentious over the years, and an administration move to ease the sanctions at this time could provoke yet another clash, However, the administration seems unlikely to tamper with the sanctions for the moment. Most important in the eyes of the administration, explained one official, is the freeing of political prisoners. Although some have been released, an undetermined number remain in South Africa’s jails. Mandela said last week in Bonn, “As far as we are concerned, we have close to 1000 political prison- ers in the country. As far as the government is concerned, there are 577 prisoners.” Democrats on Capitol Hill, who generally are strong supporters of economic sanctions, believe the lib- eralizing measures thus far adopt- ed by de Klerk are cosmetic. They detect signs that some in the ad- ministration want to give a boost to de Klerk by scaling back sanctions. The administration said Mon- day its policy will be guided by the 1986 sanctions legislation passed by Congress: the president can con- sider lifting any of the sanctions if South Africa meets three of four conditions set by Congress. How- ever, there may be disagreement between the administration and Congress over precisely what South Africa must do to be in compliance. The conditions include: @ Repeal of the declaration of a state of emergency. De Klerk ended that status for most areas of the country as of June 8. The White House praised the move as a sign of “remarkable progress” in South Africa. However, harsh police rule continues in the province of Natal, where there has been wave of black-on-black violence. @ Lifting the ban on political or- ganizations and political activities. De Klerk has made progress in this area and legalized the once-banned group that Mandela helps lead, the African National Congress. @ Repealing the basic laws of apartheid, which forbid non-whites to live in white areas and which re- quire non-whites to carry internal Passports. @ Agree to enter into negotia- tions with representatives of the black majority with no “pre- conditions.” Mandela’s visit is part of a six- week tour of 14 nations in Africa, Europe and North America that began June 6. His eight-city U.S. visit begins Wednesday, when he flies to New York to address the United Nations. This article was supplemented with re- ports from the Washington Post and the Associated Press.

        "ocr_text": "Mandela calls on Bush, all Americans keep up pressure on South Africa The Associated Press African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and his wife, Winnie, raise their fists during welcoming ceremonies today in New York. “We can see light at end of tunnel’ Sanctions needed, he tells NYC crowd By Joseph Albright and Cynthia Durcanin Staff writers NEW YORK — With quiet passion, Nelson Mandela called on all Americans, from President Bush to the ‘‘masses,” to contin- ue economic pressure on South Africa now that there are signs of political change in that apartheid nation. “We can see light at the end of the tunnel,” Mr. Mandela said in a 10-minute extemporaneous speech at John F. Kennedy Inter- national Airport. ‘““We are there- fore appealing to you in all hu- mility and all sincerity that you must join us in the internal action we are taking to force the gov- ernment to abandon apartheid. “The only way to walk togeth- er on this difficult road is for you to ensure sanctions,” he said. The African National Con- gress (ANC) leader, who was freed Feb. 11 after serving 27 years in prison, said he will use his nine-day visit to the United States “‘for the purpose of thank- ing you for the support you have given us” in winning his release and prompting South African President Frederik W. de Klerk to initiate reforms. Mr. Mandela said he looks forward to his meeting Monday with Mr. Bush “to brief him on the latest political develop- ments” in South Africa. As Mr. Mandela ended his re- marks, ‘‘New_ York, New York” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 20, 1990 >  Mandela: was played in the background. Mr. Mandela and his wife, Winnie, flew to New York from Canada about two hours behind schedule. The couple emerged from a Canadian military jet wearing scarves with the ANC’s black, yellow and green colors. New York Mayor David Din- kins, the first black to hold that office, welcomed Mr. Mandela and introduced him to other dig- nitaries, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, entertainer Harry Bela- fonte and U.S. Rep. Charles Ran- gel (D-N.Y.). Mr. Cuomo called Mr. Man- dela “a new symbol of courage, a new symbol of valor, a new sym- bol of hope.” As the ANC leader worked the crowd, the ANC’s anthem, “God Bless Africa,” was played in the background. Later, the Boys Choir of Harlem sang the anthem in the African tribal lan- guage of Xhosa while Mr. Man- dela and his wife clenched their fists in a “power to the people” salute. The delayed arrival caused him to cancel plans to address thousands of black youngsters at a high school in Brooklyn’s tough Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbor- hood. Only one day earlier, tour organizers had spoken glowingly about the Brooklyn rally as a chance for Mr. Mandela to show teenagers in a drug- and crime- ridden neighborhood ‘what the struggle is really about.” It was the second time in re- cent days that Mr. Mandela had begged off a planned appear- ance, citing fatigue. Mrs. Man- dela filled in for him before a Ca- nadian audience a few days ago. When Mr. Mandela was tour- ing in Europe, he also worried his entourage by canceling one appearance in Geneva and cut- ting short another speech, turn- ing over the podium to a sur- prised assistant. But after a night’s sleep, he bounced back and looked rested and vital when he moved on to West Germany and France. Typically, his day began with a breakfast meeting at 7 and continued through 10 working sessions until after dinner. New York organizers, trying to satisfy thousands of insistent demands for a spot on Mr. Man- dela’s schedule, have planned three days of similar dawn-to- dark appearances. It was unclear whether other parts of the sched- ule might be scrapped. “We're playing it by ear,” said Sylvia Hill, associate coordi- nator of Mr. Mandela’s national welcoming committee. “It. de- pends on how he feels.” Mr. Mandela, who will be 72 next month, is in the 17th day of his 45-day tour of 14 nations in Africa, Europe and North Ameri- ca. He left South Africa on June 4 — one day after he was dis- charged from a Johannesburg clinic after surgery to remove a cyst from his bladder. As Mr. Mandela was prepar- ing for the journey, his personal physician, urologist Dr. Gus Ge- celter, called Mr. Mandela ‘a very fit young man for his age” and said his recent surgery should not cause problems dur- ing the journey. Dr. .Gecelter said that he cut out an “inflammatory cyst” from the right side of Mr. Mandela’s bladder and that sub- sequent laboratory tests showed the cyst was non-cancerous. ‘He has had no problems be- fore or after the operation,” Dr. Gecelter said. ‘He is a very stoic and good patient. He has a very high pain threshold.” Mr. Mandela’s visit comes as the city is exploding with racial tension. New York’s “gorgeous mosaic,” as Mayor Dinkins likes to call it, is crumbling in the wake of racial murder trials over violence in Howard Beach and Bensonhurst, the rape of a Cen- tral Park jogger, and an ongoing boycott of Korean grocers. In Flatbush, where kosher pizzerias and Dominican dress shops are part of the commercial melting pot along bustling Church Avenue, a 6-month-old boycott of two Korean grocers has brought to the surface the ugly complexities of New York’s racial politics. A confrontation between a Korean store owner and a Hai- tian customer launched the boy- cott, which has captured national attention and, since January, has forced the city to put a police of- ficer at the store and erect barri- cades to keep pickets at a distance. i Pauline, a Jamaican native who works at a nearby bakery, hopes Mr. Mandela’s visit will act as a catalyst to end the fight- ing and anger on the streets. “What’s happening here is really sickening,” she said. “I hope he will bring people togeth- er here, even if it’s for one day. We can’t have this hatred every day.” Bong Jaejang, a grocery store owner, doesn’t understand why his store is being targeted. ‘“‘We want to talk,” he said, “but they won’t come.” Mr. Bong pointed to a “peace bench” donated by a Hispanic man that is inscribed, ‘“‘Love thy neighbor Let’s be friends again.” Mr. Bong keeps the park bench inside because he is afraid pro- testers might destroy it. “Racism in New York is South Africa’s apartheid,” yelled picket Norman Reide. New York organizers, trying to satisfy thousands of demands, have planned three days of dawn-to-dark appearances for Mr. Mandela. It was unclear whether other parts of the schedule might be scrapped. “We're playing it by ear. It depends on how he feels,” said Sylvia Hill, associate coordinator of the national welcoming committee. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 20, 1990 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Crowds put strain on security By Marcia Kunstel Joumal-Constitution correspondent WASHINGTON — Keeping Nelson Mandela safe is one of the largest, most complicated tasks ever assigned the diplomatic se- curity corps. ““Any time you have these in- credibly large crowds gathering im one area to see one person, sure, that causes security con- cerns,’”’ said Andy Laine, spokes- man for the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Multiply the crowds by eight cities, divide the organizing re- sponsibility by nine groups, and toss in tenuous racial relations in many parts of the country, and the result is one tough job. It is not the kind of detail that diplomatic guards face every day. They normally supply secu- rity for heads of state or other foreign visitors who generate much less emotional steam. Heavyweight visitors, such as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor- bachev, are guarded in this coun- try by the Secret Service, which is accustomed to providing tight security for U.S. presidents. Perhaps the visitors most comparable to Mr. Mandela are the British royals, princes and spouses guarded by the State De- Partment as they move near crowds of well-wishers. But even the trips by Prince Charles and Princess Diana, for example, were limited to two or three cities and required fewer logistics, Mr. Laine said. — Mr. Mandela’s visit ‘‘is the largest protective detail that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has ever undertaken,’’ he said. **It’s largest as far as manpower. It may even be the largest as far as number of cities in one partic- ular visit of a foreign dignitary.’’ Even today, there is no pre- cise time for when Mandela will depart from Boston, or when he will arrive in Washington.

        "ocr_text": "SAL tailure not political, panel told By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Several peo- ple involved in the billion-dollar collapse of Silverado Banking testi- fied Tuesday that politics did not figure in the S&L’s failure, while a congressman called on the govern-: ment to make public its findings on the role of President Bush’s son Neil as a director of the institution. Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-IIl., said the Office of Thrift Supervi- sion should “lift the veil of secrecy which shrouds this matter” and tell whether it has brought charges against Bush related to his business deals while a Silverado director. “Are the taxpayers going to have to pick up a $1 billion tab without ever knowing whether Neil Bush was right or wrong?” asked Annunzio, a senior member of the House Banking Committee, which heard a third day of testimony Tuesday on Silverado’s demise. Among witnesses was Kermit Mowbray, former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Tope- ka, Kan. Mowbray overrode a staff recommendation to crack down on Silverado in 1987, then asked the Colorado banking commissioner to delay closing down the Denver- based S&L until after the 1988 election. The request to postpone action against Silverado came from Washington, Mowbray said. He insisted under questioning that he was neither subjected to political pressures in dealing with Silverado nor influenced by the presence on Silverado’s board of directors of Neil Bush, whose fa- ther was then vice president and the Republican candidate for presi- dent Annunzio presented a document he said was obtained from the Of- fice of Thrift Supervision, which outlines a string of charges against Neil Bush and three other former officers or directors of Silverado. A committee staff member said the document was a draft paper that the Office of Thrift Supervi- sion sent in response to a commit: tee request for information involy- ing the S&L's directors and their roles in the failure. The document said Bush “vio- lated his fiduciary duty to Silver- ado Banking and obtained personal benefit” by approving loans to busi- ness associates and by failing to disclose his business relations with a firm that received a $900,000 line of credit from Silverado. Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., de- fended Bush, who has denied any wrongdoing, and suggested the president's son is “paying a penalty because of who he is.” The Office of Thrift Supervision has asked Bush to consent to a cease and desist order, in which he would promise not to repeat pro- hibited acts, but Bush has refused. “All the other directors agreed to prohibition orders because they were guilty,” Parris said. Parris also questioned the na- ture of the document itself, which is neither signed nor dated. President Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked wheth- er Neil Bush was involved in finan- cial wrongdoing. “No,” Fitzwater said. The spokesman also launched a political counterattack on the sav- ings and loan issue by serving no- tice that Republicans would not accept all the blame for the deba- e, The Democrats have ‘a big role” too, Fitawater charged, citing actions taken by the Democratical- ly controlled Congress that gener- ally are considered to have contrib- uted to the S&L crisis. Also testifying Tuesday was Kenneth Good, an investor and ulti- mately controlling partner in Bush’s oil company, JNB Explora- tion. Good obtained more than $30 million in loans from Silverado, none of which he paid back. Especially interesting to com- mittee members was Good’s $100,000 “loan” to Neil Bush, which Bush never paid back. Good said he never expected it to be repaid unless a venture in which the “loan” was “invested” turned profitable. Such “loans” were his “modus operandi,” said Good, explaining he took similar actions on behalf of about eight other people who were employees or business associates. Good said he never got any financial benefit from his associa- tion with Bush, since JNB Explora- tion did not make money. Under questioning, Good said he did not expect his “loan” to result in making Bush “loyal” to Good as Bush carried out his duties as a director of Silverado. Palm Beach Post - June 20, 1990 \f"

Activist fights exhaustion for his grueling U.S. tour By Joseph Albright and Cynthia Durcanin Staff writers NEW YORK — Looking tired and travel-worn, Nelson Man- dela rode Wednesday through tons of falling ticker tape in Man- hattan’s canyons of wealth, only minutes after black youths in Brooklyn beat out an ecstatic greeting on his passing car. Zwelakhe Sisulu, Mr. Mande- la’s press secretary, said, ‘“He’s actually stunned by what hap- pened today... At one point, the enthusiasm was quite frighten- ing.

Everyone in sight — fron street sweepers to a phalanx o dignitaries, including the pas four mayors of New York — fel over one another to praise the 71 year-old African National Con gress leader. But with fatigue clearly bear ing down on him, it remained t: be seen whether Mr. Mandel. would carry through with the 16 hour schedule. He began his six week tour of 14 nations June 6, . day after being released from . Johannesburg hospital after sur gery to remove a cyst from hi bladder. Late Wednesday, ANC offi cials were discussing whethe the schedule should be pared But Mr. Sisulu later said the ma jor events will go on a scheduled. “He’s tired.

Ahead of him lies another critical day Friday, when he leaves Gracie Mansion at 7:35 a.m. for a day of trying to be “on” for nine more sessions — with U.S. business executives, foreign policy experts, United Nations delegates and potential donors to the ANC, Mr. Mandela on Wednesday stirred the crowd in front of New York’s City Hall by holding forth a vision of a time when South Af- rica’s largest city, Johannesburg, would be a “liberated city.” © “Apartheid is doomed,” the old gladiator said. ‘South Africa shall be free.” Behind him was the stone- columned City Hall, which bears some architectural resemblance to the Cape Town City Hall, where Mr. Mandela on Feb. 11 gave his first speech in freedom after more than 27 years in prison, It was a less fiery, wearier- looking Mr. Mandela who spoke to a few thousand chosen New Yorkers who had tht political connections to latch onto one of the most coveted invitations in the city's history. Mr. Mandela brought tears to the eyes of some when he in- voked a vision of a future South Africa that would be able to ap- ply the words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. ~ Mrs, Mandela provided the’ most searing oratory when she asked all Americans to join South Africans “to launch the last on- slaught on the racist Pretoria re- gime. ” Then, she said, South Af- ricans could unite to “hoist the flag of the African National Con- gress as the new flag of South Af rica.” Mr. Mandela had just become the second foreigner in history to be lionized by a ticker-tape pa- rade up Lower Broadway, the route that has heaped fluttering confetti on heroes from aviator Charles Lindbergh after his solo 1927 crossing of the Atlantic to astronaut John Glenn after his first trip into orbit in 1962. The only other foreigner to be honored along what New York publicists call the “Canyon of Heroes” was Pope John Paul II, ne had a ticker-tape welcome New York police officials said Mr. Mandela’s visit was a first in another respect: It drew more live TV coverage than any previ- ous occasion in New York histo- ry. “We have at least seven satel- lites for transmitting and at least 25 live TV trucks floating around here somewhere,” a police lieu- tenant said. For thousands of veterans of New York’s own race turmoil, the chance to see Mr. Mandela was worth braving the traffic gridlock that afflicted much of Manhattan as the evening rush hour approached. “We have no giants in the world anymore,” said Professor Marc Crawford, 60, who teaches creative writing to New York University freshmen. “Mandela is that for all the world.” High above Broadway, inside’ the offices of the New York Housing Authority, all business came to a halt when Mr. Mande- la’s motorcade passed by. “This: is it! This is it!” shouted one. woman. It was not, however, a day in. which cynicism vanished from: this hard-boiled metropolis.

        "ocr_text": "No PLO talks “opens door’ to war, activists say By MARCIA KUNSTEL Paim Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Two leading peace activists, one Israeli and the other Palestinian, Wednesday de- nounced President Bush's suspension of talks with the Palestine Liberation Or- ganization and warned the move may “open the door” to another Middle East war. Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestin- jan nationalist from Jerusalem, called this a “sad day” and said in a speech here that cutting the dialogue “can open the way to another war. ... No one can bear it. No one can win it. Everyone will come out the loser.” Israeli journalist Yael Dayan re- flected the same tensions building in the Middle East, especially since the hard- line government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took office this month. “Whoever is not openly supporting the peace process takes the blame for the next war. And it will be a war like none other we have known,” said Dayan, the daughter of the late Israeli leader Moshe Dayan. When Bush announced the suspen- sion in Huntsville, Ala., he indicated the 18-month-old talks could be resumed if PLO leader Yasser Arafat made a clear condemnation of a May 30 guerrilla attack on an Israeli beach and if he expelled from the PLO the Palestinian faction that staged it, In Israel, whose government had pushed strongly for an end to the USS. dialogue with the PLO, Bush's move was not unexpected. Diplomats in Tel Aviv said they believed that by breaking off the talks voluntarily, Bush may have avoided congressional action on a law which would have restricted the presi- dent's ability to later resume the talks. The suspension of talks was not expected to be welcomed by most US, allies, and was seen as a blow to Egypt, which has been trying to help the \"Jnited States bring about a dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis. Some initial reactions from Con- gress were positive. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who recently has criticized Israel's fail- ure to cooperate in the peace process, said Bush made the right decision. He said he hoped the PLO would move quickly to fulfill the President's condi- tions “'so that real dialogue can begin.” Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who earli- er this year co-sponsored a law requir- ing the president to report on the PLO’s compliance with its pledge to renounce terrorism, hailed Bush's decision. “The president did the right thing: for the fight against terrorism, for U.S. interests, for the freedom and security of our ally Israel and for the search for peace in the Middle East,” Mack said. “The PLO has proven once again that it is a terrorist organization, pure and simple. The United States trusted the PLO's promise to break with terror- ism. That trust was flagrantly be- trayed,” he said. Husseini and Dayan are on a US. speaking tour sponsored by Americans for Peace Now. They appeared at a luncheon in Washington as reports cir- culated that Bush was about to suspend the PLO talks. Dayan condemned the administra- tion's move, saying suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue suspended “the only thin thread of a possibility” of beginning peace talks. “If anybody thinks realistically that it is possible to first combat terror, and when this is done then begin a peace process, this is an idiocy,” added Dayan, a leading Israeli Labor Party member. Shimon Peres, the embattled Labor Party leader who is also touring the US., said, “I congratulate the president on the steps he has decided to take.” The suspension of the U.S.-PLO dia- logue was the latest blow to prospects for a peace settlement. It followed the swearing in of the hard-line Shamir government and the refusal of Palestin- ians to continue their informal dialogue with U.S. envoys inside the territories occupied by Israel. Husseini said the only possible step he sees would be for the United States to use this tough move against the PLO to justify a similarly tough move, such as reduction of funding, against Israel. a Mideast correspondent Louis J, Salome contributed to this report.

        "ocr_text": "Mandela easing U.S. firms’ fears Business leaders more confident about post-apartheid S. Africa By Alma E. Hill and Joseph Albright Staff writers NEW YORK — The reactions of U.S. bankers and business leaders to Nelson Mandela’s message that post-apartheid South Africa will have a “mixed economy” mirrored the enthusiasm the black activist has received since setting foot on American soil. _ “It will be critical that the economy grows rap- - idly and at rates that supersede population growth. This cannot happen without large inflows of for- eign capital, including U.S. capital,” Mr. Mandela told the business leaders at a breakfast at the » World Trade Center. “He got standing ovations when he came in, when he left and a number of ovations during his speech,” said Marvin Traub, chairman and chief executive officer of Bloomingdale’s department stores. “I left the meeting with a greater respect for Mr. Mandela.” Some members of New York’s business elite ‘ even lined up for Mr. Mandela’s autograph. “You have some pretty big egos in a room like * that. Not his, ours,” said Don Anderson, publisher’ of Emerge Magazine. / “But there were people seeking autographs,” Mr. Anderson said. ‘‘There were people who, as he - was leaving the room, wanted to make sure they touched him. That was not a black or white re- sponse; everyone was touched by him and humbled . by his presence.” When asked whether companies that divested from South Africa would be treated any differently by a post-apartheid government than corporations that did not divest, Mr. Mandela reportedly replied “ves” but did not elaborate. “The noise level moved up a decibel” when Mr. Mandela made that comment, Mr. Anderson said. A spokesman for Union Carbide, which still has holdings in the country, said his firm is not worried. “We're confident that we'll be viewed favorably in a post-apartheid society because all our income dividends there go to black education, black busi- ness development and black legal aid in South Afri- ca,” said O. Jules Romary, vice president for public affairs and investor relations. Rather than divest, Union Carbide created a trust fund in 1987 to build black leadership. Mr. Romary said in a prepared statement that the cor- poration wants to learn more about a development bank proposed by Peter Goldmark of the Rockefel- ler Foundation before endorsing it. Mr. Mandela called Mr. Goldmark’s idea “very constructive” and repeated that his African Na- tional Congress has no fixed idea about the mixture of capitalist and socialist elements in a new South Africa. “We are sensitive,” he said, “to the fact that as investors in a post-apartheid South Africa, you will need to be confident about the security of your in- vestments, an, adequate and equitable return on your capital, and a general climate of peace and stability. “That is why we share the common objectives of the total abolition of the apartheid system and the institution of a genuinely democratic system in an open society.” Carl Eifler, managing director of First Boston Corp., said, “Many of us want to step in and help. It’s up to the ANC when we'll do that.” Mr. Mandela’s appeal for U.S. investment re- flected a gradual but far-reaching change in ANC thinking, which in the 1950s looked forward to eco- nomic improvements through widescale national- ization. One of the influences on ANC thinking ap- parently has been the collapse of Communist econ- omies in Eastern Europe. In 1958, before Mr. Mandela was sent to prison, he published an article in the South African left- wing magazine Liberation in which he warned of the risks of “American imperialism” in Africa. When asked about the evolution of his thinking, Mr. Mandela said Friday that he had formed an “impression” that U.S. policy no longer is aimed at establishing imperialist advantages. The list of business people included executives Knight-Ridder Tribune News For many at the United Nations, Nelson Mandela's freedom culminated years of work on his behalf. from General Electric, Cal Tex Petroleum, Citi- corp, Manufacturers Hanover, Colgate-Palmolive, American Express, Pfizer, Xerox, J.P.

By MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Under increasing criticism that his Justice Department is foot-dragging in savings and loan fraud pros- ecutions, President Bush announced an ag- gressive new effort Friday to crack down on S&L crimes. “Tt takes a snake, a coldblooded snake, to betray the trust and innocence of hard-work- ing people,” Bush said in a speech to his administration's U.S. attorneys. “And so, if we have to look under rocks to find these white-collar criminals, then we will leave no stone unturned,” The president will ask Congress to dou- ble the $50-million being spent this year on prosecutions, He also is pushing legislation to increase penalties for financial institution fraud, to make it easier to catch the crooks, and to make it harder for them to shelter ill-gotten gains from confiscation, On Capitol Hill, Democrats lashed out at the president's initiative as inadequate. “It’s too little and woefully late,” said President Rep.

        "ocr_text": "Former campaign whizzes translate ANC plans into media pizazz NEW YORK — The words fly with an easy familiarity. There’s the “triple ad- vance,” “the mult-box” and the all-im- portant “‘feed.”’ For veterans of presi- dential campaigns, there’s no need to ex- plain. But to members of the African Na- tional Congress hearing the words for the first time in a smoky, cramped hotel room, the sounds are strange. Nelson Mandela’s visit to the United States has brought together a curious mixture of Georgetown and Cape Town. Veterans of presidential campaigns for Walter F. Mondale, Michael S. Dukakis and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson have teamed with the ANC to help organize Mr. Mandela’s eight-city tour. There are more than geographic and cultural differences at work here. The ANC, banned for 30 years as a revolu- tion committees in each city. “Tt will be a good experience for the ANC,” he said. “‘They’re going to have to start doing more of this as they come into power.” But ex-Mondale workers? The for- ‘mer vice president was trounced by Ronald Reagan. What can they teach others? “We may have lost 49 states, but we were organized,” Mr. Beckel said. The team’s track record was of no concern to Chris Dlamini, an ANC mem- ber and vice president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions. “If some- body did not win, it’s an issue that be- longs to that country,” he said. Mr. Dlamini is Mr. Mandela’s labor liaison for the U.S. trip, a position that will be particularly important when the delegation visits Detroit and Miami. While in New York, Mr. Dlamini found the advance team extremely help- ful. “Our people have worked with the MANDELA’S VISIT TO AMERICA tionary organization, never has encoun- tered such electronic technology, let alone had to handle the media onslaught that goes with visiting dignitaries. As an underground organization, its members risked being jailed for print- ing pamphlets. Now they must produce oe releases and talk logistics with the media. Mr. Mandela arrived in the United States on Wednesday with a “kitchen Cabinet” that runs the gamut from a nun to several former exiles. It does not in- clude editors or television producers. Complicating the situation, several delegates dropped off after the Europe- an leg of his 14-nation tour, leaving him with a fresh team of advisers. But it cost media to some extent, but obviously there are things that are new to us. There are phrases and expressions that we have never heard in our country.” For instance, the expression “touch base”’ initially threw Mr. Dlamini off. And the amount of discussion devoted to even the smallest details is another as- pect of the American way Mr. Dlamini found amusing. “Everything is taken very serious- ly,” he said, “right down to shaking hands.” Among those managing the chaos is Nell Merlino, whose last major project was. coordinating the nation’s largest demonstration ever by homeless activ- ists in Washington. “Nell Merlino can take a disastrous schedule that’s way behind and disorga- nized and make it look like it was the best-planned series of events,” said Mr. Beckel, who worked with Ms. Merlino during the Mondale campaign. him the logistical experience gained in Europe. The veterans of U.S. political cam- paigns came to the ANC’s aid when it be- came clear Mr. Mandela’s whirlwind tour had taken on the monstrous propor- tions of a presidential campaign. “T think it’s a marriage of necessity,” said Bob Beckel, Mr. Mondale’s 1984 campaign manager. “It’s bigger than a presidential cam- paign, and it should be treated that way. Neither Bush, Reagan nor Mondale could ever draw these kind of crowds.” Although Mr. Beckel is not involved, several of his former staffers, most of them volunteers, are part of the advance team working with the ANC and recep- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 24, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Mandela’s oratory compels world to listen By Joseph Albright Cox News Service NEW YORK — The Harlem dusk was angling its last rays into Nelson Mandela’s eyes as he slowly lifted himself to speak about global racism. For 13 hours he had been on the move from one audience to an- _other in white New York. Now he had motorcaded uptown to Africa Square, the street corner Harlem calls the center of black America. It is where Martin Luther King Jr. and Adam Clayton Powell boule- vards meet. Early in this century, Marcus Garvey stood on a ladder on this corner to shout his liberation mes- sage. Paul Robeson, Malcolm X and Powell talked to their genera- tions here. Now it was the 71-year-old Mandela’s turn. He rose slowly, and for the first time on American shores, he let his words soar beyond the apartheid in his country to the global pheno- menon of racism. “As we head into the last decade of the 20th century,” Mandela said, “it is intolerable and insuffer- able that the cancer of racism is Analysis ‘ still eating away at the fabric of so- ciety in every part of our planet. “It remains one of the most im- portant global issues confronting all humanity, black and white. It is a struggle that involves all people of all walks of life.” Probably not since Winston Churchill rose from the political boneyard 50 years ago to lead war- time Britain has any English- speaking leader burst forth in the commanding manner displayed by Mandela since his Feb. 11 release from jail after 27 years. Now, from ghetto street corners to the World Trade Center, from church pulpit to TV’s Koppel Re- port, Mandela showed the United States how silky-elegant words can hit like sledgehammers. He is a rare politician who swings hard and with precise aim. His words in Bonn and Strasbourg and New York all have sounded as though he calibrated and cross-ex- amined them long before they flowed from his lips. Mandela obviously knew he would be hammered by U.S. jour- wy nalists about the support he and the African National Congress had accepted from Cuba’s Fidel Castro, Libya’s Col. Moammar Gadhafi and PLO leader Yasser Arafat. When the Arafat-Gadhafi ques- tion arose, Mandela showed how he differs from many American politicians. Rather than a vague non-an- swer, Mandela grasped the ques- tion by the throat and pounded it to the floor with a bluntness that left people gasping. “Yasser Arafat, Colonel Gad- hafi, Fidel Castro support -our struggle to the hilt,” Mandela told ABC’s Ted Koppel. ‘“‘There is no reason whatsoever why we should have any hesitation about hailing their commitment to human rights. ... Our attitude is based solely on the fact that they fully support the anti-apartheid struggle.” But Mandela’s verbal eloquence can take him only so far. He faces what amounts to a vote of confidence when the ANC meets in December for its first national congress in 30 years inside South Africa. If, by then, Mandela hasn’t shown tangible gains in his talks with President Frederik de Klerk, the ANC’s power could flow to younger men who all along have mistrusted the negotiations with the de Klerk government. His stature within South Africa will not be determined by the ex- traordinary count of live American TV crews that turn out to record his every utterance in this country. Tt will be affected more by the amount of money he brings back and by whether he succeeds in his campaign for continued sanctions. Perhaps the most important test of how the trip is going will come Monday in Dublin, Ireland. That is where British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is due to ask her fellow European leaders to loosen sanctions against South Africa to send a “positive” signal to de Klerk. If the 11 other Europeans agree to ease the economic pressure, Mandela’s eloquence will sound hollower when he gets back. to South Africa. The same would be true if Washington decided to lift sanctions over the ANC’s objections. _, Austin American-Statesman - June 24, 1990 Nelson Mandela and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis visit during a luncheon at the John F.

Mandela and his entourage arrived at Logan Inter- national Airport from New York shortly before 11 a.m. to the chants and screams of supporters. Mandela praised Boston for its role in the Ameri- can Revolution and its leadership in the anti-apartheid movement. “It was here that the Boston Tea Party served notice that the citizens of this country would not live under domination by the British,” Mandela said. “That was the establishment of a fundamental principle which has inspired democracies and democrats, free- dom fighters, revolutionaries all over the world.” At a luncheon at the John F. Kennedy Library, Mandela was presented with a bust of the late presi- dent by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. Flanked by Kennedy family members, Mandela praised the efforts of the senator for pushing for sanctions against South Africa, but made no mention of the disclosure that Mandela was arrested in 1962 through a CIA tip during Kennedy’s presidency.

His energy apparently returned later in the day when he plunged into back-to-back meetings with African exiles, representatives of U.S. black-owned publica- tions, and African diplomats. Hours after he asked for stepped-up sanctions, Mr. Man- dela, deputy president of the Af- rican National Congress, deliv- ered a stinging critique of a key element of U.S. policy toward southern Africa: covert support for Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. Noting before black journal- ists that the United States and South Africa are the main sup- porters of Mr. Savimbi, Mr. Man- dela said, “We strongly condemn that” on grounds that Mr. Sa- vimbi is trying to topple a legiti- mate African government. “Other countries should re- spect the political sovereignty and the territorial integrity of. Angola, and no assistance should be rendered to Savimbi,” he said. The lobbying group TransA- frica, helping to organize the Mandela visit, has charged that the Bush administration is fun- neling $80 million a year in aid to Mr. Savimbi, who received a friendly reception from the ad- eee n Washington last Mr. Mandela’s blunt remarks on Angola, delivered on the eve .

Notably absent from the National Airport welcoming committee was Washington’s most prominent local politician, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., whose drug trial resumes today. Instead, the mayor’s wife, Effi, represented the city. Mrs. Barry said the question of wheth- er her husband will meet Mr. Mandela during the Washington visit is “still under negotiation.” But David Fenton, an orga- nizer of the Mandela tour, said Mr. Barry had written a letter to the national Mandela Welcome Committee declining an invita- tion to greet Mr. Mandela. Mr. Mandela is due at the White House this morning to spell out his case for economic pressure on South Africa during 242 hours of meetings with Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III. After the ses- sion, Mr. Mandela is expected to speak to the White House press, but Mr. Bush has no plans to ' make a statement. Sketching out his goals for his three-day Washington visit, Mr. Mandela said, “I have come here to put the message that sanctions must be intensified and, of course, to ask for resources so that we would be able to attack the problems which are facing our country today. We have no doubt that the people of the Unit. ed States will give us that support.” ‘At a media briefing Friday, Assistant Secretary of State Her- man J.

Mr. Mandela did not linger at the small airport reception, nor did he respond to questions about his health, He became more animated when asked about his upcoming meeting with Mr. Bush and his call for contin- ued sanctions.

Page D2 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 26, Bush challenges §. African visitor to White House BLUNT TALK: President Bush’s remarks make it clear that Nelson Mandela can no longer expect unquestioning adulation. By Joseph Albright and Julia Malone Joural-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — President Bush delivered a face-to-face challenge Monday to Nelson Mandela to renounce “violence and armed struggle,” mark- ing the first time in the anti-apartheid activist’s tour that any ranking political leader has confront: ed him in public, In an extraordinary exchange, the world-fam- ous dissident stood on the South Lawn of the White House and coolly responded that Mr, Bush did not . fully understand the situation in South Africa. It was the most contentious public moment yet on a world tour in which Mr. Mandela has been treated as a superstar and showered with unal- loyed praise by the leaders of France, Germany and Canada, Several hours later, after private talks with Mr. Bush, Mr. Mandela said the two men “reached a broad agreement on almost all” of their dif- ferences, Nevertheless, Mr. Bush’s uncommonly direct remarks made it clear that Mr, Mandela, 71, no longer can expect to glide on a sea of pure, unques- tioning adulation. Mr, Mandela’s outspoken support for Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, Cuban President Fidel Castro and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has made many Americans re- alize Hah hei is not fie a graceful, grandfatherly oh hTe A few hours after meeting Mr. Bush, Mr. Man- dela’s motorcade passed 50 yards from about 30 anti-Mandela protesters outside the State Depart: ment, The protesters, assembled by'a conservative Washington research group, were white and in- cluded a South African. In Atlanta, meanwhile, the local chapter of the John Birch Society took out a full-page advertise- ment to criticize Mr. Mandela in advance of his red-carpet arrival Wednesday. Mr. Mandela will have his best chance to round out his views before a nationwide audi- ence at 11 a.m. today, when he addresses a joint session of the House and Senate. He is only the third private citizen ever accord- ed the honor. Polish labor leader Lech Walesa spoke there last year, and Marquis de Lafayette of France, who fought on the American side in the Revolution- ary War, addressed Congress in 1824. Mr. Bush invoked the words of Martin Luther King Jr. in ap- pealing for Mr. Mandela and his African National Congress to lay down arms in the struggle against apartheid. The president called on “all elements in South Africa society to renounce the use of violence in armed struggle, break free from the cycle of repression and vio- lent reaction that breeds nothing but more fear and suffering.” He then quoted the late Dr. King: “Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drink- ing from the cup of bitterness and hatred.” Mr. Mandela, standing erect with his hands serenely at his sides, responded, “‘The remarks that he has made here are due to the fact that he has not as yet got a proper briefing from us.” The ANC leader, released in February after 27 years of South African imprisonment, added that when a government bans op- posing groups and forbids free political activity, ‘then the peo- ple have no alternative but to re- sort to violence.” Cynthia Durcanin, Marcia Kunstel and Andrew Alexander contributed to this article. \f"

We gave them every detail, what ae would be wearing, the time of day, just where he would be. | ““They have picked him up. It — is one of our greatest coups.” With these crowing words, Paul Eckel, a senior CIA opera- éive in South Africa, bragged how the Central Intelligence on Aug. 5, 1962, had turned black ligerationist Nelson Mandela in to the most racially oppressive government since Nazi Germany, condemning him to spend more than a quarter of a century in prison. Eckel said this to a ranking U.S. official in South Africa the day after Mandela was arrested at a police roadblock outside Durbap. He was in a disguise and driving a car owned by a sympathetic white theatrical producer. The South African’ cops knew exactly what disguise Mandela would be wearing. They looked right through his facial camou- flage and said they knew he was Nedjson Mandela and they had a warrant for his arrest. Mandela had come out from hiding to go into Durban toa and cocky the night before he was put away for 27 years. _ “Nelson cut a large figure in khaki, his laugh booming and the familiar welcome as he em- braced each friend... . They laughed a lot, excited by their in- trigue. The police were looking for Nelson, and here they were partying with him, virtually un- der their noses.” Mandela did not know that the CIA, as part of its conti- nent-wide effort to shore up white capitalist regimes in Afri- ca, had set.up a covert operation in South Africa that by 1962 had placed a salaried deep-cover agent in the leadership ranks of - the African National Congress. ‘The black Deep Throat got word of Mandela’s plans to Eckel, who was operating under cover of the U.S. Embassy staff in Pretoria, and Eckel tipped the South Afri- can security apparatus. Rumors that the CIA had a hand in Mandela’s arrest have been circulating since the mid- 1980s, and grew more intense af- ter Mandela’s release from pris- on in February. Two weeks ago the Atlanta Journal-Constitu- tion printed a lengthy account of the CIA’s role in the sorry affair by two reporters, Joseph Al- bright and Marcia Kunstel, whose sources included the now-retired U.S. intelligence of- ficial whom CIA agent Eckel ‘boasted to about setting up Mandela and former South Afri- ca intelligence operatives they interviewed in Africa. Eckel, who later worked on the National Security Council staff in the Johnson administra- tion, died in 1986. The Journal- Constitution quoted his son, a Presbyterian clergyman in At- lanta, as confirming that his fa- ther was “related to the CIA” — but “could not talk about it and San Francisco Examiner - June 26, 1990 could not confide in anyone, at name, described the turning ove of Mandela to the South African authorities as “one of the most ‘easy. The CIA played a lot rougher with Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of the Congo (now Zaire), whose assas- sination the agency plotted in “1960. The CIA sent one of its mad scientists to the Congo with “lethal biological material” car- ried in a diplomatic pouch. When they couldn't inject Lu- mumba with the poison, the CIA settled for having him shot by Moise Tshombe, a Congo politi- cian who later distinguished himeelf by using an army of white mercenaries. Former CIA ‘African specialist John Stock- well told in his book “In Search of Enemies” how a CIA agent was driving around with Lu- mumba’s body in the trunk of his car “trying to decide what todo — with it.” Mandela must have had a funny feeling at the Kennedy Li- brary in Boston last weekend chatting with Sen. Teddy Ken- nedy, whose brothers were re- sponsible for him spending most of his adult life in jail. And he must have had an equally queasy feeling at the White House with George Bush, a former CIA di- rector who in 1976 continued CIA covert operations in Angola after Congress had cut them off. I wonder how he will feel visit- ing Oakland, the home of the Black Panthers. The FBI, through its notorious COINTEL program, was responsible for the murder of several Panther lead- ers in the ’60s and ’70s and for the imprisonment, on dubious charges, of many others. Some are still in prison. What the CIA did to the black liberation move- ment in Africa, the FBI did in the United States. Welcome to America, Mr. Mandela. \f"

They may end up battling the administration, but several members of Congress expressed optimism that Mr. Mandela’s session with President Bush on Monday and his strong speech to . ajoint session of Congress would have a powerful influence. “We would hope President Bush would join [Democrats] publicly in strong support for continued sanctions until such time as the people of South Afri- ca make a judgment themselves ... that sanctions are no longer necessary,” Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said at a news confer- ence shortly after Mr. Mandela’s speech. Mr. Mandela swept through the nation’s capital Tuesday, de- livering high rhetoric to a joint session of Congress, gratitude for years of support to the 24- member Congressional Black Caucus, and waves from his passing motorcade to citizens who gathered at a rally on Penn- sylvania Avenue. — | He brought Congress to its feet again and again as he out- lined a vision of a South Africa “where the black shall to the white be sister and brother, a fel- - low South African, an equal hu- man being, both citizens of the world.” | Cheering broke out in the packed House chamber as the 71-year-old deputy president of the African National Congress Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 27, 1990 ‘first to shake (ANC) spoke of being inspired during his more than 27 years of imprisonment by former presi- dents of the United States. “We could not have made an acquaintance through literature with human giants such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, and not been moved to act as they were moved to act. “John Brown, Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King Jr., and oth- ers — we could not have heard of these and not be moved to act as they were moved to act.” “‘We could not have read your Declaration of Independence without being moved to struggle for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” he said. Among those cheering were Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who shared his chair with his son, John-Miles, 14. Rep. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.) was one of the Mr. Mandela’s hand. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who opposes sanctions on South Africa, Rep. William Dannemey- er (R-Calif.), who said he object- ed to Mr. Mandela’s failure to _ rule out violence, and Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), who objects to Mr. Mandela’s political embrace of Libyan leader Moammar Gad- hafi, were among the few mem- bers of Congress who boycotted. Rep. Ronald Dellums (D- Calif.), who pushed the 1986 sanctions act through the House, said he will back off his effort to increase sanctions against the white minority regime of South Africa to give the nascent peace process there a chance to mature.

The Metro-Dade po- lice SWAT team was deployed on the tarmac with M-16 rifles at the ready as Mr. Mandela descended from the plane. In Atlanta, he made frequent references to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the native who made the city headquarters for the American civil rights movement. Drawing on Dr. King’s fam- ous “I Have a Dream” speech, delivered in 1963, Mr. Mandela declared, “Let freedom ring, Let us all acclaim now, ‘Let freedom ring in South Africa, Let freedom - ring wherever the people’s rights are trampled upon.’ ” But throughout the frenzied | visit, in which some appearances scheduled to last an hour or more _ became mere whistlestops, Mr. With his familiar salute, anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela greets a capacity crowd Wednesday at Georgia Johnny Crawtord/Statt Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium. He compared his strug- gle in South Africa to the U.S. civil rights movement. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 28, 1990 > \fMandela: Recalls ‘I Have a Dream’ > Continued from A1 Mandela refused to embrace Dr. King’s philosophy of non-violent protest. And one of Dr. King’s follow- ers defended Mr. Mandela’s dec- laration that violence might be necessary. “We reject the constant nag- ging that you have experienced about denouncing violence,” said the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, pres- ident of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King founded. “We who espouse non-vio- lence nevertheless ... respect the right of oppressed people to seek their liberation,” the Rev. Lowery said in a speech at Big Bethel AME Church. “Who are we to raise the question of vio- lence, we who paid the contras to shoot and slay innocent people in Central America?” Another civil rights veteran, the Rev. Hosea Williams, and four others were arrested out- side the stadium during a protest of the $5 ticket price charged to hear Mr. Mandela. “Let us see Mandela or lock us up,” demand- ed the Rev. Williams. Police locked them up. Four white supremacists, who showed up outside the stadi- um with an African National Congress flag they said they planned to burn, scrapped the idea after police threatened to arrest them. Mr. Mandela is dep- uty president of the ANC. “It’s OK to burn the Ameri- can flag, but not a Communist flag,” said one of the protesters, David W. Holland, former head of the Southern White Knights, a Ku Klux Klan faction. Rush-hour traffic was bump- er to bumper on the downtown Connector because of crowds pouring into the stadium for the rally. Traffic in the southbound lanes of I-75/85 was backed up to 14th Street. Police blocked off North Avenue between the Con- nector and Luckie Street. Mr. Mandela arrived more than an hour late at the stadium after deciding to visit Morehouse College, where he was honored by major black universities and colleges, At one point, the ANC organizers had decided Mr. Mandela would not make the stop. Mr. Mandela’s admirers didn’t seem to mind the twists and turns in his schedule. Those ‘who got to see him generally gushed with praise. Gwendolyn Boyd played hooky from her part-time job so she could attend the rally. “It’s like a spiritual enlightening,” she said. “Our parents experienced Martin Luther King. Our genera- tion is experiencing Nelson Mandela.” As if to show their solidarity with the ANC and the continent of Africa, Kinte cloth, an African fabric, was a popular accessory for dozens of people attending the stadium rally. The crowd was a sea of green and yellow, the ANC’s national colors. Volunteers from the Shrine of the Black Madonna in Atlanta passed out pizza-sized boxes to collect donations for the ANC. Collections filled a 50-gallon trash can. The money will be tak- en to Citizens Trust Bank, where SL omye. ues #8 ve iad it will be counted and given to |. ANC representatives. Although Coca-Cola was sold at the rally, Deborah Marshall and her family passed up the cool refreshment. “We refuse to buy Coke prod- RR ucts,” in protest of Coke’s pres- ence in South Africa, “so we came with our own snacks,” Ms. Marshall said. About 1,500 admirers hoping to get a close-up view of Mr. Mandela at Big Bethel earlier rushed the side doors of the | church, where his visit was de- layed two hours. An elderly woman in the crowd was pushed to the ground, and two other | women feined their collapses to get into the church. “I can’t even describe the | feeling,” said Wendy Truitt, who was at Big Bethel. “It’s tears and joy and excitement at the same time.” Mr. Mandela began his visit by going to the King Center and | laying a wreath at the tomb of Dr. King. He also met privately with Coretta Scott King, the civil rights leader’s widow. After the Georgia Tech rally, | the entourage left for Miami.

        "ocr_text": "Detroit schedule cut short to allow ANC leader to rest ‘Tam your flesh and blood,’ Mandela tells auto workers By Joseph Albright Staff writer DETROIT — Nelson Mandela arrived in friendlier territory Thursday after flying from Florida, where Cuban-American mayors snubbed the African National Congress leader because of his support for Cuban President Fidel Castro. Upon his arrival, tour organizers abbreviated his itinerary out of concern for the 71-year-old revolutionary’s health. Aboard the Mandela plane, press secretary Zwelakhe Sisulu said, “He is feeling all right, but we are finding, you know, that we have to control the schedule rather tightly because on the sched- ule you have an event that is set aside for 10 min- utes and, you know what happens, it takes two hours. It is very tiring for him.” _ Aides in the Mandela entourage said Detroit's schedule had to be shortened because Mr. Man- dela arrived two hours late in Miami as a result of his delay in Atlanta, where some scheduled ap- pearances were nearly reduced to cameos. Mr. Mandela was two hours late in address- ing a labor convention in Miami, and he did not arrive in Detroit until late afternoon, when he was due at Ford’s River Rouge Assembly Plant in Dearborn, Mich. Later, at the Dearborn plant, Mr. Mandela told cheering members of the United Auto Work- ers, “The man who stands before you is not a stranger. ... I am a member of the UAW; I am your flesh and blood. I am your comrade.” Thursday night, before 50,000 people at Tiger Stadium, Mr. Mandela borrowed from the lyrics of a Marvin Gaye song, saying, “Brother, broth- er, there’s far too many of you dying. Mother, mother, there’s too many of you crying.” Those words “are a reflection of the South Af- rican condition,” he said. Nelson Mandela thanks a government union group for its “warm reception” Thursday in Miami Beach, Fla. Mr. Mandela was to leave today ‘for the next stop on his tour, Los Angeles. He flew to Detroit in his chartered Trump 727 accompanied by two other planes, both from the federal government, filled with security agents, vehicles and equipment. As he stepped off the plane, Mr. Mandela shook hands with Gov. James J. Blanchard, May- or Coleman A. Young and UAW President Owen Bieber. The red carpet had returned, whereas in Mi- ami, because of Mr. Mandela’s remarks backing Mr. Castro, no city officials were at the airport Wednesday night.

Mr. Mandela left Atlanta late Wednesday. While in town, he visited the King Center, where he laid a wreath at the tomb of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., addressed a gathering of civil rights leaders at Big Bethel AME Church and, at More- house College, accepted 40 honorary degrees from historically black colleges and universities.

The action Common Cause cited as compelling evidence of influence-buy- ing was a 1987 vote in the House Bank- ing Committee on the bill to begin the S&L bailout. The original bill would have authorized the federal government to borrow $15 billion to shut down failing S&Ls before they lost even more money, but it required S&Ls to pay the interest on the borrowed funds. Under heavy lobbying by the indus- try, the committee reduced the amount to $5 billion, and the full House later concurred, In a compromise with the Senate, the figure later was pumped up to $10 billion, which still was far too little to staunch the tide of S&L failures, Latest top estimates put the bailout's eventual cost at $500 billion, Legislation regarding the S&L crisis has popped up in recent weeks as the issue gains political momentum, and on Thursday Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fia., in- troduced a bill that would require the president to report monthly on the sta- tus of the savings and loan bailout, in- cluding how much money had been Palm Beach Post spent, how many people had been indict- ed and convicted and how much money had been recovered from sales of assets, Other top donors and recipients list- ed by Common Cause for Florida: Florida: Sen.

Only hours after news agencies reported that he may shorten his tour by one day, Mandela said, “We are in the last leg of an ex- hausting but exhilarating tour,” and a spokesman said the trip wouldn’t be cut short. Mandela spoke with vigor while urging his audience to maintain U.S. sanctions against South Africa. “Our masses in action are like a raging torrent,” he said. “We are on freedom road, and nothing is going to stop us from reaching our destination.” The celebrities behind Mandela on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall included Muhammad Ali, Gregory Peck, Lou Gossett Jr., Sidney Poitier and Dionne Warwick. Interrupted frequently by chants of “Mandela! Mandela!” the African National Congress leader said, “Sisters and brothers, our country is on the brink of fun- damental change. Killing and tor- ture will never quell the flame of resistance burning in our hearts.” He said South African apart- heid, “this crime against human- ity,” would be transformed into “a harmonious oasis” in which all races and both sexes would coexist in a democratic and free society. “If we remain steadfast, deter- mined and united, as sure as night follows day, South Africa will be free,” Mandela said. Arriving an hour late, Mandela spoke for 10 minutes at City Hall after rushing downtown in a 24-car motorcade after a flight from De- troit. His day had begun 11 hours earlier with a walk through the de- serted streets of that Midwestern city. After the City Hall speech, he was to return to the hotel for pri- vate meetings and rest, followed by a $1,000- to $50,000-a-plate dinner attended by Hollywood luminaries and a late evening rally at the Los Nelson Mandela speaks Friday on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall.

The grueling schedule for Man- dela, 71, has raised frequent con- cerns about his health.

        "ocr_text": "Legend becomes flesh and blood in man of iron resolve Anti-apartheid leader’s visit grips American imagination By Steve Harvey and Marcia Kunstel Staff writers Through eight cities, Nelson Mandela has held center stage in urban America. From the moment he set foot on American soil June 20, his aims were winning continued U.S. sanctions against South Af- rica and raising money for his once-outlawed African National Congress. The legend that grew to almost mystical proportions through 27 years of imprison- ment finally become reality in America — in the form of a smil- ing, gray-haired man of uncom- promising resolve and unmistak- able dignity. From New York’s ticker-tape parade, through Atlanta to the star-studded welcome in Los An- geles, Mr. Mandela has been cheered and seen by tens of thou- sands, many eager to contribute money to his anti- -apartheid struggle. As the euphoria subsides, ob- servers can begin to assess the significance of Mr. Mandela’s visit, and how he might use what- ever momentum he gained here when the ANC begins negotia- tions with the South African gov- ernment later this year. There also is the question of what im- pact Mr. Mandela’s visit will have on Americans and whether it will resurrect the black activ- ism that has waned since the civil rights struggle was at its peak. Many are made uneasy While his frequently repeat- ed anti-apartheid message | brought cheers from audiences | and some politicians, the 71-— year-old ANC deputy president’s | refusal to renounce the use of vi- olence against the South African government made many uneasy. He tempered his often-stated: call for nationalization of South African industries and resources when he spoke with business leaders at a New York reception, telling them blacks and whites could live together in a “mixed economy” in which Western in- vestment would be secure. He repeated that message in Los An- geles. As he paraded through U.S. cities, the son of a tribal chief fired pride in black Americans to levels seldom seen since Martin Tuither Kino Jr. He raised emotions with his fiery rhetoric, raised spirits with his promise of hope and deliver- ance and raised some eyebrows with his list of friends. Everywhere he went, he! raised money for the ANC, which ' is close to reaching its $8 million! goal, according to tour spokes-; woman Christine Dolan. He! raised nearly $4 million in New| York and Los Angeles alone. Most of the money will go to: education, business, health and: resettlement projects in South Africa and to finance the cost of . the U.S. trip. No official cost esti- mates are available, but pub-) lished reports have put the price | at $300,000 to $400,000. Sanctions likely to stay In Washington, Mr. Mande- la’s regal sweep down the corri- dors of power seems to have en- sured, at least for the short term, that there will be no deviation from the U.S. policy of keeping sanctions on South Africa. But he was less successful in gaining full acceptance of the ANC as a pre-eminent organization capa-. ble of leading his country to de- mocracy. As the tour wound down at week’s end, Washington analysts and officials said they believed no movement to ease sanctions would be politically possible, soon, even if the legal and techni- cal conditions are met. “I think it [the visit] made it more difficult for anyone, in Con- gress or in the administration, to even think about lifting sanc- tions,” said Democratic Rep., John Lewis of Atlanta. “His pres- ence became a major plus for the whole movement to keep sanctions.” Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the House minority whip, said Mr. Mandela’s words may have hurt the ANC’s chances of being viewed by some in Washington as an organization capable of running a government. “I think he had the negative effect of reminding people with his references to violence that the African National Congress is not in the tradition of Martin Lu- ther King Jr.,” Mr. Gingrich said. “He made it less likely that the U.S. government will provide direct aid” to the ANC, Mr. Ging- rich said. An administration official said Mr. Mandela’s talks with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III provid- ed “a very good opportunity to hear his views on the developing negotiating process.” “On those terms, there was general agreement between us that apartheid must go and the negotiating process must be pur- sued,” he said. “Beyond that, I can’t say he changed anything.” The administration will take no action on sanctions without full consultation with Congress, the official said, quickly adding that some of Mr. Mandela’s blunt comments “raised eyebrows” among some members of Con- gress. Mr. Mandela again used his diplomatic skills the day after he met with President Bush when, in the wake of their heated ex- change over the use of violence, he said he saw the president as someone whom he would like to regard as part of the anti-apart- heid struggle. Pauline Baker, an analyst for the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, said she expects no sanc- tions to be lifted before the No- vember elections, because the administration seems to be di- vided on the issue. She also be- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 1,1990 > \fLegend becomes flesh and blood lieves some members of Con- gress will be reluctant to counter the swell of support that general- ly followed Mr. Mandela across the country. Continued U.S, sanctions probably will give Mr. Mandela ' added political clout once he be- gins negotiations with the South African government. As he heads to Great Britain, he will be trying to extract the same commitment from British ! Prime Minister “Margaret Thatcher, who appears eager to ease sanctions as a reward to President Frederik W. de Klerk for freeing Mr. Mandela and oth- er political prisoners and for his » partial lifting of the state of emergency, “Having the U.S, and Canada behind him will give him some political chips [and] strengthen his hand,” said Tobe Johnson, head of the political science de- partment at Atlanta’s Morehouse College, “It all depends on how he plays his hand.” Troublesome friends I the tour succeeded in gain: Mandela’s cause, it also had a downside. Observers almost unanimously cite Mr. Mandela’s refusal to renounce armed strug- gle and his support for Palestine Liberation Organization Chair- | man Yasser Arafat, Libyan lead- er Moammar Gadhafi and Cuban President Fidel Castro as his only missteps. In Atlanta, civil rights offi cials apologized for “the constant nagging” Mr. Mandela has en- countered during his U.S, tour over the use of violence. “T can’t understand why we keep raising the violence ques- tion,” said the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the South- ern Christian Leadership Con- ference. “I personally reject vio- lence in any form, but they [ANC officials] have a right to exercise their options when there is no moral conscience to which they can appeal. “Tt is totally unfair to try and force him to renounce violence no matter what the government does,” the Rev. Lowery said. In Miami, Cuban-Americans protested Mr. Mandela’s visit, and no local municipal officials greeted him at the airport. The situation “certainly didn’t help” already strained relations be- tween the area’s black and Cu- ban communities, one Miami of- Miami has seen two days of unrest between blacks and Cu- bans in the aftermath of Mr. Mandela’s visit. On Saturday, 300 blacks protested the alleged beating of a Haitian immigrant by Hispanic store employees at a shopping center. The response from the Amer- ican Jewish community has been conciliatory. “T think the American people have trouble embracing a man who [supports] a Gadhafi or a Castro,” said Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Def- amation League. “But we accept his [Mr. Mandela’s] friendship, and we do not put, as a condition of that friendship, total agree- ment on every issue.” Consciousness raised Whatever impact Mr. Mande- la’s visit will have on U.S. policy, some believe the residual effect on American society will endure. In Boston and New York, city officials said the visit already may have helped ease racial ten- sion that has plagued both cities in recent months, “People are actually talking about how we can get this thing back together,” said the Rev. Jo- seph Washington, Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn’s senior civil rights adviser. “We could not have paid for the positive impact he has had on the city.” “Certainly the American peo- ple will now have a greater awareness of the plight of black South Africans and of what kind of person Nelson Mandela is,” said Norman Ornstein, a political analyst with the American En- terprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. “They have seen that he is not just a minor figure who has been hyped or a cheap terrorist, Clear- ly he is a man of enormous stat- ure,” Mr. Ornstein said. “T sincerely believe that his visit — we may not see it today or tomorrow or next week — but his visit will have a profound impact on our society for years to come,” Mr. Lewis said. After the Detroit rally, Ruth Jacobs, 40, of Pontiac, Mich., said she expects a surge in young activism. “Since Martin Luther King, what have we done? We really haven't done anything since the ’60s. Maybe this will light a fire under people. It feels good to be somewhere where ev- eryone is of one accord.

        "ocr_text": "Starship Mandela: Racing across U.S. Old colleagues, young pros smooth the way during historic visit By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent ABOARD THE MANDELA PLANE — Personal photogra- pher Alf Kumalo, 60, lofts his battered old camera over the row of plush leather seats, straining to get a frame of tour strategists Harry Belafonte and Roger Wil- kins trying to shrink Nelson Mandela’s punishing Detroit schedule. The avuncular voice of pilot Ray Dothard comes on the inter- com. Out the right window, says the commander of the chartered Trump Shuttle Boeing 727, is a fine view of the Kennedy Space Center. A little later, Mr. Dothard in- vites Mr. Mandela and his dele-. gation to watch out the left win- dows for the Air Force C-141 transport flying 2,000 feet above them. Inside the olive-drab com- bat transport jet ride some of Mr. Mandela’s State Department se- curity detail and the bulletproof Cadillac the U.S. government is sending along to transport him to yet another delirious reception. For Mr. Kumalo and the others who wear the red-and-white but- tons of the Mandela traveling en- tourage, this dash across the United States has taken on an un- worldly quality, as though they were riding in Starship Mandela. There is the Mocow-trained personal physician, the former White House advance woman, the radical nun, the speechwriter from Zambia, the media minder from a Washington public rela- tions firm. And somewhere up in the front of the plane sit the country’s instant first couple, Nelson aad Winnie Mandela. For the 43 members of the Mandela entourage and the 12- member flying “press pool,” this probably will remain the ulti- mate power trip. And yet for Mr. Kumalo, it was nearly a no-go. A photojournalist who took pictures at the Mandelas’ wed- ding and later covered his 1964 treason trial, Mr. Kumalo was in- vited by Mr. Mandela last month to fly along with his entourage. But then, a few days before he was due to leave for New York, Mr. Kumalo discovered he had lost his South African passport — a document that can take months for a black to obtain. “My heart was bleeding,” Mr. Kumalo said. He rushed to the normally stone-faced South Afri- can Home Affairs Ministry and explained his plight. To his as- tonishment, a new passport was issued within a week, and he caught up with Mr. Mandela in Boston, the African National Congress deputy president’s sec- ond U.S. stop. Mr. Kumalo doesn’t own the big, $2,000 telephoto lenses that the legions of other photogra- phers unfurl at every stop. But he has the edge on all of them. Wherever Mr. Mandela goes, Mr. Kumalo is sure to have a po- sition, and it is often in front of all the others. There are others in the entou- rage who mean a lot to Mr. Man- dela, even though they are al- most never seen with him in public. One is Dr. Prenam Naiker, Mr. Mandela’s personal physi- cian. He is a staff doctor at the ANC’s exile headquarters in Lu- saka, Zambia. Dr. Naiker, in his late 30s, is a malaria specialist and had never treated Mr. Mandela on a regular basis before this trip. Some ANC officials aboard the plane felt he should have acted more forceful- ly to curtail Mr. Mandela’s schedule. There have been re- peated reports of unspecified ‘health problems” for Mr. Mandela. Another critically placed younger ANC exile is Ngoako Ra- matlodi, 34, the traveling speech- writer. A lawyer by training, Mr. Ra- matlodi also works in the exile headquarters in Lusaka. Because of his gift for rhetoric, he has ris- en to a trusted position as confi- dential secretary ailing ANC Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 1, 1990 (Sidebar) > \fStarship Mandela President Oliver Tambo. While Mr. Ramatlodi is often the phrasemaker, however, when it comes time to enunciate policy, the responsibility falls on Mr. Mandela himself. In Miami, a re- porter saw Mr. Ramatlodi in a hotel elevator, carrying Mr. Mandela the latest draft of the speech he would deliver to a un- ion convention in Florida. Was Mr. Mandela going to say anything to cool the tempers of Miami’s Cubans, the reporter asked. ‘Oh, I can’t say,” Mr. Ra- matlodi said in his clipped Afro- British accent. “That is up to the deputy president.” Mr. Mandela’s most impor- tant traveling policy adviser is Thabo Mbeki, head of the ANC’s international department. Mr. Mbeki, in his early 40s, played an important part in writing Mr. Mandela’s speech to Congress, viewed in the traveling entou- rage as among the best of Mr. Mandela’s long career. Serving as Mr. Mandela’s senior counselor on the trip is Ishmael Meer, a lawyer in his 70s who was Mr. Mandela’s co- defendant in the first South Afri- can treason trial of the late 1950s that launched Mr. Mandela on a path to prominence.

Jesse Jackson. “I am not the policy manager.” Along with Mr. Belafonte, Mr. Wilkins is in charge of say- ing no to the clingers. At every stop, faxes rain down on them from this coun- try’s power establishment — from mayors, senators and an- chormen — desperate for one moment of Mr. Mandela for their very own. Once Mr. Mandela’s daily schedule is fixed by ¢he higher- ups, it is up to Anne Edwards, a former advance woman in the Carter administration, to carry off the press coverage ar- rangements. She has been doing the same thing on and off since she ar- ranged news conferences for Jimmy Carter early in the 1976 presidential campaign. Some- times, Starship Mandela gives her an odd sense of deja vu. “I suddenly realized I had been in this hangar before,” she said after arranging the Detroit airport ceremony. “It was really freaky. I was here 12 or 13 years ago to set up some press confer- ence when I was working for the White House. I knew where all the exits ware.” J Atlanta Journal-Constitution-July 1, 1990 (Continued) \f"

Mandela was less successful in gaining full acceptance of the African National Congress as the preeminent organization capable of leading his country to democracy. Washington analysts and officials interviewed at week's end said they believed no movement easing sanctions would be politically possible soon, even if the legal, technical conditions are met. “I think it made it more difficult for anyone, in Congress or in the administration, to even think about lifting sanctions,” said Democratic Rep.

Analyst Pauline Baker of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace likewise said that the situation on the ground in South Africa will affect policies coming out of Washington. Issues must be resolved on both the white and the black sides in South Africa before full-scale talks can begin, she said, and until there is clearer movement toward the negotiating table it will be politically dicey here to take any action on sanctions, In any event, Baker said, she expects no sanctions to be lifted before the November elections because the administration seems to be divided on the issue, and because members of Congress will be reluctant to counter the swell of support that generally followed Mandela across the country. “Mandela's extraordinary welcome is going to make everybody think twice before they do anything controversial domestically,” Baker said. “It certainly brought it home to the administration that they can't do anything without consulting Congress.” She also cautioned that Mandela's comments on violence and his embrace of radical figures “could come back to haunt them later.” If the ANC comes Closer to wielding power in South Africa, it will be held more closely accountable for such statements, she said, Besides addressing Mandela's effect on U.S. policy, Lewis also spoke to a much deeper and more personal impact he believes the visit of this aging black rathnal Will have on this country, especially among acks, “T think in the black community Mandela has engendered a greater sense of pride, a greater sense of hope, a greater sense of optimism.

Yet by 6 a.m. Saturday, he was up, dressed and leading his security detail and a reporter on a brisk 20-minute stroll through the nearly deserted streets of downtown Los. An- geles. He wore black dress shoes, white socks, black sweat pants, a black T-shirt and a blue baseball cap. Seeing the reporter, Mr. Mandela, 71, grinned and asked, “How are you getting enough sleep?” Then he swept by and made no further small talk. To Mr. Mandela, walking is serious business, much more important than bantering with someone who might start lobbing ques- tions. Along Grand Street, Mr. Mandela stopped to talk with a middle-aged black man who was - staring vacantly from a wheel- chair, his left leg encased in a bandage. For about 30 seconds, Mr. Mandela asked him about his health, about how he was doing. Then he and his escorts strode on. “No one is ever going to be- NOTEBOOK lieve this,” the man in the wheel-, chair marveled. “I can’t believe this has happened to me.” Most of the several dozen oth- er people who observed Mr. Mandela and his procession were Hispanic or white. +k A few hours later, on the Mandela plane flying from Los Angeles to Oakland, Mandela press secretary Zwelakhe Sisulu was asked how Mr. Mandela had been affected by his emotional 11-day American visit. “For him it has been a hum- bling experience,” Mr. Sisulu said. “And you know he was a humble man before he got here.” Mr. Sisulu said Mr. Mandela was surprised in Hollywood to find that American entertainers don’t always look the same in the flesh as they appear on television or in films. The press secretary explained, “He remarked to Quincy Jones yesterday that when he hears all these famous names, he assumes they are tall, huge people, but when he meets some of them, he finds they are small [in stature] even though they are giants in culture.” Mr. Sisulu said Mr. Mandela was moved emotionally during his two brief conversations in Los Angeles with former Ameri- The Associated Press Nelson Mandela waves to cheering supporters Sunday in Dublin, Ireland, which made the ANC deputy president an honorary citizen two years ago. can boxing champion Muham- mad.

Marcial Portillo re- members his last day as a civil- ian. It was a festival day, and he was walking out of church with a friend when the army recruiting squad caught him. He was 15. “My parents went to the offi- cer and asked them to free me,” Private Portillo recalled. “He said he didn’t want to.” Now, after fighting against Marx- ist rebels for 22 ~=months, Private Por- tillo passes his days in a wheelchair at Military Hos- pital. A few weeks ago, a land mine : a blew off his Marcial Portillo right leg. Around the world, tens of thousands of teenage soldiers fight under various degrees of adult compulsion in 40-odd wars from Afghanistan to Peru. In 1988, a U.N. study cited an esti- mate that 200,000 children under 15 were bearing arms around the world. Central America is one of the few places on the globe where press-gang recruiting of teenage soldiers is indirectly subsidized by U.S. taxpayers through U.S. military aid. In some remote mountain regions of E] Salvador and Guatemala, pro-Communist rebels have filled their ranks the same way. This year the United States is providing $86.4 million in mili- tary aid to E) Salvador, $21 mil- lion to Honduras and $3.4 million to Guatemala. A few of the U.S. military aid dollars filter down to buy ban- dages at El Salvador’s main mili- tary hospital. “This place is the thermom- eter of the war,” said Lt. Col. Fer- nando Moreira Mendoza, a pedi- atric surgeon who is deputy chief of the hospital. “We can tell here if things are going bad.” Dr. Moreira estimated that 2,000 Salvadoran soldiers have been treated for combat wounds in the last eight months, most of them during a two-month rebel offensive that began in No- vember. “All are very young,” he said. “Most are about 20. About 25 percent are under 20 years. The youngest I’ve seen was about 16.” El Salvador’s legal military draft age is 18. For 10 years the United States has been advising, train- ing and helping finance El Salva- dor’s army, which is trying to fend off the guerrilla insurgency. During a decade of fighting, more than 70,000 Salvadoran sol- diers, rebels and civilians have been killed. Jose Luis Pena, 18, whose leg was ripped by an explosion of an object he never saw, said he was recruited 18 months ago and sent to combat. Asked why he fought, he said, “I don’t know. I didn’t want to fight. I was taken away.” The Roman Catholic Church raised the issue of forced recruit- ment two weeks ago when Monsi- gnor Ricardo Urioste, vicar-gen- eral of the Archdiocese of El Sal- vador, said in his Sunday homily that the army had increased its recruiting. The next day, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, a U.S.-backed conservative, de- Jose Luis Pena, 18, a patient at San Salvador’s Mili- Joseph Albright/Statf when it exploded. He had served 11 years in El Salva- : tary Hospital, never saw the object that mangled his legs — dor's army after being forcibly recruited. nied that recruiting was up. But he confirmed that his country’s army traditionally has replen- ished its ranks by finding young men on the streets and recruiting them on the spot. “I don’t really think that that is the best way to recruit,” he said, adding that his government hopes to reduce the need for sol- diers by pressing for a cease- fire. “It [forced recruitment] is certainly not the best way, but it did happen,” he said. “For the past 10 years, it has been the cus- tom. I guess it started with the war and it just kept on going. Al- though it is legal, it is a divisive approach.” Mr. Cristiani did not say whether the army had been re- cruiting youths under 18. In Honduras, President Ra- fael Leonardo Callejas said his army does not draft anyone un- der the legal age of 18. Last month, Mr. Callejas’s government appointed a com- mission to study forced military recruitment after hundreds of students from a public high school in Tegucigalpa began picketing Parliament to protest forced recruitment. They said the army had seized at least 30 students at bus stops. Mr. Callejas said filling the army has long been a problem, because youths ordinarily ignore the call for induction. “The response historically has been zero percent,” he said. “Nobody voluntarily goes into the army. ... It is a very complex problem, and I have no specific answers to give you. I will tell you that we will comply with the military law, but at the same time we will find mechanisms to reduce the forced recruitment.” But students at Tegucigalpa’s Central High School disputed Mr. Callejas. “They don’t respect age,” said Roger Torres, 18. “If they see a good body, they take it.” In neighboring Guatemala, forced recruitment may have an even longer history than else- where in Central America, said Marco Antonio Sagustume, a hu- man rights lawyer and teacher. Mr. Sagustume described what he said was a telegram sent in 1940 to Gen. George Ubico, then president of Guatemala, by one of his provincial command- ers, Gen. Encarnacion Deleon. Mr. Sagustume quoted General Deleon as saying, “I am sending you 500 volunteers for your army. Please send back to me the 500 ropes.” Until this year, forced re- cruitment was also a fact of life in Nicaragua, especially during the decade of rule by the leftist Sandinista regime. Nicaragua le- gally required universal service by youths as young as 16, in con- trast to the legal draft age of 18 in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. But Nicaragua’s new presi- dent, Violeta Chamorro, has end- ed the draft and is demobilizing the army, now that the war against the rebels has ended. In Managua, student Edwin Duarte, 16, said last week, “The kids had previously a psychosis of fear. They couldn’t even go out of their houses because [authori- ties] would come and grab them. They didn’t want to die for noth- ing. Now we can go around freely.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 22, 1990 \f"

WASHINGTON — The savings ° and loan crisis, resisting all at- : tempts to tame it, has become a __ full-grown bucking political ani- mal. “We are dealing with a moving target,” Treasury Secretary Nicho- las F. Brady said at a congressional hearing recently. Brady was referring to the un-' certain economic conditions and a lackluster real estate market that have raised the scope and costs of the S&L bailout, leaving regulators unsure how big the problem will get — much less how to cut it down to size. But even as Brady testified at the June 14 hearing, members of the House Banking and Urban Af- fairs Committee were taking their first shots at a target of another kind: a target of political opportu- nity with more lights, bells and buzzers than a shooting gallery ata county fair. The S&L financial disaster has been a lively issue for several years, but it matured into a full- blown political controversy only after new cost estimates this spring suggested taxpayers ultimately may have to spend half a trillion dollars to bail out depositors in failed savings institutions. It was a far cry from the admin- istration’s original estimate of $50 billion. Voters began demanding to know who caused the trouble — and whether they were being pun- ished. “The reasons it’s an issue now are obvious,” said Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commit- tee. “The magnitude of the crisis has finally been realized by all the parties involved.” Scarcely a day passes without a congressional hearing, indignant statement from Congress or the White House or speech by a party official, all trying to pin the blame for the S&L mess on somebody else. The issue will be pivotal in at least half a dozen congressional races this fall, Schloss said, and will underscore dozens more. In- cumbents who took campaign con- tributions from S&L figures are the most vulnerable, especially if they voted the wrong way on legislation that is now viewed as contributing to the collapse of much of the thrift industry. The collapse has also fanned smoldering regional rivalries, with members of Congress from the North and East complaining that their states will be net losers in the bailout while money flows to the South and West. Some analysts predict the S&L disaster could still be an issue in the 1992 presidential election, es- pecially since regulators have ac- cused the president’s son Neil Bush of ‘‘unsafe and unsound practices” as director of a Colorado thrift whose demise may cost the govern- ment $1 billion. “People may have a hard time understanding $500 billion,” said Schloss of the total bailout cost. “But with Neil Bush it’s been per- sonalized. Here is someone who has caused this crisis.” Crime only one cause Congressional hearings this spring probing Neil Bush’s role in the collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association con- tributed to the new politicalization of the S&L crisis. Another political escalator was President Bush’s re- cent reversal on a tax increase, which he reluctantly supported partly because of high S&L bailout costs. In recent weeks, there has been an increasing focus on the drive to prosecute S&L officers whose in- sider abuse and misconduct, regu- lators say, contributed “signifi- cantly” to the insolvency of 40 percent of the institutions seized by the government. But savings industry analyst Bert Ely says crime was not the major cause of the crisis. And S&L wrongdoing could not have flour- ished outside a climate created by a complex series of events dating back nearly a decade. The deregulation thrust of the Reagan administration — in which Congress acquiesced — resulted in S&Ls being liberated from restric- tions on how much interest they could pay depositors, as well as how they could invest depositors’ money. Another key change was raising federal insurance to cover S&L deposits up to $100,000. This combination of changes meant S&Ls could offer high inter- est rates to attract more deposits, ‘The key reason the S&L mess is so bad is because the cleanup was delayed as long as it was.’ BERT ELY, industry analyst giving them funds galore to use on whatever development scheme was plunked on their board table for consideration. In some cases, the officers had little investment experience be- yond solid single-family housing loans, and they got snagged in so- phisticated financing they couldn’t handle. In other cases the directors or officers knowingly indulged in questionable loans and investments from which they were able to make personal gains. Some critics contend that de- regulation itself was not the prob- lem, but that the government failed to monitor the S&Ls to prevent the excesses that followed. The result was a lot of bad loans that never were repaid. S&Ls. acound the country repossessed housing tracts that couldn’t be sold, unrentable high-rise office towers, warehouses that couldn’t be leased, uranium mines, parking lots and golf courses, among other things. A downturn in the real estate market, especially in the West and Southwest, contributed to the col- lapse. As S&Ls wrote off loans and were stuck with property they couldn’t sell, they found themselves lacking the funds to cover deposits their customers might wish to with- draw. The government, however, had insured the deposits, which meant the government had to pay off the depositors of bankrupt S&Ls. That is the government bailout. The administration and Con- gress failed to seriously address the problem until last year, after the insurance fund covering deposits had been depleted and S&Ls were going belly-up all over the country. A law enacted last August set up two new agencies, the Office of Thrift Supervision to regulate S&Ls and the Resolution Trust Corp. to take over and either liquidate or sell institutions too shaky to contin- ue operations. It is too early to tell whether the new politicalization of the S&L is- sue will help or hinder the efforts of bureaucrats to clean up the shat- tered industry. “It should be positive for the cleanup,” said analyst Ely, admit- ting some reservations. “The key reason the S&L mess is so bad is because the cleanup was delayed as long as it was. People realize now that delay is expen- sive.”’ Ely estimates that each year a sick S&L is allowed to contin running, its losses are compounde by 20 percent to 25 percent, The Office of Thrift Supervision probably has accelerat the de- mise of institutions through some tough new regulations. OTS offi- cials insist that S&Ls that cannot meet minimum standards will only lose money in the end, and are better seized by the government before losses burgeon. The Resolution Trust Corp. speeded up its work in the past three months by shutting down 155 institutions. It had only disposed of about 50 in the previous seven months. However, the government still is running 247 disabled S&Ls, and the downfall of hundreds more is expected. The Treasury Depart- ment has estimated that 1,000 of the nation’s 2,500 S&Ls ultimately may fail, while the Congressional Budget Office puts the estimate at 1,700 failures — more than two- thirds of the industry. But the RTC is left holdin expensive problems from rages aps the so-called ‘“resolved”’ These are the assets in the fers a houses or junk bonds or uranium mines that {he government so far has not sold. The most recent six-volume in- ventory of property in government hands includes almost 30,000 resi- dential properties and more than 5,500 commercial properties. Soft market hurts RTC Treasury Secretary Brady said the continued soft real estate mar- ket has meant trouble for RTC sales, which drives up the cost of the bailout. The more property the RTC sells, the more it offsets the costs of paying off deposits. The experience of past months “has made us more pessimistic about losses embedded in thrifts both inside and outside the RTC’s current caseload,” Brady said. One innovative RTC plan is to hold mega-auctions in which mil- lions of dollars in property will be sold off at one time, beginning in September. As voters’ anger over the losses has grown hotter, the federal pros- ecutors have gotten cooking. The Justice Department has come out with a plan to intensify investigations and prosecutions through a new special coordinator, “rapid response teams” and addi- tional funding. : But Congress itself is on a roll to get the crooks. It is expected to have a new law on the president’s desk by the middle of next month that may increase relevant crimi- nal penalties, add investigative manpower and give prosecutors and regulators more tools to get at the money S&L cheats have stashed in accounts or assets that now can- not be confiscated. If not by August, it certainly should be passed in time for mem- bers of Congress to campaign this fall on their new law getting tough on the S&L scandal. Palm Beach Post - July 22, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Loyalty to other struggles may haunt Mandela, ANC Support of Arafat, Castro, Gadhafi springs from variety of relationships By Marcia Kunstel Joumal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — What did Yasser Arafat, Fidel Castro and Moammar Gad- hafi do to earn Nelson Mandela’s political embrace, which may haunt him as he con- fronts thorny problems in South Africa? The three leaders and their move- ments have had vastly differing relation- ships with Mr. Mandela and his African National Congress. Only Mr. Castro has:supplied substan- tial military and material support to the ANC over the years. Mr. Arafat has been primarily a brother in the family of libera- tion politicians. Colonel Gadhafi was at odds with the ANC until last year. “To lump us together with all three of them is not only irrational, it is sinister,” said Madoda Hlatshwayo, a spokesman in the ANC’s Washington office. A Bush administration official who re- quested anonymity agreed that a single characterization of the three relationships was inept. “Throwing Arafat, Castro and Gadhafi in the same bag responds to America’s concerns about the three,” he said. “We throw them in the same bag.” Regardless of why Mr. Mandela had warm praise for the three leaders during his U.S. visit last month, it brought a sour note to the trip. Some members of Congress said they were incensed that Mr. Mandela publicly allied himself with leaders they consider terrorists. Even some supporters said Mr. Mandela had hurt his crusade to get finan- cial aid “to promote the peace process” in South Africa. The ANC is likely to get some of the $10 million already allocated for promot- ing democracy in South Africa but no- where near the $50 million some advo- cates sought. The ANC needs the financing to make the transition from a liberation movement in exile to a nationwide political party with offices, a radio station, a newspaper and other tools needed for political orga- nizing. As Mr. Mandela returned to South Af- rica last week and re-entered the ring to negotiate with the white government, he found another adversary on the mat. His major political rival, Mangosuthu Buthe- lezi, had just announced he was turning his Zulu tribal organization, Inkatha, into a multiracial political party. It is unclear how much money the ANC will get from allies such as Mr. Cas- tro, Mr. Arafat and Colonel Gadhafi for » democratic development. ‘ The Cubans, who face their own finan- cial disaster from cutbacks in what had been aid to the Eastern bloc, have been a mainstay of the ANC in exile. “They supported liberation in the whole of southern Africa,” Mr. Hlatsh- wayo said. “It was diplomatic assistance. It was military assistance. It was welfare assistance. Educational. All around. They looked at our problems and met our needs to facilitate us fighting against apartheid.” Leaders of ANC guerrilla forces long have been open about the military aid they received from Cuba and other Com- munist nations. “We send our people to Cuba, the Sovi- et Union, the GDR [East Germany],” Chris Hani, leader of the ANC’s military wing, once said in an interview with Cox Newspapers. “We can’t complain. The training we get is first-class training.” As for Colonel Gadhafi, he has not in- cluded the ANC in the liberation move- ments he has financed around in the Mid- dle East and Africa because the ANC has Jewish members, Mr. Hlatshwayo said. “Gadhafi did not want us in his coun- try because we've got Jews,” he said. “Gadhafi says get rid of the Jews. We say no. So we get no money. It is only this year we were allowed to operate in Libya.” The ANC was allowed to open an office in Libya without altering its’ policies. Colonel Gadhafi’s position as a patron of revolutionary struggles and fighter for Libyan independence was enough to win Mr. Mandela’s endorsement, though the Libyan leader has not been especially generous with the ANC. Mr. Mandela seems to hold higher re- gard for Mr. Arafat, another figure at the center of a fight for self-determination. Mr. Arafat and his Palestine Liberation Organization also have not supplied huge financial assistance to the ANC, but blacks in South Africa and elsewhere identify strongly with the Palestinian movement. One explanation for Mr. Mandela’s support of fellow revolutionaries is that his rhetoric harks back to the 1960s, be- fore he was sent to prison for 27 years, when radicals believed the world’s revo- weeny movements someday would be united.

Nonetheless, his 15-year involve- ment in the abortion issue as a medi- cal board member is sure to be scru- tinized during the coming Senate confirmation hearings. Because Judge Souter’s legal writings on abortion are almost non-existent, his public service record is about the only clue that the country and Con- gress have to his views.

At the time, all abortions were banned in New Hampshire under an 1867 law that was among the country’s most restrictive. Two months later, on Jan. 22, 1973, the Supreme Court handed down its Roe v.

Oates, who was then Judge Souter’s fellow Con- cord Hospital board member, said from his Maine retirement home that the board could have passed a routine “boiler-plate” resolution to allow abortion in compliance with state regu- lations. legal was still on the books, and /% Gov. Meldrim Thomson, a con- | servative Republican, had vehe- mently attacked the Supreme Court for “an arbitrary usurpa- tion of power.” But three weeks after the Roe v. Wade ruling, the state attorney general, Warren B. Rudman, declared in a legal opinion that the state’s abortion ban was now “unconstitutional.” Concord Hospital became the first hospital in the Concord area to permit abortion in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling, according to a Feb. 27, 1973, arti- cle in the local newspaper, the Appeals Judge David H. Souter has lived at this Weare, N.H., country home since he was 11 years old, “If there was something that was required, that the board had to pass to meet state regulation, then we would have passed it,” he said. “I recall no discussion of it: The current hospital presi- dent, Richard G. Warner, said: ‘I came to Concord Hospital in 1975. From 1975 until he went off the board 10 years later, abortion was never a subject of discussion at a board meeting, and he [Judge Souter] and I never had a conversation about it.”’ Nor did Judge Souter raise the topic in the twice-yearly meetings of the Dartmouth Med- ical School overseers, said for- mer medical school dean Dr. Robert McCollom. He said that Dartmouth med- ical students, like students at most medical schools, routinely learn about the techniques of performing abortions.

        "ocr_text": "For solitary Souter, law is his companion By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Pgim Beach Post Washington Bureau WEARE, N.H. — The dirt road on which David Souter lives winds like a tunnel under arching green boughs. His dilapidated country home is a place for solitude, peace and contemplation. The brown clapboard house — sporting four lightning rods and no television antenna — has moss bud- ding up through peeling paint, ripped white shades on the win- dows and a yard whose tall grass is hospitable to clover, tiny wild dai- sies and queen anne’s lace. It looks like what it is, the home of a 50- year-old bachelor devoted to the iaw and to solitary diversions such as music, rare old books and bottle collecting. | The home of the man President Bush nominated to the U.S. Su- reme Court is hardly a social nm in the New Hampshire countryside, but, like the man, it has its friendly moments. “T've been entertained at Da- vid’s house. He’s a good cook,” said Ronald Snow, president of the Con- cord law firm where Souter once worked. “He’s put on some fine dinner parties for small groups. I’ve been to his house when he did an excellent lobster feast. The whole nine yards. Lobsters, steam- ers, sweet corn — that whole Down East number.” He even has been known to whip up a homemade pie, but culinary expertise is not the basis of Souter’s reputation in these parts. He is known for his keen mind, dedication to work and devotion to the rule of law. And these are the reasons Bush said he wants Souter to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. Souter’s hard work and consid- erable intellect carried him quickly up the professional ladder. Educa- tion at Harvard University, as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford Universi- ty in England and finally after Harvard Law School, landed him a job at a prestigious Concord law firm. After only two years, he be- came deputy state attorney gener- al, then was named attorney gener- al in 1976. Two years later, Souter was named to New Hampshire Superior Court, and then in 1983 to the state Supreme Court. This year Bush put him on the U.S. Court of Appeals, the second-highest judicial level in the land. Anecdotes from as far back as high school explain his rapid rise. A Concord pharmacist who went to school with Souter remem- bers him as such a serious student that he carried a leather briefcase : to high school. Even then he was named by his peers as the most likely to succeed. Mary and Robert Sykes run Sykes and Flanders Antiquarian Books a few miles down the road and have known him for decades, but know little more than that he collects “scarce and important American history books,” and likes music and hiking. “‘He’s one of the hardest-work- ing people I know,” Mary Sykes said. “He’s always talking about his briefs. He always has to get home to finish one,” her husband added. This predilection for thorough, detailed work has made him a hard judge to practice law before, said James Duggan, a professor at Franklin Pierce Law Center who said he has argued before Souter more than 100 times as chief appel- late defender for the state. “He’s a very active participant in oral argument. He asks very difficult questions and expects good answers. He does not tolerate lawyers who give evasive answers, or are not prepared,” Duggan said. “There are some lawyers who feel he’s too dominant.” outer’s work _habi In 1957, his senior year at Concord (N.H.) High School, Souter was known as ‘Soutie.’ him in the center of the social whirl, but his appointment to the state Supreme Court prompted him to constrict his social life even further, several colleagues said. “T think his more private life has been after he became a mem- ber of the court system,” Snow said. “It just becomes very tough to socialize with your ex-colleagues who might appear before you.” His small circle of close friends includes Sen. Warren Rudman, R- N.H., who as state attorney general hired Souter when he was a junior lawyer at the Concord firm of Orr and Reno. Souter’s acquaintances name two former women friends, both of whom have married now and moved out of state. One is Ann Grant, the daughter of a crusty Superior Court judge, and the other is Anne Cagwin, who worked in the state attorney general's office with Souter. “He’s a real gentleman, very proper,” said the former Cagwin, now married to Maine school prin- cipal Gunnar Hagstrom. “We dated for about three or four months in 1978 and '79, when I was in my 20s. He was very conscious that we could not date until after he had left the attorney general’s office.” Reached by telephone in Maine, she said Souter took her hiking in the mountains and once cooked her a dinner that included the local mountain-grown delicacy, fiddle- heads, wild ferns that are used in salads. “He had a very different code than some of the men I dated,”’ she said. “It was really refreshing. He was a true gentleman — and of course this is not to disparage the other gentlemen I dated.” That Souter does live a rather cloistered life in one of the most homogeneous states in the nation has raised some questions about his empathy as a Supreme Court jus- tice. As the Concord Monitor asked in an editorial: ‘“‘Has his nar- row life experience limited his grasp of the human complexities and societal dynamics that affect many of the issues going before the court?” His friends say no. “Yes, his personal life is re- served,” said Bill Glahn, a fellow lawyer who introduced Souter to hiking and who, along with his two sons, has climbed most of the state’s highest peaks with the judge. But what Supreme Court justice ever spends much time with ‘the masses,” he asked. Souter’s experi- ence running a major state depart- ment, working in the community with the local hospital board and historical society, and his days on the bench seeing ‘‘all the gritty cases” provide a broad range of experiences, Glahn said. “The funny thing about Souter is he’s not eccentric. He’s not weird in any way. He’s just a normal guy who likes to be by himself,” Dug- gan Said. In Washington Wednesday, Sou- ter visited the Capitol. Pressed by reporters to discuss his views on issues facing the Su- preme Court, Souter said, “I don’t have any substantive feelings to express. I look forward to partici- pating with the Senate in a consti- tutional process.” Bush and some Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have said the panel should concentrate on examining Souter’s judicial philos- ophy rather than his views on spe- cific issues. But Sen. Edward Kennedy, D- Mass., reflecting the desire of abor- tion rights groups to hear the nomi- nee’s views on such a divisive issue, said Wednesday, “I think there is a desire to have full and complete hearings.” Palm Beach Post - July 26, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Souter’s elusive abortion views frustrate activists on both sides Journal-Conmstitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Anti-abor- tion activists Thursday were thrown into the same uncomfort- able position as the most fervent members of the abortion rights movement: They couldn’t figure out whether to mourn or cheer the nomination of Judge David H. Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Souter, pushing on with courtesy calls on Capitol Hill, continued to prolong their anguish. Asked to clarify a 1981 letter he wrote touching on the abortion controversy, Judge Sou- ter said, ‘‘I think you should save amy issue of that sort ... for the confirmation hearing, where I’m sure that issue will be ad- dressed.’”’ Ralph Poland, head of New Hampshire Right to Life, con- fessed Thursday he had ‘‘mixed feelings’””’ about the choice of his taciturn neighbor as the ninth justice. ‘‘If we knew exactly how Pro-life he was, then we could know what to do,’’? Mr. Poland said. ‘‘But we don’t know.” A similarly indecisive judg- ment came from abortion rights leader Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women. Ms. Yard said that three days after the nomination, she still couldn’t form an opinion on whether Judge Souter ought to be confirmed by the Senate. Abortion activists across the country were trying to make sense out of three fragments of Judge Souter’s record in New Hampshire: @ In 1973, he was a member of the board of. trustees of Concord Hospital when it unanimously voted to let staff doctors perform abortions at the hospital after the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade Aecision legalized abortions. Judge Souter remained on the board through 1985 without pro- testing the hospital’s abortion policy. @ In 1981, while a judge on the New Hampshire Superior Court, he wrote to the state Legislature opposing a bill backed by abor- tion opponents. It would have re- quired teenagers to get the con- sent of parents or a court before obtaining abortions. Judge Souter’s letter urged lawmakers mot to force judges “to make fundamental moral de- cisions’”’ for pregnant minors and warned that such a law would Promote ‘‘shopping for judges’”’ because it did not include any Buidelines on how the judges should act. The letter was used by abortion rights lobbyists in defeating the proposed law. @iIn 1986, as a state Supreme Court judge, he joined in a ruling that a doctor could be sued for The Associated Press Sapreme Court nominece David H. Souter (center) meets Thursday on Capitol Hill with Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas (right). The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to begin confirmation hearings on Judge Souter’s nomination in September. Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON —- Draft records released Thursday show v.sS. Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter re- ceived a medical deferment from military service in 1966 as the Vietnam War was esca- lating and at a time when he mo longer was eligible for a student deferment. White House spokeswom.- an Alixe Glenn said Judge Souter told her the physical deferment was based on the fact that one of his legs is an imch shorter than the other. The deferment was granted shortly after Judge Souter graduated from Harvard Law megligence for failing to advise a Pregnant woman of the risks of exposure to German measles. The court agreed that the woman was wrongly deprived of knowledge with which to make an informed decision about whether to have an abortion. Judge Souter wrote in a concur- ring opinion that a doctor with ‘religious or moral scruples’’ against abortion could have re- ferred the case to another doctor. The National Right to Life Committee believes his views re- main unclear. An American University law dean, Andrew Fr. Popper, emerged as one of the few who claimed to have figured out how Judge Souter would handle the constitutionality of abortion. Mr. Popper predicted Judge Souter would apply an *“originalist’’ view of the Constitution, in which he would interpret it by trying to determine Precisely what its Arafters meant when they wrote it two centuries ago. Mr. Popper predicted this ap- proach would lead Judge Souter to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade if Souter got military deferment School. Records released by the Selective Service System show Judge Souter registered for the draft in Milford, N.H., im March 1988, when he was an 18-year-old Harvard fresh- man. He received a student deferment and kept it throughout his years at Har- vard, as a Rhodes Scholar in England and as a Harvard law student. Im the fall of 1966, the year he left Harvard and took a job as a lawyer in Concord, N.-H., he was reclassified ‘‘1-Y.’”? The code means a candidate is qualified for military service only in time of war or national emergency. he could not find a historical rea- son for believing the framers meant to include a right of priva- cy in the Constitution. If confirmed, Judge Souter would have to deal with at least one abortion case when the high court begins its new term in Oc- tober. In the New York case Rust v. Sullivan, abortion rights propo- ments are challenging a ban on federal funds for Title X family planning programs whose coun- selors offer advice on abortions. That case, similar to other re- cent lawsuits on federal funding, is expected to offer no strong in- dication of whether the court’s altered membership is prepared to abandon Roe v. Wade. It will take two or three years for the latest tough anti-abortion state laws to arrive at the high court. Among them are Pennsyl- vania laws narrowing access to abortion and Guam’s law prohib- iting all abortions except those to save a woman ’s life.

But this time the local farmers and doctors and lawyers suspected that the journalists who landed quickly in town were up to no good. “T think they were just trying to distort the facts, like most reporters do, so they could get something on the front page,” John Knox, a neigh- bor of Judge Souter in nearby Weare, told the local newspaper, “They're looking for skeletons, but they won't find any in David Souter’s closet,” said a pharma- cist who didn’t want to be identified, Rather than clam up in the face of this outside threat, most people opened up. Ronald Snow, president of the Orr and Reno law firm where Judge Souter used to work and a long- time friend of the 50-year-old jurist, was as gruff as one might expect any self-respecting Granite Stater to be when he answered the telephone Wednesday morning. He had a court hearing in 40 minutes, Mr, Snow | Reaction in New Hamps grumbled, and could spare a maximum of five to talk with a reporter. But soon Mr, Snow warmed to the subject and could even chuckle with incredulity when telling how some guy the day before had asked him — on camera yet — whether his bachelor friend Souter was a homosexual, “David is absolutely healthy; he has no strange predispositions,” Mr, Snow then volunteered to a reporter who had asked only whether and whom Judge Souter dated, “He's interested in all kinds of nice people, nice attractive women.” Colleagues admire his independence For 20 minutes Mr. Snow extolled Judge Souter’s legal qualifications, community service, cooking prowess and mode of interacting with peo- ple. When the reporter noted that the five-minute limit had passed, Mr. Snow allowed that it was worth the time to give the nation a true picture of his friend, James Duggan, a law professor and public de- fender, must have explained to a score of journal- ists how he will miss Justice William J. Brennan Jr., the liberal whose resignation opened the way for the nomination of Judge Souter. Mr. Duggan has had plenty of what he calls “sharp disagreements” with Judge Souter in the 100 or so times he has argued cases in the judge’s court. He called Mr. Souter a classic judicial conserv- ative and predicted that he will, if Judge Souter is confirmed to the high court, disagree with a lot of his decisions. But Mr. Duggan didn’t talk to journalists just to pan this judge he describes as, personally, “a very nice guy.” “President Bush could have done a lot worse,” Mr, Duggan said, “We could have some real right wing crazy up there, [Judge Souter] is his own per- son, He's got his own philosophy. He isn’t the tool of some right-wing group. He'll probably vote with the conservatives most of the time. But he'll get there on his own route,” Friends, neighbors would miss him Wilbur “Bill” Glahn, a lawyer, hiking compan- ion and close friend of Judge Souter, seems to be one of the few people who ever has talked politics with him, “We have different philosophies,” said Mr. Glahn, who described himself as a liberal Demo- crat. “We argue about things. But I’m smart ding enough to know after this many years that I'm not going to win an intellectual argument with David Souter,” Leaning back on the bleachers after a Little League practice he coached last week, Mr. Glah talked about hashing out with Judge Souter moral and ethical implications of issues they faced’ in the attorney general’s office in the 1970s. But they are more than just intellectual friends. Mr. Glahn nodded toward his two sons quietly wait- ing for him by the car and told how Judge Soutet’ used to read them bedtime stories. Or how, after’ hiking a 4,000-foot mountain, they all go back to the Glahns’ house for dinner, He thinks Judge Souter is “the perfect judge and the best the liberals could hope to get out of ; Republican administration. But Mr, Glahn admits to bittersweet feelings about losing his friend to Washington, “He's the guy I always go to when I have a per” sonal problem,” Mr. Glahn said, adding that his wife, too, seeks advice from Judge Souter, “‘Actual-’ ly, I had something I wanted to talk to him about’ this week. Doesn’t look like I’ll get to.” . Mary Sykes was born in the house where shit! still lives with her family, a few miles down the’ road from Judge Souter, So she has known Judge Souter since he moved at age 11 into the ramshackle farmhouse where it Still lives today, She and her husband used Ju Souter’s Episcopal prayer book at their wed and the judge presided at their daughter’s wed- .

        "ocr_text": "Souter recognized right to abortion 76 brief accepted Roe v, Wade By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — As the New Hampshire at- torney general 14 years ago, Supreme Court nomi- nee David H. Souter submitted a brief acknowledg- ing that any woman has a “constitutional right” to choose abortion, so long as taxpayers don’t have to foot the bill. Since Judge Souter’s nomination last week, partisans have been searching for evidence of how the federal appeals court judge’s confirmation might tilt the Supreme Court's delicate balance on abortion rights. The document was the first to come to light un- der Judge Souter’s name in which he accepted the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the Roe v. Wade case that women have a constitutional right of pri- vacy that includes a right to abortion. The brief’s acceptance of a “constitutional right” to choose abortion was one point in its toughly phrased argument whose main thrust was that states must not be forced to fund the abortions of poor women under the Medicaid health program. The brief, found in a court archive by a liber- al lobbying group, contained Judge Souter’s typed name, followed by the signature of Rich- ard Wiebusch, then the assistant attorney gener- al directly responsible for the case. Mr. Wiebusch said Monday that he wrote the brief and cannot recall discussing it with Judge Souter before the brief was filed in March 1976. One month later, however, Judge Souter was quoted by a New Hampshire newspaper editor as saying he was following the case with interest and watching legal developments in a similar case in Pennsylvania. New Hampshire’s attorney general is ap- pointed by the governor — who at the time was conservative Republican Meldrim Thomson — and by law represents him and other state offi- cials in court cases. Senators on both sides of the abortion issue have promised to raise the subject during Judge Souter’s confirmation hearings in September. Judge Souter is due back in Washington today for more meetings with senators who will con- sider his nomination to succeed retired Justice William J. Brennan, a strong supporter of abor- tion rights. Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way, whose researchers found the brief, said, “The brief acknowledges the prece- dent of Roe v. Wade. But the language in parts of the brief suggests a clear sympathy for the anti- abortion viewpoint. Clearly the Senate should ask Judge Souter to address himself to this docu- ment at his confirmation hearings.” The case arose when a New Hampshire phy- sician and an anonymous pregnant woman filed suit to challenge state regulations barring Medi- caid-funded abortions. A trial judge ruled that the regulations were illegal, leaving it to Judge Souter’s office to defend the regulations in ap- pellate courts. “Congress did not enact [Medicaid] to aid in the destruction of fetuses,” the New Hampshire brief said. It went on to argue that because many of the state’s citizens view abortion as “the killing of unborn children,” the State Welfare Division was justified in imposing regulations barring Medicaid reimbursement for elective abortions. The brief reached the constitutionality of abortion when it addressed whether New Hamp- shire was justified in providing a special pro- gram of financial aid to poor pregnant women for prenatal, delivery and post-birth expenses. A key passage said, “For whatever reason the state chooses to assist with the expenses of birth and medically necessary abortions, it does not thereby violate the spirit or objectives of Ti- tle XIX [Medicaid] or burden the constitutional right of any woman to choose to have an abortion.” Deputy White House press secretary Ste- phen Hart said he didn’t know whether Presi- dent Bush had been told about the 1976 case. “What’s important is the president supports his nominee,” Mr. Hart said. On another controversial issue, newspaper clippings from 1976 quoted Judge Souter as hav- ing attacked federal guidelines giving employ- ment preference to people because of their eth- nic background as “affirmative discrimination.” Judge Souter, in a college commencement address in Nashua, N.H., was quoted as attack- ing affirmative action hiring as something the government “should not be involved in.” Both the Manchester Union Leader and the Nashua Telegraph quoted Judge Souter as hav- _ing told graduates of the New England Aeronau- tical Institute and Daniel Webster College, “There are some things government cannot do, and our whole constitutional history is a history of restraining power.” The two colleges and the New Hampshire At- torney General’s Office said Monday that they could find no text of Judge Souter’s remarks.

        "ocr_text": "Souter opinion in 1985 rape case sheds light on views Did victim ‘ask for it”? Court OK’d testimony By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution Washington Bureau FARMINGTON, N.H. — When a 25-year- old woman sits on one man’s lap in a bar and is seen “making out with” at least one other pa- tron, is it something a jury should consider when a third customer is accused of raping her a few hours later? The question lies at the core of what argu- ably is the most controversial opinion ever written by Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter. Athis confirmation hearing next month, the opinion by the 50-year-old federal appeals court judge is almost sure to be mined for clues to his attitudes toward the rights of a defen- dant, sexual roles and the right to privacy. Beyond the thought patterns it may reveal, the 1988 opinion also may come under debate -because of its legal craftsmanship, In an un- published New Hampshire law review article, the county prosecutor who tried the case is quoted as asserting that Judge Souter misstat- ed the facts that came up in the trial, The prosecutor, Janice Rundles, also insist- ed that the New Hampshire “rape shield” law spared the woman from being questioned in a courtroom about her sexual behavior toward anyone besides the defendant. “If she sat on 10 people’s laps, it has no bearing on this case whatsoever,” she argued when construction worker Richard Colbath was on trial on rape charges in 1986. That was exactly the kind of “character assassination” from which rape victims are supposed to be spared, the prosecutor argued in a conference with the trial judge. The defense attorney, county public de- fender Albert Scherr, insisted it was only fair to the defendant for the jury to hear the “‘cir- cumstances surrounding” the alleged rape. He said the woman’s behavior in the bar a few hours before the alleged crime was a valid indi- cator of her state of mind toward sex. Trial Judge Joseph Nadeau, after reading the state’s 1975 rape shield law, sided with the prosecutor. “The fact that she may have been ’ flirting with other people,” said Judge Nadeau, - “or that she even had sexual relations with oth- er people is not evidence of her consent to the sexual intercourse with” the defendant. The jury convicted Colbath. When he ap- pealed, Judge Souter and the other four New Hampshire Supreme Court judges voted unan- imously to reverse the trial judge on grounds that Colbath had been denied his constitutional Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter (left) chats with South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, the right to a fair trial. In an opinion written by Judge Souter, the court ordered a retrial and carved an exception in the rape shield statute under which future rape defendants could present evidence about a woman’s behavior so long as it was in a “pub- lic” setting. Judge Souter wrote, “In this case, for exam- ple, the jury could have taken evidence of the complainant’s openly sexually provocative be- havior toward a group of men as evidence of her probable attitude toward an individual within the group. Evidence that the publicly in- viting acts occurred closely in time to the al- leged sexual assault by one such man could have been viewed as indicating the complain- ant’s likely attitude at the time of the sexual ac- tivity in question,” The case grew out of a summer Friday af- ternoon in 1985 at Farmington’s Smokey Lan- tern tavern, a beer joint that still attracts a reg- ular clientele of country-and-western music fans, motorcycle riders, ex-servicemen and pool players. The woman was a virtual stranger to Far- mington, a hardscrabble factory town, when she dropped in at the Smokey Lantern around noon. She said she arrived with her sister, who knew the regular customers, and spent the rest of the afternoon playing pool and drinking half a dozen beers. A review of the trial transcript shows there were differing perceptions of what took place. The Associated Press ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, which will consider his confirmation in September. The woman testified that she was “upset” because she had been “having a lot of trouble with the guy I was living with.” She said she told her troubles to some men at the bar — among them, defendant Colbath. “Did you make advances on anyone there?” Colbath’s attorney asked her. No, she replied. When the defense attorney asked whether she was “sure about that,” she answered that she did sit on the lap of one of the defendant's male companions. She said she had known the man several years earlier as a friend of her first husband. Bar waitress Candy Lee Lepene, who knew the defendant as a frequent patron, described the woman as “hanging all over everyone and making out with Richard Colbath and a few others.” But the most graphic account of her alleged sexual receptiveness came from Colbath. He testified that around midafternoon, he and the woman got “really friendly,” and that before long they were touching each other intimately. After about six hours in the bar, she said she agreed to go for a ride in Colbath’s pickup truck. “He seemed, you know, like he really cared,” she explained. “It was like he was a good listener.” Colbath drove her to his trailer. They both testified she went inside voluntarily. After another beer, she testified, Colbath punched her, forced her to perform oral sex and raped her. His version was that she con- sented by taking off her clothes and crawling into bed. After the sex acts, as the woman was put- ting on her clothes, Colbath’s live-in girlfriend, Sheila Parzych, burst into the trailer and flew into a rage at the woman. Ms. Parzych, testifying for the defense, told of dragging the woman by the hair and kicking her repeatedly in the face. The defense used her testimony to explain the bruises on the face and breast of the rape victim. In his final instructions, Judge Nadeau told the jurors they must make up their minds whether the woman “gave consent” to Colbath without taking into account “her conduct [in the bar] with other individuals.” That was the point on which Judge Souter and the other appellate judges reversed Col- bath’s conviction. He was retried, and a second jury also found him guilty. He is serving a six- year prison sentence. After the Souter opinion, two law students, Alfred T, Catalfo and Theodore Comstock, un- dertook a project assigned by Professor Ellen Musinsky of the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord. They interviewed New Hampshire prosecutors and rape victim counselors on their reactions to the decision. The students wrote, “It should be noted that the prosecuting attorney in [the] Colbath [case] told us that the Supreme Court had im- properly ‘accepted as true the defendant's ver- sion of the facts,’ and that a large part of the ruling was based on what [the prosecuting at- torney] construed to be a questionable state- ment of the actual facts. “This was due to the [victim's] denial that she directed sexually provocative behavior toward the men in the bar and her further deni- al that an assault by the defendant's live-in girlfriend ever took place.” Despite the prosecutor's remarks, the stu- dents’ conclusion supported the Souter deci- sion. Judge Souter had read the entire trial transcript, and because the facts were so ex- ceptional, the students wrote, the decision “does not appear to be a significant departure away from victims’ rights.” Grace Mattern, an official of the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Abuse, said she had heard no reports that the Souter decision had made it harder on rape victims testifying in court. “What we find most disturbing is that Judge Souter made a distinction between pub- lic and private behavior. I can see why in this case all the evidence should have been admis- sible. But by going on to specify a distinction between public and private behavior, he is playing into old stereotypes, that the woman asked for it.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 5, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Buyer of failed S&Ls denies trying to mislead feds By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — An Arizo- na businessman testified Mon- day that he never intended to mislead federal officials who sold him 15 insolvent savings and loan institutions in Texas in an alleged sweetheart deal that some lawmakers want to overturn. James M. Fail admitted to the Senate Judiciary antitrust sub- committee that he signed an in- complete statement regarding past trouble with the law. It left out information that one of his in- surance companies had pleaded guilty to fraud in Alabama, a fact that would have disqualified him as a purchaser. “Tt might be construed as be- ing incomplete,” Mr. Fail testi- fled, explaining that he often signs papers his staff prepares without first reading the con- tents. “These forms were not pre- sented with the intention to mis- lead,” he said, adding that he as- sumed his lawyer at the time had given the information to federal officials by word of mouth. The subcommittee is investi- gating the December 1988 sale of the S&Ls, which Mr. Fail merged into a single institution he calls Bluebonnet Savings Bank of Dal- las, as a bad and possibly illegal deal in which the government lost millions of dollars, Regulators testified last week that they would not have ap- proved the deal had they known of the guilty plea. Mr. Fail bought the 15 S&Ls for a total of $120 million, he said, of which he used only $1,000 of his own money. He paid the initial $70 million around the time of purchase; the final $25 million installment is due by the end of this year. The federal government will spend $3 billion to subsidize the sale, with the money going for things such as paying off credi- tors of the defunct S&Ls or pay- ing Mr. Fail for managing un- profitable properties the institu- tions owned. Mr. Fail said he doesn’t yet have financing for the final $25 million he owes, but he insisted he would have no trouble round- ing up the funds. He made the initial payment partially through a $35 million loan from Banker’s Lite Insur- ance of Chicago. But lawmakers revealed Monday that at the time federal regulators approved the deal, Mr. Fail presented only what Sen. Howard M. Metzen- baum (D-Ohio) called “a wishy- washy letter” that said the loan still was subject to negotiations on key terms. “It just would appear that somehow the deal was greased to James M. Fail bought 15 S&Ls from the gov- ernment for a to- tal of $120 mil- lion, only $1,000 of which was his own money. go, and you had the lubricant,” said Mr. Metzenbaum, the com- mittee chairman. He was referring to lobbyist Robert Thompson, who repre- sented Mr. Fail in the transac- tion. Mr. Thompson was an aide to George Bush when Mr. Bush was vice president. Mr. Metzen- baum has tried to show that the deal was a bad one for the gov- ernment and was politically ex- pedited by Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson has refused to respond to subpoenas to testify before the committee. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 7, 1990 \f"
