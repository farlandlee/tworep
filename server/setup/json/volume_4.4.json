        "ocr_text": "ve Wallace By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Few optimistic tones crept into Gov. George C. Wallace's quiet reaction to his fourth straight primary loss in North Carolina Tuesday night, as the governor merely promised to continue seeking the Democratic presidential nomination In a press conference here, Wallace repeatedly cited the ideological vic- tory he has won Democrats to the center of the spect- rum, but would not predict any ballot- ing victories in the some 26 states yet to hold primaries. “I have no excuses,\"’ Wallace said when asked why former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter won the North Carolina vote by a much wider margin than ex- pected. At the time Wallace met with the media Carter was leading by 20 percentage points in the state Wallace swept in 1972. Asked the effect this loss would have on his future chances, Wallace said: “It certainly doesn’t help. It doesn’t do your campaign any good to lose.”’ “Naturally your chances diminish have admitted they are changing tac- tics. National Campaign Director Charles Snider said earlier this week that the former heavy reliance on ral- lies will be largely abandoned in favor of more media exposure through non- paid television and radio appear- ances. He admitted the rallies have tended to draw voters who already are Wall- ace\"’ supporters, failing to get the gov- ernor’s message across to the gray mass of undecided Democrats who of- ten tip the voting balance. ‘We have been monopolizing his in bringing. other we Has “I went to the well enough that all the rest came to the same well...1 just didn’t get quite as much water.” —Wallace each time you lose a primary,”’ Wal- lace responded when asked whether he believed he still might win the Democratic nomination. The governor would not flatly state he will continue his faltering cam- paign until the July convention in New York City, saying only, ‘‘As it stands now, yes.” “At least by staying in... I'll keep them all , honest,’’ Wallace said, re- ferring to the retreat from liberal stands other candidates have made since perceiving an electorate more attuned to ideological moderation. He said time and again that his oppo- nents have stolen his positions, have taken the issues that brought Wallace unexpected primary victories four years ago, before the assassination at- tempt took him from the race. Wallace said it ‘‘may be true’’ that time at these rallies when we could have been actually exposing him and giving him time to elaborate on the is- sues through the media,”’ Snider said. Despite Snider's emphasis that free media exposure will cost far less than the elaborate rallies, and despite the large bloc of layoffs, neither cam- paign aides nor the governor have ad- mitted to money problems. Another change expected is taking the campaign to smaller towns for more informal appearances, where Wallace can speak more directly to the people and have more personal con- Se INo Excuses he has ‘‘gone to the well’” too many times in repeatedly mounting national campaigns. “I went to the well enough that all the rest came to the same well,” he said. ‘I just didn't get quite as much water.\"' He suggested that Carter ‘‘is using the same dipper, but he has a bigger mouth.\"’ Although Wallace did intersperse his comments and answers with quiet jokes occasionally, his old fighting spirit and aggressive style were muted by tones of resignation to de- feat. His four defeats to date have prompted extensive shuffling in the campaign apparatus once boasted as a well-oiled, highly organized machine. Wallace admitted Tuesday night that some 35 staffers have been laid off, but said that action came because their primary duties of getting dele- gate candidates on the ballots had been completed. He would not discuss specifics of oth- er changes in personnel or in his cam- paign style, although aides readily tact, according to Press Secretary Bil- lie Joe Camp. Despite the changes, Wallace still characterized his battle for the nomi- nation as ‘‘an uphill fight.\"’ The gover- nor said he hopes to win in Wisconsin, where he begins campaigning Friday for the April 6 primary there. He refused to say whether he ever would support the nomination of Jim- my Carter, the man who has been his major opponent and has raised the heights of that hill Wallace must climb to reach the victory at the top.

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Renews Diversion Battle By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer After a five-month cease-fire, skirmishing began again Wednesday in the battle between the Wallace Ad- ministration and state teachers over spending educa- tion money. Gov. George C. Wallace announced in a press confer- ence here he will attempt to divert some $20 million from traditional state needs. Although that is about $10 million less than the admin- istration succeeded in rechanneling last year, the teach- ers’ chief spokesman vowed the Alabama Education Association will maintain a hard line of opposition to any diversion. ‘‘We fought attempts to take the $30 million last year, and we’ll fight attempts to take any this year,’’ said Dr. Paul Hubbert, AEA executive secretary. Hubbert scheduled a press conference for 10 a.m. Thursday for a fuller’ response to Wallace’s not unexpected declara- tion. - Wallace also announced Wednesday there will be no funding crisis in state government this year, as legisla- tive fiscal advisers have predicted. The governor said austerity moves he initiated last November in state departments under his control have eliminated the deficit that would have materialized due to the legislature’s ‘‘overappropriating’’ funds in the 1975 regular session. Acting Finance Director James R. Solomon said later the administration. had expected a possible $4 million deficit, but the spending reductions have saved between $3 million and $5 million. Although no deficit now is anticipated, Wallace said few departments or agencies will receive increased budgets for the 1976-77 fiscal year and most will have to reduce spending. The governor pointed several barbs at the Alabama Senate for refusing to reserve the $40 million he re- quested last year, saying failure to take preventive ac- tion has prompted the present frantic search for ways to cut back expenses. “TI told them, don’t wait until you run out of money to start saving,’' Wallace said. ‘‘So I say to them now, work hard .. . thrash around and find some savings.”’ He refused to express an opinion on Lt. Gov. Jere Beas- ley’s probe of state departments, an effort to streamline government costs. education programs to finance other Advertiaes Photo by Dean Smith Solomon (Left), Wallace Discuss Budget ~ “I'm not sure what anyone’s doing,” Wallace said of Beasley's investigations. ‘‘I know only one person with (such) constitutional duties and authority (and that) is the governor of Alabama.\"’ Wallace said the only arm of government that will re- ceive an influx of new dollars under his budget proposal is the Board of Corrections, but he skirted the question of whether prison funding will be sufficient to meet the federal court order to overhaul the prison system. Solomon later confirmed that, saying he expects most additional prison money will be channelled into the hir- ing of new personnel, including guards and profes- sionals mandated in the court order. “The money will be appropriated in such a manner that they (prison officials) will have some flexibility,” he said. Solomon said there will be no new capital outlay mon- ey for prisons or education, neither the universities nor public schools. He also said spending reductions will be proposed for the various branches of education, but would not specify amounts or where the cutbacks will be attempted. That could make the education fund diversion fight even more strenuous this year. The teachers bitterly opposed taking the $30 million in 1975, but at least their defeat was softened by $1,000 an- nual salary increases and several improvements in _ re- tirement benefits. Although Solomon flatly stated teacher benefits will remain at the same level, he would not make a definitive comment on. salaries. Last year the legislature awarded state employes a two-step pay raise of $500 this year and $500 next. Solo- mon said the budget does include the second half of the increase for state workers. “I'm not sure about the teachers,\"’ he said. doesn't look good.” Last year the diversion included spending $19 million of education money on Partlow School for the mentally retarded, and Solomon said this again will be proposed.

I think its very good for the country.” Is that enough for a politician, to have ac- complished that? “It’s not enough for me because I was a bona fide candidate in my heart and mind.

        "ocr_text": "Is Glad With Role Of Restoring Party By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Whiling away the hours squatting in the shade of the cotton gin, sharecropper Jim Phillips impressed upon the lad George Wallace that fine clothes and a luxurious lifestyle might be nice, but that the price tag on freedom was a dearer one. “America is the greatest country in the world. I'd fight for her anywhere,” Wallace occasionally quotes Phillips as saying when he reminisces about Barbour County childhood. Even dirt-poor farmers like Phillips didn’t let the De- pression crush their pride in country, and he wasn’t the only man fiercely committed to his land, the adult Wal- lace recalls. The South of his childhood was peopled with the poor but proud, farmers and storekeepers who hardly could keep grits and greens on their tables, but wouldn’t — dream of taking handouts or blaming the government for their misfortunes. When Rural Free Delivery mail was initiated, Wal- lace describes Barbour Countians as reluctant to use the service for fear it would bankrupt the government, This pride in region was imparted to the boy, as well. When Mozelle Wallace sent her oldest son to the store, George would read the labels on the cans to find food- stuffs grown and processed in Alabama or Georgia or Tennessee, plucking those from the shelves rather than goods imported from some far away northern factory. Even then, Wallace says, as a boy of only eight or nine - years, he held a vague notion of economics and the fi- nancial plight of the South. “I thought that might help a little,” he says of the scrupulous shopping technique, having known some- how during those formative years that the South was getting a raw deal from somebody. He knew about politics, too, that politicians were re- spected and popular and had the power to make things change. Again as a boy, Wallace remembers his father lifting him over a casket to view an elderly descendent of plan- tation patriarchs now sunk to ignominious poverty, but laid out in an unaccustomed suit and tie, his handlebar moustache waxed to a sheen. “He looks just like a senator,” the elder Wallace said in awe to his child, who stared in disbelief at the dead man he had known only as an overalled tiller of soil. Later, as an adult, those experiences would help mold him into a politician with a philosophy expressed in the slogans: ‘‘Stand Up For America.’’ ‘‘Trust The People.” But the years that intervened between catchy politi- cal phrases and the patriotism and poverty of a rural, Deep South childhood brought some darker influences to bear on Wallace. The idealism of a strong nation with a strong people committed to the work ethic was perverted along the way by the strident racism Wallace exploited to get himself into office and keep himself in the public eye. When he left the borders of Alabama to take the mes- sage of his people across the county, the message was more than simple conservatism. His past virulent at- tacks on all integration attempts made every word a symbol of hatred and discontent, rather than of a move- ment back to the old virtues, Wallace said he wanted to gain acceptance and re- spect for his people who had been downtrodden since the time a century ago when they tried to splinter them- selves from the rest of the nation. What he found in the votes garnered in Michigan and ° Massachusetts and Maryland seems not so much ac- ceptance of the Southern way as the fear and the mean- ness of spirit of those northern whites who in 1968 and 1972 were undergoing the same social trauma his people at home already had survived and were beginning to overcome, It wasn’t only racism he carried in his campaign, and people did find an agreeable emotional outlet in Wal- lace’s tirades against bureaucrats, taxes, federal con- trols, the rich and the freeloaders. But by 1976 the race issue has subsided as a viable po- litical vehicle, and other candidates from other places have adopted the same kinds of Middle America themes that boosted Wallace’s vote counts in earlier years, Wallace himself refuses to publicly recognize race as a basis of his 1976 campaign, but now all his other issues are gone, usurped by those without the taint of segrega- tionism marring their reputations. He is losing, perhaps lost, but Wallace says he is glad to have helped reverse the leftward leanings of the Democratic leadership that felled the party four years ago. He is glad to again have raised those childhood vir- tues to respectability. Wallace raised them without respectability, however, on the same flagpole that carried banners such as those of the Ku Klux Klan. Wallace was right that the country secks a return to moderation, and though there are oth- er reasons — his health, the blemishes on his record as long-time governor of Alabama — his political record precludes him from being the standard bearer of the - March 28, 1976 \f"

Bravo! for you, Mr. Martin! How re- freshing it is to read the truth about ‘Governor’? Wallace's political she- nanigans, about his unchanged bigo- try and his shocking indifference to the awful conditions that exist in the state’s prisons. You have my special admiration for your zeal and honesty in reporting Wallace's political abuses (as both governor and candidate) to those of us who live in the capital itself; for it takes much more courage to face up to wrongdoings that are close at hand. Keep up the good work, Mr. Martin, keep on telling us the truth about Mr. Wallace and others of his kind, be- cause I really believe (Praise God!) that more people are listening now. And, who knows, maybe some day Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream of peace and brotherhood and justice for all will yet come true. Incidentally, I am a native South- erner (born in North Carolina) and I have lived in the South all my life with the exception of three short military tours my husband served in the mid- west. So I feel sufficiently knowl- edgeable about this part of the country to say that I believe there is a New South and that people like yourself, Mrs. Criswell, and Ms. Kunstel have helped to make it happen. How good it is after the senseless violence and hatred of the past, to be able to feel a new mood of reason and tolerance starting, slowly but surely, to prevail. How good it is to start to feel proud of my southern heritage and hopeful (instead of fearful) about the future. PAULA M. COCKBURN Gunter AFS Montgomery March 29, 1976 \f"

Wallace's once penetrating thrust to- ward the presidency will be diminished to a token push by Wednesday, when the campaign loses another two- tid fs pad staff and 4 of the $0 per cent of out-of-state offices are shuttered, The decision to make drastic reductions came prior to results of the Wisconsin and New York Democratic pri- maries Tuesday night; according to campaign Director Charles §, Snider, and was spurred by money problems “There's no way anybody would ever consider that he'd pull out,” Snider said. “Everr if he has to sit here in Montgomery and just talk to the press once in a while.” Besides closing most of the campaign offices scat- lered across the country and whacking another 60 work- vers from the payroll—leaving 30 fulltime paid stafy fers—Snider also is attempting to unload the expensive campaign jet leased by contract through August 7. The base payment is $47,000 a month. plus costs of pi- lots and fuel, and Snider said he now is negotiating a sub-leasing deal with officials in Ronald Reagan's cam- paign for the GOP presidential nomination. Snider said chances are ‘'50-50' that Reagan will as- sume the obligation, which not only would relieve the Wallace campaign of leasing and operating costs, but also would mean the return of the $150,000 deposit and part of the §32,700 in insurance premiums that Reagan would pick up. The national headquarters leased in Montgomery's downtown Executive Building also will be contracted to accommodate the staff streamlining, with one entire floor of offices eliminated. Snider said the new cutbacks, coupled with similar, less drastic reductions following the devastating North Carolina loss (wo weeks ago when 36 staff members were fired, will reduce overhead costs from the one: time high of some $250,000 a month to about $50,000 monthly. - That does not include campaign travel and paid that cannot be significantly alleviated for weeks, if ever, Snider said Tuesday afternoon the Wallace campaign has between $150.00) and $200,000 in cash on hand, but has almost exactly the same amount in outstanding bills A new mail solicitation for donations—already fun- ded—goes out to some 150,000 past contributors this week, and Snider said he hopes to see a net return of some $100,000. In addition, he said the campaign will seek some $300,000) In matching government funds if the * media promotions. So, what will the remaining 30 regular staffers do? About six or eight, including the governor's son George Wallace Jr., who is a paid staff member, will work as field coordinators for the remaining 22 pri- maries. although they apparently seldom will get out into the field. Mostly through telephone calls, they are expected to coordinate volunteer efforts, make arrangements for the limited out-of-state stumping Wallace can afford. and place media advertising, when it can be financed Snider maintained the most expensive and time-con- suming part of a national presidential cam- paign—getting delegate candidates on the ballots—now is over, so the remaining need to promote the man him- self won't be impaired by the substantial reductions. The first priority for money not required in overhead expenses will be “putting the governor and the neces- sary staff in the states’’ for special appearances and free media interviews, Snider said, and any additional funds will pay for media advertising. Despite the announcement of major cutbacks in his finan- clally troubled presidential campaign, Wallace said Tuesday that he was “elated” with his third-place showing in the Wisconsin primary and intends to remain in the race through the convention.\" “I'm eldted,” said Wallace of his distant third-place finish behind Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona and former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter. \"I got no delegates in 1972, and it ears I'll receive 10 this time.” Federal Elections Commission is reinstated by Con- gress in the next few weeks. “The biggest thing at this point was mot to go into debt,\" Snider said, “That was the governor's decision and | concurred.” . When Wallace suddenly was eliminated from 1972 presidential politics by five bullets from the gun of an at- tempted assassin, the campaign owed $720,000 that was not repaid until last year. Despite the severe financial problems and wide- spread curtailment of campaign activity, Snider main- tained Gov. Wallace will not quit the race until the die ir- revocably is cast at the Democratic National Con- vention in July. “At this time in 1972, I had 75 delegates, and we presently have 104 after Wisconein,” Wallace awaited the results of the Wisconsin balloting at the Governor's Mansion and later spoke by telephone with reporters gathered at his national campaign headquarters here. Only a few Wallace delegates ran in the New York primary. Hours after his campaign director, Snider announced a massive cutback of personnel, Wallace sald he would continue to be an active candidate. “I'm in the race through the conventir 1 and will be partici- paling in other primaries.” Snider said the campaign has fired all but 30 of its employes, cut off financing for some 40 of its 50 offices and is* trying to unload an airplane that costs some $100,000 a month to operate. Of the remaining 22 states holding primaries through June, Snider said “active campaigning will take place in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Indiana. Mary- land, Michigan, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Cali- fornia, New Jersey and Ohio, Those are the states where Wallace hopes to make one or two appearances, and where paid advertising will be concentrated. The days of hitting the hustings on a daily basis, as when Wallace sped through Massachusetts, Florida, {1- linois and North Carolina, only to be spurned by the ma- Jority of voters, are over for the governor and his staff.

        "ocr_text": "Wallace May Use Remaining Power At Convention By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The irony of Gov. George C. Wallace's political state of affairs in 1976 has been expanded to yet another di- mension, The one-time fiery advocate of open politics and zealous battler against back-room dealing is as- suming the role of the old time pol who brokers his sup- port to the most attractive bidder. As the primary losses began mounting, most observ- ers expected Wallace to travel that route toward the Democratic National Convention in July—although a few thought he would simply drop out of contention—but it wasn't until last week that the governor admitted such intentions. Wallace conceded weeks ago that his chances of win- ning the presidential nomination were slim at best, but queried as to exactly what his role at the convention would be, the governor returned only vague responses. Last Wednesday, however, Wallace expressed the be- lief that no one would arrive at the New York City con- vention site with sufficient delegate strength to wrest the nomination from the other contenders. “Ina close race, my delegates will be a factor,\" Wal- lace said. Just as Wallace occasionally flexes his biceps to show doubters his physical durability, he apparently hopes to flex a little political muscle come July to show the un- converted that the Wallace constituency still holds up. Should Wallace continuing plucking a few delegates here and there, and the other candidates continue divid- ing delegations among themselves, the governor well could become a force to reckon with in New York. That's some chancey ifs, plus a new factor or two could scramble the scenario that now keeps Wallace Striving for primary votes. But, if the present trend holds, George Wallace could be courted at the convention as intensely as another George well-known for his back-room confer- ences-George Meany of labor fame. That is a strange position indeed for the man who just months ago ranted against the political veil shrouding the state convention method of selecting delegates. That was during the campaign preliminaries, when Wallace undertook his mini-campaign to retain or in- itiate the primary method in states where the issue was being debated. Then he challenged state legislators to open up'the system, to let the people make their clear and direct choice by ballot, by the most democratic means possible. Many of them accepted that challenge, but it didn’t help Wallace much. Now, admitting he has scant chance of being the nom- inee, Wallace tells his supporters not to lose faith, but to send him to New York anyway to send their message to the party—which he will deliver into the appropriate lap upon arrival. That may be a somewhat heavy-handed view of the Wallace strategy, considering those die-hard suppor- ters who do vote for the governor probably trust him to negotiate their votes into a proper return, whether in the form of platform planks or other influence, a return they otherwise might not realize by marking their bal- lots for a candidate who presently seems more viable. That is the strategy, however, and, as ironic as it might be, it is what some persons close to him charac: terize as essentially the only way for George Wallace to make his last big hurrah on on the national scene. They say it is the only graceful exit, that simply call- ing the battle lost now without a final show of force- -Without that last flex—would hardly be a desirable way to cap a career in national politics that has spanned dec- ades. While some Wallace confidants reportedly hold hopes that the governor will once again abandon the Demo- crats after the convention to ride out the year on the third party machine, others see that not only as an im- Possible dream, but rather as a nightmare that would totally discredit Wallace and the respectability he has acquired as a spokesman of many and a political ba- rometer that other leaders read for guidance. The third party would be a dying gasp, they say, one that would garner little support now and lead to no where in November. Going into the convention with a bloc of delegates to barter and bargain with this sum- mer at least would retain him a place in the party of his first allegiance, “He doesn't want to be another Shorty Price or Big Jim Folsom,\" said one aide, referring to Alabama's perennial candidates who generate little more than gig: gles on the one hand, or sighs of sorrow on the other that espected man has come to this.

        "ocr_text": "Carter’s Statement Assailed By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The leader of the state’s major black political organization, already hostile to Jimmy Carter's presidential bid, urged Alabama blacks Tuesday to withhold support of Carter unless he ‘comes up with a better explanation of why he wants segregated neighbor- hoods.”’ Joe Reed, president of the Alabama Democratic . Conference, said Carter's recent espousal of ‘ethnic purity’ of neighborhoods is as bad as Gov. George C. Wallace's one-time activ- ism on behalf of segregated schools. “There's not a dime’s worth of dif- ference,” Eeed said. The strong attack on Carter came despite the former Georgia governor's apology for using the term, and re- peated statements that he opposes segregation and believes in open hous- ing policies. Carter initially stated he opposed federal government attempts to dilute ‘ethnic purity’’ of neighborhoods. “I would think it would be hard for the black Carter delegates to justify themselves supporting a man who be- lieves in ethnic purily of neighbor- hoods,'’ Reed said. ‘People should have a right to live whergver they want.”’ Reed's ADC, the black caucus of the Alabama Democratic Party, already was hostile to the Carter forces here for qualifying black candidates in sev- eral primarily black districts where ADC backed candidates are running for delegate positions. The presence of two black candi- dates in a district will split the black votes, probably giving an advantage to Wallace delegate candidates. The ADC candidates are running un- committed to any presidential hope- ful, but are seen leaning toward U.S. Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, who is not a declared candidate. “We think it’s not good business for the black community to get obligated to anybody before the convention,” Reed said. ‘It's not healthy.”’ Blacks supported by the ADC are running in six of the 27 delegate dis- tricts, but Reed said the conference will endorse other uncommitted dele- gate candidates at its annual meeting later this month. The AUC likely will look for other candidates amenable to a Humphrey nomination, whether black or. white. Reed said the ADC delegates elected in the May 4 primary would have been more open to dealing with Carter at the convention had the Carter cam- paign here not opposed the ADC candi- dates, Reed admitted Carter has as much right as the ADC to field a slate of can- didates in Alabama. “I respect their right to run,” he said, “but they have to recognize my right to oppose his slate.”’ April 14, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Reagan Repeats Ford Criticisms By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The written theme was ‘‘America We Love You,” but the spoken mes- sage was kick the bums out of Wash- ington, as GOP presidential hopeful Ronald Reagan swung his campaign entourage through four Alabama cities Thursday. A crowd of some 300 supporters greeted the former California gover- nor at Montgomery's Dannelly Field and endorsed his words with repeated outbreaks of applause and cheering. They obviously wanted more than the half-hour outdoor rally alloted for the Montgomery appearance, despite the sweltering sun that dropped one young supporter to the pavement. “I’m delighted to see your state hav- ing this primary where the people can cross-over in the primary,’’ Reagan said, referring to the May 4 ballotting when Alabamians may vote either on the Republican or Democratic ticket, regardless of their party registration. Later in Clanton, where Reagan spoke at a high school football stadium rally to some 900 cheering onlookers, he again made a pitch for a cross-over vote in the traditionally Democratic and Conservative state, apparently hoping to appeal to the constituency of Gov. George C. Wallace. Reagan said he hoped the crowd con- tained not just Republicans, but ‘‘a lot of Democrats and Independents who want something better out of life,” adding later that he believed there still are many Americans ‘‘looking for a cause around which to rally. I believe we can provide that.” Reagan and opponent President Gerald Ford each have fielded a full x ee Advertiser Photes by ‘Allen Cansoa RONALD REAGAN April 23, 1976 > \fReagan slate of 37 candidates for delegate to the GOP National Convention in Au- gust. The race has been viewed as a close one here, but earlier this week Rogers C.B. Morton, Ford's campaign chair- man, said he believed Reagan might be leading in Alabama and in Georgia. Reagan made no new pronounce- ments during the Montgomery ap- pearance, repeating many of the same criticisms of Ford and the Washington establishment that he issued in a re- cent network television speech. He noted some have said there is little difference between himself and the president and have promoted ‘*sticking with the status quo—that’'s Latin for the mess we're in.”’ There are differences, he said, the main one being that ‘‘one of us has been a member of the Washington es- tablishment almost his entire adult life. I've spent most of my adult life out in the private sector.\" On domestic issues, Reagan said the government never will pull the nation out of recession or lick inflation by in- creasing the debt $95 million a year. In initial remarks and in responses to au- dience questions he repeated con- tentions that federal programs, in- cluding food stamps and aid to educa- tion, should be handled on the state and local level, not by the federal gov- ernment. He also had harsh words for the ad- ministration’s foreign policy, partic- ularly regarding the Panama Canal and defense spending. ‘President Ford said we'd never give up our defense of the operation of the Panama Canal,’ Reagan said, but then it became known administration spokesmen were negotiating to give up that defense. Ford said Thursday that calling for an end to negotiations would be irres- ponsible and would provoke bloodshed in Panama. ‘Two weeks ago he was saying we weren't going to do it. Now he’s saying there will be bloodshed if we don’t do it,\" Reagan charged. On the defense budget, Reagan ad- mitted President Ford ‘has asked a very irresponsible Congress for more money.’ But, he added, he does not believe the President has shown the lead- Advertener Photo by Jerry Senith Officer Scans Reagan’s Security Area at Dannelly Field ership that would spur the public to de- mand more defense spending. Reagan spoke here atop a_ tradition- al flat-bed truck base draped with bun- ting, the flag, and the sign: ‘*America We Love You.” The other requisites for a southern political rally also were present—the combo playing ‘‘Dixie,’’ the cute little blond-headed girl adorned with the hat and buttons and sash bearing the can- didate’s name, and the local digni- taries. The introductions were made by Montgomery County Commission Chairman Bill Joseph. a Reagan- pledged candidate for delegate, who likely was shades away from a heart attack when the microphone’ system failed moments before Reagan's plane eased up to the speaking platform. It was fixed and he spoke, then was whisked away to a local television sta- tion for a limited press conference, where representatives of the print media were barred from asking ques- tions. Prior to the Montgomery appear- ance, Reagan spoke to some 400 sup- porters at a Mobile Citizens for Rea- gan luncheon, then after visiting the Capitol City he sped on to Clanton for a rally at the high school. He made brief remarks Thursday night at a GOP dinner in Birmingham, where he will hold a press conference Friday morning April 23, 1976 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace To Stump In State ‘By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Amidst quiet predictions that he might not receive a majority of the popular vote in Alabama, Gov. George C. Wallace suddenly has scheduled nearly a week of campaign activities in his own home state. The personal campaign appear- | ances, announced only Monday and beginning Tuesday, will be supple- . mented with media advertising in- . cluding new television spots report- edly taped Monday morning. Sources indicated there was no doubt that Wallace would stump his fa- miliar haunts in Alabama, although some question had existed until Mon- day afternoon over how much time he should devote at home, considering the other presidential primaries being held around the same time as Ala- bama’s May 4 balloting. The possibility of losing the popular vote here may have contributed to the decision to spend at least a portion of each day in Alabama between Tues- day and the following Monday, the day before the primary. Few have suggested Wallace might win less than a majority of the 27 Ala- bama delegates to the Democratic Na- tional Convention to be selected in the primary, but long-time~ observers of the state political scene have pre- dicted over the past week that the gov- ernor might emerge from the contest here with a minority of the ballots cast in his favor. That would be possible since some delegate districts, particularly in the predominantly black urban districts, are expected to vote heavily anti-Wal- lace. The anti-Wallace votes there and elsewhere, however, are expected to be split mostly between delegate can- didates running uncommitted to any Democratic presidential hopeful and those pledging support to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter. That would edt away at Wallace’s -popular vote, but still leave him a ma-. jority of the delegates. Another eight convention delegates will be chosen by the State Democratic Executive Com- mittee on the basis of the primary re- sults. According to the schedule an- nounced Monday afternoon, Wallace is to hold two press conferences in In- diana Tuesday morning, then travel back to Alabama for a Birmingham session with news reporters that after- noon. Two appearances in Texas are planned for later that day. The governor will be in his Capitol office most of Wednesday and hold a rally in Alexandria. La., that night. On Thursday Wallace will make an 11 a.m. industrial announcement- campaign appearance in Monroeville. traveling from there to Georgia for two more campaign stops in Columbus and Savannah. The Georgia primary also is May 4. He will finish the day with a 6:30 p.m. rally at the Springdale Plaza Shopping Center in Mobile. Friday’s schedule begins in Atlanta, Ga., followed by a trip to Augusta, then the governor returns to Alabama once more for rallies at the Southgate Mall in Muscle Shoals at 2 p.m. and at an as yet undetermined site in Tuscaloosa at 6:30 p.m. On Saturday Wallace has rallies in Anniston at 11 a.m. at the Quintard Mall, in Gadsden’s Argicola Shopping Center at 1:30 p.m., the Northside Mall in Dothan at 4:30 pm. and the Park- way City Shopping Center in Hunt- sville at 6:30 p.m. The governor is scheduled to make welcoming remarks Sunday at the Winston 500 race in Talladega. His last Alabama campaign appearance is at noon Monday at the First Monday trade day in Scottsboro. He also is to campaign that day in Georgia and Indiana, then participate Monday night, May 3, at the League of Women Voters Presidential Forum in Chicago. The League has sponsored a series of issues questioning sessions throughout the nation. on a regional basis. This is the first Wallace has at- tended, although all candidates have been asked to appear at each forum. A Wallace spokesman said the Ala- bama campaign tour was prompted by “the general feeling that some interest needs to be generated throughout the state.\"’ not just in the Democratic presidential contest, but in the election overall.

        "ocr_text": "AEA Ads Attack Funds Diversion By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Education Associ- ation is mounting a professional, hard- hitting and apparently expensive cam- paign to ward off education fund diver- sion again this year, one that also has become tied to the presidential politics of Gov. George C. Wallace. Radio advertising aimed at gener- ating opposition to Wallace's budget proposal has run five times a day on the state's ten largest stations for the past week, with a new ad scheduled to begin Thursday morning. On Monday AEA Executive Secre- tary Paul Hubbert will deliver what is being termed ‘‘a major political news Statement,’’ where the teachers’ or- ganization is expected to reveal re- sults of polls taken in Alabama by the Quayle-Plesser Co. of New York City, one of the foremost polling firms in the nation. The polls most likely involve public attitudes toward education spending and the administration pro- posal to use some $20 million of educa- tion money for traditionally non-edu- cation purposes. . Dr. Hubbert refused to comment on specifics of the polls, but said he has been ‘‘encouraged\" by public reaction ’ AEA's stand against the budget plan. Nor would Hubbert say how much the association is spending on its cam- paign, maintaining large amounts are not being used. The movement is not solely the work of AEA, however, but is being profes- sionally coordinated by Viewpoint En- _terprises of Montgomery, the political ad agency gaining increasing respect for its handling of election campaigns, including that of Mississippi Gov. Cliff Finch last year. The radio spot aired over the past week features a little girl complaining to her father about poor conditions in school—such as lack of air condi- tioning and sharing of school books. The disclaimer at the end states the ad is a message ‘‘brought to you by my teacher.”’ The effort is not being ignored by the Wallace administration. Acting Finance Director James R. Solomon said Wednesday he has asked Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley whether the dis- claimer—which indicates the spot is a political ad—meets legal require- ments for identifying paid political ad- vertising. It is questionable whether the elec- tion law to which Solomon referred ap- plies in this case, since the budget is- sue is not on the ballot, but is a legisla- tive matter. What will be on the ballot Tues- day—one day after Hubbert's press conference—are the races for dele- gates to the Democratic National Con- vention pitting candidates supporting Wallace against those pledged to for- mer Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter and those not committed formally to any presidential aspirant. Hubbert said his Monday announce- ment is not intended to affect the primary election outcome, but is di- rected toward the opening day of the summer's legislative session, which also is Tuesday. The AEA, however, has assumed a role in some delegate contests, with lo- cal teachers working for Carter dele- gate candidates in about eight dis- tricts around the state. Hubbert has maintained there is no formal, organ- ized effort to aid the Carter campaign and to fight Wallace, but that in some areas teachers have decided to par- ticipate of their own volition. Some delegate candidates pledged to Wallace, including members of the legislature, have shown bitterness over AEA’s participation in the prima- ry, as well as concern over it's effect. Wallace himself finally agreed Mon- day to make extensive campaign ap- pearances in the state, according to sources close to the governor, after aides convinced him his Alabama strength was eroding. The governor has attempted to min- imize the effect his budget plan will have on public education in Alabama, saying primary and secondary school spending will not be reduced in his budget, but will be slightly increased. That apparently is an effort to count- er AEA's campaign, which has includ- ed distributing information to local of- ficials outlining what spending cut- backs might be required under the Wallace budget proposal. AEA has not stated reductions definitely will be made, but has detailed dollar amount cutbacks that possibly could be made for individual school systems in the ad- ministration’s budget.

        "ocr_text": "Carter Draws Overflow Crowd By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer BIRMINGHAM — Democratic pres- idential aspirant Jimmy Carter pre- dicted Friday he could beat Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace in a head-to- head confrontation here, but said he expects to win only about one third of the state's delegates under the ‘‘com- plicateJ\"’ Alabama primary system. During a press conference prior to an overflowing rally at Birmingham- Southern College, the former Georgia governor also said he will welcome the support of Wallace and his delegates at the July nominating convention. Carter did not say he would solicit a Wallace endorsement, or that of any other present or former presidential candidate. Carter's visit to Alabama, his first since before the primary season be- gan, was limited to the one Magic City stop and came just four days before the state's Tuesday balloting. Aides here said Carter, the front- runner of the Democratic pack, chose to limit his time in Alabama since the state sends so few delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Ala- bama delegates will number 35. Carter also indicated Friday he ex- pects no overwhelming success in Ala- bama because it is mot ‘‘a clear cut race between myself and Gov. Wal- lace.” In Tuesday's primary, voters will cast ballots for the delegates them- selves, not for the presidential candi- date to whom they are pledged. The last name of presidential aspirants will. be listed below those of delegate candidates. Carter did say he believe he has ‘a good chance to win one-third or more of the delegates’ here. Carter supporters in Alabama have wooed the black, anti-Wallace vote by running black delegates and broad- casting ads on soul stations citing the former governor's records on civil Tights issues and the fact that his daughter attends public schools and has a black teacher. Although Carter mentioned some of the same facts during his rally speech, few blacks were in the packed au- diences af some. 1,500 people. Most ap- peared to be students or middle to up- per class adults, In rally remarks Carter emphasized that he is a southerner and neighbor to Alabama voters. ‘We're close to you in Georgia. We've shared a lot of history’’’ He said. ‘‘At first people said the nation would never vote for a president from the South. I think the people . have been under estimated and the prej- udice over estimated.” Carter also made the following com- ments during his rally speech that lasted about 45 minutes: —He has defeated every other can- didate seeking the Democratic presi- dential nomination and sees no major opposition in the primaries ahead, al- though he does not believe he will have sufficient deiegate strength to win the Nomination on the first ballot. —The nation's income tax structure is a “disgrace to the human race,” with no hidden loopholes for the com- mon laborer but many for the rich. —Only 10 per cent of the 12 million people now on welfare abuse it, and the rest should be “treated with love and respect.” The present welfare system is anti-work and anti-family, and must be changed. —The federal government must guarantee the aafety of the country, but also should cut back the number of bases and troops overseas and the ad- mirals and generals in the military be- cause “the most wasteful bureau- cracy in Washington is in the Penta- on.

At his Montgomery press confer- ence, Wallace pledged to continue his presidential campaign in spite of serious financial difficulties. “‘The more delegates I go to the con- vention with, me ans the better con- vention we're going to have as far as the average citizen is concerned,’’ Wallace said in justifying his stance.

Wallace was leading in 14 of the first 16 delegate districts counted in Alabama’s presidential primary Tuesday, but runoff races were indicated in many of the total 27 districts that will send delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Car- ter was ahead only in one district in- cluding Montgomery’s West End. Tt appeared, however, that the two Southerners would face each other jy, many of those May 25 runoff contests since neither man had majority sup\" port in most of the counted districts.

The governor said he would not hay to worry about supporting U.S. Morris Udall of Arizona, maintaining Udall ‘‘has as much chance of winning the nomination as I have of jumping over the moon.’”’ : He also repeated the belief that m candidate who has not battled in the primaries will receive the Democratic nomination, an obvious reference to U.S. Sen. Hubert Humphrey. Wallace expressed confidence that he will be able to support the part: nominee, saying he believes both presidential candidate and the plat form will be found acceptable to the voters he claims to represent. Reminded that he once called Carter ‘fa warmed-over McGovern,’’ a refer- ence to the party’s liberal 1972 nomi- nee who carried only one state, Wal- lace noted that candidates sometimes “‘say things in the heat of :campaign- i ** that they later retract. 22 May 5, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Changes Stance on Taxe By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace reversed his stance against no new taxes Wednes- day night, making a surprise call for income tax increases that would be submitted to public vote and would fi- nance prison reform. In his state of the state address be- fore the Alabama Legislature, Wal- lace emphasized the tax proposal is a ‘‘progressive'’ one in which ‘‘those who make the most would pay the most.\"\" The plan would generate about $42 million of new revenue each year. and Wallace said the money initially would be used for prison improvements man- dated by the federal court here, but later would finance other government services. Aides later explained Wallace’s leg- islation will propose raising the straight 5 per cent rate on personal in- dorses the governor's proposal, as long as the people make the ultimate decision. “We probably should have gotten some input from the people before on how they want to finance their prison system. and this just might be the wav to do it,’’ McColrquodale said. In another prison-related matter, Wallace announced he will ask the leg- islature to turn over corrections con- trol to the governor of the state. con- verting the present decision-making Board of Corrections into an advisory body only. Wallace long has complained that he as governor receives blame for prison operations. but has no power to deal with the problems. Some form of legis- jJation giving the governor a voice on the prison board was expected. but his attempt to take full control came as a surprise. Wallace also tock advantage of his statewide forum—his address was broadcast live over the state’s educa- tional television system—to answer the Alabama Education Association's attacks on his budget program. The governor wants to use about $20 Related Story, Page 58 come to 6 per cent on taxable income of more than $5,000 and raising the 5 per cent corporate tax rate to 7.5 per cent. “This proposal will allow the people of the state to say whether or not they are willing to pay additional income tax in order to provide for prisons,’’ Wallace told the informal, joint gath- ering of House and Senate members. Whether the people will have an op- portunity to vote on the tax question was doubtful Wednesday night, as some Senate leaders voiced imme- diate, ardent disapproval. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, who has op- posed any tax increases, said he main- tains that stand against a tax ‘‘no mat- ter how it's proposed or what it is for.” The issue would be submitted to the people in the form of an amendment to the Alabama Constitution, and Beas- ley noted amendment referenda nor- million from the Special Education Trust Fund to finance mental health and medical education programs that traditionally have been financed from other sources. AEA has protested this will ‘divert education money from basic educa- tion functions that need greater fund- ing. and will ‘‘rip off'* elementary and secondary schools. “This is absurd and the lobbyists for the Alabama Education Association know this is not true,’' Wallace said, adding that his budget proposal does not decrease spending on those basic areas of public education. Wallace again cited education im- provements made under his adminis- tration, charging that AEA leaders ex- pect 100 per cent of their demands to be met and forget about past benefits. “They (AEA leaders) are not sup- posed to run Alabama. the elected offi- cials are.’’ he said. drawing the big- gest round of applause of his entire halfhour address to legislators and a large showing of visiting Wallace sup- porters. Wallace also outlined these propos- mauy araw 1U per cent or less or te voters. “It'll probably be defeated in the House, and if it's not defeated there, it'll definitely be defeated in the Sen- ate,”’ he said. State Sen. L.D. ‘‘Dick’’ Owen, chair- man of the Senate Finance and Tax- ation Committee, echoed Beasley's sentiments and said the tax plan has two chances of legislative approv- al—slim and none. Sen. Robert Wilson of Jasper sup- ported the tax change, however, add- ing he would endorse other revenue raising measures as well. ‘‘We cannot continue to run state government on the same revenues we received in 1971,'' Wilson said. ‘*I for one am not going to deceive the people into believing we can.\" House Speaker Joe McCorquodale, who also has spoken against new taxes, said Wednesday night he en- als in his legislative program for the 1976 session: —Utility regulating laws similar to those submitted in a special session last year. but turned down by lawmak- ers.

        "ocr_text": "Retirement System Investigation Asked By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The chairman of the state's Teacher Retirement System asked the legisla- ture to make a ‘‘full-scale in- vestigation’’ into the management of public retirement programs Tuesday, after an announcement that proposed state budgets fall $36.5 million short of keeping the systems financially sound. Also Tuesday, Gov. George C. Wal- lace sent an executive message to the legislature outlining the shortfall and ed lawmakers and the administration of his new calculations last month. In his executive message, Wallace said Bronner recently raised his initial $109 million estimate to $140 million for the teacher and state employe sys- tems, and his $1.1 million request for judicial retirement was raised to $2.6 million. The administration's budget, how- ever, does not even reflect the $109 mil- lion request, but proposes allocating only $105 million. The budget, printed early last month, also shows Bronner did request $2.6 million for the judges, despite the governor's claim to the contrary Tuesday. His budget proposal calls for the $1.1 million appropriation and adminis- tration officials said when the budget was made public last week that Wal- lace would ask the lawmakers to in- crease the amount paid into the retire- ment fund by judges in order to make up the difference between the $1.1 mil- lion he proposed and the $2.6 million Bronner_ said is needed. asking lawmakers to take some action to preserve the integrity of the retire- ment programs. He made no recom- mendations. Dr Paul Hubbert. executive secre- tary of the Alabama Education Associ- ation and chairman of the Teacher Re- tirement System Board, asked legisla- tive leaders to launch the probe into system management In a letter to Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley and House Speaker Joe McCorquodale, Hubbert questioned how cost estimates could have soared so significantly between the proposal As late as noon Tuesday, the gover- nor planned to personally appear be- fore a joint meeting of House and Sen- ate members to detail the pension fi- nancial problems, and he reportedly was ready to outline a list of recom- mendations to alleviate the money squeeze. Wallace finally decided to send the written message to lawmakers, in which he merely asked that they ‘‘re- view the entire matter’ of retirement funding and pleaded for a halt to fur- ther benefit increases. -Bronner said later Tuesday that ef- forts to characterize the increased cost estimates as a surprise are ‘‘a bunch of bunk.” He said the retirement cost estimate for budget purpose normally is up- dated in mid-year, when more exact personnel figures are available. Due to the large number of benefit increas- es last year and the tight state revenue situation, Bronner said he made the of increased pension benefits last year and the time the most recent estimates were made by Dr David Bromner, re- tirement systems administrator Hubbert said the AEA ‘‘in good faith’ asked the legislature for pen- sion improvements on the basis of Bronner’s initial, lower cost figures. Although Hubbert said he learned of the cost increase Monday, and Wal- late said the administration was in- formed of the shortfall just ‘‘within the last few days,’’ Bronner said he warn- update early ‘‘to forewarn the legisla- ture so they didn't spend every penny, knowing we'd be coming in for a major adjustment.\"’ The multimilliondollar increase was caused in part by the addition of some 25,000 new persons in the Teach- er Retirement System, he said. About half those were added be- cause up until last year state univer- sities had paid the state’s pension con- tribution for certain employes out of their operation and maintenance budgets. A little-known provision in a pension bill switched those payments to the regular retirement system. Bronner or a spokesman is to appear before the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday to explain the financing problem. Failure to appropriate the full amount Bronner says is needed would not jeopardize pension payments to re- tired employes immediately, but it would affect the amount available in future years as present employes be- gin retiring.

        "ocr_text": "By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer. Four years ago Saturday flve bullets ripped through the body of Gov. George C. Wallace, and he maintains, they punctured fatal holes in his political career. Hours after an attempted assassin failed to fully accomplish his intended goal—erippling Wallace rather than killing him-most had ex- pected they would hear little more from the boisterous Alabama governor who in recent weeks had astounded the nation with the sup- port he drew in the 1972 presidential pri- maries. For davs and months and nearly a full year after the tragedy in the Laurel, Md., shopping center parking lot, George Wallace also thought America would hear little from him again. Those predictions were wrong. America has heard again from Wallace. but her people have not responded. From the time it became apparent Wallace again would participate in presidential poli- tics in 1976. he repeatedly was queried wheth- ef his health would permit him to serve in the physically and mentally taxing job as presi- dent of the United States. His stock answers were, yes, he is in fine health—-except that he cannot walk—or, more flippantly, that at least he is only paralyzed from the waist down, while some politicians. seem numbed from the neck up. When he wasn't in a joking mood, the gover: nor's responses to those health question be- came increasingly testy as he lost one prima- ry afler another or did worse than expected in states where he should have been politically strong, where he had been strong in 1972. Sometimes Wallace still blames the media for those failures, saying news reporters con- tinually remind the volers of his disability, and television cameras focus on his wheel- chair so frequently that he wishes he'd bought stock in the company that manufactured it. When he is in a more generous mood. Wal: lace admits it is the people who question his fitness, not just the media. He also admits that health is not the only factor sending votes to May 15, 1976 other candidates, since many have moved closer to his political philosophy and usurped his base of support. Wallace’s time has come, and it has gone, in national politics. The five bullets ruined any chances he might have had in 1972, and their repercussions they spun through the years to 1976, Wallace's comments in recent days indicate he is resigned to being another voice in the Democratic Party rather than a powerful force either inside the party or working against it, That contrasts to his depressions docu- mented after earlier political losses, and some altribute the mellowness to the governor's Close brush with death. If he cannot wield pow er. at least he still is alive. On the fourth anniversary of the Laurel shooting Wallace once again is on the cam- paign trail. Where he will be on the fifth and sixth and seventh and others remains in ques- tion. In a recent interview the governor said he always will remain involved in politics in one way or another, but refused to speculate on specifies 9. He says he will not run his wile Cornelia for governor when his present terms expires in 1978-he cannot seek reelection—and thal he has no interest in seeking the U.S, Senate seat that might be’ vacated by Sen. John Spar- kman's resignation in the same year. Campaigning in Alabama earlier this month, however, Wallace did joke at each stop that the crowds were so good he just might de- “cide to run for something else. And he just might. Most political observers here expect he will make the run for the Senate, though there is disagreement over whether he could win, even in his own home state. In Alabama the people hardly are disturbed over his paralysis. They are used to it and know the man still can function as a public of- ficial in much the same way he always has functioned. If those observers predicting fail- ure are correct. it won't be failure because of the wheelchair, it will be because Wallace's time has come and gone in Alabama, too. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace, Staff Deny He’s Withdrawing By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A possible withdrawal announce- ment for next week has been flatly ruled out by Gov. George C. Wallace and his aides. The governor plans next week to take to the national air waves for a five-minute political advertisement for his presidential campaign. Neither Wallace nor his chief spokesmen will say exactly what the governor's message will be, indicating only that it is an appeal for further sup- $30,000, and said it will be broadcast here at 9:55 p.m., after the NBC mov- ie. Wallace himself indicated during an informal chat with reporters Wednes- day that he’s not yet ready to call it quits. Although he refused to give many concrete answers to questions about either his campaign or state legisla- tive matters, Wallace did express pleasure over his showing in the Ala- bama contest for delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The governor won four more dele- port in the remaining presidential pri- maries in California, Ohio and New Jersey, which all take place June 8. On Wednesday Wallace simply shook his head and said ‘‘no,” when asked whether he would withdraw or throw his delegate strength to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter in the na- tionally televised announcement. ‘Absolutely not,\" was the response of Charles S. Snider, the campaign di- rector. ‘‘It's just the opposite.\"’ Snider said the advertisement, taped this week, contains no reference to any other candidate and in no way gates in Tuesday's runoff, placing his total at 28 members of the 35-member delegation. “T won more votes (delegates) this time than I did in 1972,\"’ Wallace said, recalling he got 21 or 22 of the Alabama delegates that year. Regarding the results of the six pri- maries held Tuesday, in which he pick- ed up a total of 13 delegates from Ten- nessee, Kentucky and Arkansas, the governor said he “wasn’t surprised at the outcome of any election.” He did mot campaign at all in Ore- gon, Idaho and Nevada, and cancelled can be considered a withdrawal state- ment, During the talk Snider describes as “more of a conversational type atmos- phere, not a speech,\"’ the governor “tells why he is remaining in the race, what he hopes to accomplish.\" Snider and other aides said they will not give further specifics, because a leak might prompt some potential viewers to pass up the address. _ “We're looking for the largest view- ing audience we can get,’ Snider said. Snider estimated the cost of creating the ad and buying air time at about some scheduled appearances in the other three states where he did cam- paign. Wallace said he now has a total of 171 delegates to the July nominating con- vention, but would not say what he plans to do with them. He has given some indications that he ultimately will throw his support to Carter. Wallace still is scheduled to cam- paign in California for four days prior. to the primary, and the television ad June 5 will be broadcast during the peak of campaign activity there. May 27, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Wallace TV Appeal Based on Old Pitch By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer In a nationally-televised plea Thurs- day night for support in next Tues- day's three major presidential pri- maries, Gov. George C. Wallace spread virtually the same message of conservatism he has espoused for the past decade. Wallace did not withdraw from the presidential race in the five-minute advertisement, as some had predicted he might, but asked for votes and sup- port in the year's final three pri- maries. “You want to put America’s house in order and get on with the business of building new greatness in our times,’ Wallace saids calling: omethe people and politicians of the nation to chart a new course that would bring ‘‘a return to confidence, peace, sanity and decency in our lives,”’ The governor repeated many famil- iar themes in his talk, broadcast the same night he left Alabama for a four- day campaign sojourn in California, which holds its primary on Tuesday along with Ohio and New Jersey. Those themes included the follow- ing: —Moving to ‘‘cut out this bureau- cratic power that constantly in- terferes with the lives and happiness of our people and their families and get back to people power that determines the course of our government.” —Maintaining the strongest mili- tary offense and defense in the world since peace can be achieved only through strength. Controlling power of the federal judiciary before i. detroys the demo- cratic system of government through “court made laws.” ~—Removing from the welfare svs- tem “loafers who can work but won't work,”’ and easing the tax burden ‘‘be- fore it wipes out the middle class.” —Maintaining the ‘‘right to individ- uality’’ in the nation’s neighborhoods. schools and cultures to safeguard tra- ditions of a free society. By embarking on that new direction, Wallace said, this country can set an example to inspire others to search for new freedoms. “Our children can have bright new tomorrows and we will be as a piece of steel to our adversaries,” he said. The message and its delivery were in the same mellowed tones that have characterized most of Wallace's 1976 campaign, a mellowness markedly different from the stridency of his ear- lier campaigns. The governor, who has seen little success in this latest bid for the Demo- cratic presidential nomination, did not suggest he has any chances of secur- ing the prize in July. He simply asked for primary votes ‘so that I might continue to speak up for you at the Democratic National. Convention.” Campaign Director Charles S. Sni- der estimated the total cost of the five- minute political ad. broadcast across the country, at about $30,000. June 4, 1976 \f"

John Sparkman denied Friday that the state's senior Democratic senator will retire in 1978. Special Assistant Bob Geddie, recently appointed to run the senator’s Alabama offices, said Sparkman has not decided yet whether to run for re-lection in two years and probably will not announce his in- tentions until about January of 1978. “He has not made up his mind, no matter what these rumors say,” Geddie maintained, (ieddie said he has spent time with Sparkman off and on for the past two weeks, during the period of heavy speculation and source reports that the Te-year-old senator definitely has decided to termi- nate his public career. Sparkman has stated throughout the period that the speculation is baseless, Geddie said, and that he has yet to make a final decision on staying in office or retiring, Similar rumors have circulated for months, but the recent spate “of published predictions apparently has raised concern by Sparkman and his staff. Geddie, who will establish a new Montgomery of- fice for Sparkman within the next two months and coordinate activities at his Birmingham and Mobile offices, said he believes the senator “will put a pret: ty vigorous campaign together” if he does decide to seek reelection for a sixth full term. He contended the senator's age ‘‘would not be a factor but would be an issue,” maintaining Spar- kman is in excellent health, Even if Sparkman has decided to quit public life at: the close of his present term, he would be expected to deny that to prevent being seen as a lame duck sena- tor with little future influence to wield in the seat of government, Now he does hold one of the most influential posi- tions in the U.S, Senate, by virtue of his seniority and his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has been a senator since filling the unexpired term of the late Sen, John H. Bankhead in 190, and before that spent five terms in the House of Repre- sentatives. He first was elected to the U.S. House in 1936. While Sparkman is refusing to formally clear the path for a successor yet, numerous hopefuls are eye- ing his Senate seat with ambitious longing.

George C. Wallace moved Wednesday to help place a fellow southerner in the White House by en- dorsing Jimmy Carter. The move was not unexpected, but the timing was a surprise that showed George Wallace maintains his legendary political acumen even in the apparent twilight of his public career. Wallace jumped on the Carter band- wagon before it became too crowded to hold the tardy, and may have handed the former Georgia governor the dele- gates he needs to win the Democratic nomination next month. The two who were rivals on Tuesday ire to meet by this weekend to mend heir once badly splintered fences and ikely make a public pitch for a party inified behind the frontrunner. Wallace alone made that plea Nednesday, and indicated the visit to \\labama by Carter is the only- favor 1e asked for releasing the Wallace jelegates and ‘‘respectfully request- ing” they cast their votes for Carter on the first ballot at the Democratic Na- tional Convention. Wallace told reporters at an 11 a.m. oress conference that he and Carter jid ‘‘make an agreement’’ during the 1 a.m. telephone conversation Wednes; day when the Alabama governor ex- plained his intended support. “I told him all I would ask from him is that he would promise, if elected president, to use all his resources to make the people of this country, all the people, one of the finest presidents we have ever had,’’ Wallace said. During his press conference ‘Wal- lace never did 4ssue outright personal support for Carter as the best candi- date to make the best president. “I told him in view of the fact that he participated in all the primaries and he seemed to be the choice of the people, I would ask the delegates pledged to George Wallace ta support him,” Wallace: said. Questioned about his earlier com- ments denouncing Carter as ‘‘a warm- ed over McGovern,” the party's 1972 liberal and devastatingly unsuccess- ful candidate, Wallace responded that “people say things .. . in the heat of the campaign.” ‘ Before Wallace's string of primary losses mounted, the governor often a even harsher criticisms of Carter ee and campaign literature ely chastising the Georgian peri- odically- appeared. In the past month. however, Wallace also had admitted in private that he ul- timately would endorse Carter and cited the fact that he is a soathérner as one major reason. On Wednesday. a subdued and often grim-faced Wallace pointed out that he and Carter have accrued the first and second highest number of ‘pariae votes in the primaries, saying campaign proved that geography is not a factor in natiénal politics, that geographic bias was not overcome, but was never there. Wallace said his action releases 173 delegates pledged to support him—others place the count at 168—and the gover- nor said he expects most to honor his wish to vote for Carter. In most in- stances delegates are not required to. -do that. In Alabama 11 of the 21 Wallace dele- gates were contacted and seven said they would honor the request. in South Carolina six of the eight Wallace dele- gates said they would switch to Carter, The Montgomery Advertise ’ Montgomery, Ala.

Betty Rainwater, a Carter press aide, denied Wednesday sucn dis- cussions ever took place, maintaining Carter welcomes and is gratified by the Alabama governor's support. Wallace himself did not appear par- ticularly happy about bowing out of national politics in Carter's favor after more than a, decade, seldom smiling or joking with media representatives as he normally does during a press con- ference. Mrs. Cornelia Wallace and aides to the governor were similarly dour throughout the announcement that Wallace no longer is a contender for the presidential nomination. “I've seen the. effort George has put out and it’s a little disappointing.” Mrs. Wallace said. “It's always dis- appointing when you fail to accom- lish vour goals.” June 10, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Pension Lawsuit Brought By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Contending the 1975 act granting pension benefits to former governors is unconstitutional, State Sen. John Baker filed suit in Montgomery Cir- cuit Court Wednesday seeking to strike down the law. “T want to make it clear that J mean no ill will toward any individual who might now or in the future be ex- pecting some benefit under these acts,’ Baker said at.a Capitol press conference. “This is not in any manner directed to Gov. (George) Wallace.” Baker, who successfully sued Wal- lace last year to nullify the governor’s executive order providing a state edu- cation budget, said he believes the re- tirement law violates a provision of the Alabama Constitution prohibiting the legislature from retiring any offi- cer on pay or part pay. Advertiser-Journal Editor and Pub- lisher Harold E. Martin disclosed the apparent illegality of the 1975 retire- ment law in a news article not long af- , ter the act was passed by the legisla- ture. The ‘act provides a pension of 68 per cent of the current governor's salary for any former governor who served one term or less in office. Any former governor who served as much as two terms receives 100 per cent of the cur- rent salary, meaning the retirement benefit for both rises as the salary of the governor is increased. “I personally believe that career elected officials have just as much right to security in their old age and have just as much right to pensions and retirement as do state employes, teachers, judges, firemen, policemen, city and county employes and any citi- zen,’ said Baker, a second term sena- tor from Rainsville in North Alabama. Baker has proposed a constitutional amendment that would make such pensions legal, and enabling legisla- tion spelling out eligibility and ben- efits of anew retirement system for elected officials. The senator was particularly criti- cal of provisions of the 1975 law which he said might grant pensions to some persons who have served as governor only briefly. Those include former Gov. Albert Brewer, who was in office little more than two years after the late Gov. Lur- leen Wallace died and he stepped up from lieutenant governor. Baker also said Lt. Gov. Jere Beas- ley might be eligible under the current law since he served as acting governor for several months while Gov. George Wallace was in a Maryland hospital ee the attempt on his life in 1972. Baker said retirement should be provided only for career Officials‘ and employes, not an official Who serves one or two terms and “devotes only a small portion of his life and Productive years to public service.” “It is unreasonable for these to expect the public to Support for the rest of their life,” Baker people them June 10, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Carter to Pay Call on Wallace By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace and Jimmy Carter will formally bury the hatchet in a closed door meeting here Satur- day evening, the first of the former Georgia governor's courtesy calls on his one-time opponents for the Demo- cratic presidential nomination. The 4:45 p.m. session at the Gover- nor’s Mansion will follow by hours the State Democratic Executive Com- mittee meeting in Birmingham, where the remaining eight members of Ala- bama's delegation to the party nomi- nating convention will be chosen. Since Wallace threw his support to his former rival earlier this week, the majority of the 35’'member delegation is expected to support Carter at the July convention, and the endorsement may turn out to be unanimous. Of the 21 delegates Wallace won in the May primaries, 12 have agreed to switch to Carter. Carter won two dele- gates then and uncommitted candi- dates won in four races. The committee is expected to select another six delegates of Wallace's choosing, and one each nominated by ae the Carter and uncommitted forces. ag Joe Reed, the president of the Ala- bama Democratic Conference, the | black caucus that fielded the winning uncommitted delegates, said he ex- pects they will announce a com- — mittment Saturday. | oe Wallace plans to meet with his dele- gates in Birmingham at noon, when he | probably will ask them personally to back Carter. That will be just before the 1 p.m. executive committee meet-— ing, which the governor also plans to attend at least briefly. When Wallace returns to Montgom- ery for the private tete-a-tete with Car- ter, he apparently hopes to be able to deliver good news about the total num- ber of Alabama delegates who will cast their ballots for the Georgian next month. Aides to both men said they antici- pate some statement will be issued by the pair after the meeting that is ex- pected to last less than an hour. Carter is scheduled to depart the state immediately after the dis- cussion, and will travel to New York on Monday to confer with Arizona Rep.

        "ocr_text": "Carter, Wallace Forge Alliance By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The American and Alabama flags gently wafted over the massive white colomns of the Governor’s Mansion in sultry Alabama air. Below, two men used to the heat of both the southern sun and southern politics sealed a new alliance with a handshake and an exhertation that national Demo- crats unite to send a southerner to the White House. Some characterized the brief meet- ing as the symbolic changing of the guard, the Old South of Gov. George C. Wallace giving way to the New South Jimmy Carter helped construct as one-time governor of neighboring Georgia. If that's what it was, the two refused to admit it, preferring to gaze toward a future much brighter for Carter than for his former rival. They met Saturday on the mansion’s south porch, chatting in 90 degree heat bevond earshot of the surging mass of reporters and dozens of observers lin- ing the iron fence, laughing and shak- ing hands twice before moving from the shade to the front of the antebellum stvled structure. Carter was the first to speak, re- counting the 2:15 a.m. phone call Wednesday when Gov. Wallace prom- ised his endorsement and efforts to. turn his delegates to the Democratic , National Convention into Carter vot-, ers. “T told him I’d be over here before the end of the week to thank him per- sonally,” Carter’ said, ‘Following his public endorsement I quickly got the endorsements of several others.” And so he came, at 5 p.m. Saturday, for the first of a round of post-primary visits to the candidates he soundly trounced in the balloting that has giv- en him what most concede is a clear shot at the Democratic presidential nomination. He did thank Wallace, calling him “a very good candidate” and “‘a formi- dable opponent.” Now, it was time to put aside differ- ences, “His idea and mine is to pull the par- ty together in the most harmonious way possible,” Carter said. And Wallace: ‘I look forward to seeing the November election over and you elected president.” They spoke vaguely of what would be discussed in the private meeting to June 13, 1976 > \fWallace- follow, The platform, credentials, rules, other detalls of the conventlon next month were listed as possibilities, Responding to reporters’ questions, Carter said he does believe that Wal- lace helped open the door to the White House for a southerner’s entry, and re- called the Alabamian raised issues in 1972 thal were quickly grasped by his opponents, “One of the great things demonstra- led this year has been the lack of see- lionalism,” he said. “Division by re- gion is a thing of the past.” ut, Cartgt's new prominence and Wallace's demise as a potent political force do pot signal a changing of the southern guatd finally merging again with the rest of the nation. “J don’t see any abrupt changes take _(ng place,” Carter sald, “It's an evolu- (ionary process as polilics always ts,” -Alfer the short public comments the {wo men disappeared into the red-cars peted foyer for a privale talk that last- ed Just minutes.

        "ocr_text": " The Foshee Syndrome By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of The Advertiser Staff Until last Wednesday afternoon, members of the Alabama Senate used to joke about someday having to hold their sessions at the local federal pen in order to get together a quorum of senators. They stopped joking when Sen. E.C. ‘‘Crum’’ Foshee became the second senator in less than six months to be convicted of violating federal law and thus to be automatically ousted from the Senate. Their jokes were replaced with low cries of in- dignation, with self-admitted paranoia, with some- what aimless charges that “they” got Foshee sim- ply because he is a senator. “It’s the Watergate syndrome,” said one senator, “Now they think all politicians are crooks.” The same senator expressed firm belief that had any Average Joe done the same thing Foshee did there would have been no prosecution at all. The charge was using the mails to defraud several banks in a worthless check scheme. Though Foshee and his brother and business partner Wheeler ad- mitted they had performed the actions attributed to them, they contended that because there was no in- tent to harm “anyone, and because nobody in fact did lose any money, they had committed no crime. The jury did not agree. Naturally it's impossible to tell whether the fact that Foshee held a public elective office had much bearing on the decision to prosecute, despite con- tentions that it did by friends and legislative col- leagues of Foshee, who over the last couple years have watched the extensive Foshee family enter- prises crumple under the weight of successive ad- versities. It reportedly was during a federal inquiry into the possibility of arson in the second fire to blaze through the Foshee holdings that investigators de- tected the scent of the check-writing scheme. One Jawyer familiar with the case—who is not a senator—conjectured that the feds were in one of those awkward ‘‘you’re damned if you do and dam- ned if yo faced the choice of e e E ne Wie presen t sponse that they persecuted, or of not prosecuting and incurring the wrath of a general public incensed over special treatment for special people. Few legislators or other politicians displayed such a generous attitude, maintaining they are becoming sitting targets for zealots caught in a mania for ex- posing official wrongdoing, a mania they believe has the potential for sweeping up even the good guys in its ferver Strangely enough, while legislators decried the fate of Foshee and other politicos in one breath, in the next they freely admitted there's plenty of han- ky-panky going on up at Goat Hill. Not just since the Foshee verdict, but for the past several months various lawmakers have stated they are appalled at the actions of a few of their brethren who are taking unfair advantage—usually financial advantage—of their positions. On Thursday alone, four senators who at different times expressed concern over Sen. Foshee’s plight in private conversations also stated, without hesita- tion, that there does indeed exist highly questionable activity which, if it is not patently illegal, does come awfully close to a fine line. One veteran lawmaker said he has never seen so much corruption on the Hill as has surfaced this term, and various others say they understand at least three more legislators are under federal in- vestigation. Another particularly disturbed legislator recently outlined a highly complicated pattern of deals through which some few legislators have received what amounts to payoffs for voting for and support- ing legislation. The process might take several years to complete, does not always involve a specific agreement as much as an “understanding,” is ex- tremely difficult to track down, and, even if the vari- ous twists and turns of the scheme can be traced, might not be provable as a violation of the law with- out admission by the parties involved. It also is most lucrative. ‘ These are the things said in private conversation. They are never said for quotation and only in in- frequent cases are the names named. Usually the persons expressing distress at such al- leged goings on say they don’t really have any evi- dence to make a case. Perhaps there actually are no cases to be made, and the lawmakers have fallen into the same mania they critically charge is sweep- ing the media and prosecutors and general public. It hardly seems to matter whether the allegations are true or not, however, since the people privvy to the information are not doing anything with it and don’t intend to. June 13, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Last Hurrah A Whisper By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of The Advertiser Staff What once was supposed to be George Wallace's last hurrah definitely won't be now, and maybe wouldn't have been anyway. Gov. Wallace scuttled the once-popular scenario neatly laid out months ago by some observers and aides, in which the governor was to end his nearly burned out national political career in a final blaze of glory, albeit a statesmanlike one. It was to take place at the Democratic National Convention in July and was to revolve around. his graciously handing over to Jimmy Carter the Wal- lace delegates, the action accompanied by a suitable speech calling for Democratic peace, harmony, apple pie (and maybe a little anti-busing amend- ment), all suitably prime time televised. He can't do that now because he’s already done it, minus the convention setting and prime time. The strategy revision was a political emergency, since Carter's momentum was about to peak and anybody waiting for convention time would have been over the hill, politically speaking. Wallace was clever enough to recognize that and give Carter what may have been a crucial nudge toward the peak, even though it meant cancelling his own show in New York next month. Wallace says he probably still will go to the con- vention, but doesn’t sound terribly enthusiastic about it since all the glory is expected to blaze around Jimmy Carter. The last hurrah has been reduced to about a whis- per. The original vision of George Wallace pulling a Cinderella trick and suddenly transforming from a scrappy politician into one of the party's Elder Statesmen at Madison Square Garden might have been exactly that, however, a vision and little else. He could have gone through the motions well enough—he proved most gracious last week in an- nointing Carter with his blessing and adding a plug for party unity. It’s the last in the hurrah vision that’s sort of out of focus, but it’s questionable whether that truly was a part of anybody's vision in the first place. Wallace sometimes tries to make people think so, refusing to talk about his future, except using mock melancholy tones to describe life alone in some rest home. He brushes aside suggestions that he will run in 1978 for the U.S. Senate, about the only public elec- tive job option open to him, Wallace has stated repe- atedly he has no interest in the Senate, and there’s no reason to doubt the governor's sincerity on that top- ic. He's never been the ‘‘just another face in the crowd” type, preferring to retain his own spotlight as the single chief of his own domain. There also is the matter of power, which not only must be shared but is shared unequally with the new- est faces to arrive on the scene. They get less. But, there also are reasons leading most politicos around the state to believe Wallace will run for the Senate seat expected to he vacated by the retire- ment of Sen. John Sparkman. For one, he will need an income, and George Wal- lace hasn't done much but politic for his money for more than a decade. It is not just a subsistence in- come he needs, but the kind of cash that can hire him Staff to get him around and keep him up. Outside of those practical considerations, Wallace also has a reputation for not being personally satis- fied—at mental peace—unless he is active in one po- litical element or another. Stories long have made the rounds about his bouts with despondency upon losing his first gubernatorial , race, upon facing the prospect of leaving his first term as governor, and upon losing the first primary for his second term. There also is the talk of how he made an almost miraculous return to vitality after the shooting when he decided to run again for president. The U.S. Senate might not offer the power or the center stage Wallace is used to enjoying, but it is something. Then, too, there are the people who long have de- pended on Wallace's political career for livelihood. They vocally are keeping alive the potential that he will ran, and likely are engaged in or about to engage in a lobbying effort to convince the governor that is what he must do, if he does not already agree. That is why most politicians and analysts specula- ting about the 1978 senatorial race believe Wallace will be a participant. They are divided, however, when taking the next logical step: predicting the out- come. June 20, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Angry Filibuster Blocking Budget By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A vitriolic, 14-hour filibuster against the general fund budget proposal Tuesday blocked efforts by the Ala- bama Senate leadership to grasp pow- ers traditionally held by the executive branch By the mandatory midnight adjourn ment hour the Senate still was unable to reach a compromise on the $180.5 million budget reported out of the Fi- nance Committee Monday In one last-minute flurry of action shortly before midnight, Lt. Gov Jere Beasley appeared on the verge of uni- laterally cracking the filibuster when he suddenly refused to recognize the protesting senators for continued talk- ing and instead called for the vote on a pending amendment. Beasley similarly gavelled through what may have been an entirely new substitute budget, plus a quick succes- sion of minor amendments, in the dic- tatorial style for which members of the minority have criticized him. Ex- actly what was adopted remained un- certain in the waning moments of the night. The lieutenant governor apparently was merely toying with the protestors, however, for he finally did stop the ac- tion to recognize Arab Sen. Sid McDonald, a filibuster participant. ‘I wonder how anyone presiding over this Sendte can show anything but contempt and disrespect when he fails to recognize a‘ large number of sena- tors wishing to be heard,’ McDonald said ‘‘The people we represent were denied the right to be heard tonight.” The last few moments expired with no further commotion, but senators left under provisions of a surprise mo- tion by Sen. Joe Fine of Russellville, which mandates a return at 12:01 a.m. on the previously arranged date for re- convening of July 7. If minority forces wish to continue the filibuster, they could be forced to talk 48 hours straight—until midnight July 8—un- der already adopted meeting days. Protests were not lodged against the division of dollars carried in the budg- et plan, but were sounded in response to numerous provisions through which the legislative branch would gain new controls over the administration of state government. The battle partly was between Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley and Gov. George C. Wallace, but also was an outgrowth of the continuing struggle between Beas- ley and the minority of senators who have attacked the lieutenant gover- nor’s virtual total authority over Sen- ate procedings. Arguments by the ojecting minority that the legislature would gain unwar- ranted new powers at the expense of the governor's office were backed by an opinion issued by Atty. Gen, Bill Baxley. Responding tg questions posed ear- lier in the day by Tuskegee Sen. -T. Dudley Perry, a Wallace floor leader, _ Baxley said the budget proposal con- tains “open and flagrant violations of the Constitution of the State of Ala- bama which would result in unprece- dented usurpation of certain functions of government reserved by the laws of this state to the chief executive.” Some specific budget provisions un- der contention included the following: —Prohibitions against the purchase of new vehicles, except for law en- forcement use, and against any new hiring, except that approved by a spe- cial legislative committee yet to be created. —Extending to a new legislative committee virtual total control over actions by the Board of Corrections, through a provision requiring that the committee approve all board ex- penditures. —Granting to the Legislative Fiscal Committee authority to appropriate any unanticipated revenue sharing funds, as well as interest accrued by investing the funds, plus the power to alter those appropriations should the expected amount of federal money not be allotted to Alabama. —Requiring that all departments and agencies report monthly ex- penditures to the fiscal committee. Baxley's opinion said the Alabama Constitution clearly provides that the general fund budget ‘shall embrace — nothing but appropriations,” and cited several instances in which the budget bill would repeal or amend substan- tive law in violation of that provision. Beasley countered later that cries for~ accountability” in government spending have rung out over the past year from all quarters, and wondered why some senators oppose control measures now. He also said that sena- tors had full opportunity to change budget provisions while the ledger was considered by the Finance Com- mittee, since procedings there were June 30,1976 open to non-members, but no protests arnse then In addition to specifics of the budget proposal, several filibustering sena- tors decried Beasley's successful ef- forts to make his office a full-time job, despite the lack of legal sanction, and to exercise close control over the con- duct of Senate proceedings ‘This 1s the least independent, least deliberative, least majority controlled body in many, many years,” said Sen. Sid McDonald of Arab, a Beasley foe Who urged his colleagues to take back the independence they traded for fa- vors from Beasley's leadership clique. McDonald also chastised Beasley for using his Intergovernmenta] Coop- eration Commission as a.personal pub- lic relations agency at state expense, noting that the commission’s appro- priation is raised $50,000 in the pending budget. * “It has no function of improving gov- ernment, but has the sole function of im that proving one image,’’ McDonald said, charging commission employes do little but clip newspapers to send congratulatory notes from Beasley to Alabamians celebrating anniversaries or winning awards. Cullman Sen. Finis St. John echoed McDonald's words, charging that the “power of the majority has been given up and sold’ by senators wishing to ob- lain passage of their bills. with Beas- ley’s aid. Throughout the filibustering, which began shortly after the Senate con- vened at’10 a.m. and extended through the night-time hours, efforts were made to compromise away differ- ences and appeared to be succeeding. By 8 p.m., however it was clear the minority would refuse to relinquish the microphone voluntarily to permit a vote on compromise amendments. Some indicated privately they simply Wished to thwart Beasley, who said catlier he expected budget approval Tuesday, while others wanted time to Prepare alternatives for some spend- INS Proposals in the bill. \f"

Robert Wilson of Jasper. anoth- er administration ally on this issue. said he knew of no weekend negotia- tions between the Wallace faction and the majority supporting the Finance Committee budget plan. adding he ex- pects the filibuster to last at least until dav light. Bav Minette Sen. Owen. L.D. ‘*Dick** committee chairman. pre- dicted compromise positions could be reached on most of the 12 points in con- tention, but said he expects both sides to maintain hard line stands on a few kev disagreements. “T think thev’ll want more than this..” Owen said of the cost-control protests lodged by the administration. He suggested the Wallace group will make further demands concerning the allocation of funds in the committee budget propoaal. particularly the re- ductions from the governor's budget proposals for the Pensions and Secur- ity and the Highway Departments . Another administration backer, who asked to remain unidentified, con- firmed there would be amendments proposed to restore funds to those de- partments. but ‘said the filibustering senators would not maintain their stall tactics over those changes if they can strike the provisions giving new spending control powers to the legisla- ture. Wallace also indicated last week he would mount a more serious attack on the proposed allocations when the budget finally is returned to the House of Representatives for concurrence in Senate changes. These are some contested provi- sions in the Finance Committee budg- et: July 7, 1976 —Leaving Wallace discretion to spend onlv $100.000 of more than $30 million in federal revenuesharing funds, while he usually has discretion over nearly $1 million. Plus, author- izing a_ special legislative committee to allocate any unanticipated revenue sharing money and the millions in in- terest generated from investing the funds. —Giving another legislative com- mittee total control over spending by the Alabama Board of Correction. —Prohibiting any new employment by state agencies. except as author- ized bv a legislative committee. and prohibiting the purchase of most new vehicles and the hiring of attorneys. —Prohibiting the leasing of any more office space in Montgomery. —Requiring that all state depart- ments and agencies make monthly fi- nancial reports to a legislative com- mittee. The 12:01 a.m. hour to reconvene was set last week on a Surprise motion bv Sen. Joe Fine of Russellville. the Senate president pro tempore and leader of the Beasley forces Since the legislature already had agreed to meet on Wednesday and Thursday this week, it means the fili- buster participants could be required to hold forth at the microphone for 48 hours, until midnight Thursday. The intent is to wear down the talk- ers and break the filibuster. In his conferences Tuesday. Gov. Wallace did not expend energy on the staunch Beasley supporters. but con- centrated on those alreadv involved in the filibuster or others who might be persuaded ta switch to the adminis- tration side on at least some of the budget disagreements.

Alabamians also will abound in the Big Apple, with as many as 200 departing this weekend for the fun and frolic and modicum of business that will carry them through the week, That business of politics isn’t scheduled to begin until 1 p.m. half the days and till 8 p.m. the other two, so luxurious amounts of time will be left for the breakfasts, brunches, receptions and parties al- ready planned.

(Sources close to Wallace said party leaders who contacted him several times included National Party Chairman Robert Strauss, U.S Sen Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota. and former California Gov Pat Brown, father of the present California governor Ed- mund Brown, who himself remains a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. ) Last month, however, the day af- ter the final primaries had been held in California, Ohio and New Jersey, Wallace became the first active candidate to release his 173 delegates and ask them to support Carter His action quickly was fol- lowed by several others, and within days Carter had sufficient delegate pledges to win the nomination. “I knew releasing my delegates then would bring the hierarchy trailing after me to iump on the bandwagon,’ Wallace said. “‘If I had waited until the convention, had I brought my delegates to New York, there would have been a ter- rible fight, in my judgment, to de- feat Mr. Carter.”’ Until the landslide toward Carter, a landslide touched off by the rock dislodged by Wallace, predictions were rife of exactly such a bitter and devisive floor fight aimed at preventing Carter from being the nominee. Wallace said that kind of fight would have been unfair to Carter. who had succeeded in more pri- maries than any other candidate ail across the country. “The hierarchy helped stop me in Florida. and I helped stop them the night of the Ohio primarvy.\": Wallace said. “We at least have defeated the hi- erarchy. the kingmakers. and I'm proud the people of Alabama had a part in it.” he added Wallace recounted the scenario with considerable relish. initiating his comments with no prodding from reporters and saying he won- dered why no one had yet asked him the reason for his sudden switch from active candidate to supporter of a former foe Reporters had. in fact questioned him on that subject the day he announced his decision. but he said only that Carter de- served the nomination. Neither the day of that announce- ment nor on Monday did Wallace sav he personally believed Carter to be the best man to hold the presi- dencv. As far as his own delegates are concerned. Wallace still had not re- ceived full assurance by Monday night that all would do his bidding and cast their votes for Carter Several Alabama delegates have indicated reluctance. although all 35 are expected finally to vote for the Georgian. and a bloc of perhaps a dozen Wallace delegates from Florida and as many as 20 from Massachusetts appear even less re- conciled to helping Carter become the partv’s nominee iin Wednesday night's balloting Wallace called a meeting of all his — delegates Monday evening two hours before the official opening of the convention to personally ask all of them to support Carter They cheered. chanted and -sereamed for Wallace and gave no indication they would switch ba Car- ter About 300 supporters. mast from Alabama.

Close aides later definitely ruled out any movement to formally place Wallace’s name before the convention delegates. but that does not prohibit them from voting for him.

        "ocr_text": "Among Northern Blacks State Blacks By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer NEW YORK—Alabama’s black delegates, some of whom were once antagonistic to the Jimmy Carter presidential campaign, have emerged at the Democratic National Con- vention as a hard-working cadre pro- moting the Georgian’s candidacy among northern blacks still hesitant to throw their support behind a man from the Deep South. State Rep. Antonio Harrison of Bir- mingham, a member of the Steering Democrats, has been a chief negotia- tor between black leaders and Carter forces, despite his one-time highly critical view of the former Georgia governor. Harrison is among the black leaders who walked away from an_ hour-long meeting with Carter saying they are satisfied with his commitment to mi- nority needs, even though the man ex- pected to be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee refused to ac- cept a proposal binding the party to specific minority representation re- quirements at future conventions. The proposal presented by the Rules ‘Committee Tuesday night sets a time- table for meeting representation goals, but has no mandatory provi- sions.’ “Tm satisfied with the language, be- cause considering the circumstances of the present situation, it was the best we could do,’’ Harrison said. ‘‘It’s the |reality you have to live with.” ‘ Both Harrison and Tuskegee State ‘Rep. Thomas Reed, another black Ala- bama delegate, said they believe one Teason some northern blacks have been reluctant to settle for that — and for Carter as the nominee — is that. they still do not trust a white South- erner. Reed said he has spent much of his time talking with those blacks, not only delegates, but other black leaders here to participate in various aspects of behind-the-scenes convention af- fairs, in an effort to convince them that Carter is in fact committed to assuring that blacks have a more visible pres- ence both in the party councils and in the upper echelons of the federal bu- reaucracy he will fill if elected presi- dent. Montgomery State Rep. Alvin Holmes, who is an alternate delegate, is not fully satisfied with a the com- promises thus far worked out. “I disagree with the position a lot of black leaders are taking,’’ Holmes said. ‘‘We need something binding, something built into the rules. Gut faith is not enough.’ Even Holmes, however. does not question publicly that Carter may not fulfill the somewhat vague verbal commitment that has been agreed upon, saying his concern rather is with the state and local party organization. Another strong Carter supporter now is Montgomerian Joe Reed, the president of the Alabama Democratic Conference, black caucus of the state Earlier this year Reed was em- broiled in an argument with Carter campaign officials, who refused to honor his request that they not run delegates in districts where the ADC fielded uncommitted candidates. Both Harrison and Thomas Reed were elected as uncommitted delegates backed by the ADC, but later switched to Carter pledg Promote Carter Joe Reed has been quick to point out that in districts where no ADC candi- date ran, the group endorsed the Car- ter-pledged candidate, and he, too, is now trying to convince northern blacks that they must live with the re- alities of the times in which strident militancy is not acceptable to the ma- jority of the party or of the nation, and that Jimmy Carter is about the best the black community can do this time around.

        "ocr_text": "arty Unity Transcends | Deepest of Old Divisions By MARCIA KUNSTEL “Advertiser Staff Writer NEW YORK—The spirit of unity pervading the Democratic National Convention this week at -times has transcended even the deepest of old di- visions, such as race re- - kations in the South. The family of Martin Luther King Jr., the late civil rights activist _whose very name used to be anathema to Alaba- mians, has gotten on fa- mously here with folks from the Heart of Dixie. . Not only did Martin Lu- ther King Sr., father of the slain leader, warmly greet Gov. George C. Wallace immediately af- ter the governor finished his brief speech before the convention Tuesday night, but earlier in the evening Mrs. Coretta King, wife of the man who led the Montgomery bus boycott, walked over. to Alabama delegates to shake hands and ex- change pleasantries. : Although none of the black delegates was sit- ting there at the time, the white delegates imme- diately surrounded Mrs] King to pump her hand and speak a few words before she disappeared into the surging mass oh bodies on the convention floor. ++ + Not all those old wounds have been totally healed yet, however. When Wallace hosted his luncheon for Alaba- “mians attending the con- vention, Greene County Probate Judge William McKinley Branch was the only black to attend. He is an alternate dele- gate. Throughout the day. other black delegates and alternates queried ‘about their absence said meeting Caucus of Black Demo- crats, held at the same time. All said there was no coordinated effort to boy- cott the affair, until late that night when Mont- gomerian Joe Reed gave avery different re- sponse. *‘We didn't go to it at the 1972 convention and didn’t go this year,’’ said Reed, the president of the state party’s black caucus, the Alabama Democratic Conference. Others later indicated they probably wouldn’t have gone, even if they hadn't had conflicting ac- tivities. ++ + The words, or at least the general contents, of Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley's attack on Gov. Wallace and on legislators sup- porting the adminis- tration have floated all the way up to New York City, and nobody from Alabama seems too pleased at what they’ve heard. Alabaniians here have quizzed news reporters frequently to learn ex- actly what it is Beasley has been saying, showing considerable anger over the little news they’ve managed to pick up from the folks at home. Nobody wanted to give a resonse for publication, with most saying they need to know cs of Beasley’s attack first, but one legislator here did ask if anyone knew the proceedure for recall- ing (kicking out of office) the lieutenant governor of the state. +++ It took some time and consultation with ad- visers, but Gov. Wallace did finally refuse to sign Aa Advertiser Cenvention Repert the petition and thus nix- ed the plan of some dele- gates to formally place his name before the con- vention as a candidate for the presidential nomi-. nation. Another petition that didn’t even get into Wallace's hands was the one circulated by Mas- sachusetts delegates that would have presented Wallace as a candidate for the vice presidential nomination. State Rep. J Thomas ‘*Tommy'’’ Sandusky, a delegate from Mobile. who did sign the presi- dential petition, said he and others refused to at- tach their names to the veep petition. The Massachusetts delegates simply wanted to get 15 minutes of speaking time the amount allotted for plac- ing a candidate’s name before the body — to launch a tirade against busing, Sandusky said, and there was little sup- port for that move. +++ Morris Dees, the Mont- gomery lawyer and di- rect mail whiz who has handled Jimmy Carter’s fund-raising, says his ad- vice apparently isn’t heeded when it comes to other aspects of the Geor- gian’s presidential cam- paign. Dees had opted for choosing Idaho Sen. Frank Church to fill the No. 2 spot on the Demo- cratic ticket this fall, but Carter has indicated that Church won't be his se- lection.

Dees said his sec- ond choice is Mondale . +~+ + Not all the Alabamians in New York City this week are filling an offi- cial capacity; some are just having fun, seeing the sights, and occasion- ally taking in a bit of the convention, too. For example, State Sen. Ronnie Flippo of Florence is here mostly as an observer, although he does swing a bit more weight at Madison Square Garden than most unofficial visitors. Flippo is wearing cre- dentials citing him as a lieutenant governor, which means he not only can get into the building where the convention is being held, but has un- limited floor privileges as well.. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasle decided not to come, an handed over to Flippo special credentials re served for high state offi cials. The senator has bee doing a bit of work. how ever, making contacts with party bigwigs he hopes will serve him well if he is elected to Con- gress this fall from the Fifth District. He won the Democratic nomination in the spring primary. July 15, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "lrauss Alabama Anger By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer NEW YORK—Democratic National Chairman Robert Strauss acted to ap- pease Alabamians Thursday night by making a public explanation of Sorts of the fiasco one night earlier, in which Alabama’s chief spokesman at the Democratic National Convention was shouted to silence in the midst of re- marks Strauss agreed he could deliv- er, 3 “T know this convention wants to be fair, and it has been fair,” Strauss said ° during a break in the balloting for the vice presidential nomination, “I want & to clear up a matter that’s been troubl- ing-me since last night,” Strauss said the comments by Sen. Robert T. Wilson had been seriously “misinterpreted” by the convention delegates. The thousands of delegates had booed Wilson back to his chair as he at- templed to deliver a five-minute talk prior to announcing the Alabama vote on the presidential nomination, Wilson had hoped to deliver a plea for unity, aimed specifically at Wal- lace delegates still reluctant to cast their votes for Jimmy Carter. Although Strauss had agreed that Wilson could make the comments, Party Secretary Mrs. Dorothy Vre- denburg Bush, herself.an Alabamian, stated before beginning the rollcall that no delegation spokesman would be permitted to. make remarks other than giving the vote of his delegation, “I had known and the chair (Mrs, Bush) had known, that Sen, Wilson Was going to speak for a couple of mo- ments,” Strauss told the convention Thursday night. _ Strauss related that Wilson was go- Ing to repeat that Gov. Wallace sup- Ported Carter and was going to ask not Only that Wallace's delegates vote for the Georgian but to plan to ask “the considerable” Wallace constituency across the nation to do likewise in No- vember. An indication that no hard feelings Temained on either side came when ov. Wallace appeared on the plat- form as Carter delivered his accept- ance speech. Although Wallace had planned to re- turn to Montgomery Thursday morn- ing, an aide said he decided to remain and attend the acceptance speech at the request of Carter representatives. Just before making his comments, Strauss placed ‘a personal call to Wil- son via a special telephone hookup connecting delegates on the floor to the speaker's podium, Wilson said Strauss told him he “had been trying to call all day,\" and apolo- gized for the incident that Wilson and other Alabamians considered a strik- ing humiliation. Strauss ‘said Mrs, Bush’ did not at- tempt to quiet the screaming dele- gales who interrupted Wilson Wednes-: day night because “she felt she couldn't control the convention,” Wil- son related. Wilson said he responded during the call that his purpose had been to unify the Wallace people. \"That's why I came back tonight.” Wilson said he told Strauss, who re- plied: ‘We're the same kind of Demo- crats,” Wilson said he was satisfied with Strauss’ action, and the convention delegates applauded their approval after Strauss finished his apologetic explanation. . Earlier in the day, Wilson and others ~ said they believed Strauss owed the convention an apology for permitting the incident to occur, They placed the ‘ blame squarely on the chairman's shoulders. * The delegation as a group made no © formal: contact with Strauss or party officials Thursday, but the Massachu- setts delegation met in caucus and all 104 members voted unanimously to de- mand a public apology from Strauss. « Delegates from Louisiana, Mis- sissippi, Kentucky and North Carolina were similarly appalled at the Wednesday night misunderstanding and its devastating impact on Wilson and other irate Alabamians. Wilson was particularly disturbed because he said he had been assured just 10 minutes before the roll call on the presidential nomination that he would be given the five minutes to de- liver his remarks. Despite Mrs. Bush's warning. that ‘delegation spokesmen should’ refrain from extended remarks, Wilson launched into his one page text, draw- ing hollers of protests within moments from the thousands of delegates jam: med into the convention halls and aisles, Thursday afternoon, Wilson called the situation ‘‘unfortunate’’ and “an embarrassment to me.”’ “Nobody understood what was gor ing on,’ said Wilson, who added he was told Mrs. Bush had not been in- formed of the prior arrangement. | ‘Since Strauss had approved the plan, Wilson said, it was his responsi bility to inform the presiding officer of it. ' Lewis Odom, a Montgomery \\attor- ney who headed Carter’s Alabama campaign, confirmed that Wilson and the delegation had received assur- ances from Strauss’ representatives that the brief talk would be permitted, Both Odom and State Party Chair- man Robert Vance said Strauss should apologize, although Odom preferred to characterize it ‘not a deliberate act,” Odom said Thursday evening that he would personally attempt to solicit some public explanation of the situ- ation from Strauss or another party of- ficial, Montgomery City Council member lierman Harris, one of only two Ala- bama delegates elected as Carter pledges, remained perturbed that the situation had been allowed to arise at “all, that Wilson and others had insisted ,on the floor speech, vd | “Gov. Wallace had his opportunity ‘to appear (before the convention and ‘speak),’’ Harris said. ‘'The whole ‘thing was totally unnecessary in the first place.’ ; “If an agreement was made it ‘should have been honored, though,” he added. Also Thursday night, the Alabama delegation remained divided in its sen- timents, casting only 30 votes for vice presidential nominee Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota and abstain with its other five votes. The same five persons who had ignored Gov. Wal- lace’s plea to vote for Carter on Wednesday night were listed as ab- ‘staining. The five were not seen on the convention floor at the time of the vote. July 16, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Come Home, Alabama By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of The Advertiser Staff Alabama Democrats eased back into the: main- stream of American politics last week, mainly be- cause the man who kept them lodged on the dissident periphery for more than a decade dropped the bar- riers to their entry. It wasn't totally a smooth trip back, but stumbles and a few falls for the most part were overcome without serious or long-term injury being sustained. The re-entry from a political outer orbit was per- mitted and prompted by Gov. George C. Wallace, the man who finally set aside his personal ambitions and urged his deeply committed supporters to go with a winner for a change in the national arena. No more longshots bet for the price of a protest. The trip back to the heart of the party was not so long a philosophical journey as it once would have been, however, because those protests cried from the no-man’s land of the third party or from the fringes of the Democratic fold did have some im- pact. they did help rein in a leftward straying lead- ership that itself moved so far out four years ago that it. too, lost sight of the heart, This year both sides headed back toward the cen- ter, and waiting for them—or drawing them in—was Jimmy Carter. Even Alabama joined in the move- ment at the Democratic National Convention, be- ° cause George Wallace said that was the right thing to do. This year there was no Alabama walk-out, as there had been in '48, '60, ’64 and ’68. This year the majority of Alabama’s delegates did not march into and then out of the convention in time to the cadence drummed out by the beating heart of Dixie and turn a deaf ear to the tune sung by the rest of the party. There was a tense period when a boycott appeared possible, after a mix-up on the convention floor caused by bad planning resulted in the chairman of the Alabama delegation being shouted from the mi- crophone and into silent oblivion. The incident was viewed unwarranted and possi- bly deliberate disgrace by a majority of delegates, both those who have been long time followers of the Wallace camp and those who have served just as long as soldiers in the anti-Wallace 3 The potential for another replay of those earlier nose-thumbings at the party was there, but Wallace never asked for it, so it never happened, The vice presidential question Was, however, an- other opportunity for Wallace to come out swinging as he likely would have done in earlier days under similar circumstances, This year he lifted not a pin- kie, made no public comment at all about the liberal nominee until returning home, when he sald it doesn't matter anvway who fills the number {wo spot on the ticket. that it’s only the ton nasitian that This year there was not even a single challenge to the make up of the delegation, leaving State Chair- man Robert Vance wondering how he was going to . occupy his time at the convention. Judge William McKinley Branch, a leader of the old National Democratic Party of Alabama that used to protest the racial composition of Alabama's near lily-white delegation, this year returned to the regular Democrats and showed up as an alternate delegate chosen for the job by the party leadership that formerly was Branch’s chief adversary, Ideological chasms separated various elements of the delegation, but the degree of harmony between blacks and whites, between Wallaceites and Carte- rites, was remarkable enough to be remarked upon by more than a couple delegates, : Part of the phenomenon was due to the acceptance at home of the evolution of a single society from a dual. And, the Alabama delegation also was a politi- cal microcosm of the party as a whole, Wallace and his people were not totally satisfied with Carter as the nominee, believing his tastes too liberal for them to savour. Blacks were not fully sat. isfied with Carter, questioning his commitment to minority causes, to urban problems, to minimizing unemployment. But the vast majority of the delegation, as of the party. expressed extreme dissatisfaction with What the Republicans have done to the country, and a will ingness to compromise their own wishes in order to give the government back to the Democrats, The clearest sign of this new unity appeared in the final moments of the convention, when Jimmy Car. ler stood before a collection of party luminaries as diverse as George Wallace and Coretta King, Old Boss Dick Daley and New Pol Jerry Brown, Sen George McGovern the fallen Dove and Sen, Henry Jackson the fallen Hak.

        "ocr_text": "Panel Kills ERA; § Proposal Given Second Defeat By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer For the second time in three years the Equal Rights Amendment was struck a death blow, in the Alabama Legislature Wednesday. The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives voted 8-6 to indefinitely postpone, thus killing, a bill to ratify the proposed amendment to the U.S.Constitution. The vote came after a five-hour hearing during which the pros and cons were espoused by both women and men giving mostly reasoned appeals for their causes. The thousands of words delivered LJ during hours of testimony appeared an exercise in futility, however, since the vote was taken wifhout a sentence of committee debate on the merits of the proposal, indicating most, if not all, committee members held pre-deter- mined stands on the issue The sometimes leading questions from the all-male committee gave a similar indication, but the members were unusually attentive throughout the marathon hearing. The amendment, which would prohi- bit the federal and state governments from enacting laws that discriminate on the basis of sex, went down to re- sounding defeat in 1973, that time in the Alabama Senate. So far 34 of the required 38 states have ratified it, with the deadline in 1979. This year the proposal was spon- sored by Rep. A.L. “Tony” Harrison of Birmingham, who said in his openi remarks to the committee and some 200 onlookers—filling the House cham- ber with themselves, their placards, their buttons and tags—that the U.S. Constitution is supposed to assure that all citizens have the same opportunity to develop individual potential. “It is the simple intention of this amendment to give all citizens that equal right under the law,” he said, adding women have not received fair treament. While some opponents did dispute Harrison’s interpretation of the amendment’s intention, a greater number protested its potential effect. Miss Olive Spann of Chapman, chairman of the Alabama Stop ERA organization, said the amendment will mean “whatever five judges on the Su- preme Court wish it to mean.” “We want to keep the rights of Ala- bama women in the hands of the Ala- bama Legislature,” she said. Dr. Max Rafferty, professor of edu- cation at Troy State University and a newspaper columnist, said the trouble with the ERA “lies not with its word- ing, which is innocuous enough,” but with the potential it carries for prompting ‘mischievous meddling by the federal bureaucracy.” Although ERA proponents spoke first, they spent much of their testi- mony on defenses against the anti- ERA arguments. ae oe The Principals Ms Knowles (above) responds to questions Miss Spann (at left) was a chief opponent. John- stone (far right) and Armstrong were most ac- tive questioners. Advertiser Photos by Dean Smith and Mark Chesnatt “Just as we have limitations on the First Amendment, we would have lim- itations on the Equal Rights Amend- ment,’” said Ms. Marjorie Knowles, a University of Alabama law professor. As such limitations prohibit a person from yelling ‘‘fire’’ in a crowded theatre—despite the constitutional freedom of speech—so would limita- tions such as the right to privacy pre- vent excessive interpretations of the ERA, she said. “It has nothing to do with who opens the doors, who proposes marriage, who pays the bills or who takes the gar- bage out.”’ she said. Reps. Douglas Johnstone of Mobile and Ralph ‘‘Buddy’’ Armstrong of Bessemer closely questioned Ms. Knowles on the points of law she cited, and were the main interrogators of other witnesses as well. Armstrong, who voted to kill the bill, did become incensed at one point, tell- ing Miss Brenda Carson that “you in- sult my intelligence,’’ when she voiced predictions that the ERA would ‘disrupt the natural evolution of human behavior’’ and cause society to be ‘‘plunged into total cultural chaos.\"” Most of the testimony was reasoned and unemotional, however, with the two sides attemting to refute whatever the other said. Scripture was cited as arguments by both, and each gave countervailing views of the ERA’s effects on domestic life and on women who choose to be homemakers. While opponents said vehicles now exist to fight sex discrimination in em- ployment and other areas, proponents such as Mrs. Marie Jemison of Bir- mingham argued the ERA would give women “locked into traditional roles’’ a psychological key for escape. The proponents did have the advan- tage of citing a long list of organiza- tions on record as supporting the amendment, such as the Alabama Education Association, the Alabama Federation of Business and Profes- sional Women's Clubs, and the AFL- Clo. Rep. Marilyn Quarles of Springville, the lone female legislator in this state, testified that she opposes the ERA, but said she believes the entire House should have an opportunity to vote on it.

        "ocr_text": "Beasley’s Vehicle By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of The Advertiser Staff It started out with a two-year appropriation of $5,000. and ten years later the Intergovernmental Cooperation Commission (ICC) received $105.000 of taxpavers money to operate for a single 12-month period. In the span of time that has elapsed since its crea- tion. the ICC not only has accrued a sizable sum of cash to finance its functioning. but also has accrued a Sizable list of complaints that its functioning has served mainly to promote the political ambitions of its chairman—Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley. In recent weeks members of the both the Alabama Senate and the House of Representatives have made the most strident and most public attacks on Beaslev and the ICC that have been heard since the agency first stirred rumblings of discontent several vears ago. Beaslev has made no attempt to hide the fact that he closely guides the day-to-day operations of the commission, but maintains there is no politicking in- volved in ICC workings. that the commission in fact is run within the somewhat vague statutory confines of the legislation that created it in 1965. Whether the commission is indeed a campaign ve- hicle being steered down a course intended to help drop Beasley in the governor's chair at the end of the line may be a matter of interpretation and defin- tion—how one defines politics and campaigning. There are signs that Beasley has subverted the in- itial intention of the commission and converted it to his personal use. For example. of the six full-time employes now on the ICC staff. one is a receptionist who sits in Beas- lev's outer office. answering his telephone and mail and performing other secretarial duties. Most frequenters of Capitol halls have thought she was on Beasley's personal staff. since she functions much as his personal secretary. Want to know where the lieutenant governor can be located? Ask Karen. Calling for Beasley? She often answers his phone. She also calls reporters with his news releases. Then there is Wayne McMahon. who until recently held the formal position of Beasley's executive as- sistant, but now has been transferred to the ICC pay- roll. Late last week. Beasley had to call a staffer to find out exactly which office was issuing McMahon's paycheck—his own or the ICC. Although McMahon retains his connecting office adjacent to Beaslev's. he now is called ICC director. Reo Kirkland. ICC administrative assistant. savs one of his main jobs now is “coordinating citizens requests with agencies of state government.” He supplies information. refers callers to the agency that might assist with a problem. and otherwise helps people who must deal with the bureaucracy. From whence do these people with problems come? They call or wander into the lieutenant gover- nor’s office. and are turned over to Kirkland or other 1CC_ workers. He and Bill Fuller. another ICC staff member. worked “just about full time.’ Beasley said. on.a legislative budget committee's probe into state spending and management practices this spring. Beasley chaired the committee. through which he did uncover some strange bureaucratic bungling. He also got almost daily headlines out of the in- vestigation. Another main function of the ICC. taking the full- time work of one employe. has been assisting in the State government reorganization study. Although Gov. George C. Wallace did order the studv and di- rect the ICC to provide staff help. the executive or- der he signed was supplied by Beasley and stamped official only after the lieutenant governor's repeated proddings. according to Wallace's aides. Beasley says the work done by the ICC is fully jus- tified. since it does result in service to the people of the state. Critics. such as Rep. Larry Morris of Alexander City and Sen. Sid McDonald of Arab. have charged that the legislature did not create or appropriate money to the ICC for those purposes and that Beas- lev has managed to get himself a full-time staff at the taxpavers expense—not to promote in- tergovernmental cooperation. but to promote the image of Jere Beasley. The law, Tit. 55, Sec. 373 (58). setting up the ICC States the agency is to assist officials and emploves of all branches of state government in developing and maintaining “‘friendly contact’ with officials and employes of other states. of the federal govern- ment and of local governments. Beasley has argued long and loud that the govern- ment bureaucracy has grown to an unwieldy size and is not accountable to the people who finance it. Others are saying the same thing now about the lieu- tenant governor's own little fiefdom czlled the In- tergovernmental Cooperation Commission. July 25, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Hostage Budget | By MARCIA. KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Thursday night a woman from out of* town ran into the state Senator who represents her district as she was leaving a Montgomery restaurant. Unfortu- nately for the senator, Earlier that day she had visited the halls of the Alabama Legislature for the first time, and, al- though she was quite cordial and pleasant in chat- ting with the senator, she did keep’ raising one stum- per of a question: “Why?” “That's all I want to know, is why,” she repeated several times, The lady was not stupid. By her job and her con- Versation and her over all bearing it was obvious that this was an educated woman, a woman fairly ~ alert to what goes on in the world. She had spent part of the day sitting in the bal. conies that overlook the legislative chambers, but, despite her education and societal awareness, she was unable to understand, the logic of the scenes that unfolded before her eyes, ~ It's impossible to say exactly what the woman did see or how she perceived it, but here are some of the things that happened on that Thursday, the third to last day of the 1976 session and a not particularly atypical day in the legislature. Perhaps the most paradoxical part of the day . Would Have been watching both the House and Sen- ate blithely perform routine chores and debate and pass primarily non-controversial legislation, appar- ently ignoring the need to address the general fund budget which finances most non-education functions of state government. Sens. Bingham Edwards of Decatur and John Baker of Rainsville both complained that the reason the House hadn't taken up the budget was because House members wanted to force the Senate into adopting its choice of a schedule for the last two days of the session. The budget was a hostage and acquiescence to House demand was the ransom, they said. It must have been difficult for the woman, and for other gallery observers uninitiated in the ways of Alabama legislating, to understand how something as apparently insignificant as when to meet could hold up passage of a multi-million dollar budget. Strange that the House would imprison the budget over the schedule, but equally inexplicable that the Senate would refuse to negotiate the schedule, which prompted the House action in the first place, and would have brought release of the budget in the sec- ond. Edwards and Baker loudly, publicly and repe- atedly chastised the House for its irresponsibility, although the attitude was not exactly shared by their fellow senators, In fact, the two and small cadre ot cohorts had to filibuster to prevent the Senate trom adopting the schedule desired by the House. The situation looked incredibly grim, when Lt. . Goy, Jere Beasley pronounced: a’ 10-minute recess * and escorted Edwards and Baker back to his office ~ for a private tete-a-tete. When the three returned, lo and behold, Sens. Ed: wards and Baker found their point of principle to - have vanished, their indignation suddenly dis- sipated. The Senate quickly adopted the meeting schedule desired by the House. As it turned out later (and this would have been to- ‘tally unbeknownst to gallery observers), Lt Gov. Beasley had informed the two protesting senators that a bill they wanted the House to kill, a bill that was a local issue in Edwards’ home district. indeed would be killed in the House. If the woman in the balcony scooted across the ro- tunda to observe House. action after the Senate adopted the new schedule, she would have seen an- . other surprising event: the House immediately set aside other business and took up the budget, despite righteous denials of House leaders that they had ~ made no demands of any nature. The senator verbally accosted by his constituent in the aisle of a Montgomery restaurant at 10 p.m. that night naturally did not even attempt to explain the fine points of political maneuvering and motiva- . tion in the Alabama Legislature to a rational human being who hasn't felt the ambition and pride and , thirst for power that make people run for public of: fice.

        "ocr_text": "Filibusters Cost Private Schools By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Senate broke a long tradition of partially financing five private schools Monday, when a suc- cession of filibusters consumed the last six hours of the day and ended the 1976. legislative session on a discordant note. When the Senate adjourned sine die at midnight, without stopping the. clock for a few more minutes or hours of action, the appropriations and sev- eral other, more controversial bills, diedon the calendar of business. Those bills, which prompted filibus- ters both by opponents and by suppor- ters who protested the Senate's failure to consider them, included the ‘‘lid law’’ that would clamp a ceiling on new ad valorem tax revenue gener- ated from property reassessment, the proposed severance tax on coal, a fire- man’s pension plan, and the con- firmation of Henry Gray's appoint- ment as a general in the Alabama Na- tional Guard. Although the filibuster that took up most of the night supposedly was aimed at Gray, the administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, some participating senators actually were seeking to kill other bills. The schools that will be without state allocations are Walker Junior College, Lyman Ward Military Academy, Tus- kegee Institute, Marion Institute and Talladega College. Sen. Robert Wilson of Jasper in Walker County promised at the close of the session that he will be back when the legislature returns in February with a bill for double the $325,000 allo- cation proposed this session. It was Russellville Sen. Joe Fine who finally killed the allocations and the 1976 session. The filibuster against Gray had been set aside about 11:50 p.m. in order to bring up the money bills, but Fine grabbed the micro- phone and talked away the last 10 min- utes of the night. After a full day of tending to busi- ness, the filibusters finally erupted when Sen. John Baker rose to protest the Senate’s refusal to bring up the lid law.” ; Baker’s filibuster was interrupted, however, when Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley announced several messages from Gov. George C. Wallace that had been | reported to the full Senate by the Rules Committee. Such messages take pre- cedence over other action, at what- ever time the presiding officer wishes to bring them before the body. The messages were appointments the governor had sent for Senate con- firmation, and a handful were con- firmed before the upper chamber reached the nomination of Gray, who is administrator of the Alcoholic Bev- erage Control Board and a colonel in the Guard. Earlier the nomination had been de- layed in the Rules Committee, which’ failed to take any action on the nomi- nation at its 8 a.m. meeting, since no member made a motion for action. Later, however, at an impromptu and unannounced session, the com- mittee did vote to send Gray's appoint- ment to the full Senate. Sen. Ronnie Flippo of Florence said he made the af- firmative motion at the second meet- ing after Gray himself had requested it. Flippo said he did not act earlier be- cause no one had asked him to support the nomination. On the Senate floor Sen. Mayer “Mike” Perloff of Chickasaw was the main adversary, saying his opposition was prompted by an incident related to the ABC Board. Perloff said Gray had assured him a private club license in whicb he was in- terested would be granted, but it ulti- mately was denied by the board. Perloff said that when he attempted to call Gray to learn what happened, Gray refused to speak with him on the telephone. “If he doesn’t have enough guts to cE : iz Advertiser Photo by Roger Wentowski Sen. John Baker Filibusters in Front of Nearly Empty Senate Chamber answer the telephone, he doesn't have enough guts to be a general,’’ Perloff said. Sen. L.D. “Dick” Owen of Bay Min- ette said he would join Perloff in the filibuster, and at one point the two cast the only votes in favor of postponing and killing the nomination. Owen said earlier,when the proposal was before the Rules Commitee of which he is a member, that he objected to the fact that Gray has never served on active duty and to his spending only four of five work days a week on his ABC Board job. Gray also was involved in Owen's 1974 bid for re-election, — supporting the senator's opponent. Perhaps the most distraught sena- tors over the stalling tactics were those with private schools in their home districts, schools that normally receive a state stipend for operations. Those appropriations had not vet re- ceived final Senate approval when the at _ was stopped by the talk- teste Also concerned, once again, were the throngs of firemen lining the Sen- ate gallery throughout the day to show their support of a firemen’s pension bill that has been proposed repeatedly over the past several years, but never won approval. Fire insurance pre- miums would be raised to help finance the retirement plan. Baker’s filibuster regarding the ‘‘lid law’? was sparked after his several un- successful attempts to bring up the bill for debate. Earlier in the day Baker had at- tempted to have the bill placed on one of several special order calendars, which list the bills to be considered, but his effort was fruitless. “If you adopt a special order calen- dar of this length at this hour, you have in effect killed the ‘lid law’ and any hope of softening the blow of ad valo- rem -taxation,” Baker said. Both senators favoring and opposing the ‘‘lid law’’ lined up against Baker, supporting the unamended calendar of 20 bills. Most of those bills, like most of the others passed Monday, had stirred little controversy, so the majority wanted to act on them before facing the tax measure and others likely to bring time-consuming disputes and August 17, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Senators Productive on By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Senate made its last day of the session the most productive of the year Monday, passing dozens of bills before stalling on a filibuster. Working steadily from 7 a.m. till 5:30 p.m., interrupted only by a lunch - break, the Senate passed much of the remaining major legislation in- troduced in 1976, including the bills most ardently desired by Gov. George C. Wallace. , The administration-endorsed bills include the $25 million bond issue to fi- nance relocation of three bridges along the Tennessee-Tombighee Wa- terway now being developed, the $12 million bond issue for expansion of the —Prohibit recipients from divesting themselves of assets for a period of one year prior to becoming eligible for Me- dicaid assistance, which is an effort to stop recipients from turning over as- sets to their families in order to meet eligibility income requirements. —Require recipients to pay $1 for each doctor’s visit, while presently they pay nothing. —Make it a felony to falsify any Me- dicaid claim or application to the pro- gram. —Grant immunity from civil liabil- ity to persons investigating Medicaid fraud, in any legal action stemming from the investigation. The Senate also gave final passage Monday to bills that would do the fol- lowing: coal-handling facility at the Mobile state docks, and a package of five bills aimed at cutting costs and reducing fi- nancial abuse of the Medicaid pro- gram. : The bond issue for the bridge work is in the form of a constitutional amend- ment, since it will be amortized from general state revenues, and must be approved by the voters in referendum. Although the Senate did make some amendments in those bills, the House concurred with all the changes and sent the legislation to Gov. Wallace for his signature. Anything passed on the final day of the session can be pocket vetoed by the governor, simply by his failure to sign it. As has happened on many, if not tered nurses with proper training and licensing will be able to deliver babies in hospitals. —Credit toward his prison sentence the amount of time a convicted crimi- nal spent in local jail pending trial and conviction. —Direct the State Department of Education to condmct a study on the feasibility and cost of establishing a most, of the 30 legislative days of the | 1976 session, conducted over the past 105 calendar days as stipulated In the constitutional amendment estab- lishing annual sessions this year, the upper chamber did finally get bogged .down in a filibuster Monday evening. That was sparked by Rainsville Sen. John Baker’s protest against the Sen- ate's refusal to take up the con- troversial ‘“‘lid law,’’ which would place a ceiling on the amount of new revenue generated from ad valorem taxes due to the current property reas- sessment program. Among the bills passed before Baker stalled further action was the Medi- - caid package,which included legisla- tion to do the following: prisons. —Expand the programs of the Ala- bama Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville to include study, research and exhibits concerning energy re- sources. —Change the name of the Depart- ment of Publicity and Information to Department of Travel.

        "ocr_text": "Tactics Baffle Campaigners By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Despite ebullent promises that “‘we’re going to run a traditional, all out: Democratic campaign,’’ party leaders learned Thursday that the 1976 fall election season may be short on Alabama tradition. Not only Alabama politicians, and not only Democrats, are scratching their heads in wonder as campaigning gears up, waiting for answers that could make this an unusual election in- deed. For example, Julian Butler of Hunt- sville, the party loyalist serving as state campaign coordinator, warned grass roots organizers at their initial gathering that they’d best not use the names or photos of the Democratic standard bearers yet, or they ay end up in the cooler. “It might come ‘to (our) saying, ‘Vote for the Democratic candidate for president,’ without mentioning his name,” Butler said. And, State Democratic Chairman Robert Vance told how the Birming- ham advertising firm of Luckie and Forney, a political tradition in itself here, already has purchased billboard space across the state on behalf of the Alabama party, but nobody knows what to paste up on the boards. The party might be able to grace them with the face of Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter, but then again it might not. The questions stem from the as yet untried portions of the federal elec- tions law pertaining to the national The presidential campaigns are lim- ited under the law to spending about $20 million each, which comes from the federal government, and Vance and his counterparts around the nation are wondering how that impacts on the state campaign efforts financed local- ly and not directly tied to the national organizations. The question of promoting national candidates with local money has been submitted to the Federal Elections Commission, and, as Butler warned Thursday, the locals had better not take any chances till getting definitive word from the FEC. “Four years ago it looked like Presi- dent Nixon more or less tried to buy the presidency,’’ Vance said at a cam- paign kick-off rally earlier: in the. day. ‘‘Congress may have over-reacted with the stringent federal regu- lations.” The state committee definitely may spend $1,000 promoting the Carter- Mondale ticket, and each county , mittee may spend the same ml Vance said the party has no limitation on spending for what he called ‘“‘the Democratic campaign” here, as dis- tinguished from the Carter campaign. Taking no chances, or a slim one at best, the state party opened its cam- paign season with buttons and posters and cardboard auto tags that make no mention of Carter. What they do show, and apparently what will be a main symbol of Ala- bama campaign for Democrats, is a peanut eating an elephant—a reversal of the comment emanating from the GOP National Convention this week that “elephants eat peanuts. The promotions also bear the words, “I'm a Democrat.” Emphasized throughout the day of partisan activities, beginning with the rally, then a dutch-treat luncheon fol- lowed by the actual organizing work session, was that Alabama Democrats finally are unified behind a single ban- ner this year, and will be working for all candidates from the presidency on down. ' The ambitious slogan for that effort. is: ‘A clean sweep, from the courthouse to the White House.” “You have to go back to the days of FDR to find this kind of situation,” Vance said, citing the state party uni- fied behind a national party that is ‘‘in the mainstream’ of American poli- tics. Gov. George C. Wallace; a main ral- ly speaker who in earlier years had produced some of the party divisions to which Vance alluded, emphasized that Alabama's past politics helped bring the rest of the nation to the brink of accepting a Southernor for their chief elected official. “If we don’t take if for granted, we can see a man from the Deep South elected president,” Wallace said. His concern over taking a Demo- cratic success for granted was echoed briefly by Jim Free, the Tennessean assigned by the Carter national cam- paign to coordinate Alabama, Mis- Sissippi and Tennessee politicking, August 20, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Between Wallace. Legislature Adviser Finds Liaison Role Hectic By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer One of the most sought after men in Alabama state government these days is Bill Jackson. . Young, pipe-smoking, unruffled throughout the phone calls, messages and personal visitors who interrupt his workday, Jackson is the legal ad- viser to Gov. George C. Wallace whose primary duty right now is sifting through the piles of legis- ‘*Normally I know what’s in them (bills) by now,’’ Jackson said, al- though legislation amended or substituted at the last minute on the .House or Senate floor sometimes presents a need for closer analysis. At this point, with nearly 500 bills approved on the last two days of the session that ended one week ago, Jackson doesn’t have time to look for clerical errors, but concentrates on substan- tive provisions of the leg- islation. Most of those bills are local legislation affecting only one city or county. While Jackson says the governor’s office doesn’t like to meddle with local matters. sometimes there is no choice. There was the cigarete tax last year that prompted a dispute among the Jefferson County legislative dele- gation, county local offi- cials, and Birmingham city fathers. After as much deliber- lation passed the last two days of the 1976 session. It is Jackson who analyzes the scores of bills stacked on his desk and presents to Wallace the case for signing or pocket vetoing them. Jackson relays to the governor the views and wishes of state depart- ment officials, legisla- tors and local office-hold- ers who sometimes ar- dently desire that the leg- islation be written into the lawbooks, and some- ation’ as possible, Wal- lace decided not to sign the tax bill. He had to call his decision from Rome, | however, having left im- mediately after the 1975 session ended for a Eu- ropean tour. That, Jackson recalls, was a rough post-session period. 3 Besides dealing with local battles, Jackson also must hear the pleas of ‘‘losing’’ legislators who saw local bills pass _ despite their opposition. The classic case is seen this year in the bill op- posed by Rep. Marilyn Quarles of Springville, who managed to tie up al- most the entire last night of the session in the House in retaliation for passage of a local bill granting a raise to a judge. Now she wants the goyv- ernor to pocket veto it, al- though other members of the delegation and local governing offiials want it signed. There also are cases of sponsors of legislation _ times adamantly oppose the same. Wallace has until mid- night Thursday to act, and anything unsigned by that time will die un- der terms of the pocket veto that cannot be over- ridden by a legislature which is not in session. “Usually the bad mis- takes are caught prior to this time,’’ Jackson said Monday. ‘‘We notify the (legislative) committees and they correct the er- rors.”’ who, for one reason or an- other, want their bills killed. Sometimes they change their minds or are convinced by local of- ficials to reverse their stand, but there also are lawmakers who never really wanted the laws passed in the first place- They simply had to make a public effort. The duty of giving bills a final scrutiny and deal- ing with all those people who want a say in wheth- er they live or die is not exactly a nine to five job. ‘‘T watched the Re- publican Convention while I was reviewing bills,” Jackson said. And, he also must deal with a governor who has other things to do and oth- er interests than bills. “T’ll take whatever time is necessary to get them done,’’ Jackson said, ‘‘including stacking them up, taking them to the Governor’s Mansion and getting him to sign them in bed.”’ A special advisory committee, including the legal adviser and reve- nue and finance officials, meets with Wallace throughout the session to scrutinize bills as they are introduced. Some legislation re- quires additional input from department offi- cials having a better knowledge of the subject matter. For example, a bill dealing with health is checked by the Health Department.

        "ocr_text": "Is Beasley Target OF Wallace, Vance? By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace and State Democratic Chairman Robert Vance are sealing their relatively new al- liance with a joint effort some politi. cians believe is aimed at toppling Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley. The clearest manifestation of the Wallace-Vance partnership to date is the current struggle over the Demo- cratic nomination for the Dist. 25 Sen- ate seat, vacated by the federal mail fraud conviction of former Sen, ELC. “tum” Foshee, Both Wallace aides and Vance lieu- tenants are urging members of the State Democratic Exe cutive Com- mittee to select Enterprise veterinarian Dr, Wallace Miller, a staunch Wallace supporter, The state committee will chose the nominee because Wallace called the general election on the vacancy with too little time to permit a primary election, Some of the 129 committee members said they received calls on Miller’s be- half Tuesday, the day ballots were, to be mailed to them, from Wallace oper. ative Mickey Griffin and from Al LaP- ierre, an aide to Vance at Democratic state headquarters. Don Gilbert, a member of the governor's staff, also reportedly made telephone calls in support of Miller, Also seeking the Dist, 25 nomination is Mrs, Jo Ann Foshee, who would be expected to follow the lead of her for- mer senator husband in joining forces with Beasley if she became a Senate member, Although two other candidates, State Rep, Jimmy Holley of Elba and Coffee County Democratic Committee member Neal Atkison of Enterprise, also are in the contest, most comments from the Wallace and Vance forces center on Miller and Mrs, Foshee, Some committee members see Vance's participation as mainly an ef- fort to keep Wallace aligned with the Democratic ranks, at least for the du- ration of the fall national campaign. Other members and political ob- servers envision a longer range al- liance designed to impact on the 1978 gubernatorial election, with the Wal- lace and Vance camps supporting the expected candidacy of Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley, rather than that of Beasley, who also is likely to run. One committee member lobbied by Griffin in Miller's behalf Tuesday said the former presidential campaign aide to Wallace “gave me to under- stand that Gov. Wallace and Mr, : Vr\"e saw eye to eye.” ‘.@ said, Griffin's basic argument was that the committee should not feel bound to give a job ‘‘to relatives of law breakers” simply because of family fi- nancial troubles, That was a reference to the money bind the Foshees began experiencing even before criminal charges were leveled against the for- mer senator. “I think Mr. Vance is doing every- thing he can to have a unified party in Alabama,” said the committeeman, who preferred to remain anonymous. “We're a lot better off with Mr. Wal- lace in our party.” He also characterized the support of Miller as a joint anti-Beasley effort. LaPierre was quoted by another committee member as citing the gov- ernor's SUPpOrt Of Muuer, and adging that ‘‘we are in agreement with him.” LaPierre also supposedly said a rea- son to vote for Miller was to bring a “better balance” to the Senate, which is weighted heavily with Beasley sup: porters. ; Wallace and Beasley have main- tained a feud for several years, and the governor has faced serious difficulty in securing Senate passage of adminis- tration legislation. Wallace and Vance also have had their share of battles, but Wallace’s stinging defeat in his 1974 effort to un- seat Vance as state chairman brought a truce that was uneasy at first, Since the governor has pledged support to the Democratic national ticket this year, the two have been more than amicable, Meanwhile, concern has been issued in other quarters that Wallace and Vance will team up again in attempts to name Democratic nominees for two more expected Senate vacancies, if Sen. Ronnie Flippo of Florence wins election to Congress and Sen. C.C. “BO” Torbert of Opelika becomes Ala- bama Supreme Court chief justice in the Nov, 2 ballotting. State Executive Committee mem- bers must return ballots in the nomi- nation for the Foshee vacancy by next Tuesday, August 25, 1976 \f"

George _C. Wallace does not deny she may attempt in 1978 to exchange her role as gracious first lady and chief hostess of the state for. the job of Alabama’ s chief execu- tive. She said in a recent Interview that she has not yet decided. There also is the ‘possibility, ‘growing more probable by the - ‘I just think it would be marvelous if we could retire and go to some sunshiny little village in Key West, but I cannot im- agine the man out of the political element.’ Cornelia and Lee Wallace Washington and the U.S. Senate 1978, when his days at the Capitol here are terminated by the legal sanction against another succes- sive term in office. He says he has not yet decided. Mrs. Wallace has been quoted as saying that those disparate ambitions do not conflict, that a family can be maintained, some- times better than otherwise, with two public officials based in two different cities some 1,000 miles apart. Speaking in the Governor's Mansion informal dining room last week, however, Mrs. Wal- lace was reluctant and vague in discussing the politics in her own future, citing family needs as her foremost interest. ‘‘My primary concern right this minute is getting my chil- dren through these teen-age years. This year particularly, and next year,’ she said. What about after next year? “Well, I don’t know. I don’t deny I’m interested in politics. I love it,’ she said. “But there’s a lot ‘of difference in being a mem- ber of the League of Women Vot- ers, serving on a committee, or even being . . . a member of the House of Representatives, and in taking on the full responsibility of the governor’s office.” The children, her two boys and the governor’s daughter from previous marriages, are aged 12, 13 and 15, and Mrs. Wallace said those are not “stabilized” id August 29, 1976 > \fCornelia “Pll have to see how things go,’’ she said. ‘“‘It would not please me to be successful at achieving the governor’s office, and be a failure as a mother, or feel that I was.” Most political observers and participants rate Mrs. Wallace’s chances for success in that race quite low, if only because they believe Alabamians feel the time has come to end the Wallace dy- nasty that has ruled government here for 11 of the last 13 years through the present governor's three administrations and the figurehead leadership of his late first wife Lurleen. Mrs. Wallace was not so cer- tain, jokingly citing her high Name recognition as a plus and the fact that her name would ap- pear near the end of the ballot as a minus, but adding that a serious assessment couldn’t be made without running some polls. Mrs. Wallace was encouraged that so many women have real- ized success in state politics, in- cluding Lurleen Wallace, even though she was obviously a stand-in for George Wallace. “I really was surprised myself that the people elected Lurleen,”’ she said. ‘‘I did not think the men of Alabama would vote for a woman, would allow a woman to be elected governor. And I was wrong. “I knew George was a political genius, that he could pull it off if anybody could, but I just didn’t think it would happen.” She also said she is proud that women can be elected in Ala- bama because it impresses out- of-staters, whom she believes “probably think we're a little backward or a little narrow- minded.”’ Despite the ‘act that women can indeed win elective office in Alabama, Mrs. Wallace stresses that she is keenly 2ware of her obligations as a mother and ex- presses fears that the long work hours with official dinners at night and frequent weekend events could seriously cut into fulfillment of those obligations. Mrs. Wallace expresses sim- : jlar family concerns about life in Washington, should Gov. Wal- lace seek and win election to the Senate seat likely to be vacated by the retirement of U.S. Sen. John Sparkman in 1978, Although she said only one of the children wants to live in Washington, and questioned whether a senator’s salary would be sufficient to support the fami- ly and the special needs of her paraplegic husband in the costly nation’s capital, Mrs. Wallace said she would go with him to strike out on a new tangent in an already long-lived political ca- reer. That, apparently, is assuming she does not decide to embark upon her own Career in politics. ‘We were discussing it one night and he (Gov. Wallace) said, ‘Well, I guess I’d put you on my payroll,’ and I said, ‘I would not be put on your payroll,’’’ Mrs Wallace said. ‘‘So I would have to work probably.”’ That is the course many con- gressional wives have followed. and Mrs. Wallace says her in- terests and abilities are varied enough that she believes she could find a job without great dif- ficulty. The author of one book that is selling moderately well, she mentioned further writing as a possibility, and suggested her fa- miliarity with politics and gov- ernment might suit her for public relations or political consulting work. “I love the campaigns,”’ she said. . As for whether Gov. Wallace will undertake yet another cam- paign, this time for the Senate, his wife could not say. “It’s the most obvious thing for him to do, I think. It’s the only available thing for him to do po- litically,”” she said. ‘I just think it would be marvelous if we could retire and go to some sunshiny little village in Key West, but 1 cannot imagine the man out of the political element. Of course he’ll make that decision, like he does all of them, and then I’ll read about it in the paper.”’ August 29, 1976 (Continued) \f"

Mrs. Cornelia Wallace | may be what’s known in Alabama as a ‘“‘yeHow dog.

But the governor’s wife side- steps partisan talk when dis- cussing the wives of the Demo- cratic and Republican con- tenders for the’ presidency. In fact, sitting at the oval table in the Governor's Mansion din- “jng room for an interview, Mrs. Wallace expressed an _ enthusias- tic appreciation for Republican Betty Ford and. her performance _ thus far as first lady. ‘Becoming reflective at first, : hesitating and stirring once again a still untasted glass of assessed that iced tea, she final Mrs. Ford’s contribution to her country might be a bit more in- tangible than beautification or other pet projects of prior first ladies. “It’s a sense or feeling that a woman can hold that position and be married to a man and still not be an extension of him.

I guess maybe I’ve been around politics a little too much .. . but I just don't believe that I’d voice opin- ions like that,’’ Mrs. Wallace said. ‘After all this is his (Gov. Wal- lace’s) career, and if I can’t help him, for gosh sakes, I shouldn't hurt him,’’ she added. BE et wowele Ss And yet, she again character- ized Mrs. Ford as an inspiration, an example proving that women “can go on and do and be and ex- press themselves in their own li- festyle, which may be totally dif- ferent from their: husbands’.”’ Despite her open adulation of Mrs. Ford, it is Jimmy and Ros- lynn Carter who Mrs. Wallace is working to make the next resi- dents of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave- nue, Mrs. Wallace sits on the Na- tional Democratic Party’s cam- paign steering committee, and shuffled through her scattered notes of committee meetings as she turned her attention to the fa- vored candidate and his wife. “He has a lot of respect for her, for her opinions,’ Mrs. Wallace said, noting that as Georgia gov- ernor he placed Mrs. Carter unofficially in charge of the state’s mental health programs. ‘‘She’s a very competent wom- an who is very efficient and has areas of interest of her own that are very worthwhile,’ Mrs. Wal- lace said, predicting that if Mrs. Carter does become the first lady, she will evidence ‘‘very in- teresting, deep involvement in some programs.”’ August 29, 1976 (Sidebar) \f"

Wallace admitted S Wednesday that tapes and a recording E evice had been discovered in his bed room, and characterized the incident asa “purely domestic” one “‘involving me and my wife” After ilveting a relatively brief statement at a 6 p.m. press confer: ence, during which he claimed no po- litical motive was involved in the apparent bugging of the Governor's Mansion, Wallace refused to answer reporters’ inquiries regarding specif: ies of the situation, His statement came in response to rumors which have been rampant across the state over the past month, and even have spread to other corners of the country, about apparent marital difficulties between him and his wife Cornelia, and, more spécifically, about a reported tap that she placed on his bedroom telephone, Tn an interview with The Advertiser on Aug. 26, Mrs, Wallace basically de nied the rumored taping. \" haven't heard that one,” she said when asked directly whether she had been involved in secretly taping her husband's conversations, \"T think you ought to ask my huss band about that,” she said, “Afterall, he is the governor of the state,” She also said she believed the media September 9, 1976 > \fwas being ‘used’ by unnamed per- son,” claiming she had heard that as many as 100 anonymous telephone calls had been placed to news media representatives suggesting she had lett Gov. Wallace. Mrs. Wallace indicated she believed someone was attempting to harm her or her reputation by floating such ru- mors, possibly for political reasons. Information from that interview and other rumor reports were not publish: ed in The Advertiser, because they re- mained unsubstantiated and because Mrs, Wallace denied knowledge of the taping tale. On Wednesday, Gov. Wallace ex: pressed appreciation to his wife for the ald and support she supplied him fol- lowing the 1972 attempt on his life in Laurel, Md., which has left him para- lyzed from the waist down, and ex- pressed anger at the news media for publishing and broadcasting reports that the state's first family was es- tranged. Wallace said he had seen and heard accounts of the reported separation, but added that at the time those re- ports were circulating Mrs. Wallace was in Florida with his daughter Lee, his youngest child from a previous marriage. “On recent matters, there were some tapes and a device—purely do- mestic, all that was involved,” he said. Gov. Wallace said the tapes, of un- specified number and content, have been destroyed. “This happened in my bedroom. be- {ween me and my wife,’ he said, “What happens between me and my Wile. as long as it doesn’t affect the state of Alabama or my service as gov- ernor, remains the business of me and my wife.” Wallace did not directly state that his wife had been involved in the secret taping, claiming only that the entire incident was “purely domestic.” Then, and throughout his informal comments, Wallace emphasized that politics was not involved in the situ- ation and that no political motive for the tapings existed. He admitted he is aware of talk that Mrs. Wallace is interested in running for governor in 1978, when his term ex- pires and he cannot seek re-election, but said he does not know whether his wife will run. “If she does, I would be as strong for her as 1 was for my first wife,” Wal- lace said, referring to the late Gov. Lurleen Wallace, who ran essentially as a stand-in for Gov, Wallace in 1966. At that time a governor was prohibited by the Alabama Constitution from suc- ceeding himself in office, and Gov.. - Wallace had served the term before — (ov. Lurleen Wallace was elected, The possibility of his present wife, running for governor in 1978 apparent: ly was the political motivation to which Wallace referred by denying it existed. “It’s difficult to solve domestic mat- ters under all the trying circum: stances, especially if you are in poli- ties,” Wallace said. “I think we can better resolve what differences we might have, if any, by the press ac- cepting what I'm saying, that this was purely a domestic matter and nothing else and that no one has been harmed, no one has been offended, and that's that,” . The governor said he personally re- sents the fact that some have attribut: ed political motives to the surrep- titious tapings, although he did not in- dicate what motivation might have prompted the action, and emphasized that he appreciates ‘‘that my wife has done much for me when I was ill.” “There ain't no questions for you to ask. I've covered it all,” Wallace em- phatically told reporters, He did ask whether there was any- thing else reporters wanted to know, but when one asked what type of recording device was involved in the tapings, Wallace snapped back: “That's irrelevant.” “If you folks in the press would leave us alone in a domestic matter,” he said, “we'll solve it a lot quicker,” No further queries were put to him from reporters. Rumors about a possible split be- tween Gov. and Mrs. Wallace, an at: tractive 37-year-old, began circulating in mid August, and sources extremely close to the governor reported that his wife was not staying at the Governor's Mansion and that her personal staff had been relieved of their duties. It is reliably known that the Mansion domestic help and other staff were subjected to lie detector tests follow. ing discovery of the tapes and record- er, During that period in August Gov. Wallace dined out alone a number of times, and Mrs. Wallace frequently was out of town, She told several per- sons that she could be reached at the home of her cousin, Rachel Folsom Lichenstein, 1513 §, Perry St., Montgom- ery. Mrs. Lichenstein is the daughter of former Gov. James E. Folsom, and Mrs, Wallace is his niece. After Gov. Folsom's first wife died, his sister Ruby Austin served for a time as first lady, living in the Mansion with Corn- elia, who is her daughter and Folsom’s niece, Gov. and Mrs, Wallace are sched- uled to host a reception at the Mansion Thursday for Mrs. Rosalynn Carter, the wife of Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter.

        "ocr_text": "Cornelia Silemt Bbout Favesdrop By MARCIA KUNSTEL And GREG MacARTHUR Advertiser Staff Writers Mrs. George Wallace went public Thursday, but only to show her face at the Governor's Mansion reception for Mrs. Rosalynn Carter. Mrs. Wallace refused to answer reporters’ questions about her husband's disclosure one day earlier that secret tapings had been made in his bedroom. Also Thursday, U.S. Atty. Ira De- Ment said FBI agents conducted a pre- liminary investigation of the taping system on Wednesday, but concluded the Secret eavesdropping “appears to be purely domestic and the taps ap- pear not to have been placed by profes- sionals.” Mrs. Wallace stuck close by the side of her husband, Gov. George C. Wal- lace, throughout most of the afternoon event at the Mansion, avoiding report- ers and refusing to respond to in- quiries. Prior to the arrival of Mrs. Carter, who came to campaign on behalf of her husband Jimmy Carter, the Demo- cratic presidential nominee, Mrs. Wallace remained closeted inside the Mansion, mingling with state politi- cians and other dignitaries here for the reception. The formal dining room where she stood behind a glass door was off-lim- its to reporters, and Mrs. Wallace didn’t emerge to the south porch until Mrs. Carter arrived and the in- troductions began. Clad in a shimmery, salmon-colored dress, Mrs. Wallace smiled seldom while standing next to her husband's wheelchair throughout Mrs. Carter's press conference on the porch. When the press conference closed, one reporter asked whether Mrs. Wal- ‘lace would respond to questions. Billy Joe Camp, the governor’s press secre- tary, said she would not, and Mrs, Car- ter immediately ended the session by Saying other guests were awaiting her appearance inside. The entourage did emerge again a short time later, and Mrs. Carter made a few brief remarks to the stand- ing crowd. In a final effort to elicit some com- ment from Mrs. Wallace, another re- porter called out a question about why she had taped her husband’s conversa- tions, but the governor's wife imme- diately turned her back and dis- appeared through the milling bodies. Both the governor and his wife wore expressions of displeasure when the questions were raised. The event was the first time the state’s first couple appeared in public together since Gov. Wallace's office birthday party Aug. 25. It also was Mrs. Wallace's first confrontation with reporters and the public since her husband admitted Wednesday that tapes and a recording device had been His disclosure came in the midst of rampant rumors that the governor and his wife were having marital prob- lems and that Mrs. Wallace had been secretly tapping his bedroom phone. Gov. Wallace did not say directly that Mrs. Wallace had instigated the surreptitious tapings,, but said the matter was ‘‘purely domastic.”’ U.S. Atty. DeMent agreed. He said Thursday that the tapping probably violated federal law, but that he would not pursue the matter because ‘‘it ap- pears to be purely domestic.” “At the request of Gov. Wallace, and with my concurrence, no further in- vestigation will be conducted at this time, although it may have been a technical violation of the law,”’ De- Ment said. He declined to comment on the mo- tive for the bugging or the kind of elec- tronic equipment used. The Advertiser also received con- firmation Thursday that Gov. Wallace first initiated surveillance on his wife, and that her action came in retaliation. Among the information Mrs. Wal- lace gleaned from the tapes, accord- ing to highly reliable sources, was the fact that Gov. Wallace had been call- ing several long-time female friends from the Capitol and making dis- paraging comments about his wife. That news, the sources said, prompted Mrs. Wallace to contact a lawyer about divorce proceedings, which was the same move the gover- nor made upon learning that his tele- phone had been tapped.

Earlier, Mrs. Carter was introduced to reporters by Gov. George C.

At a brief press conference Mrs. Carter said the influx of family mem- bers to Alabama—a son was here La- bor Day, the candidate will appear Monday, and his aunt will arrive for two days of stumping later this Month—was not prompted by a special concern for the political sentiments of Alabamians. ‘“‘We’re campaigning everywhere,”’ she said. ‘‘The bigger mandate we can get, the easier it will be for Jimmy to get his programs through (Con- gress).”” ‘‘People ask me every day if we're g°lng to campaign in the South,’’ Mrs. Carter said. ‘‘We're not only going to campaign in the South, we’re going to _take the South with us.’’ sion crowds and ‘later went the hand- shaking route at Montgomery.

By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Mrs. James Earl Carter may be the perfect politi- cal wife, as long as you grade her by the standards of the old school. ; She is not a controversial lady—doesn't disagree with her husband in public, doesn’t make outrageous (but highly quotable) statements, doesn't indulge in spur of the moment whims to do something simply because she wants to do it. Something that might be silly or exciting or fun. When Rosalynn Carter speaks to outsiders, wheth- er a rally crowd or in an interview such as she granted to The Advertiser here last week, she em- ploys the first person plural as frequently as or more often than she uses the singular. Because her husband Jimmy Carter, the Demo- cratic presidential nominee, has chosen to make his campaign a family affair, Mrs. Carter also has be- come somewhat of a pro at working the crowds at a shopping center or rally and at fielding with aplomb the questions flung at her by reporters. She has made the interview-press conference scene so many times, in fact, that it almost seems Mrs. Carter has a storehouse of answers for any giv- en question, as does any experienced politician. The basic response may be the same to whomever is ior cn views that vary from those of her husband. Although that usually is the course followed by political wives. Mrs, Carter has been primed to the point that she virtually provides an exact duplicate of Jimmy Car- ter’s statements. She often says, however, that “we decided’ or “we believe.’ when responding to issues questions. Admitting that the two often disagree and argue. Mrs. Carter said their disputes are resolved in pri- vate in order to present a united front and to enhance chances of finally attaining that ultimate goal. The day may come-after Jimmy Carter is safely ensconced in the White House —when Mrs, Carter will diverge from the common path and offer an op- posite viewpoint, she said, but only if the issue is ex- tremely important and she. is unable to alter her hus- band’s stance. ; “T don't think this is the time for that now.” she cc ower doing the ‘sing, but she picks ont chediee which little antecdote to add for the purposes of illustration and of that personal touch. “fm glad I started campaigning in April,’ she said Thursday afternoon, ‘“‘because now I can antici- pate the questions.”’ In interviews with two different reporters. here, Mrs. Carter was asked similar questions about ad- justing to the role of political wife. She gave essentially the same answers about “growing into’’ the job through a variety of ex- periences over the years, beginning with the period when she was “raising little babies’’ far away from her family and friends when her husband was in the | U.S. Navy. She did, however, vary her accounts of events in later years, back home again in Plains, Ga., in giv- ing further examples of personally ‘‘changing to meet the circumstances’ that led to becoming a na- tionally-known figure. For example, one story she related to The Adverti- ser, but not to another reporter who had a private in- terview, regarded the Carters’ initial return to the peanut business. “When we moved back to Plains, (the town) didn’t have a restaurant.

        "ocr_text": "Courting Non-Voters By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of The Advertiser Staff They are for the most part black, young and labor- affiliated, they live in 30 of the state’s 67 counties, and they are the subject of an intense search by the Democratic party here. They are being sought, and once found, will be urged to register to vote because chances are than even they will vote Democratic. They are among the 450,000 to 500,000 Alabamians who are eligible to vote, but for some reason are not now registered and are unable to exercise one of their most fundamental constitutional privileges, according to State Rep. Antonio L. Harrison of Bir- mingham, the coordinator for the state party's voter registration project. It's not that the bicentennial spirit has infused Democratic leaders with a desire to promote patici- patory citizenship in their fellow Alabamians Rather, the prime motivation behind the national party's voter registration drive, of which the Ala- bama effort is a spin-off, is the belief that as many as two-thirds of those Americans not presently regis- tered would vote the Democratic line if they did vote. The national party also has chosen 1976 to under- take its first major registration drive in 16 years, said Harrison, because leaders think they have “a saleable product’ in the presidential ticket of Jim- my Carter and Sen. Walter Mondale. Outside those practical concerns, Carter himself holds what Harrison called a “philosophical posi- tion” that voting should be made as easy as possible for as many people as possible. Carter recently endorsed the concept of universal, automatic registration, through which virtually all. American citizens, upon reaching the proper age, would be listed as registered voters at their local courthouses upon reaching that magic birthday. State Democratic Chairman Robert Vance enthu- siastically shares Carter's view. “Registration was started to stop people from vot- ing,”” he said in an interview late last week. He cited constitutional restrictions of not so long ago against women and blacks voting, and the more locally oriented laws requiring literacy tests and poll taxes, which effectively kept large blocs of people outside the polling booth. There also remain, Vance said, restrictions such as residency requirements, or technical imped- iments such as the practice of local boards of voter registrars accepting applications only a few days each month, which still hamper the exercise of that right. “Do you realize that something like eight million voters were disfranchised nationwide last time (1972), because they didn’t live where they were sup- posed to?” he asked. By that, he meant that people had changed their addresses, perhaps moved to another state, and re- alized too late that they hadn't filed the requisite forms to restore their electoral voice. “Registration has outlived its usefulness,” Vance declared. ‘This democracy is strong enough to gov- ern itself.” To complaints that universal registration leaves too much room for fraudulent balloting, Vance re- sponds that under the present methods,.in this very State, there exists “wholesale, systematized, illegal voting.” Of the 500,000 or so Alabamians who should be but aren't registered, Vance readily admits that a sub- stantial portion simply don't care to vote. A recent study showed increasing numbers of Americans be- lieve their ballot carries little weight, that the sys- tem is so fouled up that they don’t wish to be a part of it. The Democratic chairman here said some locals undoubtedly fit that category. “But there also is a substantial part of those (unre- gistered) people who want to vote, and would if they could,” Vance said. The state party proposes to try to help them do ex- actly that, although leaders of the registration effort are taking pains to assure that as many of them as possible will vote Democratic in November. Harrison and his team have identified 30 Alabama counties “that are historically Democratic voting counties and have a high concentration of individ uals who we are inclined to believe would vote Democratic.” Those individuals include bla cks, labor, youth, and other whites who live in neighborhoods with the “right” voting pattern. Committees will be set up in each of the 30 counties to seek out those unregistered voters, tell them how to get on active status, and urge them to do it. It's all a pretty tentative process’ — not exactly universal in scope — but at least it is a start and may be the germ for expanded efforts sometime when it isn’t an election year.

The governor repeated his now-fa- miliar litany of how the Demotratic hi- erarchy used Carter to stop his own campaign in Florida and elsewhere, then encouraged him to struggle through the remaining primaries to draw votes and convention delegates from Carter. “They thought as long as | stayed in the race, every delegate I got would be taken from this deep southerner,’’ Wallace said. ‘They were trying to tie the convention up and nominate some- body like Ted Kennedy or Hubert Humphrey. I'd rather take somebody from Plains, Ga.” Even though Carter deserved the nomination by virtue of his success in the spring primaries, Wallace said, the. Democratic chieftans wanted to thwart his victory because he is from the South and outside the party's tradi- tional establishment. In explaining why his supportive au- dience should be supportive of Carter in November at the polls, Wallace did not tick off a list of the candidate's qualifications. He attested to Carter's southerness, instead. “He is a descendent of those who have known poverty and desolation and despair,”’ the governor said, re- calling the tribulations of the region he boasted now is “the most vibrant and viable” in the nation. Wallace was forceful and con- vineing throughout his 15-minute talk, drawing repeated cheers and ap- plause, Regional bias’ apparently is exactly what the Carter organization wanted Wallace to exploit in his out-of-state campaign appearance, the first the Alabama governor has ever made on behalf of another man seeking the presidency. Phil Wise, the Carter Campaign's — southern coordinator, said he and the governor discussed what remarks October 1, 1976 would be made during a ride from the local airport to the rally site. Wise found the talk quite satisfac- tory. So did David Dunn, the Montgom- erian on leave from Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley’s staff since last spring to work the hustings for Carter. Dunn, who now is Carter's Florida coordinator, said the main reason for having Wallace act as ‘‘a surrogate campaigner” was assuring local vot- ers that the governor. personally sup- ports his Georgia neighbor and wants to see him in the White House. He also noted that Wallace received 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the primary vote in panhandle counties. The southern togetherness theme also was observed by the man who in- troduced Wallace to his faithful follow- ing. Jake Wingard, a Wallace delegate to the Democratic National Convention and Crestview attorney, said the gov- ernor was the first ‘to recognize the leftward drift of the nation’ and the first “to turn the eyes of the nation to the South.” “Without the Stewardship and work of this man,” Wingard said, ‘‘a south- erner never would have had the chance to become president.’ \f"

        "ocr_text": "Auditing Beasley By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of The Advertiser Staff Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley is righteously indignant that someone should question his authority to lead the legislature through its first close inspection of the government it runs in what apparently has been many years. He has charged that someone is trying to sabotage his efforts, someone, he says, who has a vested in- terest in guarding from public view.the nooks and crannies of the bureaucracy. He has maintained a stance of perseverance, how- ever, quietly proclaiming that even if someone should forcibly knock this white knight off his horse, a battalion is charging behind him to finish the job and rid state government of its scourge. This stalwart face has been turned in response to no less a question than whether the lieutenant gover- nor might be leading the charge illegally. The question has been posed by State Auditor Bet- tye Frink, who asked whether the lieutenant gover- nor may serve and vote on a legislative committee without violating the Alabama Constitution, and she went for an official answer to Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley. The committee is the legislature’s Budget Control Subcommittee, the vehicle Beasley is using to carry his troops into battle. The reason Mrs. Frink believes Beasley may be an’ improper conductor of this vehicle is two-fold: first, the lieutenant governor constitutionally sits in the executive branch, and this extensive overlap into the lawmaking branch may breach the separation of powers doctrine, and second, the constitution also spells out only two duties to be performed by the state’s second-in-command, and those are presiding over the Alabama Senate and casting tie-breaking Votes, While Beasley says he believes this query is int- tended to roadblock his committee probe of govern- ment operations, he also has stated that he does not believe Mrs. Frink initiated the request for an attor- ney general’s opinion. Mrs. Frink, through her executive assistant Retha Deal Wynott, has denied both Beasley's in- terpretation of the motive and his charge that bas- ically the auditor is being used as a pawn by some- one else. . “We are not trying to stop any investigation,” Mrs. Wynott said in an interview late last week. “We are in favor of a close scrutiny of state agencies. He has missed the point altogether.’ The point is, she said, that the auditor also has cer- tain investigative duties and certain responsibilities for assuring public money is legally spent. The money involved is the $52 a day paid to mem- bers of Beasley's subcommittee each day they meet. The lieutenant governor did say, after news of the request for a legal opinion came out, that he no long- er was receiving pay for his subcommittee work. Mrs. Wynott indicated, however, that the auditor still is interested in obtaining the opinion for the pos- sible purpose of seeking repayment by Beasley of all the funds he has received for interim committee work both during the present probe and during the similar investigation conducted prior to the 1976 summer legislative session, She also said it was absurd to suggest that anyone else pushed Mrs. Frink into requesting the opinion, maintaining that the folks in the auditor's office “do exactly what we think we're supposed to do,’’ with- out prompting from outsiders. It may be contended that Beasley, of course, has given the auditor plenty of reason to hold him tightly to the legal line without any outside urging. He has questioned whether the auditor is per- forming all her duties, particularly in the area of property inventories, (she says she has been con- ducting them), and, more importantly, on several occasions has questioned the need for her office at all. He suggests the Examiners of Public Accounts, an arm of the legislature, easily could take over the state auditor’s functions. That apparently would re- quire a constitutional amendment, since the office is mandated in the state's organic law, but just to be certain Mrs. Frink has asked Atty. Gen, Baxley for a ruling on that matter, too. Regardless of the motive, it seems that Mrs. Frink has posed a legitimate question about Beasley ‘serving as chairman of the subcommittee. Since the lieutenant governor has cracked down on state agencies from A to Z regarding their spend- ing of state funds and the proper performance of their duties, it is ironic that he now protests a similar scrutiny involving himself. October 1, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Baxley Meets With Panel To Discuss Compromise By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer: Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley and members of a legislative budget panel met be- hind closed doors Tuesday and report: edly moved toward compromising a dispute over Baxley’s refusal to turn over office financial and employment records, Despite the caustic comriients that have passed in recent days between the attorney general and allies of Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, who chairs the Budget Control Subcommittee seeking the records, both sides characterized the 90-minute session as a cordial one. All parties were secretive regarding their discussions, although Sen. L.D. “Dick” Owen of Bay Minette said the meeting produced ‘‘some progress,” and Baxley later said he probably will make a decision Wednesday on com- piling and handing over the sought in- formation. ' Sources did report privately, how- ever, that concessions on the part of both factions were discussed, as were some apparent misunderstandings on Baxley's part regarding exactly what Statistics had been requested. Baxley has not closed his books to the subcommittee, but said in a letter to Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley last Friday that his staff does not have time to compile responses to the lengthy ques- tionaire sent to all state government departments and agencies. His refusal to comply prompted a series of heated exchanges between SECOND Che Aionlgomery Advertiser Baxley and persons associaied with the subcommittee, including Sen. Owen's threat to have the Examiners of Public Accounts subpoena the records. Owen did make a motion at Tuesday morning's subcommittee meeting to have the examiners obtain the files “by whatever means necessary,” but Montgomery Rep. Bishop Barron won approval of a substitute proposal to ap- . point a delegation to confer with the at- torney general. That resulted in the afternoon ses- sion, when Sen. Owen, Rep. Barron and Huntsville Rep. Frank Riddick called on Baxley. Sources indicated they expect the af- ternoon discussions will be related to the full subcommittee Wednesday may be taken, The meeting might not have been so “cordial” had the lawmakers been aware of comments Baxley made an hour earlier, both during and after a luncheon speech to the Kiwanis Club of Montgomery. Responding to reporters’ queries af- ter his talk, Baxley chavged that, as chairman of the subcommittee, Beas- ley is “running it strictly for political reasons,” to gain publicity and a pay- check. ; Beasley. did stop drawing pay for subcommittee work, after another of- ficial questioned the constitutionality of his serving as chairman.- “If’that committee really wants to do something and be something other than a political vehicle . ... then I might change my position’ on cooperating with its request, Baxley said. Although Baxley did have good words for Barron and some other House members on the subcommittee, . who does whatever Beasley bids him to, do.” The attorney general also contehded the subcommittee does not have the le- gal authority to demand the informa- tion it is seeking, nor do the examiners October 13, 1976 i d that Sen. a morning, when some further action i chargen.

Baxley did admit the current dis- pute will further enflame his long- standing feud with Beasley and is not palitically wise, but he contended: ‘There's just no way you can keep from having a political feud with ley unless ‘you lay down and let him run over you.” . In his remarks to the Kiwanians, Baxley was more generally critical of the legislature. He endorsed the idea of having greater accountability in public spending, but noted the rise in costs of running the Senate and said lawmak- ers should ‘‘make a serious effort to ward cleaning up their own back yard.” Baxley won applause when citing as his biggest mistake his support of an- nual legislative sessions. i thought it couldn't get any worse,” he said. “I was wrong.

        "ocr_text": "Looking To 1978 By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of The Advertiser Staff Election campaigning has turned into the hottest show in town this fall, but it’s not campaigning for the election just 16 days hence. The sights of the current crop of contestants are set on the spring of 1978, and their maneuvers, ploys and verbal fusillades are more notably present in Alabama than are similar offerings from the candi- dates who face the voters Nov. 2. Obviously the most active of the lot have been Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley and Atty. Gen, Bill Baxley, al- though lesser lights also are running hard, and have been for months. The Baxley-Beasley show has taken on the most personal tone, however, and may presage an eye- gouging, ear-boxing battle as the 1978 primaries for the state’s highest elected offices draw nearer. Both men say they are aware the voters aren't overly fond of name-calling contests, but both still have shown little reluctance to lunge for the jugular. Beasley may think he is bowing slightly to good taste by attempting to remove himself from the public fray and leave the bad-mouthing to his aides and po- litical allies, but that trick is transparent, at best, Apparently each is hoping to discredit the other in the voters’ eyes, and they may end up doing exactly’ that. Both may succeed. As one of the principals noted last week, their most recent dispute “probably is playing right into Albert Brewer's hands,” the former governor who rounds out the ‘‘three B's’ expected to seek the Democratic nomination for governor when 1978 brings to an end the Wallace era at the Capitol. But it will not be just a trio casting covetous glances at the Capitol’s first floor governor office, and the B’s can expect to be crowded by a few other letters of the alphabet, including perhaps one big H—for Supreme Court Chief Justice Howell Heflin. Heflin, who voluntarily steps down from the court as of January, is keeping mum about.what his in- tentions are for '78, but it is no secret that supporters around the state are trying to convince the judge that the governor's job could be his. Attorneys especially are hopeful that Heflin will opt for the governor's race, as many still hold deep grudges against Baxley for his interference in the re-election bid of Judge Aubrey Cates, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals presiding judge. For those who may have forgotten, the attorney general offered his own candidate~an assistant in his of- fice—then took to the air waves to severely denounce: Cates as a judge soft on the criminal element. A lot of lawyers disagreed with that assessment of Judge Cates, and, even some of those who didn't, ‘were appalled at Baxley’s act. Heflin, who friends say always has been reluctant to step into a political sideshow of the sort antici- pated in the governor’s race, supposedly was pre- paring to seek the nomination for U.S. Sen. John Sparkman’s seat, which also is before the voters in 1978, when he decided to leave the court. The friendly persuasion of those who want to keep Helfin in Alabama, coupled with one or two other de- velopments, may change the judge’s plans. Those developments include the growing belief that Gov. George C. Wallace will turn his eyes to- ward Washington, and the increasing possibility that Sen. Sparkman, despite the fact that he will be 78 years old when his term expires, just might bid for re-election. Besides the possible candidacy of Heflin, State Sen. Sid McDonald has been campaigning for the governor's office for more than a year, State Sen. LW. “Red” Noonan of Mobile reportedly is gearing up for the run, and speculation has placed House Speaker Joe McCorquodale, State Treasurer Melba Till Allen, and Montgomery Mayor Jim Robinson (notably the only “outsider” at a time when that might be a decided advantage) as contestants in the same race. And there undoubtedly will be others. Perhaps Beasley and Baxley, who have been con- sidered contenders since before they won their present, second terms in office, ought:to take a close look at that long list of potential opposition and then ‘check out their own images. , The list includes some interesting candidates who haven’t built themselves images as hot-headed, bickering school boys, images that the voters might find better suited to be smiling out at them from the governor’s chair for the four years following 1978.

        "ocr_text": "Alabama Democrats Begin Media Blitz for Carter By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama Democrats are beginning their media blitz on behalf of Jimmy . Carter this week with hopes of regain- ing substantial ground lost to Presi- dent Gerald Ford in the presidential race once taken for granted in the Heart of Dixie. Radio advertising starts throughout the state this week and television spots featuring Alabama’s most popular when he ai r main thoroughfare of the Port City on a Saturday afternoon. . Those traveling across the state also have issued surprise at the sentiment they find for Ford among all segments of the population. The general view, admitted by both Democrats and Republicans, is that Carter's strength remains solid in North Alabama, but begins to soften by increasing degrees southward through the state. Neither side admits to having taken reliable statewide polls, apparently because Alabama has been considered a sure thing for the man from neigh- boring Georgia. Montgomery attorney Richard Ball, co-chairman of Ford's Alabama cam- paign, maintains that his party's infor- » mal telephone polls show the Presi- dent with a two-to-one lead from Jef- ferson County south, with some 15 per cent as yet undecided. Ball predicted this week that Ford an_ incredible on behalf of Carter ona . elected officials—Gov, George C. Wal- lace and U.S. Sens, John Sparkman and Jim Allen—will fill the air waves beginning Monday, The media campaign is not a plan suddenly devised to offset Ford’s re- cent surge of strength here, but when Democratic strategists laid the groundwork more than a month ago, most were hardly concerned that such tactics of persuasion would be impor- tant in Alabama. There are signs that is no longer the tally of 58 per cent or even 60 per cent. State Democratic Chairman Robert Vance finds that laughable, calling a lead “‘well upwards of 10 per cent’’ for Carter. Many other Democrats place the Carter lead at a considerably lower figure. saving they now see the race as a much closer one than they earlier be- lieved possible. Vance does point to one poll he said was reliably executed in the Sixth Con- gressional District—the Birmingham area—which shows Carter an eight- point favorite. That is particularly important, he says, because the Sixth District has not voted Democratic in a presidential election since the days of Franklin Roosevelt. ‘ - “If you're talking to the working folks you're not getting that Ford stuff.” Vance said in a telephone in- terview this week. ‘‘Amdng white people it’s a close race, with Ford pos- sibly having an edge. a blacks are about all for Jimmy Car case, “especially from southern sec- tors. Many of them are small signals that may not indicate major trends among the voting population, but they are there. For example, State Sen. Wendell Mitchell of Luverne reported that his Rotary Club was divided 15 for Carter and 11 for Ford back in July, but this week was tolally reversed, with 20 Ro- tarians favoring Ford and only eight for Carter. gree bama will go to Carter by a substantial margin, but he and others have ques- tioned how large the black turnout will be. Except in isolated instances there are no other statewide or local races of significant interest to draw anyone to the polls, black or white. Ball said the swing to the GOP candi- date has been “prompted by average voters getting more information on Carter and his stands, through the televised debates and other news cov- erage. “The average Alabamian finds Mr Carter's views so contrary to their own that they could not and will not vote for Mr. Carter,” Ball said, citing as exam- ples issues such as gun control and promises to balance the federal budg- et and reform taxes while initiating substantial new government pro- grams. Vance complains many of the issues have ‘been distorted through the Re- October 20, 1976 There was the recent public declara- tion from Democratic Mayor Joe Smitherman of Selma that he supports Ford, and the informal show of hands at an Auburn University journalism class where only a smattering of arms were raised in support of Carter. The overwhelming majority was for Ford. In Mobile thousands of people turned out to see and cheer President Ford late last month, while Gov. Wallace, who used to draw packed houses there, found an audience of perhaps a couple hundred publicans’ ‘‘big lie’’ campaign. through which the former Georgia governor is ‘painted as a liberal of the Humphrey sort.’” “He is not. He never has been,\" Vance said. ‘‘By southern standards Carter was a moderate governor.” The issue of gun control has been one of the more volatile here. Although Carter has said he favors only registration of hand guns, Ford repeatedly appealed to hunters during his southern swing with statements implying Carter wants to register all guns and rifles. Signs to the same ef- fect have been raised in much of North Alabama, and letters to newspapers around the state have charged Carter favors virtual confiscation of all weap- ons. Both sides are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the final debate on Fri- day in hopes. of a boost for their respec- tive candidate, while more neutral ob- servers are looking to the entire 13 days remaining before the election as holding a potential bombshell that could swing the Alabama vote either \f"

Wal- lace confirmed the request had been made. They said Solomon has agreed to re- main in the position until Gov. Wallace finds a replacement to fill the powerful and pressure-filled job. Solomon, appointed acting director in January of 1974, when former Fi- nance Director Taylor Hardin quit to become mental health commissioner, reportedly is concerned about main- taining his merit system status with the state and has felt increasingly pressured by demands of the job. Hic not only serves as finance direc- being a political appointee, rather than a state employe. Although the names of several Cabl- net-level officials have been men- tioned in speculation over whom Wal- lace will appoint to the job, no one has expressed any certainty. The job is one of the most powerful in the executive branch of state govern- ment, as the finance director is in- tegrally involved in budget-planning and other aspects of state spending, which means developing broad pol- icies and priorities over the direction of the government. é Although Solomon was expected to serve essentially as a figure-head leader, with Hardin maintaining ac- tual contro] as a key Wallace advisor, he gradually did assume more power and authority and has become an aide upon whom the governor has relied ex. tensively. Initially it was expected Solomon ‘would retain the position only until Wallace's second term closed at the informally requested. e e ep : E JAMES R.

Wallace did not replace Solomon, al- ‘though he had agreed to fill the job on a_ temporary basis only. While serving as acting director, Solomon has been instrumental in car- rying out a number of bureaucratic re- forms designed to make government run more efficiently and economic- ally. Some were proposed in the Gov- ernor’s Cost Control Survey of 1972, “but had not been implemented. Changes Solomon has directed in-. clude consolidating computer and printing services, getting zero-based budgeting off the ground, and. in- itiating a an entirely new accounting system aimed at keeping closer track of exactly how much is spent on what. Most of the new systems have not yet been made fully operational, but are in the process of being instituted on a government-wide basis. sponsibilities of the number two spot. Solomon was appointed acting di- rector in order to maintain both his nigher salary as legal officer and his. merit system job protection, which does not cloak political appointments such as the directorship. At the time he was named acting di- rector, his salary as Attorney III su- ervisor was $22,500 a year, while the director's job paid only $21,780. Solomon, 41, has been with the state since 1963. He has worked in the De- partments of Revenue, Highway, and Industrial Relations, and was brought into the Finance Department in 1969 during the administration of former Gov. Albert Brewer. He has been a Wallace loyalist, how- eyer, and the sources who confirmed his pending move emphatically denied the governor has pressured Solomon to step down. .

        "ocr_text": "Voter Turnout Wiay Be By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The voter turnout Tuesday could be a crucial factor in the presidential election that surprisingly has turned into a contest in Alabama. The question is not only how many of Alabama's 1,864,947 registered voters (as of Oct. 1) exercise their con- ' Stitutional right to help choose their government leaders, but, perhaps more importantly, in which sections of the state they turn out. The general view in both Democrat- ic and Republican circles is that Presi- dent Ford will score his highest vote in South Alabama, while North Alabama is solid Jimmy Carter territory. Republicans are hoping Ford strength from Birmingham south will offset a Carter majority expected north of there, while Democrats are confident that they Democrats’ favor is that they have mounted a fairly serious not only will far outdistance , Ford in the North Alabama totals, but also will pick up virtually all of the state’s black vote to surge ahead to a sound victory. Huntsville attorney Julian Butler, the man coordinating the campaign for the Democratic ticket in Alabama, was placing friendly bets as late as last week that Carter will carry the state with a 20-point margin. Few other Democrats have been sc optimistic, with Lewis Odom, the Car- ter campaign director, predicting his candidate will win with a minimum lead of 6 percentage points. Crucial That kind of assessment also appar- ently has buoyed the GOP here toward thoughts of a possible win in the state earlier considered neatly squirrelled away in Jimmy Carter’s hip pocket. Montgomerian Richard Ball, a co- chairman of Ford’s Alabama cam- paign, has said informal Republican telephone polls. give Ford a 2-1 lead from Birmingham south, and he main- ‘tains the President will win a majority vote here. Outside of the facts that Carter is a fellow southerner and has received en- dorsements from the top officeholders here, including Gov. George C, Wal- lace and the entire Democratic con- gressional delegation, one other point in the voter registration drive. The push has been taken to pre- dominantly black areas and other parts of the state where residents—based on the community voting patterns and socio-e nomic character—would be expected cast Democratic ballots if they cast any a alla. a, The Oct. 1 total of registered voters as listed by the secretary of states ‘ of. fice, includes 44,738 more people than did the April 1 figure. And that October total does not include anyone who reg- istered this month, while the registra- tion drive supposedly was peaking. If the Democrats have targeted their drive accurately, they should see a sizable addition to the Carter col- umn, since the newly-registered are more likely to vote than others. Whichever candidate does secure the majority vote, he will get all nine of Alabama’s electoral votes. That is be- cause for the first time in the state’s history, the people are voting for the October 31, 1976 > \fPolittes -—_—_ cc <— candidates . Tather than the individual electors.. In past elections the names of elec- tors have appeared on the ballot, with the unusual result that the electoral votes sometimes have been split be- tween two presidential candidates, or the electors who ran as Democrats voted for someone other than the na-_ tional party’s nominee. This year the electors, selected by the parties, are pledged to vote for their respective party’s candidate. Whichever candidate wins the Pens vote will get all the electors. As in other ‘states, Alabama's turf and air waves have been inundated - ‘with campaigners and partisan pro-. nouncements over the past few’ weeks The GOP effort has prompted sev eral cries of ‘‘foul’’ from Democratic leaders, most prominently from State Democratic Chairman Robert Vance. who has charged the Republicans with distorting Jimmy Carter’s views on is- sues and his record as governor of Georgia. Although the Republican television ads primarily have been positive in na- ture, emphasizing President Ford's character and accomplishments, the ‘GOP newspaper advertising and oth- ‘er literature has been attack-oriented. At the GOP county headquarters. most of the campaign literature is anti-Carter, rather than pro- -Ford. while the Democratic offices. are stacked with pamphlets detailing Car- ter’s positions on a multitude of issues The attack method generally is adopted by candidates who view them- selves as the underdog and must dis- credit the opponent, as has been in virtually every other statewic oe district race this campaign ae The Carter forces, however. have ; no means taken this state totally for granted, as evidenced by the steady stream of ‘‘surrogate’’ campaigners routed into all corners of the state. though such stand-ins do help dis- seminate the candidate's views, their main purpose is generating. a flow of publicity for the main man. Alabamians also will be able to vote for a presidential candidate from oth- er than one of the two major parties, since four other hopefuls will be listed on’ the ballot They are former Georgia Gov. Les- ter Maddox, of the American Indepen- dent party, Gus Hall, the Communist party candidate in most states who is Tunning as an independent here, Ben- -jamin Bubar of the Prohibition party and Roger Lea McBride of the Liber- tarian party.

Ford vs. Democrat challenger Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia. The Advertiser-Journal has attempted to provide voters with capsule presentations ot the issues deemed by pollsters, political ex- perts and the candidates themselves as the decisive ones of ‘76. The material, compiled and edited by Ad- ~-yertiser Political Writer Marcia Kunstel, Staff Writer Frank Whatley and Advertiser News Editor Nancy Wilstach, was drawn from a variety of sources, Guided by the judicial admonition to present when possible the “best evidence,” the first option was always the candidate’s own words directly from a text of one of his speeches or from one of his position papers. Where the first option was unavailable, the Second source is the platform of the candi- date’s national party forged at the parties’ re- spective national conventions and regarded as reflecting the candidate’s own views. Only when material was available from nei- ther of these “direct” sources did the com- pilers turn to “indirect” material— that which is gleaned from news media coverage of candi- dates’ speeches, debates and interviews. This material was used only when it was deemed ob- jective in its treatment of candidates’ views, thus eliminating as sources such subjective material as commentary, personality profiles or analyses. Graphic matter illustrating the issues se- lected for examination was prepared and pro- duced. by Advertiser Cartoonist Frank Spang- ler.

HIAIAIAIAAA IAAI AIAIAIAIASAAA IK ' Democratic Candidate Jimmy Carter Republican President Gerald Ford ‘We propose to balance the federal budget by doing two things: Number One, cutting the rate in growth of federal funding from 11 per cent per year, as it has been for the last ten years, to a 5.5 per cent rate of increase in growth. At the same time, we would stimulate the domestic economy by giving additional tax cuts to taxpayers whether they are in- dividuals or businesses, That is the way to get more people in the United States to spend more money of their own, to increase consumer expenditures, and to give more money to business so they can expand and modernize and provide more jobs. In that way we can balance the federal budget in three years and increase the strength of our economy in America... .’ He opposes wage and price controls as having ‘long-range detrimental reper- cussions,’ but notes, ‘we do have a wage-price council that . . . on several occasions has been helpful in trying to get a moderation of a price increase.’ ‘As the leader of the free world, America has a special responsibility to explore new paths ; to peace for all mankind, It is a responsibility we have not shirked , . . The foreign relations of the United States can be conducted effectively only if there is strong central direction that allows flexibility of action, That responsibility clearly rests with the President .. (We must) keep our powder dry and not put our finger on the nuclear trigger.’ ‘My immediate goal is two and a half million new jobs every year with emphasis on our youth, especially the minorities, Not demeaning, dead-end jobs paid for out of the federal treasury, but permanent jobs with a future generated by the demands of a healthy economy . - We proved once and for all that you can cut inflation in half and add four million new jobs in just 17 months.

We can attain a balanced budget within the context of full employment by 1979 . . . without reducing social expenditures through the increased revenues which will be realized by higher incomes ina fully employed economy ,. . Much of the inflation we have experienced was not caused by excessive demand, but rather by dollar devaluations, external factors such as the increasing oil prices, and by worldwide in- creases in food and basic material prices . . . I would like standby wage-price controls. My guess is that I would never use them. But I would like them as a lever,’ \"There has evolved a kind of secretive “Lone Ranger’’ foreign policy—a one-man policy of international adventure . . . we have sometimes tried to play other nations one against another. . .

It seems to me that a well-managed energy company, big or small, is the best. nergy way to solve our energy problem , ..' Ford favors release of naval petroleum reserves, gradual decontrol of oil prices over a 40-month period and development of nuclear energy and creation of an Energy Independence Authority, Ford's health program calls or protection of the aged and disabled against catastrophic or prolonged illness and calls for combination of all 16 of the overlapping federal health programs now in operation, ‘Consolidation of health programs is essential to continue our national progress in the field of health .

While protecting the rights of the accused, our emphasis must always be on protecting the rights of the victim... I favor the use of the death penalty in the Federal criminal system in accordance with proper Constitutional standards.’ Ford has directed thé heads of departments and agencies to insure that all persons have an opportunity to compete on a fair and equal basis for employment and advancement in the Federal Government. He has strongly supported the ERA, saying: ‘It would be most fitting tor the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to be accomplished during our nation's 200th year. . .’ Ford is pledged to support of open housing laws and supports housing oppor: tunities for blacks and other minorities.

        "ocr_text": "2nd District Incumbent on Defensive - By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer He resembles a halfback; she, a lithe ballerina. But U.S. Rep. Bill Dickinson. the in- cumbent Republican hoping to tack another two-year term onto his 12-year Congressional career. has been on the defensive line most of this campaign season, as Democratic challenger Miss Carole Keahey pirouettes around him. not so much like a dainty balle- .Tina as like a dancing boxer—poking, jabbing and landing one verbal blow after another. Dickinson. a large-framed. 5l-year- old lawyer with conservative creden- tials. has lumbered across his 13-coun- tv Second District campaigning on his experience and his voting record. Miss Keahey, a willowy business- ’ woman who has strong Alabama fami- lv ties but spent most of her 29 years in Washington, D.C., has attacked both. And, she has attacked hard. Her offensive stance, carried to the voters through an expensive and wide- spread media campaign, apparently has brought some results and nar- rowed from a chasm to a gap the spread between their respective sup- port. Most state Democrats who long have hoped to capture Dickinson's GOP seat still say they would be sur- prised to see Miss Keahey emerge vic- torious the night of Nov. 2. but they do believe she has made serious inroads on Dickinson's strength and may be setting him up for a toppling in 1978. Miss Keahey said she believes she will win. The congressman and his aides say otherwise. After fairly low-keyed campaigns brought Miss Keahey from a_ second- place finish in the Democratic prima- ry to somewhat of a surprise run-off victory, this fall the nominee imported a professional Political adviser from Minnesota, James Goff, to orchestrate what has turned into a hard-hitting general election push. She has badgered Dickinson about his junkets abroad and across this country, mostly taken in connection with his work on the House Armed Services Committee, but she also has. been harshly critical of the congress- man’s voting record. He points with some pride to ‘‘voting the way the way the people tell me to vote.\" as ascertained through ques- tionnaires routinely sent to district residents. asking their views on gener- al issues. occasionally on specific pro- posals Miss Keahey couners that they ‘are loaded,\" overlayed with rhetoric that leaves a reasonable citizen with only one answer to give — the one he wants. She also, through advertising, has made his votes on various issues a matter of more personal concern to the voter by adding her own rhetoric. For example: ‘‘Children and farm- ers have something in common with small businessmen and retired citi- zens . . . Bill Dickinson has voted ‘against them all.”’ Dickinson, in his speeches and con-: versations around the district, ex- presses concern over the country’s trend toward socialism and increased federal spending. He has no apologies for his voting record, adding that some special interest groups have distorted it. His votes in favor of the adminis- tration’s education budgets, but against floor amendments to add more spending, for example. have been translated into an anti-education tem- per. he says. He also says he does not abuse the privilege of spending taxpayers dol- lars on fact-finding trips, character- izing the junkets as ‘‘absolutely neces- sary. “You can't ask the Army why its commissaries are messed up,’’ he says, or trust the State Department to give the full facts on negotiations over the Panama Canal. ‘You have to go see for yourself, get on site and investigate these things,”’ he contends. Miss Keahey charges he has gone too much, and spent too lavishly on food and drink and tourist attractions. Dickinson has not been totally on the defensive. He charges that the Democrat not only is inexperienced, but cannot be aware of the needs and problems of the Second District because she never has lived here. He characterizes Miss Kea- hey as an outsider coming to Alabama to further her own political ambitions, much as the late Sen. Robert Kennedy did when he moved from Massachu- setts to New York to run for the U.S. Senate. Miss Keahey admits she never has lived here full-time, but attributes that to her father's military career. She is a legal resident and registered voter, and says she spent summers here as a child and makes periodic visits to rela- tives. Neither of the candidates maintains a personal residence in the state. Both have taken positions against gun control and in favor of a strong de- fense. Miss Keahey also characterizes her- self as a conservative, but some of the programs she has endorsed would mean additional government spend- ing. These include improved educa- tion programs, higher Social Security retirement benefits, higher veteran's benefits, stronger aid to local law en- forcement agencies and mortgage guarantees for middle income .fami- lies. Dickinson says there is little he will change if re-elected, except that he possibly will push harder for a con- Stitutional amendment to extend con- gressional terms from two to four years. Miss Keahey is divorced, as is Dick- inson, has spent some time as a New York model and helps run a family moving and storage business in Wash- ington. October 31, 1976 (Sidebar) \f"

That has emerged as one of the most emotional, possibly most misunderstood issues in the presiden- tial campaign in Alabama. For some people the question of handgun con-. trol—of registering pistols with the federal govern- ment—represents more than simply being required to submit a form or to be adjudged sane and not a criminal before being allowed to tote a firearm. For some it represents an entire world view. “We look at it as a threat tantamount to con- fiscation,”’ said Archie Phillips, the Birmingham taxidermist, hunter and primary Alabama spokes- man against any form of gun control. ‘If con- fiscation wasn't in their minds, why would they even be talking about registration?” Once guns are registered, he said, those in poiver would know where everybody's guns were. That is a logical deduction. But from this point, Phillips goes on to conjure up a menacing invasion of totalitarians who would visit each person on the registration list and snatch away their guns as part of a forceful sub- Jugation of the citizenry. Of course, most military analysts in the 1970's be- lieve a foreign (or internal) foe hardly would need gun registration lists to disarm a people, to render ineffective the armed sportsmen Phillips calls ‘the standing army of America.” A serious enemy would have the bomb, chemical warfare, germ warfare and untold other sophis- ticated weapons to demonstrate its intentions. once, then hold the threat of repetition over the head of any pistol-packing patriot who'd care to chance resis- tance, The days of a romantic underground movement toiling to save democracy in the face of oppressors have passed. The enemies may remain, but the means of keeping them out of American households have changed. Jimmy Carter favors the federal registration of hand guns. Not rifles or shotguns, just hand guns. Archie Phillips is one of the southerners cam- paigning against Carter on that issue. He is in good company, because many other hunters and sports- men have joined him. They have been aided by the operatives of President Gerald Ford’s campaign in that regard. Some of the anti-gun registration literature how- ever, must be viewed as misleading. One brief GOP brochure claims Carter “‘favors federal registration of firearms.’ That’s an awlully broad term — “firearms'’’ — hardly representative of the Democrat's actual position. Phillips also has put out his own literatare, quoting Ford as saying, “The law abiding citizens of this country should not be deprived of the right to bear arms for their own protection.” The implication is that Carter would deny that right, which is not the candidate's position. Phillips’ handbill also endorses the Ford-Dole ticket as being “‘men who believe in punishing crimi- nals, not gunowners.”’ Again, he implies that Carter believes otherwise. - What Carter proposes is identical to the law that has been on the Alabama books for the past 20 years, a law that has not hindered the sportsman’s pursuit of his pleasures (unless he happens to be a felon and wants to hunt with a pistol). In Montgomery County this year alone, however, the law has resulted in applications for at least 55 hand guns being denied to persons who have been convicted of committing felonious acts—common criminals, Carter's proposal, like the Alabama law, is to re- quire that persons wishing to purchase hand guns fill out an application with the gun dealer. The informa- tion would be sent to proper law enforcement offi- cers, who would have a short period (in Alabama it is 48 hours) to check whether the applicant is an ex-fel- on or has been legally declared mentally in- competent. The criminal and the insane would be prohibited, as they are right now in Alabama, from making the purchase, Only hand guns would be so registered under Car- ter’s proposal. Carter knows that sportsmen fear what he terms a “domino theory” of gun control. He has stated: “If proponents of extreme gun control recommend mis- guided regulatory controls, which would be contrary to the legitimate interests of sportsmen, I would do all 1 could to oppose them,” October 31, 1976 \f"

Mobile and Jef- ferson. Complete returns boost. in Montgomery County, where Ford was expected to do well, showed the President leading by about 4,000 votes, with a total of 29,343 to Carter's 24,745. Carter, as expected, showed his greatest strength in North Alabama. while Ford's majorities came primar- ily in southerly counties. Ford did manage to climb ahead in Shelby County. generally. a GOP stronghold. In Jefferson County. with 602 of 849 precincts reported’ Ford was leading by about 6.000. and he carried Mobile County by about a 3.000-vote margin. Those relatively small majorities for Ford in the areas where he was seen as strongest apparently crushed the hopes of GOP state leaders who predicted their man would take the State. The leads in the big counties couldn't overcome the Black Belt support for Carter:and the Tennessee Valley. totals that for the most part were top-heavy for the Democrat. For example, in Madison County ‘where Huntsville is located. Carter led by almost 20.000 votes. When it had become apparent that Carter. the former Georgia governor. was likely to take the national election. Gov. George C. Wallace commented that a victory would show that ‘no ge- ographic bias exists in the hearts and minds of the masses when choosing a president.” Wallace, himself a presidential can- didate four times, said the Carter win “means that wherever you're from you: can be elected president. And that bodes well for this nation.” The governor would not predict any substantial changes in store for the South. saying he wouldn't expect Car- ter to favor his home region any more than would a president from the East or Midwest. Wallace also said he had received a call Tuesday night from Carter. ask- ing that his thanks be expressed to the people of Alabama for giving him a victory here. Lewis Odom, state campaign direc- tor for Carter, attributed the heavy vote to “a flurry of activity during the - closing days of the campaign” and to the apparent closeness of the race. “That stir red interest.’’ Odom said. “T think that was to Gov. Carter's ad- vantage. At the Democratic return-watching celebration here Tuesday night, Joe Reed. president of the Alabama Democratic Caucus. the black arm of the party, said he believes the black vote ‘was crucial’’ to Carter's suc- cess. He also noted, however, the diver- sity of support throughout the state © “We had a common enemy and a common friend,”’ Reed said. ‘‘The common enemy was Ford and the friend was Carter” “Folks were voting for Carter for different reasons,’ Reed. said, citing among them the economy and the. fact that Carter is a Southerner While leaders of both parties earlier had predicted only a moderate turnout of voters at best. the people surprised the pros by streaming to the polls throughout the state. In many places traffic jams were re- ported. requiring the presence of po- lice officers to unsnarl the autos and clear paths for children on the way to school. Montgomery County was no ex- ception, as most precinct officials re- ported surprisingly long lines of voters who in some places had to wait half an hour or longer to get to the voting booths. In Jefferson County, officials were talking about seeing as much as an 82 per cent turnout, while Mobile County reported only a moderate one. Although Democrats traditionally have swept to power in statewide of- November 3, fices in Alabama, this is the first time since 1952 that the state apparently will cast all nine of its electoral votes i a Democratic presidential candi- te. Alabama went Republican in 1964, for Barry Goldwater, and in 1972. for Richard Nixon. In 1968 the state sent electors pledged to Gov George C Wallace. who ran as an independent. In 1956 and 1960 the electors were split between third party and regular Democrats.

Carter carried the vote with 4,729: ballots compared to the 3.758 cast for Ford. Voting complaints were frequently fielded by U.S. Atty. Ira DeMent. but he said the two dozen or so calls were not of a major nature that would prompt criminal prosecution Most were simply protests of poll workers being uninformed regarding more complicated voting procedures, such as how to cast write-in votes, DeMent said. 1976 \f"

It was that southern heri- tage—especially important in the rural areas—the heavy black turn- out, and the solid labor vote that re- sulted in Carter's big win, he said.

State Democratic Chairman Rob ‘ert Vance cited three basic reasons or Carter's success here; Carter is “a heck of a candidate” who came on strong at the tail end of the. cam- paign; there was “‘unprecented party unity’ with endorsements from all major elected officials, the party had good campaign organiza- tions that functioned more actively than in any presidential race In re- cent memory, \"I think generally we just got our act together pretty well,’ Vance Said, Ys November 4, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Tags to Run Out Here by Monday \"By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Montgomery County is one of two in the state expected to run out of new auto tags by Monday and be forced to ° issue temporary, cardboard tags. Car owners still will be required to purchase the temporary license tags by the regular Nov. 1 deadline in both Montgomery and Etowah counties, but will be permitted to display them in the rear window of their cars. — Billy Joe Camp, press secretary to Gov. George Wallace, said Friday the shortage resulted from the State Reve- nue Department miscalculating how many tags could be punched from the steel it purchased. All those who cannot get the normal tags still must buy the cardboard ones that will be issued when the steel runs out, Smith emphasized. _ ‘Judge Hobbie asked the state to pay the cost of sending these (late tags) out to the public,’’ Smith said. “It’s bad enough to inconvenience the people by making them use the card- jboard tags.”’ ! | Smith said the county will not be jatile to mail out the late tags unless the state does come through with funding, and no committment has yet been ‘made. If the late tags are not mailed out, “The tags are heavier this year,\" ‘Camp said. ‘‘In years past they had the experience of being able to get X num- ber of tags out of a ton of steel. This year they didn’t get as many.” C The new tags are heavier because. under a law passed by the Alabama Legislature last year, they will be used for five years, rather than only one year as in the past. They also are numbered differently under the new system, bearing three letters and three numbers rather than just a series of numbers, and that change resulted in a problem earlier in the tag-making process. A mix-up in the prison system tag plant caused an error in the figures. the purchasers of cardboard tags will have to make another trip back to the courthouse to exhange them for the » real thing, once the steel tags do ar- rive. Camp said the state has ordered more steel, after purchasing as much as possible on a spot, emergency basis, but the shipment likely won't be delivered until sometime late in No- vember. Neither Camp nor Smith could say why Montgomery and Etowah coun- ties are the two facing shortages, and Revenue Department officials could _not be reached for comment Friday night. and about 16,000 tags had to be de- stroyed. : ; Lloyd D. Smith, chief clerk to Mont- gomery County Probate Judge Walker Hobbie, said Friday his office has about 1,000 tags left to issue, all of eg should be gone by sometime Mon- ay. Smith said his office has been press- ing state officials for more tags for weeks, since the first shipment in Au- gust of 45,000 tags was recognized as far below the county's needs. The county did get another load of 12.000 tags in September, Smith said, then a final shipment of 5,000. That still leaves the county about 42,000 tags short. November 6, 1976 \f"

Vance reportedly is un- der consideration to take over the party’s national chairmanship.

Levin begins work with the transition team in Washington on Monday, but would not say in exactly what capacity he will serve, preferring to await the official an- - nouncement next week. On the policy task force in Atlanta he worked in the areas of national healh insurance, welfare reform and criminal justice, preparing recommendations for policy, . staffing, budgeting and congressional relations. Once the transition work is completed, Levin likely will be appointed to a position in the new administration, sources have said, State Chairman Vance, a Birmingham attorney, reportedly is not champing at the bit for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, but his name has cropped up frequently in speculation over who will be Carter's selection. ~ Vance has advised Carter on DNC issues since the par- ty’s convention last summer. Although the job of national chairman has been most in- fluential when the Democrats don’t hold the White House, since the chairman is then the chief party spokesman, one Carter campaign aide said Friday he expects that change some with this administration, Carter has said he will take his case to the people if Congress balks at his programs, and the party structure is a logical means of spreading the word, the aide said. y ‘Vance’s contacts across the country are solid, having served as president of the association of Democratic state chairmen, a job he lost when Strauss moved to put one of his favorites in the position, Mrs, Derian, also mentioned for the job Strauss said he will leave after January, was a political adviser for the southeastern states throughout Carter's general election campaign. | She also has developed a national base as president of the women's caucus of the DNC.

Especially in the past week—the days leading up to Tuesday’s state- “wide referendum on the bond is- sue—railroad interests and con- servationists have attempted a lobby- ing blitz to convince voters to pull the *‘no”’ lever on Amendment No. 1. easier shipment of U.S. coal to Japan - through the Port of Mobile, possibly in- flating prices of remaining domestic coal, when this nation still is ex- periencing energy problems. —Adverse environmental effects will include a further drop in the water table in some areas, accelerate de- struction of the Tombigbee River and its fish, create problems in disposing -of 258 million cubic yards of dirt, which is more than was removed from the Panama Canal cut. Opponents also say that sufficient transportation already exists through the state of Alabama, that the entire project represents an unfair subsidi- zation of the barge industry, and that ‘cost estimates already have soared far beyond the original expectations. Proponents of the waterway and the bond issue say its benefits will far out- weigh the disadvantages by the over- all impact of connecting this state via waterway with 22 other states and the 16,000 mile inland waterway system of the midsection of the nation. Their effort follows a much longer movement spurred by top state offi- cials supporting the bond issue as Ala- bama’s fair share of the more than $1.5 billion project to link the Port of Mo- bile and state waterway systems with the rivers coursing through the heart ‘of =mid-America. The $25 million is needed to finance the relocation of three bridges and ac- cess roads, components of the project supposedly assigned by the federal government to the states. Among other favorable impacts, supporters say the completed water- way will create nearly 55,000 new jobs and pump some $7 billion into the state’s economy by the year 2000. They generally brush aside environ- mental concerns, which also include fears of increased flooding and the in- undation of 40,000 acres of hardwood forests, and add that the federal gov- ernment will invest $50 million in rec- reation facilities along the entire wa- terway (not all in Alabama). Supporters also note that the water- way will reduce by as much as 819 miles the distance between the Port of Mobile and Alabama’s inland ports in the Tennesse Valley. © Detractors say, however, that coal will be the main commodity shipped through the waterway, and 70 per cent of it will come from outside Alabama. That means Alabamians, through this $25 million bond issue and a $10 million issue already approved to relocate the bridges, will be defraying trans- portation expenses for out-of-state concerns. And, they add, the U.S. Corps of Army Engineers that is conducting the Tenn-Tom project has admitted that 50 per cent of the Kentucky and Ten- nessee coal will be shipped to Japan. The cost question also is dismissed by bond issue supporters, who quote the multi-billion dollars in in- Opponents cite less favorable im- pacts, with the anti-bond issue liter- ature making the following points: —The issue will carry $24 million in interest payments, skimmed from the top of state tax revenues. —Alabama is bearing the full cost of the bridge and road work, while Mis- sissippi is receiving federal financial aid for similar projects. —In the first year of waterway oper- ation, between 100 and 125 railroad jobs in Alabama will be lost, since the coal now shipped by rail will be hauled by barge. —The waterway will allow for the vestments to be prompted by con- struction of the waterway. The bond is- sue and its interest costs to the tax- payers will be offset in multiples, if the proponents cite accurate estimates that by the year 2000 a total of $573 mil- lion will be generated in state tax reve- nues, and another $43 million in local government taxes. Whichever side does win the battle, it likely will be decided by a small per- centage of the state’s voters. Constitutional amendment elections such as this—required because the constitution sets a ceiling on bonded indebtedness to be repaid from gener- al state revenues—normally draw only a fraction of those eligible to vote. The participation could be even low- er this time, since the public earlier this month trekked to the polls in the presidential election. Most officials expect a low turnout. Also on Tuesday’s ballot will be eight other constitutional amend- ments, but each of those apply to only a single city or county. None would af- fect Montgomery. November 21, 2016 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Probing Purpose? By MARCIA KUNSTEL Of The Advertiser Staff It's a good thing politics hasn't gotten wrapped up in the current investigations of Lt. Gov. Jere Beas- ley's budget panel. ‘That panel is formally known as the legislature’s Budget Control Subcommittee, a group of lawmak- ers probing into the finances and bureaucratic work- ings (or sometimes fumblings, as Beasley might characterize things) of the cogs that keep the state government wheels spinning. The subcommittee, aided by the Legislative Fis- cal Office and the Examiners of Public Accounts, has undertaken the monumental task of not only finding out how government works in Alabama, but of making it work to the greatest benefit of the public supporting that government with its tax dollars. That, in any event, is the stated aim of the com- mittee. Considering the prominence of the principals in- volved, ie. the lieutenant governor himself, a group of distinguished senators and house members and the heads of major state departments and agencies, the investigation has attracted consid- erable media coverage so the people can remain | abreast of important developments in the profes- sional lives of important people. It thus would be unfortunate at best if the various investigations and probing ouestions were tinted by the dark colorings of political ambitions, on the part of any of the principals, since all the proceedings are prominently displayed for public consumption. The people might find it unfortunate, for example, if any particular department were given what is known in both the businesses of journalism and politics as the whitewash. It similarly would be dis- tressing to the public, in all likelihood, should any particular department be treated in an opposite Manner—as the scapegoat. More specifically, it might be misleading to the general public if an expansive arm of the govern- ment such as the Mental Health Department were not scrutinized in the same detail as have been some departments with less forceful and powerful chief administrative officers than Tavlor Hardin. Per- sons, for instance. who had not come to terms with The idea that subcommittee members with the strongest background and greatest experience in probing for unneeded or exorbitant expenditures, persons such as Beasley, would remain virtually si- lent throughout the examination of Commissioner Hardin, leaving the interrogation to relative new- comers to the investigatory game, certainly would not be understood by the people counting on this pan- el to delve into ALL questionable government ex- penditures. It hardly could be an expected or welcome devel- opment: should the subcommittee members fail to pose critical questions regarding the more than 500 consultants employed by the Mental Health Depart- ment, when they cast wary eyes upon the substan- tially lesser numbers of same contracted by the De- partment of Youth Services. It likewise would seem inconsistent should the subcommittee fail to ponder the need for a Mental Health Department lobbyist, whose major function is maintaining ties with and promoting favorable ac- tion by the legislature, and whose travel expenses in one year exceeded $7,000, when the same subcom- mittee has voiced deep concern over universities re- taining personnel who partially function in the same lobbying capacity. And, how could this subcommittee fault the belea- gured Board of Corrections staff, already trembling at the legislative wrath so far incurred for actions deemed inappropriate, for securing the advice of the - state’s chief legal officer before implementing a new law which totally reverses its practice in computing ‘‘good time” for prisoners? . The public similarly would be stymied in under- standing the subcommittee’s work should it appear politics played a part in the panel’s new, more gracious attitude toward the Department of Pen- sions and Security, which now is headed by a man who Beasley says was one of his strongest suppor- ters when he ran for re-election, and barely pulled through by the skin of his teeth. The thought that political motivations have prompted the drumfire attack on the state’s public universities, to the point where not a favorable word has issued from the subcommittee’s collective mouth regarding the schools that have provided a source of pride and advancement and entertainment for so many Alabamians, also would surely plant a germ of suspicion in the public mind concerning the objective character and intent of the subcommittee. But of course the lieutenant governor, as chair- man and guiding light of the panel, and his subordi- nate members and staff, would never stoop to decep- tion or half-truths or techniques that mislead in car- Tying out the business of the state and of the people in performing their task of making Alabama govern- ment work, because the people surely would not stand for that.

        "ocr_text": "Reed Expected To Deny Tapes By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Tuskegee State Rep. Thomas Reed is expected to take the witness stand in his own defense Wednesday to deny al- legations that he solicited kickbacks in regard to the proposed establishment of a dog racing track in Macon County. The allegations were contained in tape recorded conversations played by the prosecution Tuesday in Reed’s Montgomery Circuit Court bribery trial. On the tapes Ronald Williams, a for- mer Tuskegee city employe indicted on identical bribery charges with ‘Reed last September, said the repres- entative promised to appoint him to the proposed dog racing commission in return for a $2,000 kickback from the commissioner’s $15,000 annual salary. Williams, who will be tried separate- ly later, made the statements during a conversation with Tuskegee State Sen. Dudley Perry, the chief prosecution witness who earlier in the trial testi- fied that Reed and Williams attempted to bribe him with an offer to make him the commission's attorney if he would support Reed’s 1975 legislation to create the dog track and supervisory commission. Other testimony Tuesday showed the conversation was recorded by the FBI, at Perry’s home and with his co- operation, as was another June, 1975, meeting between Perry and Reed. On that recording, also played for the jury Tuesday, Reed promised Per- ry he would alter the proposed bill so each lawmaker would make two ap- pointments to the five-member com- mission, giving them a majority vote. Reed told Perry he would extract a promise from his appointees to cast ‘their votes for the senator for commis- sion attorney, a job which Reed said in another portion of the recording should carry a salary of at least $25,000 the first year, and as much as $50,000 by the second year. tsa “REP. THOMAS REED In addition to showing that Reed of- fered a bribe to Perry, the prosecution also must prove Reed himself stood to gain by the action, due to the in- dictment’s wording that he ‘‘willfully and corruptly’’ bribed the senator. That is what the attorney general's office hoped to show in the recording of the Williams-Perry conversation. Transcripts of that tape were made available only to the jurors and attor- neys, because Circuit Judge William Thetford ruled the limited distribution was required to assure Williams a fair trial later. Although much of the recording played in the courtroom was inaudible from spectators’ seats, it was possible to tell that Williams said Reed ex- pected to receive similar kickbacks from other dog track commissioners. Williams also suggested that he, as a commissioner, and Perry, as the com- mission attorney, could team their in- fluence to get kickbacks from persons hoping to get the contract to build the track, which he characterized as ‘a $15 million project.’’ It did not appear, however, that he included Reed in his proposal for the additional financial gain. Although Williams at one point said that Reed solicited the $2,000 kickback d that he believed Reed would get kickbacks from other com- missioners, he said later on the tape that he did not know what the second- term representative would gain from establishment of the dog track. The defense, which begins present- ing its case Wednesday, is expected to call Reed to the stand to deny the state- ments made by Williams. Defense attorney George Dean of Destin, Fla., said he also will call Wil- liams as a witness, but that he expects Williams will take the Fifth Amend- ment and refuse to answer questions on grounds he may incriminate him- self. Dean also is expected to attempt get- ting into the court record the results of a lie-detector test submitted to Wil- liams at the local Tuskegee news- paper, which supposedly would con- tain information to Reed’s benefit. In the Reed-Perry conversation, which contained only a scattering of profanities in contrast to the frequent use of profane language in the Wil- liams-Perry tape, Reed did intimate he might someday solicit financial help from Perry. At the close of the one-and-a-half hour tape, Reed is recorded as saying: ‘‘Doesn't it stand to reason that if I've got my tail in a crack and you made $25,000. $50,000, or something on this thing, if I need two or three thousand dollars that you'd either let me have it or tell somebody to let me have it?’’ In most of the rest of the tape Reed repeatedly told Perry how much the senator could gain, with Reed’s help and by his own initiative, but also sev- eral times contended Perry’s service and compensation as the dog commis- sion’s attorney would be legal and le- gitimate. Perry never did support Reed’s leg- islation, which killed the dog track bill since local legislation normally re- quires favorable votes from all law- makers representing the district that would be affected. At the close of court proceedings Tuesday, four character witnesses were called by the defense to testify to Reed’s good reputation and say they would believe him under oath. December 8, 2016 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Cabinet Post For Johnson? By MARCIA KUNSTEL And LINDA PARHAM Advertiser Staff Writers Predictions that President-elect Jimmy Carter will offer the post of U.S. attorney general or FBI director to Montgomery's controversial feder- al jurist, U.S. Dist. Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., multiplied Monday in the wake of their late afternoon Atlanta meeting. Official word was virtually nil on the reasons for and outcome of the ses- sion, one of many Carter held at the Georgia Governor’s Mansion through- out the day with prospective Cabinet and other high administration offi- cials. The Associated Press in Atlanta re- ported Johnson presumably spoke with the President-elect about a Jus- tice Department position, however. And Alabama sources close to both the judge and the Carter camp confirmed has sought a U.S. Supreme Court nom- ination from Republican adminis- trations, Levin noted no vacancy ex- ists now on the high court so that likely would not have been the subject of the Monday meeting. Montgomery sources in frequent contact with Johnson also confirmed he is interested in leaving his present position, but has not limited his ambi- tions to another judicial post. They said they believe Johnson would find one of the top Justice De- partment spots a challenge and an op- portunity for continued service that he would not forego if offered And, despite his Republican alle- giance, Johnson reportedly was a per- sonal supporter of Carter's candidacy, rather than of President Ford. that Johnson had been recommended for a high level position in the nation’s chief law enforcement agency. They said the judge had spoken with Carter aides about such possibilities prior to his visit to Atlanta Monday. Johnson, at age 57 a 20-year veteran of the federal bench, whose rulings for sweeping change in Alabama govern- ment and social structures have re- sulted in some calling him ‘‘the real governor of Alabama,’’ reportedly may even have some discretion in the choice of a post. Here are some reasons several sources gave for believing Johnson will be named to an influential job in the Carter administration: —Despite the controversies sur- rounding Johnson's rulings since his appointment in 1955, he has main- tained a publicly neutral stance in po- litical affairs, and Carter has said he wants non-political persons for top Justice Department positions. Johnson, a native of Winston Coun- ty, was appointed to the district judg- eship in 1965, at the age of 37, by the late President Dwight D, Eisenhower, One of his first orders was that the City of Montgomery desegregate seat: ng on public buses, a landmark case followed later by similarly con: troversial civil rights decisions such as the desegregation of public schools. In other fields, he wrote precedent: jal orders concerning the con- stitutional rights of persons in- carcerated in state mental in- stitutions-demanding vast improve: ments throughout the facilitiesand more recently concerning the rights of state prison inmates. That order like: wise was accompanied by detailed di- rections for upgrading the prisons. * —Johnson is a Republican, and Car- ter reportedly is searching for Re- publicans with whom he can work in a harmonious atmosphere, having said he will take a bipartisan approach to appointments. —Johnson is held in high esteem by a umber of Carter advisers, who held top campaign positions or are involved in the president-elect’s transition work, or have served in both capac- ities. —Black support was vital to Car- ter's November victory, and Johnson has a strong reputation among south- ern blacks for his landmark desegre- gation rulings. Support for Johnson within the Car- ter camp supposedly has issued from several quarters, as well as from cur- rent staffers of the Justice Depart- ment. The Associated Press also reported, for example, that Johnson and retired U.S. Circuit Judge Griffin Bell both met with Carter regarding the Justice Department appointments Monday. Johnson is a personal friend of@Bell, who stepped down from the bench to resume his Atlanta law practice with Charles Kirbo, one of Carter's most in- fluential advisers. Bell actively cam- paigned for Carter and has been de- scribed as a key consultant. Also, Montgomery attorney Joseph Levin Jr. is the leader of the president- elect's transition team dealing with Justice Department policy and ap- pointments. Although Levin refused direct com- ment on Johnson's prospects as a can- didate when contacted in Washington Monday, he did admit he has ex- pressed to Carter aides a high regard for Johnson. Similarly favorable comments have been made by other Carter staffers fa- miliar with Johnson's reputation as a jurist. Although Johnson for several years December 14, 2016 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Beasley Asks ICC Be Cut; Report chides Lt. Governor By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley’s request that the Intergovernmental Cooperation Commission be abolished took the spotlight off a state examiner's report partially confirming charges that the agency is a political vehicle for Beasley. The report was prepared by the Exam- iners of Public Accounts for the Sunset Committee, and was delivered the day Beasley appeared before the panel to ask that the commission he chairs be “sunsetted.”” The Sunset Committee, which is re- viewing agencies to determine whether they should be eliminated or continued in service, complied by recommending to the legislature that the controversial ICC be abolished. The committee’s action precluded a review of the examiner’s report, which mildly rebuked the lieutenant governor for practices such as mingling papers from his office with those of the ICC. The report also noted, without com- ment, that employes on the ICC payroll sometimes did work for Beasley, but also stated his office workers at times performed ICC duties. The examiners, whose department is run by a legislative committee chaired by Beasley, also reported on costs of a toll-free telephone line installed by the ICC in Beasley's office. Charges for the line were based on a minimum ten hours a month, and the re- port showed five months when the line was used less than two hours in each, but the cost was the minimum $238.21. The greatest usage was 17.1 hours in September of 1975, followed by 8.9 hours in October of that year. The most frequent usage came during months in which the legislature was in session, and the examiners suggested the line should be disconnected during non-session months. The report also noted the line had been disconnected as of August this year, with total costs for the period from the previous September standing at $3,466. According to the report, the ICC ex- penditures rose from $1,823.64 in the 1966-67 fiscal year when it first was created, to $80,132.16 in fiscal 1975-76. Beasley took over the chairmanship in 1971, and expanded the personnel and duties of the commission that had been virtually dormant. The lieutenant governor's critics have charged that he used the ICC to increase his personal staff and promote his politi- cal ambitions. The examiners did not give any break- down on the kind of work the ICC staff did for Beasley, or how much time they spent doing it. The report did cite the statute creating the ICC, which generally charges it with the responsibility for representing the state bn the Council of State Govern- ments and for helping state officials and employes ‘‘maintain friendly contact with officials and employes of other state, federal and local units of govern- ment.\" The examiners did not question wheth- er drafting legislation of purely state na- ture, or having ICC staff serve a legisla- tive budget committee chaired by Beas- ley, carried out the purpose of the statute establishing the ICC. Those are among the activities for wey the commission has been criti- cized. December 21, 2016 \f"

Wallace's compassion for the physically afflicted with increasing frequency has taken the form of financial aid to specialized medic- al programs. “I lay awake nights thinking about these things,\" Wallace said in a recent interview. : Although the governor said he always was in- . terested in state-financed medical pro- grams—citing his 1970 campaign promise to build a new medical school in Mobile and earlier efforts to fund nursing training—his proposals seem to have increased in number and zeal since the 1972 attempt on his life in Laurel, Md., left him paralyzed from the waist down. The five shots that rendered his legs useless also caused. substantial internal injuries which meant re- peated infections and operations and lengthy stays in hospitals. “T might be a little more aware because I spent so ‘much time in the hospital and saw all kinds of prob- lems,” Wallace said. , But he maintained that his*interest in health care preceded that tragic day in May, having grown after his first wife Lurleen. was stricken with cancer and died in 1968. Among Wallace’s most recent interests is the need for dialysis facilities in Alabama for persons whose ‘kidneys don't function properly to clean impurities from their blood. Those patients must spend six hours several times a week hooked up to a dialysis machine that does the job their kidneys can’t do. Wallace said a magazine article first made him _ aware of the problem, especially difficult for people who live far from dialysis centers and must make long trips for the life sustaining treatment. He made contact with the Kidney Foundation of Alabama, Inc., to find out what the needs are in Alabama, and that resulted in a $300,000 revenue sharing grant, half for dialysis programs in Montgomery and the other half for research and equipment at a dialysis center in Birmingham. The governor also said he will ask the Alabama Legislature to appropriate about $800,000 in the com- ing regular session to help construct an addition to a building at the University of Alabama in Birming- ham Medical Center, The $2 million addition, most to be financed from private foundation and other funds, is for a kidney transplant center. The governor also said he will request about an- other $500,000 for paramedic training in the state's major cities. And, he likely will ask for further funding for the homebound program that enables paraplegics, like himself, and other invalids to remain in their homes with the assistance of visiting housekeepers and aides, Apparently speaking from personal experience, Wallace says one of the most important aspects of providing such medical programs is the ‘‘peace of mind” it gives to the ailing. “It eases the mind to know you won't have to trav- el for treatment,” he said, “to know that you can be confident in the facilities here. And if you're men- tally at ease, it helps you physically, too.” The governor said he does not believe the state has neglected the people's health needs here, but that it's only in recent years that Alabama's treasury has grown sufficiently to finance such programs. he need it, it’s past due, and we're able right now to do it.” December 26, 2016 \f"

Journalists frequently approach this heady task in an unusual manner, how- ever, by devising resolutions for persons other than themselves. The origin of this charitable tradition of helping others, usually public offi- cials, to see the errors of their ways and guide them down the proper path must be listed in some hidden chronicle of his- tory. But it is a tradition observed nation- wide in even the smallest hamlets where newspapers are published, and where reporters labor under delusions of their wisdom and their ability to perform the jobs that others are paid to do. Delusions or otherwise, the intrepid journalist cannot shrink from the duty. So here are some proposed resolutions that the principals of Alabama govern- ment and politics might mull over as they embark on 1977: Gov. George C. Wallace resolving to spend less time campaigning and more time governing. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley and Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley resolving not to call each oth- er nasty names, at least not in public. The members of the Alabama Legisla-- ture resolving not to do anything that will get them sent to the pen. Legislators further resolving not to. pass any laws that they’ll have to repeal or rewrite next year, because they didn’t know what they passed in the first place. All Alabama politicians resolving to stop campaigning for the 1978 elections till 1978 arrives. Everybody thinking about it resolving not to sue the Ethics Commission. Cornelia Wallace resolving not to ex- periment in the field of electronics: again. House Speaker Joe McCorquodale re- solving to think up better reasons for yanking rebellious House members off prestigious committees. Gov. Wallace and State Democratic Chairman Robert Vance resolving to give the primary system a try once again. Montgomery Rep.

        "ocr_text": "°76 Carter Endorsement Pivotal Move for Wallace By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer It was a pivotal year in the political ca- reer of Gov. George C. Wallace, one in which he regained a base in the Demo- cratic party to be built upon through 1977 for a probable U.S. Senate campaign next year. Wallace came as close as he ever may get to being politically respectable among the majority ranks of the Demo- crats, when he finally, formally scuttled his own presidential dreams and cast his lot with with Jimmy Carter. Friends note that likely was a difficult step for the governor, citing his long dis- played reluctance to personally endorse other candidates, especially one who bested him. (It has been reliably reported that Wallace later seriously considered—or said he did—recanting that support with a critique of Carter and an exhortation that his old follers likewise.) But his other choices, to use one of the governor’s favorite expressions, vir- tually were “‘slim and none.” Wallace’s own presidential campaign had faltered badly throughout the spring, as he failed to score significant pri mary results even in the states where he had done well four years earlier and had been expected to do the same or bet- ter this time. His spot in the national limelight had been practically extinguished, and about the only clout remaining to be wielded was in concert with someone else. ANALYSIS Among the Democrats actively seek- ing the nomination, Carter obviously was the most attractive to Wallace, whatever his personal feelings about the Georgian, simply because he is a south- erner. Besides, a failure by Carter to enter the convention with less than a solid ma- jority of the delegates would have left open the possibility of the party turning to an “insider,” like Sen. Hubert Hum- phrey, someone who was a bona fide member of the hierarchy Wallace dis- dained, and carried liberal credentials, to boot. In some ways it might have been eas- ier for Wallace to allign with one of the two major Republicans seeking their party’s nomination. Ronald Reagan was perhaps more philosophically com- patible with Wallace than any other can- didate in either party, and the governor never made any secret of his personal high esteem for President Ford. But that kind of defection in 1976 ulti- mately could have proved disastrous for Wallace. If he does run for the Senate in 1978, which he almost certainly will do, the governor will face a field of serious oppo- nents in the Democratic primary. It won’t be a replay of his 1974 campaign for re-election, when the only other can- didate was a state senator with little rec- ognition and less money. Abandonment of the Democrats in 1976 would have drawn the ive of Ala- bama regulars who have gained strength, funds and an even more ardent party committment than in the old days when Wallace could travel the third par- ty route nationally, then come back and be a Democrat in Alabama without suf- fering ill effects from the separation. That strong faction of the party would have fought him bitterly, when he al- ready would have had a tough enough battle against the other candidates. As it is, Wallace now enjoys a cozy relationship with State Democratic Chairman Robert Vance and his team, and is flirting with segments of the Democratic voting population which haven't been among his ardent followers in the past. There was, for example, his effort on behalf of Huntsville area residents who don’t want a new prison in their back- yard. The governor attempted to in- tervene with the prison board, in what was seen as an effort to ingratiate him- self to at least that one portion of the hef- ty North Alabama vote. There also have been a few quiet - moves in the direction of the black com- munity, such as his raisingt of he United States flag over the Confederate banner on the Capitol dome, and his easy will- ingness to sign the pardon of the last known living Scottsboro boy. Similar overtures can be expected through the coming year, as Wallace prepares to face what could be the most critical struggle of his political career. January 3, 1977 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Super-Agencies Urged for State By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A consulting firm studying how to reorganize state government report- edly has recommended that Ala- bama’s 212 agencies and departments be combined into nine super-agencies and the existing constitutional offices. The report has been submitted to the Governor’s Committee on State Gov- ernment Reorganization, whose exec- utive committee met in a closed-door session with Gov. George C. Wallace Wednesday to discuss their views on the proposal. Members later said the group is far from final agreement on a reorganiza- tion recommendation but is working to finish a product for submission to the Alabama Legislature during the ses- sion that convenes Feb. 1. Several said there is considerable displeasure over specific aspects of the proposal, made by Warren King and Associates Inc., a management consulting firm in Chicago. There supposedly is general agree- ment, however, that the large number of state departments, agencies, boards and commissions can and should be vastly reduced to improve over all administration in the execu- tive branch. Although the group initially planned to consider altering the constitutional structure of the goverment, it was de- cided to concentrate now on the offices created by statute or by executive or- der, according to executive committee members and others familiar with the group’s work, who preferred not to be’ quoted by name. They said the King proposal would give the governor more adminis- trative authority over all executive branch functions which don’t come un- der other constitutional offices. That includes the Mental Health and Corrections Departments, which now are run by independent boards. One source said both boards might be abo- lished or reduced to an advisory stat- us. As outlined in the consultants’ re- port, the transition to the super- agency system would take at least two years to accomplish, once approved by the legislature. The new secretaries or directors of the major departments, as well as the constitutional officers, would be as- signed the functions of existing depart- ments and agencies. In the two-year period the secretar- ies would develop their own organiza- tion plans, deciding how to handle the agencies assigned to them—whether to abolish or consolidate them, or to leave them intact as individual units within the major department. Those plans also probably would require ulti- mate legislative approval. Considerable pessimism was_ issued task in time for presentation in the up- coming legislative session. Even if a reorganization plan is ap- proved by lawmakers this year, the transition likely could not begin until at least late 1978. That is because the 1977-78 fiscal year budget is close to completion now, and it would be ex- tremely difficult to alter the ledger to accommodate the new government structure until the 1978 regular legisla- tive session. In that year the legislature will be writing budgets for the 1978-79 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 1978, to Sept. 30, 1979), which would coincide with the change in the state administration. That, it was noted, would be a partic- ularly good time for the transition to take place, since a new governor tak- ing office in 1979 mill make wide-rang- ing personnel changes in the executive branch anyway. Some sources said they don’t expect such a reorganization to save large sums of money or make significant personnel reductions, at least not im- mediately. They said the main benefit would be producing clearer, more definite lines of administrative responsibility and authority. 7 That essentially is how President- elect Jimmy Carter described the merits of the reorganization plan im- plemented while he was governor of Georgia. He has made similar com- ments about his plans to reorganize the federal bureaucratic structure. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, however, who has promoted state government reorganization and was the impetus behind Wallace’s appointment of the committee, has said a comprehensive restructuring of the government would save large sums of taxpayers’ money and bring* about reductions in state employment.

        "ocr_text": "Ohioan Feels Smug O the snow, the beautiful snow, Filling the sky and the earth below. Over the housetops, over the street, Over the heads of the people you meet, Dancing, Flirting, Skimming along, Beautiful snow, it can do nothing wrong. —John Whittaker Watson By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer That might be the sentiment of the poet lounging before a crackling fire, gazing out upon woodlands peacfully edged in white. Or of kids gleefully released from classroom rigors to wallow in snowdrifts and careen down slippery hillsides. Most Montgomerians, however, can find plenty wrong with snow. The freakish collision of cold and warm air masses that once every few years turns South Alabama into a scene from Curier and Ives also turns normal life into one gigantic State of confusion. For a native Ohioan reared in the snowbelt where skies often drop a 15-inch load of white stuff in a single night, the chaos allows a smugness verging on amusement. The idea of local residents close- ting themselves indoors—or at least venturing out only to tread a path to the local grocery on foot—seems al- most ludicrous when recalling the many nights of driving miles in near blizzard conditions just to keep a dinner engagement or see a mov- ie. The school closing, shut-down of state and local governments, and cars crawling at 10 miles an hour through just an inch or two of snow stretch the bounds of a one-time Northerner’s believability. That, however, is only the initial reaction, and it melts away quicker than those lacy flakes bringing a relatively short-lived trauma to the Montgomery area. A little thought and a few conver- sations result in the obvious realiza- tion that Southerners simply never learned how to cope with snow. Not only do they seldom have to deal with it, but when they do, even the small amounts dumped on their doorsteps can be more burdensome than a foot or two in Ohio. The first inkling for this North- erner came upon reaching into the trunk of the car for a windshield snow brush—and recalling I gave that up with the last auto trade-in. Driving to the interstate I noticed a man sweeping the snow from his walk with a broom. No standard household shovels in Alabama. By 10:30 a.m. the snow was turn- ing to deep slush on the highviay, but it occurred to me that the state has none of the bright yellow ploughs that speed down super- highways in Ohio to quickly clear paths and lay cinders on any* re- maining ice. And the driving: practices that; second nature to someone who first sat behind the wheel in snowy weather are virtually unknown to co-workers and friends who qpiver at the thought of making it to te of- fice. ; Most people here seem unztware that bridges freeze first, so sjtecial caution is needed when approach- ing one; that lightly tapping the brake when a stop seems imnlinent is the best way to keep from sliding into the auto ahead; that relensing the brake and turning with the. skid is the only way to get out of one with- out wrenching sidelong off. the road; that stopping at the bottm of an icy hill to brace for the effort will assure you don’t make the top. The differences in the northern and southern responses to a spdden cover of white are vastly diff erent, yet in one way are the same, at‘; least for some people of both regions. The beauty of the first snowfall, the physical transformatior that creates a pure white fantasyld, is greeted with awe by those used to the drab gray of empty tree branches and browned lawns. : The sight produces a strange: ex- hileration signalled in smiles and hellos between strangers trudging , past each other on the streets, all bun- dled against the cold air and sear- ing winds. It might not last 1nuch longer than it takes to feel the flesh numb down to the bones, but ié’s a _ lovely, friendly world for a while. ;_/) January 19, 1977 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Who Will Go Where? By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The pomp and circumstance in Washington this past week signalled the formal close to 18 months of a continuous, heavy dose of national politics, liber- ally laced with Jimmy Carter. Although President Carter obviously will remain a central figure in news and political circles, the pleasant glow of the limelight has dimmed, and he soon will become simply another beleagured presi- dent attempting to cope with conflicting demands from all quarters on all issues, as the nation settles into the new presidency. Gov. George C. Wallace was among those at the in- auguration doing homage to the country’s new lead- er, maintaining for him the unaccustomed role of subordinate ally that ne assumed the day he official- ly bowed out of the presidential sweepstakes last summer. Wallace and most other politicians have per- - Mitted Carter his warm day in the sun, but soon will be scrambling to attract a few rays to themselves, The governor already has gone so far as to put out word that he is ‘seriously considering” a race for the U.S. Senate in 1978, saying to questioners that he would have some announcement after the first of the year, He never said how soon after the first, but cohorts have suggested the news would not be made till Car- ter was safely installed as head of state, thus show- ing the proper respect for the new chief executive and incidentally waiting for the media to become re- ceptive again to non-presidential news. Friends reportedly have been urging the governor to make his public stand soon, partially in hopes of warding off other possible contenders who would give long and searching thought to doing battle against the man who has become virtually an in- stitution in this state. An announced Wallace candidacy may have that impact on some potential aspirants, mostly those be- ginning from a weak base and having more idle hopes than working chances. Others, however, will not be scared off. Recently-retired Chief Justice Howell Heflin may be one, Some practically have written off the judge as a man who would shy away from a tough and po- tentially scarring fight for any office, having emerged from his latest political experience with a cleaner image than graces many only beginning their political careers. Both the campaigns for gov- ernor and for the Senate, the two in which Heflin has been interested, are expected to be of the rough-and- tumble variety, and many believe the judge will stay out of the fray. Perhaps he will. But Heflin lost no time after shedding his judicial robe last week in making the rounds to sound out the opinions of influential people regarding both those races. He is not out of the pic- ture, and likely will not let Gov. Wallace’s antici- pated announcement be the deciding factor. Talk still is circulating that Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley may be switching his sights to Washington rather than to the first-floor gubernatorial sanctum in the Capitol. The animosity between Beasley and the governor is so great that the lieutenant governor likely will face active opposition from Wallace's people in whichever race he chooses to make, so has little to lose by taking the governor head on. Beas- ley's two-year inquest into the conduct of the execu- tive branch provides him a good base either for a campaign to clean up the government as the new ex: ecutive, or for a more personal one against the man who let things get into such disarray, With no formal announcements yet, it’s too soon to conjecture what will happen by then. The factors in- clude the possibility of a wide field splintering the anti-Wallace vote and tossing the nomination safely to the governor. No one knows yet how great the sympathy vote will be for the crippled Wallace, or how many people simply are tiring of the regime that has held power here for more than a decade, amid frequent charges of corruption and non-admin- istration. The most certain thing is that a Wallace candidacy would be virtually a life-or-death push for the gover- nor, a man whose life has been built around politics and dreadfully altered by them. Many question how long he could sustain a will to survive on the college lecture circuit or in a modest law practice without the constant rejuvenating injections of political en- zymes. His stakes are by far the greatest in 1978. a Ie NN After six years on Alabama's Capitol Hill, Miss Kun- stel is moving to Atlanta. This is her last Sunday col- umn, January 23, 1977 \f"
