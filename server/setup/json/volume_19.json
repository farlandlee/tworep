Salome Joumal-Constitution correspondents CAIRO, Egypt — U.S. soldiers began hunkering down Saturday for a protracted stay in Saudi Arabia, as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak lamented for the first time that he sees “no hope” for a peaceful end to Iraq’s annexation of Kuwait. “]'m always optimistic, but frankly I tell you there is no hope,” Mr. Mubarak said Saturday when asked about a possible peaceful solution. “I wish there was.” As if to un- derline the ®» Complete coverage of risk of war, crisis A10-A11 Saudi Arabian >US. vulnerable ti-aircraft pitteries fired inMiddle East G4 Saturday at two Iraqi reconnaissance planes near the Kuwaiti border with the kingdom, diplo- matic sources told The Associated Press. But a Saudi official, who requested ano- nymity, denied the incident took place. The spokesman for the U.S. Rapid De- ployment Force in Saudi Arabia, Capt. Kev- in Baggett, asked about reports of the shoot- ing, said, “I don’t know anything about that.” In Washingon, Col. Miguel Monte- verde, a Pentagon spokesman, said he was aware of the report but added, “It’s uncon- firmed by American sources.” Mr. Mubarak, appearing dejected one day after an Arab summit failed to produce any Iraqi compromise, said Egypt was sending a contingent of army reconnais- sance troops to Saudi Arabia. He said Syria and Morocco “probably” would add ground units to the growing multinational air, sea and land force that has been assembled around Iraq since its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Meanwhile, President Bush indicated the United States would welcome any Iraqi move to overthrow President Saddam Hussein. “I hope the Iragi people do something about it,” Mr. Bush said from his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he is vacationing. “Some coun- tries around the world are hop- ing that will happen.” Asked whether the United States was among those coun- tries, Mr. Bush said, “Whatever it takes to have our objectives met is what should take place.” Iraq’s borders remained vir- tually sealed, and Saddam gave no sign that he was about to give exit permits to the 4,000 Ameri- cans trapped in Irag and Kuwait. A few Westerners did emerge, including Penelope Nabokov, 10, and 10 U.S. diplomatic personnel who reached Jordan. Iraq’s government press and radio continued to assail ‘‘evil” Arab leaders who “conspired” to approve Saudi Arabia’s plea for an Arab defense force. Saudi Arabia “will have to suffer the consequences” if Iraq is ever at- tacked, the Iraqi commentators said. U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia labored in bristling 120-degree temperatures Saturday to pre- pare for their open-ended stay. One U.S. soldier, reached by telephone inside Saudi Arabia, said the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., already has taken up positions near Dhahran air base, about 180 miles south of the Iraqi front lines in southern Kuwait. Asked where the division’s headquar- ters could be contacted, the man said, “They are already out in the desert.” AU.S. diplomat in Saudi Ara- bia’s oil-producing Eastern prov- ince, where the 82nd Airborne is positioned, reported that local people are staying “quite calm” despite last week's spate of Iraqi invasion rumors. “Grocery stores are open, there isn’t any panic buying; there aren’t any lines at the gaso- line stations,” the diplomat said. “What I noticed most was the large amount of fresh tomatoes, fruits and other produce that was being trucked into the “area for sale in the stores. To me, it was a Sign that everything is incredibly normal.” The Egyptian detachment of 500 soldiers that has arrived in Saudi Arabia could be the begin- ning of a sizable Arab peace- keeping force. A leading Egyp- tian political scientist, Abdel Monem Said Aly, predicted that the expected Arab force would reach 50,000 troops. The Arabs would be deployed alongside the Americans, but they are not expected to be part of a unified desert command. Syria — Egypt’s archenemy for 20 years — seemed poised to send a sizable troop contingent that would rank second in strength to Cairo’s, according to diplomats and Egyptian analysts. At the summit meeting, Presi- dent Hafez Assad of Syria emerged as one of the strongest allies of the Saudi monarchy and the fiercest critic of the Iraqi in- vasion. Other Arab countries viewed as likely contributors to the Arab force were Morocco, Oman, Bah- rain and the United Arab Emir- ates. Jordan, however, once a de- pendable U.S. ally but now tied closely to Iraq, declared at the summit that it had “reserva- tions” about the Saudi troop request. Any Arab leader who does send troops can be sure of a vitri- olic, and possibly violent, reac- tion from Saddam and his admir- ers in their countries. In a foretaste of what could happen in packed, brooding cit- ies throughout the Middle East, more than 10,000 Yemeni admir- ers of Saddam massed in the cap- ital of San‘a and tried to storm the U.S. and Saudi embassies to protest the American troop. de- ployment. Witnesses said they chanted, “no to America, no to Jews, the army of Mohammed will return” as they threw stones before being driven back by baton-wielding Yemeni polic¥. Yemen abstained on the summit’s resolution on sending Arab troops. Similar demonstrations have been reported in Jordan, Libya, Mauritania and the territories occupied by Israel. In other developments: # Thirty-two foreign men, women and children, mostly Americans and Britons, escaped across the desert from Kuwait with the help of Bedouin guides, reaching Bahrain on Saturday, a newspaper reported. One woman in the group told the Gulf Daily News that she knew of at least four women who were raped by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait. aJapanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu planned today to discuss whether Japan should contribute money to help finance a multinational force guarding Saudi Arabia. A newspaper re- ported that Japan, which obtains 70 percent of its oil from the Mid- dle East, may help pay for the de- fense force . Atlanta Journal- Constitution August 12, hehe] e \f"

        "ocr_text": " Arabs forced to choose sides MARCIA KUNSTEL COX NEWS SERVICE ASHINGTON — Western businessmen often get vi- sas to the Gulf sultanate of Qman quicker and easier than do Palestinians, who are subjected tocxtensivesecuity checks, or Libyans, \"a usually aren’t permitted inside at When an Omani official was asked about such treatment of Arab brothers, he was said to reply: “Englishmen don’t plant bombs,” or is one mark of the differences per vading the vast Arab family, iferene spread like a network of hairline cracks across a parched riverbed, Sometimes defining what binds the Arab family s more difficult than point: ing out the cracks, That is especially so in times such as the present crisis, when stark decisions must be made and sides taken on behalf of one or another family member. The Aug. 10 Arab summit meeting in Cairo, where a majority voted to send troops to stop Iraq from expanding its invasion beyond Kuwait, was one of those times, The session was report- edly so fractious that Iraqis threw plates of food at the Kuwaitis during lunch, and the Kuwaiti foreign minister faint ed in the midst of debate, Yet exhortations to be united, to act as a single nation, to move forward togeth- er in brotherhood and faith have come loud and repeatedly from the mouths of Arabs, both leader and led, over many decades, They are being stated today and undoubtedly will issue forth for many tomorrows, Conflicting aims How can this paradox be? It is not that Arabs fail to see their conflicting aims and philosophies or the kaleidoscope of diverse peoples who comprise the Arab world, “Underlying that,” explained James ‘Zogby, director of the Arab-American ~ Institute, “isa strong emotional sense of people being a single people that is based on the reality of a common lan- guage, a common culture anda common history.” That history stretches back more than 1,000 years, to an Arab Moslem empire that expanded from the holy Islamic city of Mecca to reach beyond Syria, east as far as China and west across northern Africa, then up to cover Spain and part of France, It was built by holy warriors following the preaching of the prophet Mo- hammed, who when he died in 632 left behind one of the world’s great reli. gions, Islam, and a phalanx of desert: hardened adherents bent on spreading Conquering sometimes was eased by native populations already under for- eign rule, such as in Syria and Iraq, who in some ways saw Arab invaders as lib- erators. These Moslems usually levied’ lower taxes, kept their troops from mass pillage and did not demand that people convert to Islam. Tenets of the religion itself attracted converts, perhaps primarily because of the emphasis on equality. In carrying the words of Mohammed thousands of miles across deserts, mountains and seas to none believers, the Arabs also took other aspects of their culture. Most important, they spread their language. The classical Arabic of the Koran, the collection of Mohammed’s teachings, is said to be such beautifully rhythmical and rhyming prose that it defies transla- tion. The Koran is the basis of written Arabic, of Moslem education and of the Islamic religion, making it probably the most widely-read book today in a world in which one-sixth of the population is Moslem. At the same time, the Arabs were in- fluenced by the cultures in place when they arrived — Hellenistic, Persian, By- zantine, They became purveyors of art, food, ideas, bringing oranges to Spain and Greek philosophy to Baghdad. It is the grandeur of those days in the 8th and 9th centuries that still haunts Arabs today, ftom Morocco on the coast of the Atlantic to Oman on the Arabian The empire, as all before and after, did not last. Splits breached the faith itself, as religious factionalism brought politi- cal divisions that still today wrench Arab harmony. Pieces of a weakened empire fell to Christian Crusaders, to brutal Mongol warriors and to Catholic monarchs who opened the vengeful Spanish Inquisi- tion, The Ottoman Turks began empire- building in the 1320s, finally captured Cairo in 1517, and initiated 400 years of Ottoman domination of the Islamic world and parts of Europe. The places where Arab culture was fixed and survived outside rule were, for the most part, places where the Arabic language took root. Syrian writer Sati al-Husri gave a defi- nition of the Arab world in 1930 that fits today: “The Arab nation consists of all who speak Arabic as their mother tongue, no more, no less.” It includes fair-haired, blue-eyed Syri- ans, black-skinned Sudanese, and Alge- rians who speak French as a result of colonial occupation, but made Arabic their national language as soon as they achieved independence. Among these Arabs are 10 million Christians. More recent colonial incursions creased what had become the Arab land with the deepest divisions. French and British colonial powers imbued Arabs with the notion of the na- tion state, then imposed upon them boundaries that sometimes made little sense, The Sie of statehood i i$ $0 The Gazette (Montreal, Canada) - August 18, 1990 > \fArabs forced War | no independent nation had Ara- bic as its official language. Sense of betrayal Probably the greatest sense of betrayal that led to anti-western sentiment burn- ing yet today stemmed from Britain’s three promises for the land of Pales- tine. nation there, in return for their fighting against the Turks. And it promised the Jews “a national home” there, for which it expected Jewish financial support for the war effort. And Britain signed a trea- ty with France dividing Palestine and Arabia into foreign spheres of influence — not independent states, Britain controlled Palestine after the war, opening half of it to an influx of Jewish immigrants from Russia and Eu- rope whose numbers exploded as Nazi anti-Semitism built into the terrors of the Holocaust and World War II. Ultimately the Jews built their state of Israel within Palestine, but amid contin- ual resistance from the Arabs who lived around them.

        "ocr_text": "Saudi onl freliad could becCco re tmcendiary bor bormb By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent CAIRO, Egypt — Travel 100 miles into Saudi Arabia’s gray, glimmering desert east from its capital, Riyadh, and you'll reach a single, mammoth oil field that holds about one-tenth of the world’s oil reserves, In the hard-boiled realm of global calculations, the Ghawar field is a big part of why the Western world cares about pre- serving the Saudi monarchy. It is the amazing capacity of this one ‘field that allows Saudi rulers to drive world oil prices up or down overnight. During the Persian Gulf cri- sis, however, Ghawar is a mixed blessing. Its pumping stations and holding tanks were designed for peacetime. If war breaks out and the Ira- qis attack the Ghawar complex - with missiles, it could turn into the world’s biggest incendiary bomb. The loss of Ghawar and its intricate oil-loading facilities could leave the world starved for oil for months, even years. ome Ghawa i is a ¥ ered, few people except petro- _leum geologists have heard of it. ' Even fewer have seen it. As a piece of landscape, it - isn’t much. The terrain looks like just another dusty stretch of de- sert dotted by occasional bushes resembling scraggly sagebrush, — No sand dunes, no camels, not even a lonely Bedouin. It is even hard to see an oil well, Because each one can yield 10,000 barrels a day or more, they are spaced a mile or so apart. The wells look like stove- pipes coming out of the ground, each with a few gauges and dials. There’s a reason: In Ghawar, as elsewhere in the Middle East, the wells are so prolific that there is no need for the rocker- arm pumps that give Texas oil wells their distinctive look. Instead of using pumps to lift the oil, the engineers who man- age Ghawar adjust the “reser- voir pressure” in the subterra- nean oil pool by pumping salt wa- ter and natural gas along the sides of the oil reservoir. The wa- ter and natural gas replace the oil as it flows out. The most startling aspect of the Ghawar field is not its looks, but its size. Down there, 7,500 Ghawar i fel or) Wells could gush out 9 million barrels of oil a day, according to | a 1978 study for the CIA by the |, Rand Corp. Since then, cutbacks in well | drilling probably have lowered the field’s maximum capacity. But a concentrated drilling pro- gram could snap it back to its old self in months. As far as outsid- ers can deduce, Ghawar was pro- 4 ducing a mere 2 million barrels a Ne, af | day before Kuwait was invaded. Even at that comparatively paltry output, this one field was SL nearly matching all the oil wells feet below the sand, is an enor: mous, oil-soaked sponge 140 miles long,.20 miles wide and 1,000 feet thick. For the past decade, King Fahd’s oil technicians have kept the Ghawar field on idle: Most of the time, it has produced less than one-fourth of its theoretical capacity. i i Saudis chose to let in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay com- bined. That means that every time a U.S. motorist fills up the tank, the odds are that at least half a gallon of the gas was re- fined from Ghawar’s crude. Ghawar has three or four times the reserves of the next: largest Saudi field. Take away Ghawar, and Saudi Arabia’s total oil reserves would be slashed by one-third to one-half. The only oil field in the world near its capacity is Kuwait's Bur- gan field, one of Saddam’s new any Prizes. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 19, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Gls’ arrival helps sooth Saudi fears Border exodus slows as soldiers move in By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent ALONG THE KUWAITI BORDER, Saudi Arabia — Three days ago, a Saudi first sergeant named Abdullah led his infantry- mer in digging foxholes in the sand. “For one or two weeks up here, it is not a problem for us,” Abdullah said. “But if we have to Stay up here one month or two months, it will be very hard on us.” He is one in a thin line: the foot soldiers of Saudi Arabia who have been sent north to ward off the 200,000 Iraqi soldiers and 1,000 tanks that Defense Secre- tary Dick Cheney on Sunday said are poised on the other side of the Kuwaiti frontier. Even for a man of the desert, the 120-degree heat weighs a ton. Abdullah says his unit is short on water and has no ice. Worst of all, the hot wind of- ten blows all night and pushes sand into their foxholes. When the sun rises the next morning, they must dig them out again. But one thing helps his mo- al h ai « . ave N aU a now that the Americans have come.” At noon Sunday, when the killer sun was vertical to the de- sert, Abdullah's commander de- cided he had to give the men a break. He sent Abdullah and a truckload of his young Saudi troops into Khafji to eat roast chicken and rice. The place is called the Ku- wait Cafe, so named because the Saudi owner thought it would at- tract a few of the Kuwaiti travel- ers who before the Aug, 2 inva- sion used to wheel through the border town of Khafji in their air-conditioned BMWs. Like Abdullah, the town of Khafji is trying to adjust to the fact that advance units of Iraqi troops are only seven miles away. For those townspeople who haven't left, that reality doesn't seem quite so spooky now. Like the soldiers, they have been told the Yanks are coming, “T haven't seen them yet, but I know they are here,” he said, “We have strong weapons of our own, but we don't have enough people.” The news of the Americans’ landing has slowed the exodus from the border region, On the edge of town, 79 for: eign women — mostly Filipinos, Indians and Pakistanis — work as nurses in the hospital of the Japanese-owned Arabian Oil Co. Since the conquest of Kuwait, the prospect of getting raped in the next Iraqi offensive has caused “almost panic” in the nurses’ quarters, said Ibrahim Khalil, the company’s vice pres- ident. ® “Tmt with tb,\" he said. “I told them we would give them their passports back so they could leave any time, and we would keep a bus and a driver in front of the hospital where they could see it.” For now, the nurses have agreed to stay. But the other night, Mr. Kha- lil got a frantic call from the hos- pital’s chief medical officer. One nurse noticed that the driver of their emergency bus had wan- dered away from his post. The driver was found and the crisis ended. In his company compound, at least, rape has outweighed chem- ical warfare as a worry, Mr. Kha- lil said. “Of course, we've been trying to train people about [chemical weapons], too,” he said, “We've told people that they should go into a bathtub and get under the water, and that they should turn off the air conditioning and put towels next to the cracks in the door.” That is not the only executive headache at Arabian Oil, the town's main employer. For 32 years, the company has produced oil from a stretch of sea bottom under the Persian Gulf that belongs partly to Ku- wait and partly to Saudi Arabia. The company has been produc. ing 450,000 barrels a day from the joint concession, bringing a daily stream of revenue of about $11 million. So to whom is the company su to send Kuwait's share of the revenue? Should it go to Baghdad or to the deposed Ku: waiti rulers? According to local execu: ed in the New York bank ac- counts of the toppled Kuwaiti government, That presumably means the ex-rulers could draw on it to finance their activities aimed at ousting the Iraqi troops. “So far, none of these new people has come and asked us for acheck,” one Arabian Oil execu- tive said. “Maybe they won't try.” The town of Khafji had 35,000 inhabitants before Kuwait was conquered. Many were out of town already because August is a Saudi holiday month, The inva- sion has caused many hundreds of other Saudi families to flee to safer places, and the town seems empty. The modern shops are shut- tered, Around midday, not a sin- gle child played in the street, not a single woman was visible, _ No wonder, Between the cen- ter of town and the Saudi frontier post is seven miles of highway through flat, open desert. The Saudi frontier post looks scarcely like a bastion to defend the sector that contains more than 95 percent of the country's oil. From the road leading into Kuwait, it looks like a big con- crete toll plaza where workers have gone on strike, An Arabian Oil executive ex- plained that a 1.5-mile-wide no man’s land separates the Saudi frontier from Kuwait's southern- most frontier station, “From what we have been told, that's where the Iraqi army starts,” The Yanks hadn't come yet, but they were on their way, During a taxi ride back from the border toward heavily inhab- ited regions farther south, the driver said, “Look, there they are, the Americans.” Sure enough, about a dozen U.S. soldiers were stopped along the north-south highway, looking into the desert and studying maps. They were sitting in three olive-drab scout cars, the ad- vanced military version of a jeep designed to cruise through sand and mud, We made a U-turn across the six-lane highway and parked ahead of them. “We're from Fort Bragg,” said a battalion commander, a lieutenant colonel, What's it like living in the de- sert? “From 10 to 2 in the after- noon, it's awful,” said an officer of the 82nd Airborne Division. He was wearing shoulder patch- es that said “Airborne” and “Ranger.” “We will never get used to it like these people from over here,” he said. “You've got to stay in the shade if you can, We have been trying to do some physical training in the evenings.” Heading south again, a half- hour later the taxi passed a con- voy of U.S. troops rolling north. A few rode smartly in Fort Bragg desert buggies, but most looked out of place. To get to the Kuwaiti front, the cream of the U.S, Rapid De- ployment Force had to jam into white, blue and orange Saudi public buses apparently bor- rowed from the Saudi transit system. t Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 20, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "American workers im Saudi Arabia dare to stay put O1ul1 company’s motto: Never flinch from risk By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — For oil company schoolteacher Susan Wells of Hamlet, N.C., the hardest part is “getting these hysterical calls from home in the middle of the night telling us to get out.” “The other night my sister just called me from Rome, Ga., and said if my mother doesn’t stop watching CNN, she’s going to have a stroke,”’ said Ms. Wells, who works for the world’s most prolific oil company, the Arabian American Oil Co. (Aramco). For now, Ms. Wells is staying put. And so are most of the other 2,568 Americans and 8,800 expa- triates helping to run Aramco 250 miles south of the Iraqi front lines. Together they make up one-fourth of the work force, with the rest of the jobs held by Saudis. Most foreign dependents have been evacuated, but a de- termined minority, including at least 200 American wives and children, have chosen to stay. One is Christophe Sherman, 7, an oil worker’s child who was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The family is used to suit- cases: Christophe complains that he has moved so many times that he has had to repeat kindergar- ten in three countries. But not this time, not for Saddam Hussein. “We decided that if we left, my dad might get killed, and my mom wouldn’t like that,’’ Chris- tophe said. If war comes, the Aramco compound almost certainly would be Saddam’s ground zero. Even if he wanted to leave Aram- co’s control center intact, he could scarcely ignore the threat from the large Dhahran Air Base, a two-minute drive from the Aramco gate. Every so often as Christophe spoke, a pair of Saudi or Ameri- can F-15s or a few British Torna- dos would scream up from the runway, blasting eardrums in the playground below. Last week, nine-tenths of the boys and girls in the Aramco pri- mary school were evacuated in chartered jumbo jets, along with their mothers and siblings. About 1,400 of the 5,000 Ar- amco dependents flew out a few days after the invasion of Kuwait when the company offered all foreign employees a chance to pack their families out. Hun- dreds of Aramco dependents al- ready were abroad because Sad- dam struck during the August vacation season. Then, on Aug. 11, the U.S. transport and fighter planes sent by President Bush started pour- ing out of the sky at Dhahran Air Base. That turned the Dhahran Hills School’s playground into an airborne show-and-tell. On Monday morning, nine days later, about 50 primary schoolchildren were frolicking in a manicured grass playground, playing on the swings and jungle gyms and co’s miniature roller coaster. A lesson in real danger For Christophe, recent events have been a chance to learn about the precariousness of life before he has finished first grade. “T heard that there is this cra- zy man up there who says he’s going to gas babies,\"’ Christophe said. “I don't think he will.” He figures ‘there will be some shooting and some killing.” But he guesses that he and his parents won't have to leave Saudi Arabia until it comes time for their next vacation. ‘‘We're plan- ning to go to Hawaii,” he said. “If we like it there, we might stay.” Since the company now called Aramco found oil in Saudi Arabia in March 1938, the corpo- rate ethic was to never flinch from risk — and almost never talk to outsiders. It was that way for 35 years, shares ° when were owned out right by Exxon, Mobil, Texaco Lucia Rawis of Columbia, S.C., lectures recently hired Aramco em- ployees on how to stay calm. “DOING THEIR JOBS\" and Amoco. And the corporate culture hasn’t altered much since 1972, when the Saudi gov- ernment told the U.S. companies it was going to begin buying up the American shares. In 1988, Aramco became 100 percent Saudi-owned. Saddam changed one thing: He made it possible for a few Western journalists to go behind the walls of a company town, built atop the now-capped Dam- mam oil field, the first one Ar- amco found. The most striking sight in the Dnahran Hills compound is the golf course, Rolling Hills. Aficionados tee off in 120-de- gree heat on a course made by pouring asphalt over the desert. Players carry strips of astroturf and place the ball on top of it be- fore each shot on the fairway. If the ball veers off into the un- paved sand “rough,” the astro- turf isn’t allowed. Aside from Rolling Hills, it looks a bit like a high-priced sub- urb in South Florida — mani- cured lawns, palm trees, hedges of purple-flowered bougain- villea. “Take away the palm trees and this could be Georgia,” Ms. Wells said. The ‘ultimate challenge’ Most Aramco employees probably would agree with Lucia Rawls of Columbia, S.C., a politi- cal scientist who is Aramco’s highest-ranking woman profes- weeks have been the ultimate challenge,”” said Dr. Rawls, 30, who came to Saudi Arabia two years ago with master’s and doc- toral degrees from the Universi- ty of South Carolina. Before the invasion, her job was representing Aramco’s med- ical and legal departments in dealings with Saudi Arabian gov- ernment ministries. These days, she has taken on an added duty: lecturing recently hired Aramco employees on how to stay calm. Avoid passing on rumors, she says. And buy a shortwave radio. In quieter times, Dr. Rawls used her off hours to go scuba diving or play catcher on an ex- patriate women’s softball team behind the walls of a foreign company compound, where no Saudi Arabian eyes could be shocked. Now she comforts herself af- ter-hours by trading black hu- mor with some of the others who are sticking it out for the du- ration. Her samples of the latest: “New names for Saddam Hussein’s country: Irate and Kuwack.” “New name for Aramco if Saddam Hussein wins: Iraco.\" “New T-shirt: ‘Life in Saudi Arabia is a Gas.’”’ “Another new T-shirt: ‘Visit Iraq Before Iraq Visits You.’ ” The crisis has brought Dr. Rawls her quota of anguished calls from home. Her father, Lu- cian Rawls, is a retired colonel in the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division and now the president of a family services center in Co- lumbia. “This experience has really done a lot for my parents,” she said. ‘‘My mother used to watch as my dad went off to situations. Now he has to watch television when I’m out here. “‘My mother told me she has finally realized that being a yo woman in the °90s is total- ly different than what she knew — this ti I was not a depen- dent to tf relocated.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 21, 1990 \f"

Many of these professional airmen fig- ured that war is inevitable and they might as well get on with it. “We are waiting for it to start,” said Dennis, 41, a master sergeant from South Carolina, who flew in more than a week ago with the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing from Langley Air Force Base, Va. “We can’t wait for that. I think the only way the world is going to be safe from this man is to take him out, and that is what we are geared up to do.” Specific locations and full names cannot be provided under Pentagon rules. Dennis said he knows this base is within the arc of Sad- dam’s missiles. “Once he starts something, we'll have to take them out,” he said. “We know that. Maybe some people will lose their lives, maybe myself in- At the other end of the air base, a black-bereted Saudi F-15 pilot was asked if he expects war. “Yes,” he said, “I think the way is open for that. ... If it breaks out, it will be a long war. From a military point of view, it would be a bad one.” On Tuesday, the Middle East ratcheted one notch further toward bloodshed when it be- came a missile crisis, oil crisis and hostage crisis rolled into one. The base commander, Brig. Gen. Turki bin Nasser, con- firmed Tuesday that Saddam has been moving 400-mile-range missiles into occupied Kuwait. That puts this base, which is the joint American-Saudi com- mand center, within the potential trajectory of high-explosive and possibly chemical warheads. Though General Turki de- clined to specify numbers of mis- siles, an editor of Jane’s Soviet Intelligence Review said Iraq has moved up to 36 missile launchers and 800 missiles into Kuwait. The editor, Henry Dodds, said he has learned from a Saudi source that the missile is the Al- Husayn, a souped-up Iraqi ver- sion of the Soviet Scud-B fired against Tehran during the Iran- Iraq war. The United States has set up batteries of Patriot anti-missile missiles near the air base in hopes of batting down any pro- jectiles fired by Saddam’s crews. The Patriot, designed to help defend Europe against the Sovi- ets, could face its first live test against incoming missiles, “It has never been tested in com- bat,” said General Turki, “but it is quite good in theory.” This air base is the spring- board for the flights of Saudi and American F-15s. They take turns flying in big circles near the Ira- qi border, waiting around the Clock to intercept any Iraqi in- truders, It also is the site of the joint U.S.-Saudi tactical command center, where relays of high- ranking officers of the two na- tions study instant readouts from airborne radars and decide whether to give the pilots a go- ahead to fire their missiles. General Turki said the Saudi and American planes are under orders not to patrol closer than 20 to 30 miles from Saudi Ara- bia’s borders with Iraq and Ku- wait. And he said Iraq also is re- fraining from flights directly up to the border. An F-15 is armed with target- tracking radar that can find and lock on to an enemy plane to a 40- mile range, U.S. sources have said, The F-15’s role is to sweep he sky clean of MiGs, thus giv- ing a clear shot to the growing lineup of attack planes capable of raining destruction on Iraqi ar- mored columns or even Sad- dam’s command post. None of the elusive F117-A Stealth fighter-bombers is in view at this air base, and the Pen- tagon hasn’t said where they will be based. But the Saudis do have Tor- nados, the potent British attack plane that can land bombs within a 100-foot-radius circle, accord- ing to one Saudi Tornado pilot. The 29-year-old pilot said the Tornado can drop a full load of bombs on a target 1,000 miles distant and still return to base. Baghdad is 700 miles away. If Tornados have to attack Iraqi tank formations, he said, they probably would use Ameri- can-made 1,000-pound cluster bombs, each enabling the pilot to lay down a carpet of destruction 350 feet in diameter. For attacking buried com- mand posts, he said, the Tornado could choose between 1,000- pound high-explosive bombs and British JB-230 penetration bombs, which were designed to destroy an enemy's air base Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 22, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "ostage hot line flooded by calls By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — American hostages in Iraq and Kuwait in- clude auto mechanics, telecom- munications technicians and wives of local men, plus about 1,000 peo- ple whom the State Department has not identified or found. They aren’t all oil jockeys who spend their days drilling deep into desert sands or keeping refineries humming but a cross-section of Americans motivated to live in a very different world by everything from high salaries to love. Now they are pawns in the lat- est international power struggle, held as human shields by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who said he will release them if U.S. troops are pulled out of the region. A lot of people are worried about them. That at least is the impression of those within the State Department task force that deals with friends and families of the 3,000 people President Bush Monday for the first time described as hostages. The task force, which ranges in size from 60 to 90 people who work around the clock answering phones and peering at computer terminals, had received about 20,000 calls by Monday. “There are about 1,000 people that we don’t know about,” a spokeswoman said. “When you go to a foreign country, you’re encour- aged to go to the American Embas- sy and check in and let them know ou’re there. Not everyone does.” It has been virtually non-stop work in a windowless basement office for the task force. “It’s the first time I’ve been out in daylight in the last two weeks,” Mary Ryan, acting assistant secre- tary of state over the task force, said at one briefing last week. “In fact, I’ve been asked to bring back information about the outside | world.” Her staff works from a comput- erized data base that grows as new information is gleaned from the embassies in Kuwait and Iraq or from family members in this coun- try who supply vital personal de- tails. For example, it is important to know which hostages have medical problems, and a task force officer is trying to keep track of them. The spokeswoman refused to detail any medical troubles serious enough to put a hostage at risk but said it is “logical to think there are people with problems” in any group that large. There is little that American companies can do about workers who remain trapped inside Iraq or Kuwait, which was overrun by Iraqi forces in an Aug. 2 invasion. Many U.S. firms, citing security considerations, refuse to talk about how many employees are stranded, who they are, where they were working or on what project. GM, Ford workers held Of the 10 biggest U.S. industrial corporations, General Motors and Ford Motor Co. apparently are the only ones with workers held hos- tage. Many smaller U.S. companies have only a single or handful of employees at their sites in Kuwait or Iraq, depending on local resi- dents or other non-Americans to fill their staffs. So few corporations could sup- ply a long list of workers that would account for a significant por- tion of the American hostages. Pratt & Whitney confirmed this month that it has one Palm Beach County-based employee in Kuwait. “The U.S. Embassy is aware of the individual’s presence in the country and has been in contact with him,” Pratt spokesman Bob Carroll said. ‘‘For security reasons, and the welfare of the individual, we will not comment any further.” In fact, the last list of U.S companies doing business in Ku: wait alone is 13 pages long, ranging from architectural firms to ship- ping companies to Avis Rent-a-Car Systems. May work for foreign firms Many of the 1,000 Americans on whom the State Department has no exact fix may not work for Ameri- can companies at all. Many work for foreign oil companies which operate in Kuwait, said Ghaleb Faidi of the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of Commerce. And some are wives of Iraqi or Kuwaiti men, said Marshall Wiley, a former ambassador in the region who directs the U.S.-Iraq Business Forum. “Td be surprised if they (the Iraqis) would try to take the women out of their homes,” Wiley said. “But they probably will be treated the same as others in Iraq.” Officials at seven of the 10 biggest U.S. industrial corporations said Monday that their firm doesn’t have any employees in Iraq and Kuwait. The firms were Exxon, IBM, General Electric, Mobil, Phil- lip Morris, Chrysler and E.I. du- Pont de Nemours. Texaco Inc. said its 17 employ- ees in the area got out in time, General Motors said it has four in the area, and Ford Motor Company declined “for security reasons” to comment on the status of its em- ployees. General Motors spokesman John Pekarek said his company last talked to its four employees in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, last Thursday. The men, two vehicle service technicians and two engineers, were able to make a telephone call out from their office-apartment complex. They were doing fine last week, said Pekarek, who refused to give their names or even home towns. One is a U.S. citizen, he said, while two are Canadian and one British. ‘A frustrating situation’ The men are helping the Iraqi government build a plant to assem- ble Oldsmobile Cutlass Sierras and Chevrolet S-10 Blazers, but Pe- karek said work was shut down when the U.S. government an- nounced the embargo against com- mercial activity with Iraq. “‘We’ve made calls to the State Department to let them know our people are there and working with- in the framework of what our gov- ernment is doing. Beyond that, like for most people, it’s a rather a frustrating situation.” Ford Motor Co. would not even admit it has employees in either country, but a spokeswoman indi- cated it did with a statement that “for security reasons we are not providing any information in con- nection with the Iraq-Kuwait situa- tion.” Texaco Inc. also among the top ten companies that had combined sales last year of $623 billion and employed almost 2.5 million peo- ple, got 17 American workers and their dependents out of the trouble zone. They had been working on oil exploration and production activi- ties in the neutral zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, very near the Saudi border, when news of Iraq's assault filtered down to them, said spokeswoman Anita Larson. The company arranged for bus- es to carry them out of the area right away. Palm Beach Post August 22, ehh Te \f"

One U.S. government handbook on Saudi Ara- bia said in 1976: “Saudis assume, often explicitly, that men and women are different kinds of creatures, Women are thought to be weaker than men in mind, body and spirit, more sensual, less disci- plined, and in need of protection both from their own impulses and from the excesses of strange men... “The honor of the men of a family, which is easily damaged and nearly irreparable, depends on the conduct of their women, particularly sisters and daughters; consequently, women are ex- pected to be circumspect, modest and decorous and their virtue to be above reproach,” Rhonda’s job is helping to make sure the Saudis are still around to enjoy their honor, Her work ranges from ordering up jet fuel to © 1990 Cox News Service WASHINGTON — The U.S. Marine Corps, bowing to anger and frustration within Congress and its own ranks, has done an about-face on the deployment of women Marines to the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon ordered a 45,000-man Marine Expeditionary Force to join other U.S. forces in Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia last week, It was the largest Marine force assembled since the Vietnam War, but it did not include any women, because Marine Corps officials, un- like their counterparts in the other service branches, barred women from shipping out. “In keeping with Marine Corps policy and op- erational concepts, the initial scheduled assault waves will not include women,” the Marine Corps said in response to initial press inquiries, But in Operation Desert Shield, U.S. forces are Supposed to be performing only a defensive role fill the F-15 tanks to making sure there is oxygen for the pilots’ air-breathing systems, The Penta- gon may not call that a combat job, but the place Where she works is more likely to be targeted by Saddam Hussein than any of the desert foxholes occupied by the all-male infantry units of the 82nd Airborne Division, “It's hot and stuffy over here, but I really be- lieve in helping these people,” Rhonda said. “They've treated us well, and I'd like to help them, too, And we all need gas. It’s the only way we can Stabilize the economy.” Military officials say they don't know how many women are among the roughly 30,000 U.S. troops now inside Saudi Arabia, The Marines, the Army and the Navy Seabees have a few, Marine Corps deploys women to gulf — as Rep. Patricia Schroeder reminded Marine | Corps officials on Tuesday during a private meeting in her Capitol Hill office, The meeting ended with the Marine Corps of- ficers’ assuring the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on military in- stallations and facilities that the women Marines left behind have since rejoined their units in Saudi Arabia, “We have been upset that everybody deployed women except the Marines,” Schroeder said yesterday. “They rolled up the plane and said . women couldn't get on. We had them in here saying they screwed up and they're going to be deployed in the same manner.” The Colorado Democrat added that the fact the other service branches had included women in their initial deployments “angered the women | Marines even more, because it made them look like they weren’t good enough.” But in the Air Force, the proportion of women is higher — perhaps one out of every 20, judging from visits to this base Tuesday and yesterday. Airman Mary is one of them. A 22-year-old woman from Virginia, she is an Air Force radar operator whose specialty is help- ing to run an air war. Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, she scanned screens at Homestead Air Force Base in Florida, “On a regular base back in the states, it is almost 50-50 women,” she said. “For this one, we left a lot of women back, But they had to take the ‘mission-essential women.’ ” Women in the Air Force have become special objects of curiosity here. “Those Saudi guys, they really stare,” Mary said.

Not everyone in the Air Force gets to jockey F-15s. “When they say we are Mobile Tactical, it means we do every- thing. We are the soldiers of the Air Force,” he said. ‘We've been filling so many sandbags it isn’t even funny.’ The 28 hours had been fairly typical of what he's been doing. He started his work day at 3:30 a.m. Tuesday. He and his unit-mates spent the next three hours spreading camou- flage netting over airlifted equipment. Then Tuesday chow, followed by sack time from 9 a.m. until about 2:30 p.m. John and six other American airmen sleep in a classroom of a Saudi girls’ school. It’s tight, only a foot separating the beds, At 3 p.m. Tuesday, when the heat was tailing off toward 110 degrees, John reported for his night shift. “We didn’t have any formation or anything; we just met our truck,” he said. “They took us out to our tech site (on the air base). Then we started filling sandbags.” Even at night it's hot, he said. He drank eight canteens of water during the night. One thing that keeps the airmen going is that they know they get a half hour break every time they finish a pile of 100 sandbags. If they keep going at one sandbag every two minutes, that means they get their break after three hours and twenty minutes. During one of the breaks, they ate their MREs — Meals Ready to Eat ~ out of a brown plastic package. No one had to give John a lecture on why sandbags should be made. “If bul- lets start flying, it’s going to get pretty messy around here,” he said. He's heard about the threat that his base could be peppered with Iraqi mis- siles. “Missiles? Yeah, that’s something we have to face,” he said. “If you sign up, you expect a degree of danger involved,” He said he hasn't done very much since he arrived in Saudi Arabia. But what he has done had made him feel he’s mattered. “This guy (Saddam Hussein) is following the same tactics Hitler did,” he said. “He was expecting nobody was going to do anything, but we surprised him,” Palm Beach Post - August 23, 1990 \f"

The forward-deployed troops of the 82nd Airborne Division took up firing po- sitions on hilly ground overlooking likely attack routes for Iraqi tanks. In 115S-de- gree heat, they spent the day practicing tactics they would use to blunt a tank attack. “This is the first time a force of this size has been put out on the ground,” said Col. Ron Rokosz of Chicago, commander of the 82nd Airborne unit. Asked what the operation is called, Colonel Rokosz replied, ‘' ‘Sweat in the Sun,’ I guess.”’ One goal of the practice is to gauge how well his men adjust to the desert in 24 hours. Another goal is to measure whether his scattered commanders could stay in touch by radio if the desert turned into a battlefield. MANEUVERS IN THE SAND If Iraqi tanks invade, the 82nd Air- borne expects to have time to scramble all its combat vehicles to their fighting stations before the tanks appear on the horizon. Even if no one is shooting at them, Iraqi tanks travel at less than 20 mph. Although the 82nd Airborne wasn’t designed for full-blown tank warfare, its commanders and many of its soldiers said they have enough firepower to stop even the most heavily armored model of Iraqi tank, the Soviet-designed T-72. Some foot soldiers are armed with mobile TOW missiles, which fire potent armor-piercing projectiles that can be steered during flight. Their outer range is said to be two miles, double the range of the heavy guns on the turrets of the T-72s. “This is TOW heaven,” said Sgt. Christopher, 20. (Under military cover- age rules, identities of soldiers below a senior command level cannot be pub- lished for fear that terrorists might try to target their families in the United States.) “If you see the Iraqi tank, you would align the cross hairs on the part of the tank you want to hit,”’ he said. ‘‘And then you shoot and use the sight to steer it to the target. our motto’ “‘One shot, one kill ...’ that’s our motto,” the sergeant said. ‘If you don’t kili on the first shot, he can hit you.” A lieutenant colonel gave journalists a rough idea of how U.S. troops would try to blunt and finally stop an attack by the 1,000 Iraqi tanks said to be poised in Kuwait. “Our plan is that they will get fun- neled between here and the ocean,” he said. ‘“‘That will put them in the best loca- tion. ... Here the terrain is to our ad- vantage.”’ If the Iraqis move south, A-10s, F-16s and other attack planes of the joint U.S.- Saudi command would bomb the tank col- umns. Next the Iraqis would be hit by at- tack helicopters. Even if the 82nd is forced to pull back after an initial battle, other forces behind it are expected to keep hammering the Iragi invasion column as it lumbers toward the enormous Saudi petroleum complex 250 miles south of the Kuwait border. One 31-year-old staff sergeant from St. Louis named Kent expressed what ap- peared to be the common view among the airborne troops. “TI guess most of us would rather go home,” he said. “But if we have to go home through Kuwait, then we will.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 24, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Americans adapting to harsh desert Joseph Albright Cox News Service IN SAUDI ARABIA — “I wish I was home, but I got a job to do,” said Robert, 24, a sergeant of the 82d Airborne Division from Car- rollton, Ga. “The food here is good,” he said. “I've got a decent place to stay, better than I expected. But it’s really, really hot. My last unit trained in the desert in Califor- nia. It was nothing like the heat we have here. Even so, I'm feel- ing fairly good.” From talks with dozens of for- ward-deployed airborne troops, Robert appears to capsule the grunt’s-eye- view of Saudi Ara- bia. The soldiers are startled that it can get so hot. But they are coping remarkably well with the physical and psychological shock of being propelled into one of the world’s loneliest deserts. Some of Robert’s fellow sol- diers have invented a new off- hours game called water poker. Each time they deal the cards, players have to take a slug of wa- ter as an ante. To raise, it’s an- other slug of bottled water. To call, it’s another slug. “It keeps us hydrated and we have some fun,” said PFC Norman, 20, of Spring Harbor, Mich. Robert's job is to go head-to- head with an Iraqi T-72 tank. Crouching behind a tuffet of An American soldier takes time out for a shave in the Saudi Arabian desert. The Department of Defense has shipped a large quantity of supplies to Saudi Arabia to help the troops withstand the harsh desert conditions. sand, Robert scanned the possi- ble lines of fire for his stubby black hand-held tube. The tube, called an AT-4 anti- tank weapon, can stop an ar- mored vehicle at 1,000 yards. He plans to let his tank come in much closer. In test firings at Fort Bragg, N.C., Robert has hit about nine tank-size targets out of 10. If war comes to his slice of desert, he figures he can’t afford even one miss. “I have no choice,” he said. “I either do it or else I am going to die, and I am not going to die.” These are soldiers who grew up in the age of television soaps, where there is action every few seconds and things come to a cli- max inside of one hour. How their morale is going to last if the Iraq crisis stretches into months is a major unknown. But Sgt. Gregg, 24, of Arvada, Colo., said, “I wish they (the Iraqis) would do something. Sit- ting here wasting our time is no good.” His friend PFC Sean, 19, of Valdosta, Ga., agreed. “The hardest part is the waiting,” said Sean, who was sent over here as an ammunition carrier. . When I saw him, he was pound- ing a tent peg into the sand, using his helmet as the hammer. He was among members of the 82d Airborne who rolled out in hun- dreds of trucks on Thursday to participate in the biggest desert warfare exercise the United States has mounted since the be- ginning of the Kuwait-Iraq crisis. Sean and a team of others were throwing up a tent of camouflage netting that would be used to keep mortar shells cool if war broke out. . The 120-degree noontime tem- peratures play tricks with an army that was designed to stop a Soviet army on the plains of Ger- many. For Sean’s squad, one problem is that extreme heat tends to melt the wax in which their mortar shells are packed. “It gets hard to get them out,” said Sgt. Kevin, 20, of Alabama. “You have to dig them out with a bayonet.” “I think a lot of people overes- timated the Iraqi military up against the U.S. military,” said Sean, who was filling in as an as- sistant mortar man. I heard none say they are afraid of taking on Iraqi armor with their light infantry weap- ons. The Daily Sentinel (Grand Junction, Colorado) - August 26, 1990 \f"

N. leader to meet with Iraqi official Dependents of U.S. diplomats leave Baghdad, head for home Power, water cut off at embassy in Kuwait By Andrew Alexander and Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondents WASHINGTON — The threat of imminent hostilities in the Persian Gulf eased Sunday as the United Nations announced that Iraq’s top diplomat will meet with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar this week to dis- cuss the crisis. The U.N. announcement of the meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was made as 52 of 55 American dependents of U.S. diplomats crossed from Iraq into Turkey. Three young males were detained by Iraqi border authorities, the State Depart- ment said. The young men were de- scribed as dependents of diplo- mats at the U.S. Embassy in Ku- wait. They were in the company of a U.S. Embassy escort officer, the State Department spokesman said. ; The dependents escaping Iraq were to spend the night in Turkey before returning to the United States. The freed Americans, the wives and children of U.S. diplo- mats, left Baghdad by car and crossed into Turkey at the Habur border post about 2 a.m. today, State Department officials in Washington said: “> The husbands rémained be- hind in Baghdad because Iraq says the envoys have lost their diplomatic immunity and will be detained as hostages. Iraq last week ordered na- tions to close their embassies in Kuwait, claiming the nation was now part of Iraq. :. The United States reduced its embassy staff by sending about 110 diplomats and their depen- dents to Baghdad. They were stranded there when Iraqi Presi- dent Saddam Hussein reneged ona promise and said they would be detained until the United States closed its embassy in Kuwait. A UN. spokesman said Mr, Perez de Cuellar would meet Thursday with Iraq’s foreign minister in the Jordanian capital of Amman, “It is an open-ended meeting and it has to do with the entire situation,” he said. ‘ The Bush administration said if has no objections to talks be- tween the United Nations and Iraq. “* “We wouldn’t have any prob- lem with that,” national security adviser Brent Scowcroft said in Kennebunkport, Maine, where President Bush continued his va- cation. “The secretary-general has his negotiating framework.” Mr. Scowcroft was referring ito U.N. Security Council resolu- psa demanding that Iraq with- w its occupation forces from Kuwait, restore Kuwait's previ- ous government and release all foreign hostages. ~'\\ Earlier, appearing on ABC's | “This Week With David Brink- ley,” Mr. Scowcroft said Bagh: dad’s willingness to engage in talks indicates that Saddam “is casting about for a way out of the box in which he finds himself.” “He certainly is showing that he is concerned by what is in place against him,” Mr, Scow- croft said, referring to the huge U.S.led military deployment in the Persian Gulf and the global economic embargo against Iraq, Sunday’s announcement of a dialogue represented a shift of tone away from the almost daily diet of inflammatory rhetoric during the first three weeks of the crisis, In other developments Sunday: The United States and other Western nations continued to defy Iraq's order that they shut bargo down their embassies in occu- pied Kuwait, but there were no reports of Iraqi troops entering the missions, Iraq, citing its dec- laration that it has annexed Ku- wait, claims the embassies no longer are needed, John H, Kelly, U.S, assistant secretary of state for Middle East affairs, said Sunday that electricity and water to the U.S, Embassy in Kuwait had been cut off but that Ambassador W. Na- thaniel Howell III and a skeleton staff still were able to communi- cate with Washington, “They're holding fast and do- ing well,” Mr, Kelly said on NBC's “Meet the Press,” He said the. U.S. diplomats probably could hold out for “a matter of weeks,” eThe Soviet Union an- nounced it will not use force in the Persian Gulf, though it voted for the U.N. resolution allowing military enforcement of the em- bargo against Iraq. But Soviet Foreign Minister Edward A. She- vardnadze indicated Sunday that Moscow would not object if the United States and other nations with military vessels in the gulf used force “within the frame: work of that resolution.” The UN. Security Council voted unanimously Saturday to allow the use of military force to en- sure compliance with the em- # (il ministers of the Organi- zation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) assembled in Vienna, Austria, for informal talks on revised production lev- els brought on by the crisis, Sau- di Arabia already has announced plans to increase oil production by up to 2 million barrels a day to help make up roughly half the re- duction of 4 million barrels a day caused by the cutoff of oil from Iraq and occupied Kuwait, The Saudis reportedly want the OPEC ministers formally to ap- prove their increased pro: duction, @Mr, Scowcroft said the United States will grant asylum to Iraqi tanker crews that go along with the U.N. economic sanctions, There have been re- ports that Saddam has threat- ened to shoot any Iraqi tanker captain who lets the U.S. Navy stop and board his ship. @Pope John Paul II, in his first public comment on the cri- sis, condemned Iraq's detention of foreigners and assailed “grave violations of international rights and the U.N, Charter” by Sad- dam.

        "ocr_text": "Ga. troops arrive at Saudi base Fort Benning unit moves tricky ammo By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent AN AIR BASE IN SAUDI ARABIA — The first unit of fighters from Fort Benning, Ga., piled out of a C-5 transport plane at dawn Sunday, with Sgt. 1st Class Joanna Bennett leading six young men into one of the most hazardous jobs in the gulf region. They are from the 608th Ord- nance Company, soldiers who spend their days hauling pointed cylinders of explosives that get blasted out the snouts of tanks. They also are the people who know what a box of hand gre- nades is supposed to smell like and how to push through a requi- sition for laser-guided mu- nitions. Sergeant Bennett is the top non-commissioned officer in’ charge of inspecting ammunition to see if it is going to blow up in some soldier’s face. She directs six lower-ranking male ammuni- tion inspectors. They are part of the ordnance company, whose size cannot be disclosed under military news coverage rules. “That’s my job,” she said. “It doesn’t make me nervous. I am not afraid of ammunition.” On Friday, she said goodbye in Columbus to her husband, Ed- die, a supervisor for a janitorial service, and children, ages 3, 8 and 10. Thirty-six hours later, a C-5 had flown her and her fellow sol- diers halfway around the world, and she was watching the sun come up over Saudi Arabia. “My husband was worried Atlanta Journal- Constitution August 27, 1990 Sgt. Jonn Hilton of Augusta, Ga., waves his M-16 rifle and an American flag Sunday at Dhahran Airport in Saudi because I was going,” she said, “and mad because he didn’t get to go. “My oldest daughter was up- set because I just came back from Korea. My husband said she cried all the way home. She just told me, ‘Get on the plane, give those people the ammuni- tion and come home.’ With the 8- year-old and the 3-year-old, there was not much reaction that you could see.” The younger soldiers of the 608th Ordnance spent the early morning playing volleyball, us- ing a yellow ball that somehow materialized in the middle of the busy runways. These soldiers came to pass the ammunition, and they were ready to get on with it now. “It’s hard waiting,” said Spec. Wiley Trueblood, 21, of Minneapolis. “We are unsure what’s going to be going on.” But the soldiers who had been around awhile said this was the smoothest war they’ve ever been in — if indeed it is a war. Chief Warrant Officer Clyde Bell, 38, of Culbertson, Neb., said, “I loved the support we got when the plane stopped in Mas- sachusetts and in Spain. The Red Cross was out with cots. I couldn’t believe it. “This deployment was better- prepared than when I went into Vietnam,” he said. “I was a ' young little old 18-year-old when I went into Vietnam. The biggest difference between then and now, that’s the support of the American people. It’s total sup- port; you couldn’t ask for a better sendoff.”” He added with a grin, “We are the first ones from Fort Benning to hit the ground. A col- onel told us so.” That would mean they beat out another Fort Benning unit, which got a military ceremony when it left the base for Saudi Arabia days ago. But members of the 608th said that unit got put “on hold” at a stateside air base, allowing the 608th to claim the honor of arriving here first. A 608th company cook, Staff Sgt. Clifford Groce, 30, of Rus- sellville, Ala., said their depar- ture “‘was so quick that nobody had a chance to give us a farewell ceremony.” “I had been at work since 4:30 in the morning on Friday. We got the word at 12:30 p.m. to be in a formation at 1 p.m.,” he said. “They told us we would be mov- ing out at 2.” Asked how he felt, Staff Ser- geant Groce said, “I think a whole lot of people walk around nervous. We don’t know if we are The Associated Pres Arabia. Sergeant Hilton, a member of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized), arrived Sunday from Fort Stewart. going to be in a shooting situa- tion. We hope we do what we came for without having to do some fighting. But if we do, we are ready.” Warrant Officer Bell said the company is here to carry out an ammunition-passer’s motto: “If they need it, we got it. If you need it and they got it, they are going to send it.” Sergeant Bennett said she ex- pects to have problems with the desert heat. One thing she’s encountered already: The wax that seals her blasting caps will melt under the daily 115-degree sun broiler. That makes them trickier than usual. “We'll just have to put some sand on top of them to insu- late them or something,” she said. Asked whether conditions in Saudi Arabia could make for ac- cidents with ammunition, she re- plied, “It has never been put in such a hot situation, so I don’t know exactly how it is going to react.” She, like others in the 608th, would be just as happy if they go home with all their ammunition boxes still intact. “That would be real nice,” she said. “Just like a nice camp- ing trip and go home.” \f"

        "ocr_text": "Only Arabs can get Iraq out of Kuwait, Jordanian prince says By Marcia Kunstel Joural-Constitution correspondent AMMAN, Jordan— A united Arab ef: fort to end the gulf crisis must rest on pressuring Iraqi President Saddam Hus- sein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait, Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan said Monday. “The Arab solution obviously is to se- cure a withdrawal, there is no doubt about this, of Iraqi troops from Kuwait,” said Prince Hassan, brother of King Hussein and effectively the deputy head of state in Jordan, In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Prince Hassan outlined a possible way to resolve the crisis, which Jordanian leaders fear could ignite a war devastating the entire region. The call for total withdrawal is a big change in Jordan, which has been among the closest to Iraq and the least critical of Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion and annex- ation of Kuwait. “The regional issue has to be resolved regionally between the Arab countries themselves impressing upon the Iraqis: ‘This is the way itis,’ Annexation Is totally unacceptable.” Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan King Hussein arrived Monday in Tu- nisia on the second stop of a tour through four Arab nations and several European countries, He likely is posing the ideas as an Arab initiative that could be present: ed to Iraq. Jordan steadily has been pushing for a resolution by Arab nations without Western or other outside interference, and the crown prince repeated that view Monday. “The regional issue has to be re- solved regionally between the Arab countries themselves impressing upon the Iraqis: ‘This is the way it is.’ A final negotiated settlement has to be achieved over the Kuwait issue, ... Annexation is totally unacceptable,” he said, Prince Hassan said that if Iraqi troops withdrew, they would be replaced by an international Arab peacekeeping force similar to those deployed in the past to maintain calm until a final settle- ment could be reached. He cited a 1961 force in which Jorda- nian troops participated after Iraqi ag- gression in a border dispute among Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. He said the goal is not a joint Arab force “confronting an Iraqi military ma- chine,” as international troops headed by the United States are doing, but a force to act as a United Nations peace- keeping buffer. Prince Hassan indicated that King Hussein's current visits should be seen as being integrated with U.N. efforts, not as an attempt to circumvent the U.N. process. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is to meet Thursday in Amman with Iragi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. Prince Hassan said an Iraqi with- drawal probably would have to come with a non-aggression agreement, The United States has demanded an unconditional withdrawal and would not be expected to give Saddam any assur- ances until his troops were out of Kuwait and American hostages there and in Iraq were safe. Americans would expect Saddam to retreat to the internationally recognized border between Kuwait and Iraq, but the location of that border is disputed, and the debate helped fuel the Iraqi assault.

        "ocr_text": "THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION By Marcia Kunstel and Andrew Alexander Jourmnal-Constitution correspondents AMMAN, Jordan — Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said Tuesday that foreign women and children held hostage in his country are free to leave begin- ning today. The surprise announcement came hours after Saddam was shown on Iragi television talking with a group of foreign hostage families. It was similar to his televised appearance with a group of British hostages last week. The Iraqi News Agency, in a report monitored in Amman, said Saddam issued a decree that “all women and children who are foreigners in Iraq are allowed to move freely in Iraq or to travel whenever they want starting to- morrow, including the families Iraq is hosting.” About 500 Americans are be- ing held in Iraq. It was not clear whether Saddam’s order applied to the estimated 2,500 Americans in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2 and declared annexed. They are among about 12,000 Westerners trapped in Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Millions of oth- er foreign workers there also are unable to leave. Iraq does not consider them hostages. The announcement was seen as an effort to temper adverse in- ternational reaction to Iraq’s statement earlier in the day that Kuwait would become its 19th province. In other Tuesday: @ Forty-seven dependents of U.S. diplomats who left Kuwait by bus for Baghdad on Thursday arrived at Andrews Air Force Base -outside Washington on Tuesday, ending their harrowing journey. The dependents — 27 women and 20 children — were led from the chartered jet by Marjorie Howell, wife of the U.S. ambassador, who stayed in Kuwait. developments Copyright © 1990 The Atlanta Const to releas For 122 Years the South’s Standard Newspaper @ Iraq said an American civil- ian died of an apparent heart at- tack in the southern city of Basra near the Persian Gulf. A State Department official said Iraq had offered to let U.S. officials participate in an autopsy to verl- fy the cause of death. The 56-year-old man, who was not identified, was believed to be one of 63 who had been re- located to strategic military and industrial sites around Iraq to deter a U.S.-led attack. @Shipping sources said U.S. warships have stopped at least two cargo ships in the Gulf of Aqaba in recent days and that U.S. Navy crewmen boarded one of them to make sure all were complying with United Nations sanctions approved Aug. 6 for- bidding goods from flowing into or out of Iraq. It was believed to be the first time a ship was boarded since the sanctions took effect. The embargo appears to be working. Lloyd's Casualty Re- porting Service, a British firm that monitors shipping, reported that Jordan’s Port of Aqaba — which used to be a major ship- ment point for goods flowing to and from Iraq — “is almost emp- ty, and all trucking business and truck fleets [3,000 to 3,500 trucks) are idle.” @OPEC oil ministers, meet- sated Sopnetel tora baente it tative a to a to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates increase production to help offset losses caused by the Persian Gulf cri- sis. Only 10 of the 13 ministers were present. They decided to WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 29, 1990 delay formal action in order to hear from two absent members, Iraq and Libya. The video of Saddam with foreign hostages was edited. It was not clear when it had been shot. In it, he told the hostages he was sorry they felt restricted but that their presence was essential to prevent a U.S.-led attack. In the broadcast, Saddam of- fered to debate President Bush and British Prime Minister Mar- garet Thatcher. “I am prepared now, really prepared, for direct talks, dia- logue with Mr. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher,” he said. “Let us have the debate between me and them on television for the whole world to see.” The suggestion for a debate produced a sharp response from the State Department, where spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said, “It’s sick, and it doesn’t even deserve a response.” The pending release of a large segment of Saddam's hos- tage population seemed aimed at non-Arab governments that are irate over Iraq's detention of their citizens and appear pre- pared to go to war at any provo- cation. But the tightening of Iraq's hold on Kuwait seemed to be a tlement of the crisis with a plan featuring Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the removal of all troops, including Ameri- can, the region.

        "ocr_text": "Kuwatitis thank hosts but still miss home By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Paim Beach Post Washington Bureau KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia — Nearly a month after they were forced into the world’s cushiest exile, an estimated 90,000 Kuwaitis are finding that lavish Saudi hospi- tality is no substitute for home. Sipping sweet tea for hours in the marble lobbies of luxury hotels, the men grumble about Iraqi sol- diers and talk of where to send their children to school next week. The women in their black veils chat in partitioned-off salons, while their children use the hotel corri- dors as playgrounds. “Everything is free, but we want our home,”’ said Fahad al Ajemi, an exiled official of the former Kuwait national airline. ‘“‘Next month, school starts. We don’t know what to do for my son. For us, it is difficult living in a hotel. We are used to living in a big house in Kuwait.” Their hatred boils against Sad- dam Hussein’s soldiers and against the Palestinian residents of Kuwait they accuse of helping Hussein con- quer their country. One 32-year old Kuwaiti named Mohammed, a former Kuwait gov- ernment employee, was so mad at all Palestinians that he has come to believe the Israelis aren’t so bad after all. *“‘We thank God Israel came to Palestine, because the Palestinians are not good people,’”’ Mohammed said. ‘““‘We gave them good jobs and a good life and look what they did. They worked with the Iraqi army.” By Kuwaiti standards, there has been an enormous exodus of exiles. Just in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, about one of every 10 Kuwaitis in the world is staying free in Saudi hotels, schools and clubs. The population of Kuwaiti citizens amounted to about 500,000 before the invasion. “‘We thank God we are here in Saudi Arabia,’’ Ajemi said. The Saudi royal governor, Prince Mohammed, has decreed that all Kuwaitis are to be treated as guests of the Saudi government and of his father, King hd. The Saudi royal family is doing more than observe the ancient de- sert custom of extending hospital- ity to anyone slipping beneath their tent flaps. They also are repaying an old debt to the al-Sabah family. Between 1890 and 1902, the al- Sabah’'s gave refuge in Kuwait to King Fahd’s father, King Ibn Saud, who had just lost out in a tribal struggle. Ibn Saud spent more than a decade in exile as guest of the family that ruled what came to be called Kuwait, from about 1890 until he organized an expedition to capture the capital Riyadh in 1903. That conquest made him the king and made Saudi Arabia a country. The Eastern Province govern- ment is rushing to outfit a giant housing complex that was built during the 1970s oil boom and nev- er occupied. Other never-used Sau- di housing projects in Riyadh and Jidda are also being readied to help spread the Kuwaitis around this country. The complex is made up of about 20 apartment towers 17 sto- ries tall. Now, the complex is being refitted to hold up to 30,000 Ku-. waitis. In one rush purchase, the pro- vincial government ordered 10,000 1.5-ton air conditioners from Zamil Air Conditioning, a Saudi air condi- tioner factory. A contractor said all 10,000 are installed and that the apartments will be ready as soon. “The government has spent a lot of millions to make them com- fortable,’’ said an aide to Prince Mohammed. ‘‘We treat them like Saudis because we are one family.” Palm Beach Post - August 30, 1990 \f"

They were initiated by their side,” “You could describe it as a feeler, but not much more,” said the official, who insisted on anonymity, “We're at a listening stage.” He declined to elaborate, In the Jordanian capital of Amman, a source close to King Hussein said that Iraq plans to propose that Kuwait be given a limited autonomy as part of a “confederation plan” that would allow the tiny emirate a number of seats in Iraq’s national cabinet. It is expected that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq may raise the when he meets today in Amman oe Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Such a plan for limited autonomy would fall short of demands by the U.N. Security Council, as well as Presi- dent Bush, that Iraq withdraw all forces from Kuwait and reinstate the former government. Popadiuk refused to confirm or deny a report in News- day that Iraq had secretly offered a deal under which it would withdraw from Kuwait and release thousands of Western hostages. In return, the New York newspaper reported, Baghdad insisted that U.N. economic sanctions be lifted, that it be given former Kuwaiti territory that would provide it with access to the Persian Gulf, and that it be given sole control of a key Kuwaiti oil field. The official Iragi News Agency denied Wednesday that Baghdad had advanced any offers for settling the crisis. Meanwhile, the United States on Wednesday awaited details from Iraq on when and how American and other Western women and children would be permitted to leave Iraq and occupied Kuwait. The announcement that they could leave was made Tuesday in Baghdad by President Saddam Hussein. Al-Mashat told reporters the Americans would be al- lowed to leave through Jordan or Turkey, but he gave no timetable for their departure. “It is not possible administratively that everybody go on the same day,” al-Mastat said. He said he did not know whether the Iraqi government would provide aircraft to facilitate the departures, Cable News Network quoted unidentified Iraqi officials as saying an Iraqi Airways plane filled with Westerners will leave Baghdad for Amman today. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said US. diplomats in Baghdad had been officially informed that Iraq was preparing “new guidelines” that would allow the women and children to leave. “They will require all the parties to obtain exit per- mits,” she said. “We have been asked to provide the Iraqi aor with the names of all those who might desire to leave.” Even if exit visas are granted, Baghdad’s main airport is already jammed with non- Westerners who are waiting to get on fully booked flights to destinations around the ~ As a result, the United States is pressing Iraq to a charir flights into Baghdad to pick yf West- erners. The other option is for them to exit overland through ighboring Jordan or Turkey. ’ ne he thousands of Wester women and children are about 1,000 Americans, Tutwiler said, “We do not have a breakdown of (American) women and children in Iraq,” she said. “In Kuwait, we have ap- proximately 500 women, about 25 of whom are pregnant, 360 children, ages three to 18; (and) 60 infants ... under the age of three.” As rumors of diplomatic ry and hostage releases swirled around Weuegen and the Middle East Wednes- day, the Pentagon announced that the White House has approved a $2.2 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia. The sale involves: or 24 F-15 fighter jets equipped with Sidewinder and Sparrow oe — 150 M- tanks. 8 200 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 50 shoulder-held Stinger launchers. Such arms sales normally must be approved by Con- gress, but Bush used his presidential authority to waive that requirement. . Bush delivered a pep talk to U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, but his remarks over Armed Forces Radio were heard by only a few of them. That is because the radio network does not have a transmitter in Saudi Arabia, so the speech was heard by only those troops with access to powerful radio receiver. “We have never sought conflict nor do we hope to chart a course for other nations, but at the hands of injustice in the face of aggression, ours is a once reluctant fist now clutched resolutely,” he told them. “It is your presence, your skills, your talents, your judg- ment that bring America’s principles to life and give them strength and meaning,” Bush said. In other developments Wednesday: W Two television networks, NBC and CNN, said U.S. agencies, particularly Army Special Forces troops and the CIA, were helping the Kuwaiti resistance in hit-and-run attacks on Iraqi occupiers. No U.S. troops were said to be involved, but Kuwaiti fighters based on the Saudi-Kuwait border were reported to be getting intelligence, weapons, radios, advice and instruction from the United States. WThe White House, under pressure from Congress, said it was seeking help from allies to defray the expense of deploying tens of thousands of U.S. combat forces to the Persian Gulf. The cost is estimated at $2.5 billion through September. Spokane Review - August 30, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Americans in Kuwait grow desperate By Marcia Kunstel Joumal-Constitution correspondent KUWAIT CITY — At least 2,000 Americans hiding from Iraqi forces in Kuwait City have had no notice that women and children are free to leave, and officials at the cordoned American Embassy appealed Friday for a mede- vac plane, fresh water and fuel to run said, standing next to the ambas- sador on one side of the turnstile leading into the embassy while the Rev. Jackson stood on the outside of it. “We are conducting an inter- view behind bars,” said Ms. Ba- dine, in her 40s, the No. 2 official at the embassy. Underscoring that imprison- ment were the Iraqi security agents who crowded around the Rev. Jackson in the narrow em- bassy entryway. Four men car- ried AK-47 assault rifles, while another Iraqi who.had been guid- ing the Rev. Jackson around the city had a 9mm automatic pistol in his hip pocket. Iraqi President Saddam Hus- sein gave all countries until Aug. 24 to shut down their embassies in Kuwait.

She said there is no electricity and no working water line, which means no air condi- tioning or plumbing and no way to pre- serve fresh food. “The water situation is going to get bad,” Ms. Badine said food in the embas- sy is rotting and there is little to drink except limited water and some canned nied the Rev.

You know the president asked me to stay, and one thing that worries me a great deal is that we’re unable to con- tact them and have access so they get the consular protection recognized by international ‘law.” Ms. Badine said bad phone lines make it impossible to keep up with the status of 2,000 Amer- icans sprinkled throughout Ku- wait, 1,400 of whom she estimat- ed are women and children. Many American women have married Kuwaiti men, she said. “Some parts of the city we can’t reach at all,” she said.

They are interned. For that rea- son, they don’t want to come out of their apartments.” She said that all the Ameri- cans she knows were in hiding have been picked up and taken to Iraq. In an emotional farewell that ended the first face-to-face out- side contact the ambassador and his deputy had in a week, a visit that at times left participants with tearful eyes, the Rev.

They joined nearly 600 other former Western hostages, many of them woman and children, who were finally able to leave Iraq. The short relief flight from Kuwait to cans told harrowing tales of ; nessman from St. Louis, said he had ‘ been holed up in the U.S. Embassy ' for about two weeks. Earlier, he had » hidden in the basement of the hotel ‘ where he was lodged out of fear the ‘ Iraqis would arrest him.

THE HEAT had driven the 40 ‘ people trapped in the embassy to ‘ sleeping beside the pool. '  **People were jumping in the pool - every hour,’’ Johnson said.

They boiled it boiled over fires they fueled by breaking up desks, chairs and a playground set. ‘In another two months every- thing in the embassy will be burned down,’’ Johnson said. Johnson and several other Ameri- - cans spoke to were interviewed ina minibus that took them the embassy to Kuwait’s International Airport. That facility has been virtually s Baghdad — the first leg of a long journey home — followed a personal appeal by the Rev. Jesse Jackson to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during their talk earlier in the day. All in all, Iraq let 574 foreign hostages leave the country, including 264 Westerners whose release was secured by Jackson in his talks with Saddam. Several plane loads of Westerners in- cluded about 150 Americans. One group departed Saddam Hussein International down for commercial traffic since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion. The 20-minute trip was inter- rupted for several anxious moments when Iraqi soldiers at a military checkpoint stopped the convoy of vehicles when they said they saw a cameraman photographing the ap- proach to the airport. . THE EXITING Americans tensed and groaned when an Iraqi official appeared at the door of the stopped van and demanded to know why they were filming film. The television news cameramen insisted they had not taken anv shots of the sensitive area. After several moments otf hostile exchanges, they surrendered their video tape to the Iraqi official. The official then made the camer- aman put the videotape back in the camera so he could take it out again with an Iraqi soldier as a witness. In another interview, an Ameri- can from Cincinnati, Ohio, said he preferred to remain unnamed out of fear his two U.S. business as- sociates he had left behind would re trouble if they could be identi- He related how compassionate local residents had extended them- selves to hide and support him and other Americans. This man was among the group leaving because he is an insulin-dependent diabetic. THE MAN said he and his two companions found refuge on the day of the Iraqi invasion, with a Leba- nese businessman whom they had only met in recent days. The Leba- nese man arranged to pick them up at their hotel and take them to stay at his apartment. But at one point they waited nervously in the car on the side of the road with tanks gz past them while their Leb- Airport in an Iraqi Air 747 jumbo jet at 12:30 a.m. Sunday Iraqi time. That flight was to land in Amman, Jordan; Paris and London, before finally arriving in Washing- ton on Sunday afternoon.

Jackson — in Iraq briefly as a television reporter to interview Saddam — arranged anese associate retrieved a can of gas. ’ Once there, the Lebanese brought in cases of food and water and found a large of quantity of insulin, syr- inges and medicinal alcohol so the diabetic American would not suffer insulin shock while he was in hiding. Insulin must be ingested at strict regular intervals. The American related an incident in which the Lebanese hid the three Americans in closets when Iraqi soldiers came to search his apart- ment. He made up a story that sent the soldiers away, then quickly took the Americans out to the apartment of a friend where they remained for a day and a half, out of fear the soldiers might return. THE DIABETIC American said his biggest problem was figuring out to get to the airport without being detected and apprehended by Iraqi soldiers who have roadblocks and checkpoints throughout the city. American Embassy officials were unable to help him leave because they too are virtual prisoners. The Iraqi government has threatened to hang anyone found aiding West- erners trapped in this captured city. ‘I phoned somebody I never met before, another Lebanese. He said he would meet me out by the road and take me to the airport. He knew me by my suitcase color and I knew — him by his car,”’ he said. Although the American and the Lebanese driver were stopped at three check- points, the soldiers never discerned that he was an American. ‘“‘The Lebanese joked with them and I just sat there and smiled,”’’ he said. .

But before he departed, he left the hidden Ameri- cans well provided with stocks of food and water. : Nine in the group that had been holed up in the embassy had made an emotional denature, after wait- ing through a day of uncertainty as Jackson negotiated their release from a hotel across the street. Two men had been taken away earlier to have hospital tests to learn if they really were sick enough to leave with the medical evac- uation. They were. Odessa and Bob Higgins had been brought from a different hospital, where she was recovering from a broken hip. Mrs. Higgins, a member of the diplomatic staff, had been injured in an auto accident that occurred as a convoy of embassy workers was driving out of Kuwait to Baghdad. The majority of the embassy employees departed before the Iraqi deadline for closing all embassies in Kuwait, leaving only a skeleton staff and the Ameri- cans from the community who had sought sanctuary there. Mrs. Higgins was carried onto the plane on a stretcher. DEPARTURE was especially hard on women and children who left theiy husbands and fathers crying. “This is terrible,’’ said Barbara Longsworth, 38, who was leaving with her daughter, Jasmine, 6. ‘‘I wish I could stop this, all of it, right this minute.”” Her husband, a petroleum engi- neer, was left behind in their home in Kuwait, where they had lived for 10 years. She had come to the embassy to stay about two weeks ago because of a health problem for which she had been unable to find any medicine. Mrs. Longsworth said she had spoken to her husband early in her stay at the embassy, but that the telephone lines were not working well and she had been unable to contact him for more than a week. \f"

        "ocr_text": "A city that stopped: Kuwait's capital like a ghost town Soldier-filled streets devoid of usual bustle By Marcia Kunstel Joumal-Constitution correspondent KUWAIT CITY — The bat- tered, ghostly streets of this oc- cupied capital seem to hold few signs of life beyond soldiers wielding AK-47s. : Kuwait City looks like a dead metropolis in the care of some perplexed guardian uncertain of how to treat the corpse. For instance, Friday, the Muslim holy day, is always quiet in an Islamic city. But most Is- lamic cities are not littered with crashed, cannibalized or burned- out cars. Their major roadways are not barricaded or spotted with military checkpoints. Their stores and hotels are not virtual- ly all closed and tightly shut- tered. Their streets are not bare of shoppers, workers and casual strollers in most parts of town — not like they are in Kuwait. A day trip into and around the capital now occupied by Iraq was a Visit to a city that stopped. It was made possible when the Ira- qi government granted permis- sion for a visit by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is doing a news segment on the Persian Gulf cri- sis for the syndicated TV show “Inside Edition.” Accompanied by two Ameri- can journalists and one Italian, along with a force of heavily armed Iraqi escorts, the Ameri- can civil rights activist was al- lowed to roam almost freely around the city. A few clusters of civilians were seen. There were foreign workers standing by the side of the road near the airport with possessions crammed into bags and suit- cases, heading for a plane to Baghdad (there are no flights to anywhere else), and then to their native countries. Another group of the same had collected at what appeared to be an impromptu bus termi- nus, a place along the street in town where buses were parked, but no bus station was in sight. The third center was a mosque, not heavily populated for the day’s main noon prayers, but having drawn a respectable crowd, The only major hotel remain- ing open is the Kuwait Interna- tional, a gleaming, 400-room high-rise such as one would ex- pect to find in an oil-rich Persian Gulf emirate. On Friday it had only 170 guests, but general manager Hermann Simon said business always is slow in August, when people vacation in cooler climes. All 170 guests, however, are members of Iraqi official delega- tions brought to Kuwait to figure out how to revive the city. Despite the international em- bargo against commercial trade with Iraq and occupied Kuwait, Mr. Simon said he has experi- enced no food shortages. “We had stock for six months here,” he said. “We were smelling it coming.” Even had he not sensed the coming invasion and increased his supplies, Mr. Simon probably would have little trouble getting whatever he needs to feed and care for official Iraqi delega- tions, At lunch, however, his ho- tel was out of all soft drinks and mineral water. Some things even Baghdad can’t supply. Residents gave mixed re- sponses about the availability of goods. At the mosque, three men were interviewed while Iraq’s new chief of protocol, who wears a 9mm automatic pistol on his hip, hovered nearby. All said there are no serious problems with food, although one young ‘Sudanese said money is in short supply because almost no one is working. “] think the situation will be- come better,” said Ahmad Abd- ullah, a Palestinian auditor who has been out of work almost a month, “There is not too much shortage of food. You have to stand in line maybe one-half hour.” One resident who asked not to be identified said part of the problem is the Kuwaiti resis- tance, which has threatened to harm people who go to work or open their stores. That is why several major construction pro- jects mostly sit idle, skeletal frames no further fleshed out than they were Aug, 2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Owners of burned-out ware- houses and stores, which are scattered here and there about the city, have not begun any repairs, A few posters of the ousted Kuwaiti leader, Sheik Jaber Ah- med Sabah, were displayed on fences, and explosions that sounded like gunfire cracked the air three times. Reports of Iraqi soldiers being killed on night- time patrols have come from for- eign workers, But most of the hundreds of soldiers deployed throughout the city seemed relaxed in the 110- degree afternoon, clutching their water bottles and AK-47s as they sat all day at sandbagged bun- kers along the ‘beachfront, manned checkpoints or patrolled the actionless downtown shop- ping section.

It’s a Saudi airstrip the Ma- rines have taken over to fly heli- copters that support the forward- . most U.S. combat force in Saudi _ Arabia. , There are big yellow “arriv- al” and “departure” signs, but no sign giving the airport a name. One clue to why it could be a hellish place to fight is the willy- nilly mix of helicopters parked ' nose to tail rotor for hundreds of yards in all directions. There are not only half a doz- en models of Marine helicopters, but helicopters of the U.S. Army, the Saudi Arabian air force and the air force of the exiled emir of Kuwait. The dozen Kuwaiti helicop- ters, which escaped across the border during the first hours of the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2, have been awaiting instructions since before the Marine and Army helicopters arrived in the last 10 . days.

When Marine Staff Sgt. Eddie | tay be concerned and buy some Hughes, 27, of Forsyth, Ga., planted his boots on Saudi Arabi- an sand two weeks ago, his great- est fear was lack of water. Like many of the estimated | 60,000 other U.S. soldiers who | have dropped out of the sky into | the driest nation on Earth, Ser- | geant Hughes couldn’t figure out | how anyone could possibly keep | ' nel Carr began relying on a com- him from getting dehydrated. It was an apt worry. For if the | American military buildup has had an Achilles heel, it has been : the millions of gallons of water : needed for troops spread out: over hundreds of square miles of | sand. If Murphy’s Law applied, | thirst seemed inevitable, at least ' for those such as Sergeant Hughes, stuck farthest out in the desert. But the last month has given the troops a savory surprise: Not only has there been abundant water for everyone, but Saudi water tends to taste far better than the water the troops drank in the United States. “To us, this is champagne,” a Marine said last week as he sipped from a 1.5 liter plastic bottle of chilled, desalinated Sau- di Arabian well water. Behind the heady success sto- ry is a tale of Saudi entrepre- neurship, royal generosity and 22-hour days by an Army staffer nicknamed “Cinc-Water.” Cinc-Water’s superior, Maj. Gen. William Pagonis, the Army’s logistics chief in Saudi Arabia, said the Saudi govern- ment is providing, free, more than half the water being con- sumed by the troops. The rest is being desalinated by the Marines or purchased on the open market by Cinc-Water — Lt. Col. John “Every week we tell the Saudi government what we are going to need,”’ General Pagonis said. “I ' build in a safety factor. I watch the supplies very carefully in our warehouses. When the supply goes below a certain margin, we in the marketplace.” For all the importance of | planning and computers, Gener- ' al Pagonis and Lieutenant Colo- nel Carr have had to improvise, using pencil calculations and what they can remember, the general said. Only last week, after the most critical weeks of the buildup were finished, Lieutenant Colo- puter instead of his scratch pad. “The bottom line,’’ said Gen- eral Pagonis, “is that water is a vital asset to life, and we are do- ing everything in our power to ensure that bottled water and pu- rified water is available to our soldiers in whatever quantity they need.” Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the world with no riv- ers. It has hardly any rainfall. Oddly enough, few other countries in the world have Saudi Arabia's enormous spare capaci- ty for producing drinking water. Ever since the explosion of oil prices in 1973, the Saudis have been sinking millions into devel- oping the world’s most advanced desalinization plants and tapping its abundant supplies of deep ar- tesian water. Every year, 1 million Muslim pilgrims trek to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, from around the world. For a month, Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd arranges to provide each pilgrim with free drinking water in plastic bags. The infrastructure for sup- plying water to the monthlong pilgrimage consists of a dozen or so privately owned water-bot- tling companies dotted around the kingdom. For most of the year, they op- erate at slack capacity, building up their inventories for the hajj, as the pilgrim season is called. This year the hajj ended several months ago, and the water bot- tlers were only too happy to get the business for the American troops. One of the major private bot- tlers, Health Water Bottling Co. of Riyadh, is.owned by relatives of Suleiman Oleyan, a Saudi cap- italist who went from being a $75S-a-week truck driver for the Arabian American Oil Co. in the 1940s to a billionaire in the 1970s. The company pumps water from deep wells south of Riyadh, the capital. When the water emerges from the ground, it is too salty. So the company uses advanced ion-exchange equip- ment to remove the salts to the specifications of the Ministry of Health. One section of the factory turns out the plastic bottles for the water. The plastic. comes from petrochemical stocks man- ufactured at a big new industrial complex at Jubail, about 130 miles south of the Kuwaiti border. ; “Just our company alone is supplying about 100,000 cases of water a week to the American soldiers,” a company official said. ‘‘We have had to cut back our shipments to the southern part of the country and to some towns in the northwest. We also have some extra water because we used to sell water to Kuwait.” Each case of water contains 12 bottles, or enough to keep one soldier going for three days — provided he doesn’t do much heavy work in the hottest part of the day. If he exerts himself at midday, one case will last two days or less. The wholesale price for a case of water is about 10 riyals ($2.66), but guests who buy wa- ter by the bottle in a hotel often pay 6 riyals ($1.60) per bottle. The bottling company official said he has had to increase the price of water by 1 riyal a case because he has to pay drivers overtime to keep his company’s eight water trucks shuttling be- tween the bottling plant and U.S. military water warehouses sev- eral hundred miles away. Troops in Saudi Arabia get water from three sources: = Saudi privately owned bot- tling companies. It is the bottled water that troops find most re- freshing because it tastes like a mountain spring. The govern- ment pays for some of it, the mili- tary buys the rest. = Saudi government desalini- zation plants. A network of huge plants supplies thousands of Ma- rines and a lesser number of Army troops through water taps at their rear area base camps. This desalinated water is what most Saudi citizens draw out of their water taps at home. It tastes about like tap water in any Amer- ican city — bland, slightly chlori- nated, but otherwise all right. =Portable seawater desali- nating plants that the Marines are operating at a port where they unload their tanks and other heavy equipment. Known as re- verse osmosis water purifying units, these machines drone on 24 hours a day, turning out drink- ing water that most servicemen don’t want to drink if they can help it. That water has a rubbery, salty aftertaste. Marine opera- tors say this faint tang in the wa- ter is absorbed from the device’s huge inflatable bladders through which the seawater must pass as the salt is being chemically ex- tracted. To kill the rubber taste, Marines turn it into what tastes like grape juice Kool-Aid by add- ing a package of purple powder that they get in their packaged meals. And what of Sergeant Hughes, stationed at one of the northernmost Marine outposts? The morning I found him, the thermometer read 112 degrees in the shade by 11 a.m. When I held the thermometer facing the sun at the level of my waist, the mer- cury pushed up to 120 degrees. Sergeant Hughes’s buddies told me that if I wanted to see how hot it really was at Fox Com- pany’s outpost, I should lay the thermometer on the desert floor. I did. One minutes later, the juice in the thermometer rose off the top of the scale — 134 de- grees. If I had brought along an oven thermometer, I might have been able to take a true reading. ; Sergeant Hughes wasn’t grip- ng. Water was a major factor in Ce ene his unflagging mo- rale.

        "ocr_text": "Feeling pinch, Iraq orders food controls By Marcia Kunstel - Joumal-Constitution correspondent BAGHDAD, Iraq — A system of “rationalizing consumption” ‘went into effect in Iraq on Sun- day to deal with dwindling food supplies brought about by a worldwide embargo. “It is not rationing. It is ra- tionalizing consumption,” Infor- ‘mation Director Najil Hadithi told U.S. journalists. . “If you need one kilo [2.2 pounds] of rice for your family you can get two, but you cannot get ten,” the government's chief ‘spokesman said. *- The controls were ordered Saturday, Mr. Hadithi said, and ‘are being administered by the ‘ruling Baath Socialist Party’s branches in every neighborhood. ‘ Baghdad residents stood in one bread line at a bakery for at ‘least two hours Saturday. Anoth- ‘er long line stretched outside a ‘government market Sunday {morning. ‘The spokesman said bread ‘lines might appear because ‘“bakers give customers exactly ‘what they need,” rather than the larger quantities they formerly were able to buy. That means people must purchase bread more often. Responding to questions about the effect of the interna- tional embargo against Iraq, Mr. Hadithi said his country is not experiencing shortages of vege- tables and fruits because the government “took dozens of measures” to get farmers to boost production during the pun- ishing eight-year war with Iran. Iraq now is self-sufficient in fresh foods, he said. “Food is available and we are determined to live on our local production,” he said. ‘‘We have a war-tested society and a war- tested economy. So even if we eat mud we shall resist and we shall not kneel down to any power.”’ Mr. Hadithi said the rate of self-sufficiency in producing rice and wheat also has in- creased. But a U.S. government report completed in July on Iraq's agricultural capacity said imports averaged 82 percent of all grain consumed in Iraq in the years 1987-89. The report said the American decision to end $2 billion in cred- it guarantees for Iraqi agricul- tural purchases as of this year would compound Iraq’s prob- lems, eliminating virtually all American agricultural exports to the country. The mandatory U.N. embargo means Iraq is having difficulty finding replacement suppliers. Wheat also is used in Iraq in place of corn as feed for animals, including chickens. Iraq has a flourishing chicken industry, but has had to import 88 percent of its corn in recent years, the re- port said. That means existing grain stocks would have to stretch to feed both people and animals, unless Iraq finds a clandestine source from which to purchase grain. Unconfirmed reports out of Beirut, Lebanon, last week said some grain was being di- verted and smuggled into Iraq. Both Mr. Hadithi and the gov- ernment report said this year has been fruitful for farmers, with plentiful rain in contrast to drought-like conditions that cut deeply into output last year. Mr. Hadithi and Latif Jasim, the minister of information and culture, said Iragis are deter- mined to resist the embargo. “We can live on simple things. We can live on bread and water, no more than that,” Mr. Jasim said, “because the dignity is more important than the food.” Mr. Jasim also stressed that Iraq needs time to work out a so- lution to the crisis, as well as as- surances that American troops stationed in Saudi Arabia will not attack. He left the door open to the round of Arab diplomacy begun last week. It has been led by Jor- dan’s King Hussein in an effort to resolve the U.S.-Iraq standoff without bloodshed. “The pressure being exer- cised on Iraq is not healthy. In a short time, four resolutions were passed by the United Nations and they want us to implement them,” he said.

        "ocr_text": "When trigger fingers twitch By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent SOMEWHERE IN SAUDI ARABIA — One month into the fastest, costliest mili- tary buildup in American history, it looks like the United States has the forces in place to grind down any conceivable Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia. But the United States and its Arab part- ners are at least two weeks short of being ready to strike to overthrow Iraqi Presi- dent Saddam Hussein. So they are talking softly until the stick gets bigger. That is what the commander of U.S. forces, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, was doing when he said last week, “There's not going to be any war unless the Iraqis attack.” Soon thereafter, Saudi Arabia’s defense minister, Prince Sultan, took the same soft line when he announced that his country would not be the “stage” for an offensive to recapture Kuwait or free the foreign hostages. But the time is fast approaching when President Bush and Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd can — and probably will — institute a more aggressive strategy. Insiders in Saudi Arabia privately sug- gest that by late September, U.S. and Saudi pilots likely will be patrolling at the edge of Iraqi airspace, daring Iraqi pilots to fire the first shot. Their current “rules of en- gagement” keep them 20 miles back from the border. Another likely development would place the U.S. battleship Wisconsin within firing range of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Behind the diplomatic curtain, Mr. Bush and King Fahd seem to agree that there is only one real solution: Saddam Hussein and his inner circle will have to go. If anything, the Saudis are more insistent than the Americans in saying privately that the crisis won't end until someone gets rid of Saddam. But not quite yet. The pace of the buildup has astonished everyone in the Middle East. ‘This is a lo- gistics miracle,” Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) noted the other day. But the buildup is not finished. The first 60,000 or so American troops are here and ready for anything. Thou- = more pour out onto the runway every ay. The Air Force has essentially all the men and women and fighting machines it ever wanted. “The work has slowed down somewhat,” said Air Force Master Sgt. John Nash of St. Louis, who arrived nearly amonth ago with the first unit of F-15 fight- ers. “Everything we wanted is pretty much in place.” The Navy and Marines also are nearing full strength. The most significant recent arrival was the Wisconsin, which has been hovering in the Gulf of Oman, only one day's steaming distance from the Kuwaiti coast. The Wis- consin, with its 16-inch guns, the largest naval guns in the world, offers American commanders a weapon capable of blasting eae through the thickest wall of Iraqi As Marine Lt. Gen. Walt Boomer told visiting U.S. lawmakers last week, “If the flow continues, we will be at full combat power in two weeks.” So far, the worst gap in the allied com- manders’ planning is a lack of precise intel- ligence about Saddam's whereabouts. “We don’t know where he is and we don't know the conversations between him and his top advisers,” an official in Saudi Arabia ac- knowledged, . Saddam has retained the loyalty of 50,000 presidential guards, military come mander's and senior bureaucrats who con- stitute Iraq's privileged elite. But it is ' widely believed that most of the world’s : key intelligence agencies are working to change that. The other big gap has been the deficien- cy of fast ships to carry tanks and other ar- mored equipment from the United States. That — along with spotty mail service to the United States — is the main problem the visiting lawmakers, including Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), said Sunday that they will report to the armed services com- mittees of Congress, if conflict had broken out a week ago, the shortage of ships would have forced the Americans to fight a tank war with only a fraction of their heavy armor in place. In the last day or two, more armor has arrived by ship, but a shortage of tanks and ar- mored troop carriers persists, The 24th Infantry Division (Mecha- nized) of Fort Stewart, Ga., has had to delay its push into the desert because support ships were slower arriving than expected. Also behind schedule are the tank com- panies of the 197th Infantry Brigade from Fort Benning, Ga, Members of the 197th walked down the ramps at a Saudi air base Sunday. But soldiers of the brigade said they think it will be days before they can hook up with their M-1 Abrams tanks. One sign of increasing confidence is that the Saudis have invited journalists to visit their enormous — and highly vulnera- ble — Ras Tanura oil terminal, 150 miles south of the Kuwaiti border, For the first month of the crisis, the Saudi military re- fused to let journalists anywhere near any oil facility or desalination plant, out of fear | that they would transmit information the Iraqis might find useful, For the moment, the crisis is likely to en- ter a less nerve-jangling phase, The fear of chemical weapons has diminished, The prospect of Iraqi tanks lunging forward to capture the oil fields seems past. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 3, 1990 Even defending against missile attacks seems less troublesome now that American reconnaissance satellites and other techni- cal intelligence have honed in on the launch sites, The “real-time” reconnaissance images reportedly are good enough to spot any movement by Iraqi missile crews, “A fly can’t walk on one of those sites without us knowing it,” bragged one Saudi officer, Among influential Saudis, the pre- ferred solution is for Saddam to be over: thrown or assassinated by his own people. A coup would cause the fewest casualties and the least political threat to the oil-rich Saudi monarchy. “The best scenario as far as I am con- cerned is a coup d’etat in Iraq,” said Abdul lah Debagh, secretary-general of the Saudi Chamber of Commerce. “That would defi- nitely solve a great deal of the problem. ... There must be some rational people in Iraq, people who are looking around and saying, ‘My God, we are isolated. And all this state-of-the-art firepower surrounding us. We have no chance.’” One thing is certain: Even if the decision goes toward war, there will never bea pub- lic declaration to that effect. As Prince Sul- tan made clear in his news conference, the Saudis do not want to launch the first strike, Nevertheless, as a well-informed source in Saudi Arabia put it, provocations can be created if needed, “We create them every day,” the source said, “We create them 20 times a day when we lock on our radars onto their planes. If we wanted, we could shoot one of his planes and say it was on our side of the border, How would anyone know where it was?” The source, who insisted on anonymity, went on to say, “At the end of the day, Sad- dam Hussein has got to go, and his regime has got to be destroyed. There is no ques- tion that that is the final objective.” \f"

This is the oil port where the Saudis gath- er their black treasure to be processed and exported. Here in silvery steel tanks that look ; like jumbo mushrooms can be stored up to 50 million barrels of oil. The Ras Tanura tank farm alone could supply 92 percent of the c::- tire oil import requirements of the non-Com- munist world for one day. Unless it is bombed. That catastrophic contingency is some- thing that Mohammed Yones, who works for the Arabian American Oil Co., has consid- ered every day since Iraq invaded Kuwait. “Of course, these products are volatile,” Mr. Yones, the Aramco supervisor in charge of loading supertankers, said in a pierside in- terview Monday. “And our big concern is fire and explosion. But we have a lot of safety measures.” What if a war came and Ras Tanura was attacked? “Well, if the place is bombed ... of course, all these products are volatile, catch fire, and explosions will occur,” he said. If that happened, somebody would press the button labeled “Disaster Alarm.” Then the hundreds of men on duty at Ras Tanura would sprint for the massive concrete blast shelters and try to ride out the detonation. “We haven't seen any resignations since this crisis started,” said Mr. Yones, who like most of Aramco’s production employees is a Saudi citizen. “We are all committed to work, and stay here as long as a drop of oil can be shipped. wm, ‘For years, Ras Tanura has been off-limits to visiting journalists.

        "ocr_text": "28 more Americans evacuated from Iraq By Marcia Kunstel Joumal-Constitution correspondent BAGHDAD, Iraq — Nearly 300 Westerners, including 28 Americans, were evacuated Tuesday from Iraq in what diplo- mats hoped would be an opening for a broad exodus of former hostages. The arrangement of charter- ing Iraqi Airways jets to ferry el- igible Westerhave from Baghdad to Amman, Jordan, seemed to have set an evacuation pattern acceptable to Iraqi and Western governments. The plane containing the 28 Americans, most with family ties in Iraq, also carried British, French, Irish and Canadian citi- zens when it finally departed at - 11:30 p.m. Its 125 passengers were delayed 412 hours after me- chanical trouble required a change of aircraft. “I have to assume it was a technical problem and no ill will,” a Western diplomat said. A German-chartered Iraqi plane full of ex-hostages left ear- lier Tuesday, and three others were expected to go in the next two days. Meanwhile, fissures began appearing in the Western stand against closing embassies in Ira- qi-occupied Kuwait. The Norwe- gian governnient announced it probably would shut down its peed there Thursday, and the uropean Community scheduled West- eaguered dip- adigensson on. Europe's Foreigners exiting Iraq and Kuwait The parting for Americans in Baghdad was bittersweet. Iraqi relatives left behind wept under the weltering sun at the U.S. Em- bassy compound as they repeat- edly kissed and hugged their de- parting kin beside a bus waiting on the narrow street. “My father is an old man now. It’s hard for him to take care of the rest of the family,” said Amer Shaae, a 33-year-old refrigera- tion mechanic from San Diego. A naturalized American citizen, Mr. Shaae said he was leaving out of fear he would be detained with other American men who have become a “human shield” at military and energy-related installations. “I think maybe they will lock me in here,” Mr. Shaae said. Iragi-Americans have not been taken hostage and are free to leave the country. Tears were shed, not just at the embassy, but also at the Bab- ylon Terminal of Saddam Hus- sein International Airport, where Western wives and chil- dren finally had to separate from men who are being required by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to stay. The flight Tuesday carried out what was believed to be the last batch of Americans in Bagh- dad who were eligible and wished to depart. “We've got most everybody who is urgently desirous of leav- ~. a diplomat at the airport The other Iraqi Airways flight, chartered by West Germa- ny, carried 14 Irish passengers and 128 Germans, 98 of whom had been brought by bus from Kuwait on Monday. A German air force plane was to pick them up in Amman. Another bus convoy, this one with seven buses and an automo- bile, left Kuwait for Baghdad filled with about 300 Britons. The passengers faced a 15-hour drive through the barren, dry and mer- cilessly hot southeast Iraq. British officials were hoping to have exit visas for the group processed quickly and to put the travelers on a flight to Amman by Thursday. : Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 5, 1990 \f"

The man’s next of kin were being kept up to date on efforts to confirm or refute the report, said a spokesman for the department’s consular task force. Uncertainty arose over some of the wording in Saddam’s bitter complaints that Iraqi children could die due to lack of imported food and medicine. The U.N. sanctions allow only exceptions to the international ban on trade with Iraq only for “humanitar- ian” reasons. A simultaneous translation into English by a CNN translator during the televised reading quoted the Iraqi leader as saying, “The children of Iraq are dying because they’re being deprived of. their milk and their food and their medicine.” An official of the private Fed- eral News Service, which distrib- uted the text of CNN’s translation to many news organizations, said an Arabic-speaking member of its staff monitored the transla- tion in Washington and de- scribed it as “superior.” The Associated Press, howev- er, reported that the official Ara- bic text of the statement distrib- ‘uted later by the Iraqi news -agency did not contain that avete | versions agreed that at a eto point Saddam _ com- plained that others were trying to “starve a nation to death’ and that it was historically unprece- dented that “children should die because of a premeditated deci- sion to deprive them of milk.” White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater dismissed Sad- dam’s statement as a “rhetorical diatribe designed to split Arab unity” and as “a sign of despera- tion that Iraq is lashing out with hypocrisy and irrelevant statements.” Mr. Fitzwater said there is no evidence of children dying from the trade embargo. Shoppers ob- served by U.S. reporters in nee | recent per pave Meanwhile, President Bush told a congressional delegation that if international sanctions don’t reverse Iraqi aggression, the United States will consider other options. Speaking with lawmakers re- turning from a visit with U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Bush vowed to “keep pressure on Iraq and convince Saddam Hussein that time is against him,” Mr. Fitzwater said. The embargo against Iraq “must succeed,” said Mr. Bush, according to Mr. Fitzwater. “If not, we will review our options.” The lawmakers gave him broad support for his actions in the Per- sian Gulf crisis. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said during testimony before the Senate Foreign Rela- tions Committee that the strategy _ of weakening Saddam’s position . through an economic choke hold _ is “going to take some time.” “And that is what we ask most “ of the American people,” he con- tinued. “Stand firm, be patient and remain united so that togeth- er we can show that aggression does not pay.” At the State Department's consular task force, which is keeping track of Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, a spokesman requesting anonym- ity said, “We do have a report of an American citizen being shot and wounded while trying to avoid ore in Kuwait City.

More than 11,000 Western men also are trapped, and many have been moved to key Iraqi military and industrial sites to be used as human shields to deter attacks. @ East European government officials and Western diplomats said Warsaw Pact countries have agreed in principle to sell gas masks and other decontamina- tion equipment to protect civil- ians in Saudi Arabia in the event of an Iraqi chemical-weapons at- tack. The Western diplomats said they did not know whether the Soviet Union had agreed to sell the equipment for Saudi Arabia or whether it played any role in helping to arrange the deal being worked out with the East Euro- pean countries. @British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady met in London and an- nounced that Britain had pledged an unspecified amount of money to help nations suffer- ing as a result of U.N. trade sanctions. @The Associated Press re- ported that, according to senior Bush administration aides, the United States wants its allies to pay the entire cost, either in cash or contributions of materiel, of the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf. The aides said the administration estimated those costs as $6 billion to the end of the year and $1 billion a month after that, plus $10.5 billion a year for nearby countries hurt by the trade embargo and an un- sum for developing countries battered by oil price increases. In his vitriolic statement Wednesday, Saddam labeled Saudi King Fahd and Mr. Mubar- ak traitors to the Arab cause be- cause they have joined the U.S.- led multinational force in the, region. He also said Israel is to blame for persuading the United States to take action against Iraq for the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. American troops in Saudi Arabia seemed to be at an unoffi- cially heightened level of alert due to a theory that Saddam likes to launch attacks under a full moon. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Potent air strike could save lives, officer says By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau SAUDI ARABIA — A top U.S. air com- mander said Thursday the United States has sufficient air power in Saudi Arabia to knock out Iraqi coastal defenses in Kuwait and make possible a successful Marine assault with minimum casualties. “I am capable from the air wing side of fully supporting an amphibious operation,” Marine Maj. Gen. Royal Moore Jr. said. Moore said if Washington ordered, the Marines could destroy Iraq’s Air Force with- in 36 hours and then punch through the Iraqi tanks massed in Kuwait. Moore, the first senior commander to discuss the prospect of U.S. forces moving onto the offensive, said: “We're going to pick a spot that is, at best, not armed at all, if we possibly can. If it is, then Marine air, naval gunfire, artillery, will go in and soften it up. And we can either envelop it via the helicopter, (go) around it or over it, or we can come in with the amphibi- ous landing.” Asked how the war would go for an Iraqi tank commander waiting in Kuwait, Moore replied, “If he wants to catch a 500-pounder, or a thousand-pounder, be my guest.” The general’s remarks seemed to be part of an American attempt to create psycholog- ical pressure on President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and his senior commanders to surren- der without putting the world through the trauma of a war that would kill thousands. Saudi sources have said Saudi Arabia might permit an attack from Saudi soil if it appeared that Iraqi planes had committed some kind of “provocation” first. Moore said an assault would likely be launched by specialized U.S. planes that jam enemy radars and launch beam-following missiles that are designed to blast radars and anti-aircraft defenses within the first min- utes of the war. “We want about three to five minutes, and we're going to give him the most violent three to five minutes they’ve ever seen,” ee mn THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Alongside a Soviet freighter, U.S. Ma- rines check equipment at a Saudi port. Moore said. ‘“‘That’s all we want.” By crippling Iraqi air defenses and ra- dars, the United States could begin to neu- tralize the heavy coastal defenses Iraq has set up in occupied Kuwait, he said. He disclosed that for the last week, war- planes of the Air Force, Marines and Navy have been operating a 24-hour-a-day aerial “cap” in the sky about 100 miles off the Kuwait coast. The spot is so full of electronic emissions from Kuwait, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia that pilots have begun calling it ‘the junkyard,” he said. The Marines’ top air commander warned that air power could never win a war against Iraq alone. In the end, he said, eee and tank drivers would have to finish the battle. “I’m not going to ever predict that it’s going to be a cakewalk,” he said. “If we do it right, the casualties will be light, we hope, and we’ll be there.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 7, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "General describes how Marines would liberate Kuwait One of the senior American air commanders in the Persian Gulf, Marine Maj. Gen. Royal N, Moore Jr., gave the first public preview Thursday of what would happen if President Bush ordered an amphibious assault to end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. The following is a partial transcript of his remarks, as recorded on an airfield in Saudi Ara- bia by Joseph Albright of The Atlanta Journal: Constitution. General Moore, who has piloted fighters, helicopters and reconnaissance planes, now commands the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing in Saudi Arabia, A Marine air wing normally has about 450 planes, General Moore's wing is based in El Toro, Calif. 0: What would a unit of this size do in support of an amphibious invasion over defended territo- ry, a defended harbor? As ‘he country (Kuwait) and the AO [area of operations] are so small that it'll be very, very easy for me to cover with fixed-wing assets any amphibious landing that we desire to make, 0) So you could support one now? k: Tam capable from the air wing side of sup- porting, fully supporting, an amphibious oper- ation, 0) What would it look lke as it started to un- fold? What would happen before the Marines got to the beach? Me We wou have, of course, the same old prep that we've had before. We're going to pick a spot that is, at best, not armed at all, if we possibly can. If it is, then Marine air, naval gunfire, artil- lery will go in and soften it up, And we can either envelop it via the helicopter, [go] around it or over it, or we can come in with the amphibious landing. 0: Do you have the capability of removing tanks that are dug in along the seashore? h Both the two weapons systems that you see right here, both the AV-8 and the F-18 along with the F-16.... are very, very accurate. [NOTE: He referred to the AV-8B Harrier, a Marine plane, and the FA-18 Hornet, a Marine fighter attack plane, as well as the Air Force’s F-16 fighter, 0: How accurate? h: Let’s put it this way: The worst bomb I had on my second hop would have taken all of us out. I can put it easily inside of 30 feet. 0: What would it mean for the guys in a tank? h: If he wants to catch a 500-pounder, or a thousand-pounder, be my guest. 0: Are you sending a message to Saddam? As {truly believe that i he had intention... of coming south past the Kuwaiti border, that he’s missed his opportunity. There is just too much firepower in-country right now for him to even think something like that now. . .. I’m not saying at all that (air power is) going to win it. In my world, I truly believe that it takes the Marine on the ground to doit. Aircan’t doeverything, .. It’s the tank-on-tank that probably cleans it all up. 0: You expect to lose a lot of people? h: I don’t think so, ... We have an awful lot of sophisticated missile systems like Harm and Shrike that go after (radar-guided) individual weapons systems, If he chooses to leave them on, that’s great, because we take out his set. If he chooses to turn it off or go into dummy load, that's great, too, because he’s given us exactly what we want. We want about three to five minites, and we're going to.give him the most violent three to five minutes they've ever seen, That’s all we want. We don’t want to stay over the target for hours and hours, 0: Do you have enough to take back Kuwait now? k: ] am not going to comment on that, I think without question, others have answered this, and you can look around at the level of forces, As they start to close, day by day, you see the ships arriv- ing with M-1 tanks and everything, Without ques- tion, if the force level continues, there will be a period in time that we have enough combat power on the ground to do that, if the president wanted to do that along with the Saudi Arabians and the oth- er Arab nations that are now involved in it. 0) What is your assessment of how the Iraqis fight? h Let me give you an assessment from the air. The Iran-Iraq War from the air was almost one of comic relief. They flew against one another, and in some venues they would fly through one anoth er, Take shots at great ranges. I think it was more of a stage show than it actually was a good war’ There were some good engagements. There was an Iraqi pilot who got two good shots on two F-4s and took them down. The Iraqis, the area that worries me is the leaker. The one guy who gets caught out there after a strike group that is com: ing home, or the one guy who gets caught behind an airliner and who can get through, that’s what their modus operandi was. They would tank one guy, send him on down, Never a combined, coor: dinated evolution, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 7, 1990 \f"

To satisfy Islamic custom, ‘men form one line and Baghdad’s mix of ‘women, some clothed in western dresses ‘or skirts and the traditionalists in sweep- ‘ing black abayas, form another. The international embargo against Iraq, a punishment for invading and an- ‘nexing Kuwait last month, is being felt. ' But the embargo is not seriously dis- ,abling, and the Iraqi people seem to have reserves of spirit as vast as the stores of oil belonging to Iraq now that it has reassert- ed dominion over its old property, Kuwait. ‘People have gone through eight years of war, so we’re used to this,” said Kamal ‘Why are the American soldiers here?” asked an aeronautical engineer. “They are the problem, not we.” Like most Iraqis who agree to speak even briefly with journalists, he asked not to be identified by name. Most do not want to talk at all, in this city with a vast security network crossing neighborhoods. Support for Hussein, whether he de- cides to fight a traditional enemy in Iran or to snatch the oil-rich fields of Kuwait, is based partly on his distribution of what oil wealth has not gone into war-making. Construction of modern hospitals has enhanced Iraq’s medical reputation. Two major universities, separate law schools, colleges of education and arts have risen in every sector of the city.

Right now his profits are especially low, because this is high season for the fruits and vegetables piled in brightly colored pyramids at open-fronted stands — deep purple eggplants, tomatoes, onions and ungainly green watermelons spilling out to the sidewalks. The vegetables will become fewer, but the conventional wisdom will remain: that Iraqis are used to scrimping and suffering when necessary, and are ready to do it again.

The streets of the predominantly military Zayouna section of Baghdad are lined with well-built, attractive and large serie, larger than what most Iraqis can afford. When dissatisfaction has been voiced within the ranks, students of Iraq society say, it has been ruthlessly, permanently silenced: Support for both Hussein and the mili- tary is built into Baghdad’s environment. Billboards, posters, five-story high paintings, statues and photographs of Sad- dam are everywhere. He appears in mili- tary garb, traditional headdress, wearing a businessman’s suit, in judicial robes in front of a courthouse and in a cap and gown on the grounds of a university. Streets and plazas and even a city are named for him. before peace came in 1988, a Western diplomat said. “The people are used to it.” And that is the “certain strength” upon which President Saddam Hussein is rely- ing as he squarely confronts a disapprov- ing world. Such strength militates against one aim of the embargo, which is to create a dissatisfied population that will rise up against Hussein, an iron-willed ruler whose cult of personality permeates this sprawling city. Unless there is significant leakage in the embargo, its effect is bound to increase in the coming months, particularly as Iraq’s industry and utilities run short of spare parts. But so far, there is little sign of discon- tent. The Iraqi people seem to believe that Kuwait is their due and that American and other foreign troops have no business squatting in Saudi Arabia.

        "ocr_text": "Huge field of ‘superlight’ oil discovered in Saudi desert ‘MORE LIKE GASOLINE THAN OIL’ By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — While wildcatting in an untested part of the kingdom, the Saudi Arabian government-owned oil company has discovered vast de- posits of a rare, superlight oil that could be used in a car engine without being refined. As it gushes out of the desert, this new oil has the color of gaso- line and the consistency of water, company Officials say. “You could probably put it straight into your car and run it — it’s more like gasoline than crude oil,” Henry Crook, the drilling manager of Arabian American Oil Co. (Aramco), said in the company’s internal news- letter. Other Aramco officials said the oil will be refined before it is sent to market. But it will be far cheaper and cleaner to refine than any other oil discovered anywhere in the world, they said. In its public statements, the company has not assessed the significance of the 1989 discov- ery in the previously unexplored Central Province. But test wells show that the field almost cer- tainly is the largest accumulation of oil discovered anywhere dur- ing the last 20 years. “We think it may be the big- gest field in the world,” one Sau- di official said Friday.. Copies of the internal compa- ny newsletter, The Arabian Sun, show that Aramco has found vir- tually the same grade of super- light oil in five widely scattered wildcat wells in a _ 120-mile swatch of badlands and desert south of the capital, Riyadh. Before the Persian Gulf cri- sis, Aramco was drilling ‘‘delin- eation wells” to see whether it had discovered one historic ‘‘su- pergiant”’ oil pool or a series of smaller “giant” fields. So far, company announcements have spoken of each well as a separate field. Even so, the new oil territory may well be large enough to pro- duce one-fourth of America’s present oil imports for half a cen- tury or longer. That would guar- antee Saudi Arabia’s role as a primary source of energy for the world until the 22nd century. For the moment, the discov- ery doesn’t change the correla- tion of forces in the gulf crisis. But it would appear to increase Saudi Arabia’s strategic impor- tance over the long run. There have been no authori- tative estimates of how much oil the new find will yield. But based on the prolific nature of the wells found so far and their widely scattered locations, it appears that Saudi Arabia may have dis- covered the equivalent of anoth- - New Saudi wells =~ Es =- ea Abha = Dilam #1: Discovered Oct. 22,1989; 4,500 barrels/day _ Raghib #1- Discovered Jan 1; 3.650 barrels/day plus gas ayyim #1- Discovered Apr. 8; 2,800 barrels/day plus gas Hilwah #1- Discovered May 1; gas only ‘Haz Miyah #1- Discovered June 11; 4,300 barrels plus gas_ er Texas — and perhaps more. The new oil was found 150 miles west of the Saudi oil fields that were discovered in the 1930s and 1940s. The first gusher — testing at 8,000 barrels a day — came in on June 5, 1989, near a town south of Riyadh called Hawtah. Four months later, Aramco drillers hit a second gusher 60 miles away that tested at 4,300 barrels a day. Since then, they have hit three more prolific oil wells and one gas well. Only a week before Iraq’s in- vasion of Kuwait, an issue of the Aramco newsletter said the pro- spective drilling area covers 1,440 square miles. The most pleasant surprise was that all the new oil from the five wildcat wells was of roughly the same superlight consistency, which exists in only a few places in the world. Using the widely ac- cepted measure of oil’s lightness devised by the American Petro- leum Institute, the “gravity” of oil from the five wells varies from 42 to 49 degrees. The Arabian Sun _ reported Oct. 2 that the oil is higher in quality than ‘“‘any crude oil trad- ing in significant volume on the world market. Much of the world’s oil, in- cluding the bulk of existing Saudi production, contains consider- able quantities of hydrogen sul-. fide gas, which has to be re- moved at great cost before the oil can be refined or exported. The Hawtah oil contains almost no sulfur or other impurities. Because of its consistency, oil companies are sure to bid its price up several dollars a barrel over the current ‘‘benchmark”’ prices for light crude oils. Refin- ers will be able to squeeze more gasoline out of a barrel of super- light, spurring the price in- crease. longer to build above-ground fa cilities and pipelines. For decades, Aramco geolo gists have suspected there migh be oil in the kingdom’s unex plored Central Province. Their suspicions grew in 1985 when z Saudi farmer living not far f Hawtah found an oily taste in his well water. In 1987, the Saudi govern ment directed Aramco to under take an exploration program millions of acres of desert that the early Aramco explorers hac never drilled.

        "ocr_text": "Tnirad police state, few dare to defy iro iron heel of Saddam Hussein BY Marcia Kunstel Jotimal- Constitution correspondent -tBAGHDAD — There was an aéf of courage by an Iraqi here lat week. Ol Tt came at the close of a small . démonstration in front of the ‘S. Embassy, where a group of fewer than 200 lawyers chanted solidarity with Iragi President Saddam Hussein. The protest was stage-man- aged perfectly, materializing at the embassy compound just as the daily 10 a.m. briefing for-U. s. journalists broke up. Men and women, many in the black robes of advocates, gave unswerving support to Saddam’s violent annexation of Kuwait. They deflected questions about international law being shredded under tank treads. One lawyer, however, shook his head as he listened to a col- league answer questions in full agreement with the govern- ment’s policy line. He declined to answer a reporter’s queries himself. But when the protest was fin- ished and the sweating lawyers shed their robes as they walked to their sunbaked cars, this man strode back toward the com- bgune and found the journalist. “I*want you to know that not all Iraqis agree with all this,” he said. : His eyes locked onto the jour- nalist’s for a moment, and both realized he had taken an exceed- ingly dangerous step. In Iraq, people can be executed for criti- cizing Saddam. People’s fear of speaking crit- ically, combined with the fear that Iraqi authorities try to instill in Pad journalists, gives the outside world an understanding of Iraqi society that at best dips only shallowly into its surface. It is a controlled place, and ip is iron. Surveillance and placed on reporters now, time of crisis, naturally are re intense than during peace- ‘days. But surveillance and ts long have been compan- ms on a visit to Iraq. o\" These days, journalists arriv- ing at Saddam Hussein Interna- tional Airport are not permitted to leave until an escort from the Ministry of Information comes for them, In some cases the wait has exceeded three hours. .

TV crews and photojournal- ists have found it essential to have a guide everywhere they go, or face being detained by police. All television footage must be viewed by a censor before being transmitted, and offensive seg- ments often are sliced. What qualifies as offensive is unpredictable. One network had taped interviews with Western women allowed to leave Iraq but noted that many were depressed and tearful at leaving friends or husbands behind. — en ec said the Atlanta Journal-Constitution thout cameras nave tobe ta more iatitede to travel the city and try to figure out what's going on. But the reluctance of Iraqis to talk is another effective curb on probing too deeply. An encounter with an educat- ed, English-speaking Iraqi showed the depth of fear. This man, a government worker, spent half a day with several journalists. At one point he chatted freely and candidly about conditions of the moment. He in no way criticized the gov- ernment, but he did reveal some- thing about deteriorating condi- tions because of sanctions against Iraq. An hour after this unexpected fe-and-take, the man found a moment to take aside one of journalists. He begged that Footer not write what he oi or publish anything that ht identify him. By the time nished, he was weeping. The man-on-the-street inter- view, a staple of Western jour- nalism ingountries whe are happy to spout opinions, is useless in Baghdad. Store own-. ers tense up when reporters ask questions, and people standing in increasingly long bread lines usually refuse to talk. Three American reporters discovered why. They were talking with a shopkeeper about life in Iraq, and he volunteered that two of his sons were in the army serving in Kuwait. Immediately a man ap- proached and demanded to know why the journalists were asking sensitive military questions. He appeared to be the neighborhood extension of either the Baath Party or one of six security ser- vices in the country. The police were called, and the journalists were hauled away and held for several hours before a U.S. Embassy representative intervened. Iraqis sometimes fear being seen with a journalist, even in the most innocuous places. A jour- nalist visiting a public museum with a new Iraqi acquaintance suddenly found the acquaintance _ pushing her into a sheltering al- cove. She saw two soldiers pass- ing down the hallway. The ac- quaintance smiled and said nothing. The most chilling events tran- spired the morning that Ameri- can journalists were called into the Information Ministry to be briefed by high officials. Naji Hadithi, general director of information, had finished his briefing and was taking the group up to talk with the minister of information. Waiting for an elevator, a Wall Street Journal reporter asked Mr. Hadithi if reporters were permitted to travel out of town, for example, to Babylon. “To follow the line of Bazoft? You are free,” Mr. Hadithi said with a smile, Farzad Bazoft was an Irani- an-born journalist working for < British newspaper who was ac- cused of spying earlier this yee He was convicted March 8 and hanged March 15. - September 9, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Is this dot deadly? Sky-watchers keep a vigil over Saudi Arabia By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution comespondent ABOVE SAUDI ARABIA — “Six O'Clock Charlie” showed up late on the airborne radar screens Sunday. But at 7:26 a.m. the air sur- veillance officer of the U.S. Air Force AWACS plane jumped. He saw a telltale yellow dot move south in Iraq. “At last, we’ve got a high-speed track,” said Capt. oat Lomheim, 31, of Littleton, 0. As the single Iraqi warplane hurtled south, its pilot must have gone to afterburners. The plane was moving toward Captain Lomheim at 1,500 mph, or so the IBM 370 mainframe in the belly of the AWACS told him. “About 50 miles to the fron- tier,” Captain Lomheim said about a minute later. “It’s at 33,000 feet.” Here aboard America’s flying war room, it seemed for a few moments that the summit meet- ing would be overtaken by war. If the yellow dot kept going south and crossed the purple latitude line denoting the start of Saudi airspace, the first missile shot of war might be only a few minutes away. When Captain Lomheim first called out the hostile “track” on the surveillance intercom, the Air Force captain serving as Po- sition 7 weapons officer picked up the cue. He radioed to the four American F-15 fighters some- where between here and the Ira- qi border. Two of the F-15s were out of position, flying east toward some slow-moving radar blip in occu- pied Kuwait. But the other two F- 15s were available to protect the AWACS as it exercised its re- sponsibility to “manage” the cru- cial first half-hour of the war. Under orders from the AWACS officer, the F-15 pilots flew U- turns and began flying north in the direction of the oncoming Iraqi. At 36 miles from the Saudi border, the Iraqi pilot veered up and flew parallel to the border. Then he dived and headed back toward Baghdad. “T guess that’s our excitement for the day,” Captain Lomheim said. ; Not so, it turned out. Twenty minutes later, three more V-shaped yellow blips ap- peared on the sector of the scope representing southern Iraq. The crew queried the onboard com- puter and judged that they were three Iraqi fighters flying about 700 mph across Iraq's border with Kuwait. The three fighters seemed to hesitate and fly into an orbit over Kuwait. “This one is getting brave,” said Maj. Jeff Moore, 34, of New Boston, Ohio, the AWACS mis- sion crew commander. “He has started to come down.” But the fighter turned back north again after venturing to within 59 miles of Saudi To the elite radarmen who staff the gray, windowless Boe- ing 707 with a mushroom-shaped radar dome, this was just another 15-hour milk run: monotonous but not wasted. - “I would classify the activity as medium to low in comparison to other missions,” said AWACS wing commander Col. Tom Bliss, 46, of Aliquippa, Pa., who joined the 32-member crew aloft. “It wasn’t the slowest, but it wasn’t anything dramatic. It was a fairly routine mission.” Probably the major anomaly is that the Air Force let four civil- ian visitors fly along to observe air activity across the Saudi bor- der into Iraq.

Norman Schwarzkopf in case war begins, One percent of the job is in- stant adrenalin. The other 99 . percent takes a sustained prob- lem-solving concentration that can get crushingly monotonous. “It’s a tiresome job to watch empty skies,” Major Moore said. ' . The work is hard on the eyes and even harder on the ears. Capt. Scott Wright, 29, of Bal- timore said, “At any time you can have six different people speak- ing into your earphone at the same time. You have to teach yourself to prioritize what you hear.” Master Sgt. Michael Rose, 43, the chief of the surveillance tech- nicians, said, “It probably takes you to a limit you’ve never been to before. But it doesn’t take long to get what we call tunnel view. Pretty soon, you can lose your concentration and something will be going right across your screen. There is also a human side of this. That is the uncertain- ty. You just don’t know what is going to happen.” Here the AWACS has been employed only as a defensive weapon, providing early warning of Iraqi planes to a range of more than 250 miles. But if the United States and Saudi Arabia decided to launch an offensive or retalia- tory strike, the AWACS almost certainly would function as the American commander's forward headquarters in the first few days of fighting. “We have a plan for what to do if the Iraqis attack us,” said the commander of this AWACS flight, Lt. Col. Larry Johnson, 41, of Cape Girardeau, Mo. “And Joseph Albright Stat U.S. Air Force personnel observe limited activity on plane over Saudi Arabia, “W'S a tiresome job to watch radar screens Sunday morning aboard an AWACS radar ~~ empty skies,” Maj. Jeff Moore said, F-15s should fire back. If the ‘Six O’Clock Charlie” had decided to keep streaking south, he would have crossed the northern Saudi border in 1 min- ute, 26 seconds. Just straying across the bor- der wouldn’t necessarily cause the F-15s to open fire, said Colo- nel Bliss.

It is everyone’s assumption that we have to deal with their chemi- cal and nuclear potential.

        "ocr_text": " Dusty, bare expanse makes military radio tough to transmit By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent IN SAUDI ARABIA — U.S. forces are learning something the Iraqis, Is- raelis and anyone else who has fought in the Middle East have known for years. It is much harder to operate so- phisticated systems of command, con- trol and communications in this dusty, overheated climate than almost any- where else in the world, “Communications are tough in the desert,” said one of the top ground troop commanders, Marine Col. Carl Fulford. “In the California desert, we expe- rienced a lot of difficulties because the desert has a lot of lead content. Here we have the additional problem that there are a lot of power line grids around here that make communica- tions very tough. But we are using a combination of frequencies, and we are making do.” Communication between American commanders has improved a lot since the dicey few days of early August when the first American combat troops began pouring out of planes. If a war had broken out then, many units likely would have been cut off from quick communications and left to fight virtu- ally on their own, Yet the military command and con- trol mechanisms for fighting a desert war are not fully in place, and increas- ing the American edge in combat com- munications is likely to be among the highest priorities of troop command- ers. In addition to the heat, the feature- less terrain along the Kuwaiti border spells trouble for military communica- tions. There are no mountains, hills or tall trees on which the Army Signals Corps can establish radio relay sta- tions. Ordinarily, most military radio traffic moves on “line of sight” radio “Sometimes the heat takes its casualties” on voice transmissions. Maj. Gen. Royal N. Moore Jr. Marine aviation chief frequencies, If the antenna is beyond the horizon, the signal can't be heard unless passed along via relays called repeaters. Even after the military establishes enough repeaters, it must cope with the problem of allocating scarce frequen- cies, So many ground units from the Army and Marines are spread out across the desert that one unit's signals sometimes slop over onto another's fre- quencies. This has put additional demands on military communication via satellite. One of the first units to arrive in Saudi Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 11, 1990 Arabia was an Air Force detachment from Robbins Air Force Base, Ga., that helps operate the AFSATCOM satellite link. AFSATCOM is designed to carry a limited number of secure messages be- - tween senior commanders around the world, For instance, AFSATCOM was used during the Carter administration to link the war room of the Pentagon with the commanders of the Delta Force in the failed 1980 mission to res- cue American hostages in Iran. AFSATCOM and other classified satellite communications nets also have kept essential messages flowing in Saudi Arabia, but these networks were not designed for the flood of rou- tine messages now flowing between troop commanders, =. Working alongside the satellite net- work are futuristic systems:_ BJTIDS, used by the Air Force AWACS surveillance plane to beam in- stant “radar pictures” of Iraqi fighters approaching Saudi Arabia to the com- manders at the Patriot anti-aircraft missile batteries that defend major air- fields against Iraqi attack. @TADIL-A, which instantly sends the AWACS radar image to the Marine Aviation command post hundreds of miles away. @TADIL-C, which sends the same data instantly to the Navy. Both TADIL networks avoid the risk of Iraqi jam- ming. Despite the multiplicity of high- tech systems, communications are not perfect. One senior commander, Ma- rine aviation chief Maj. Gen. Royal N. Moore Jr., has acknowledged that his subordinate commanders have been having difficulties tying together their units at bases scattered across the Ara- bian peninsula. “We are still wiring together the air portion of it,” he said last week. “It is coming a little slower than I would \f"

        "ocr_text": "Iraq wooing Third World with free oil But Saddam’s invitation means foreigners must run blockade By Marcia Kunstel and Andrew Alexander Joumal-Constitution AMMAN, Jordan — Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in an apparent bid to gain allies, of- fered Monday to give free oil to all Third World countries and re- stored normal relations with longtime enemy Iran. The oil offer came in a state- ment read over Iraqi television by an official spokesman, who said the scheme was intended to offset higher oil prices from which Western nations were making “filthy profits.” Recipients of the oil would have to arrange shipment of it from Iraq but would make no other payment. Taking. the oil would not violate U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq, Saddam said through the spokesman, be- cause Baghdad would receive no fer as “just another effort to try to separate countries [and] get support wherever he can find Ro i “The man _ is desperate, reaching out wherever he can,” Mr. Fitzwater said. He said eco- nomic sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq’s Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait “relate to all commodities and supplies. Cost is not a factor.” Western navies have mount- ed a blockade of ships going to and from Iraq, and it remained doubtful that they would let any oil tankers through the cordon isolating Iraq even if any Third World countries should take up Saddam’s offer. Meanwhile, former foes Iraq and Iran announced Monday that they will normalize diplomatic relations that were nearly severed during their 1980-88 war, Although the rival neighbors never officially cut diplom, fi ties, they did close their embassies and recalled | ambassadors during the war, There was no indication Monday that would violate the U.N. sanctions and allow gi flow to and from Iraq across their common border, Tran has said it will honor the sanctions despite | its opposition to the U.S.-led military buildup in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region, However, there have been reports that st shipments of flour and rice have been sent from Tran into Iraq, An official at the Iranian Interests Section in Washington, the low-level consular post that handles dealings between the United States and Iran, denied late Monday that any shipments have gone from his country to Iraq, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in other Middle East countries, said Monday that the decision to normalize diplomatic ties was reached in meetings that Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had in Iran with Iranian For- eign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Iranian Presi- dent Hashemi Rafsanjani. Mr. Azi2 returned to Baghdad on Monday at the end of his 24-hour mission, The diplomatic rapprochement between Iran and Iraq — bitter enemies in a war that produced a million casualties — indicates the potential of the Persian Gulf crisis for dramatically reshaping the political landscape and alliances in the region, Along those lines, Secretary of State James A, Baker III said Monday in Brussels, Belgium, that _ hewill fly to Damascus, Syria, on Thursday to meet -- with Syrian President Hafez Assad, \\ “The United States has not had good relations with Syria,” Mr. Baker said, adding that his goal in meeting with Mr. Assad is to seek “improvement in those relations.” Syria, in a gesture that may signal it wants to move in that direction, said Monday that it would send more troops to Saudi Arabia to bolster the es- timated 4,000 to 5,000 combat forces it already has sent. Syria is considered officially by the Slate De- partment to be a country that supports terrorism, and Mr, Assad long has been considered @ radical Arab leader. For those reasons, and because the State Department considers Syria to have a poor human rights record, the country has been ineligi- ble for U.S. technology or military equipment. “We continue to have some differences with Syria, and we expect to discuss those differences,” Mr, Baker said in a news conference at NATO headquarters, where he briefed foreign ministers of member countries on the results of President Bush’s Sunday summit with Soviet President Mik- hail $, Gorbachev in Helsinki, Finland. Saddam described his offer of free oil to Third World countries as unconditional. “The supply of free oil will not be linked to any decision or position taken by a country to the cur- rent crisis because we respect the opinions of states and nations and do not assume any coinci- dence of views on all issues,” Saddam said through the television spokesman. Saddam, who has been unable to sell any oil since the embargo began last month, said his ges- ture was one of solidarity with nations suffering under the rise in oil costs, The world price of oil has gone up about 50 percent since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, at one point topping $30 a barrel in the United States. “We are brothers and we share the same fate. That is why we declare our readiness to supply those countries in need with Iraqi oil free of charge,” Saddam said, His expressed concern over rising oil prices contrasted with Iraq’s position earlier, when it lob- bied other OPEC countries from February through July, arguing that Kuwait and other countries ex- ceeding oil production quotas must reduce produc- tion. The goal of the Iraqi position was to raise oil prices so Iraq would make more money to pay off its massive debts. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 11, 1990 \f"

Disaster Relief Organization. Although officials expressed cautious hope that the worst of the crisis has passed, they also warned that a great unknown lies beyond the border in Iraq. “We don’t know what wave might come next,” said Regina Boucault of the International Or- ganization for Migration, refer- ring to the waves of evacuees ouring over the border from Kuwait and Iraq. She cited estimates that 500,000 stranded people may wish to leave the two countries but said neither the Jordanian government nor the internation- al agencies assisting it have good figures on what to expect. The latest crisis grew out of a pe of evacuees from India, Sri ° and |hailanad su anka, Baneladesh EVACUEES IN LIMBO | who had remained in Kuwait several weeks after Iraq invaded Aug. 2. Many said they had hoped normal life would return, but as food got more scarce and their work did not resume, masses of them decided to leave. The most critical trouble spot has been the Shalan 1 border camp, flooded with up to 60,000 people in recent days. The popu- lation there had been reduced to less than 18,000 by Sunday night, according to government fig- ures. The camp had been an uncon- trolled mass of suffering people as recently as Friday, leading to predictions of a cholera epidem- ic or food riots. “A lot of things started hap- pening at the same time,” said Nigel Fisher, deputy regional di- rector of UNICEF, the U.N. chil- dren’s agency. A second, more orderly bor- der camp was expanded, and a third one opened to relieve con- gestion at Shalan 1. Another camp between the border and Amman eventually is expected to hold 40,000 people and will begin Arefugee at the International Fair Center in Am- man, Jordan, pleads Monday for more food for her chil- receiving people today. “When I went back Sunday thinking it was still disastrous, it was wonderful to see the change,” Mr. Fisher said. View- ing Shalan 1 from the air, he said he saw fewer people, more tents, orderly food lines, and 20 buses being loaded with people leay- ing. Several agency officials said the government's aim is to empty the camp, close it and clean it out. Meanwhile, more evacuees are being airlifted back to their homelands. Only three days after the In- ternational Organization for Mi- gration (IOM) said the exodus out of Iraq and Kuwait had reached a “breaking point” and appealed for urgent contribu- tions for the airlift, the organiza- tion said Monday that the situa- dren. World relief efforts have surged in the past few days, reducing fears of violence and epidemics. tion now “looks more optimis- tic.” In one week of operation, the organization has arranged 107 flights that will carry 31,500 peo- ple home by Sept. 20. But that is only one-third of the 105,000 peo- ple now stranded in Jordan, and more are arriving daily. “Our aim is to repatriate as many people as there are to repa- triate and to do it as soon as pos- sible,” Ms. Boucault said, “espe- cially since we don’t know what wave might come next.” IOM, an intergovernmental agency but not part of the United Nations, has received $30 million in pledges to help finance the air- lift. The United States has con- tributed $7.25 million, Ms. Bou- cault said. France has donated the use of a Boeing 747 for at least a week, and IOM is hoping for more con- tributions.

        "ocr_text": " Saudis claim Iraqi soldiers braving minefields to defect By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent NEAR THE KUWAITI BORDER, Saudi Arabia — U.S. spy satellites have spotted Iraqis laying minefields just north of the Saudi border in what appears to be an attempt to stop defecting Iraqi sol- diers, a senior Saudi general said Tuesday. Brig. Gen. Mohammed Shehri said scores of hungry Iraqi troops have fled south into Saudi Ara- bia, including 100 defectors who showed up Friday and Saturday. General Shehri said most of the de- fectors cross the flat, hard-packed desert on foot, but a few have driven into Saudi Arabia in tanks and armored personnel carriers. The general’s comments came as Defense Sec- retary Dick Cheney disclosed in Washington that the cost of the U.S. military buildup in the Middle East could total $15 billion in fiscal 1991, which be- gins Oct. 1. But he promised disgruntled lawmak- ers “a significant increase” in help from Arab na- tions and other U.S. allies. Mr. Cheney warned that costs “would multiply many fold” if American troops get involved in com- bat. Japan, trying to defuse criticism that it is not doing its share in the face-off against Baghdad, an- nounced it may send $2 billion in aid to nations af- fected most severely by the U.N. embargo against Iraq. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have said they will contribute $12 billion, with some of the money going to nations hurt by the economic embargo. General Shehri, deputy commander and logis- tics chief of the Saudi northern sector, said Iraqi defectors include at least one major and some cap- tains and lieutenants. He refused to let journalists interview any defectors or photograph their tanks, saying that doing so could jeopardize the lives of He said he ed of Iraq’s mine-laying through one of the frequent updates his headquar- ters receives from U.S. military intelligence offi- cials at a base elsewhere in Saudi Arabia. “As soon as the Americans get something from their satellites, they fax it to our operations cen- ter,” General Shehri said. He said the satellite data show that some Iraqi armored units in Kuwait and southern Iraq don’t always stay dug into their static defenses, as had ___DEFECTING IRAQIS been reported. “They are moving every day,” he said, “some- times two or three times, up and down the line. They are changing units, too.” U.S. military spokesmen declined to comment, saying they were not authorized to discuss intelli- gence matters. General Shehri first told journalists about the defectors more than two weeks ago but said then that his remarks were off the record. “They told us they are dying; they don’t have enough food to eat,” he said. General Shehri said Iraqi tank crews’ diet consists of bread they get from bakeries in Kuwait City and a paste they fash- ion from wheat, cooking oil and sugar. General Shehri, who got his advanced infantry and Ranger training at Fort Benning, Ga., in the 1970s, is responsible for making sure the Saudi, Egyptian, Moroccan and other Arab troops are supplied with food, fuel, water and spare parts. He prides himself on delivering three fresh-cooked hot meals a day to Saudi and allied Arab troops at the front via helicopter and truck. The Saudi and other Arab troops are in a three- layer defensive position just south of Iraq and Ku- wait, General Shehri said. He said the first line, six miles from the border, consists of trenches, intelligence outposts and small posts for scout troops. About 35 miles back is a second Saudi line of anti-aircraft and missile bat- teries as well as light infantry. A third line of de- fense, consisting of dug-in tanks and artillery, is 50 miles from the border. All three lines are designed to blunt an Iraqi tank thrust aimed down the single road that leads southwest toward Riyadh, the Saudi capital. The American tank units of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) have not moved north toward the border to join the Saudis. Its major elements remain in defensive posi- tions more than 100 miles south of the Saudi tank lines. The 24th is awaiting the delayed arrival of ships carrying spare parts and other supplies from the Port of Savannah. The Associated Press contributed to this article.

        "ocr_text": "[ranian calls _ presence of America in the Persian Gulf for holy war against U.S. | Fahd, , By MARCIA KUNSTEL and ANDREW ALEXANDER Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau AMMAN, Jordan — Iraq gained support from two neighbors | Wednesday, the most unexpected coming in an Iranian call for a holy war against U.S. forces in the Per- sian Gulf. And Jordanian officials praised Iraq’s pledge of free oil for Third © World countries, indicating they will accept the offer. Iran’s supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on all Muslims to fight the U.S. de- ployment of troops in Saudi Arabia. This was coupled with signs that Iran was weakening its backing for trade sanctions against Iraq. Unconfirmed reports through- out the Mideast said small amounts of food and other supplies had been moving from Iran into neighboring Iraq. But Richard Boucher of the State Department said Wednesday there was “no evidence” Iran is breaking the embargo. The developments came after Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz visited Iran on Sunday. MIDEAST CRISIS @ HOUSE MEMBERS, up- set that Japan is not paying enough to help the U.S. in the Mideast, amend a bill to require the Japanese to pay more for stationing U.S, forces in their country. @ A SOLDIER'S letter that President Bush referred to on national TV said the soldier doesn't believe in war ‘or the unnecessary acts of violence against fellow human beings, but it is my job.’ STORIES ON 4A, 5A Iran and Iraq announced at that time that they would normalize diplomatic relations, which had been virtually severed during a ot eight-year war that ended in 1988 “The struggle against Ameri- can aggression, greed, plans and policies in the Persian Gulf wi counted as Jihad (Holy War) in the cause of Allah, and anybody who is killed on that path is a martyr,” Tehran Radio quoted Khamenei as saying. “We are vehemently opposed to the region as well as to its constantly in- creasing greed and its shameless policy in the region.” A member of the Saudi Arabian royal family dismissed Khamenei’s call for a holy war. “That won't be the first time or the last time,” said Prince Fahd bin Sal- man, deputy governor of Saudi Arabia’s eastern province and nephew of King President Bush prepared an eight- minute videotaped message Wednesday to [raq’s citizens, telling them the Unit- ed States has “no quarrel with the Iraqi people,” and that Iraqis should blame hardships created by the embargo on their own government. White House officials doubt whether Iraq will broadcast Bush’s Arabic- dubbed message in an unedited form. If that is not done, the White House plans to release the tape to other nations. At the United Nations, a special Security Council committee dealing with sanctions against Iraq failed to agree on when emergency food should be shipped to Iraq and Kuwait. A deadlock developed when the five permanent Security Council members — the United States, Soviet Union, Brit- ain, France and China — pushed to send experts to see if emergency food ship- ments are needed, But Cuba and Yemen want immediate shipments to aid hun- dreds of thousands of foreigners pped there. The United States and other Western nations Say a critical food shortage has not developed and that they fear ship- ments could be diverted to help Iraq ease the pinch of U.N.-imposed econom- ic sanctions, Roughly 800 Americans have left Iraq and Kuwait in recent days. Another flight is scheduled for Friday. The State Department says about 1,400 Ameri- cans still are in Kuwait and that about 200 remain in Iraq. Tn his broadcast from Tehran, Kha- menei especially objected to stationing American troops in Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam’s most holy shrines. The Iranian government has de- nounced the Iraqi invasion and annex- ation of Kuwait, and has pledged to observe mandatory international sanc- tions against trade with Iraq. But Wednesday, the Tehran Times newspa per said Iran was considering moving food and medicine into Iraq on an hu manitarian basis. ; “Once Iran finalizes its decision and starts shipping food and medicine to Iraq, political circles believe, Iraq will have an outlet in its present strapped position,” the newspaper said. ' In Saudi Arabia, some officials said Wednesday night that one consequence of the softening Iranian position may be a blockade of Iranian ports. Westerg ships already stop and query vessels that appear to be bound for Iran, but so far they have let them all pass. Jordan became the first country to publicly welcome Iraq's offer to supply free oil to Third World nations that arrange to ship it, and officials indicat- ed Jordan will accept the oil.

        "ocr_text": "Iraq denies it plans hits by terrorists By Marcia Kunstel and Andrew Alexander COX NEWS SERVICE AMMAN, Jordan — Iraq denied Thursday that it was planning ter- rorist assaults on U.S. interests, and accused the Bush administra- tion of using such allegations as a pretext to attack Iraq. But Iraq did not rule out the pos- sibility of ter- rorist strikes by Arab na- tions against the United States and other nations trying to force Iraq to retreat from its occupation of Kuwait. “The American government and President Bush should expect that the crimes the United States of America is committing against the Arab nation and the insult it is di- recting to the Islamic shrines by occupying holy lands will un- doubtedly produce a natural reac- tion from the Arab and Islamic masses,” said a government mem- orandum quoted by the Iraqi News Agency (INA). INA said the memorandum was a response to a message from the Bush administration, delivered to Iraq’s Foreign Ministry in Bagh- dad on Wednesday, which said it had information that pro-Iraqi ter- rorist groups were plotting attacks on the United States and other na- tions lined up in opposition to Iraq’s Aug. 2 invasion and subse- quent annexation of Kuwait. The American message had warned that if any such attack takes place, “President Saddam Hussein should know that the United States will hold him per- sonally responsible,”’ according to. INA. Meanwhile, a convocation of Moslem clergy in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, condemned the Iraqi an- nexation of Kuwait and said the U.S.-led multinational force’s presence was justified by Iraq’s invasion. Meanwhile Thursday, members of the United Nations Security . Council were deadlocked over when and how to send emergency food aid to Iraq and occupied Kuwait. The United States and other Western nations of the 15-member Council were pushing for adoption of a resolution that would first re- quire an on-the-scene determina- tion that emergency food aid is needed and, if so, that it be distrib- uted by neutral international relief agencies such as the Red Cross. But nonaligned members, led by Yemen and Cuba, were pushing for immediate approval for a request by India to ship food for hundreds of thousands of its nationals trapped in Kuwait. The United States and other Western nations fear that Iraq may divert the food aid for its own citizens. Iraq has not permitted represen- tatives of the United Nations or in- ternational relief agencies to visit Iraq or Kuwait to determine if food aid is needed. “The information we have is that there is still plenty of food in Iraq but Iraqi authorities are using food aS a weapon (and have) denied food to foreign nationals,” said Marjatta Rasi, Dayton Daily News - September 14, 1990 \f"

On Aug. 18 it fired across the bow of a ootant vessel. USS Bradley is awash in adrenalin after 45 days of enforcing sanctions By Joseph Albright Joumnal-Constitution correspondent. ABOARD THE USS BRADLEY IN THE PERSIAN GULF — Around 3 a.m. on Aug. 2, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait, the radioman aboard this American warship heard the alarm bell clang on his teleprinter. “T ripped it off without looking at it,” said Seaman Jeff Blazer, 24, of Springfield, Ohio, who has been in the Navy for only one year. “I took it straight to Combat. They decided to bring us to General Quarters.” ‘ The 215 men aboard the Bradley, the closest U.S. vessel to Kuwait, bolt- ed out of their bunks and to their battle stations. They were the first of the more than 100,000 American service- men now in the Persian Gulf theater to _ go onto a war footing. “My first thought was whether the ship was on fire,” said Petty Officer Carlus Jackson, 35, of Columbus, Ga., chief radar technician. The USS Robert G. Bradley, a svelte sea darter the Navy calls a guid- ed-missile frigate, is named for a Navy officer killed by a Japanese dive bomb- er in 1944, It is 453 feet long and 47 feet wide. The Bradley left its home port of Charleston, S.C., ia early June for a routine six-month patrol in the gulf. As the luck of the sea has played out over the past 45 days, the crew has lived a bigger slice of the crisis than anyone else. ++ * An unknown cargo ship had dropped anchor in the central gulf, and it was up to the Bradley’s officers to figure out whether the ship was haul- ing goods for Iraq in defiance of the U.N. embargo. “This is Navy warship; I have a few questions for you,” the officer of the deck, Lt. j.g. Ted Anderson, 26, of Mun- cie, Ind., called out to the freighter. The freighter’s third mate an- swered in Filipino-accented English, saying the ship was the Panamanian- registered Maria Kay bound from Mo- rocco to the Iranian port of Bandar Khomeini. “What was the cargo?” “Fertilizer.” “What kind of fertilizer?” “Phosphate, in bags.” “How much?” 27,000 metric tons.” “When do you intend to get under way?” “We are planning to leave right away. We will be in Bandar Khomeini at 0600 [6 a.m.] tomorrow morning.” The captain, Cmdr. Kevin Cosgriff, 41, of Binghamton, N.Y., told the half- dozen officers and seamen plus several journalists on the bridge that he was suspicious. What caught his eye was the fishing boat a few hundred yards from the anchored Maria Kay. “One of the realities over here is smuggling,” Commander Cosgriff said. “A ship lying to with a little dhow [ship] around is perhaps a little bit more than coincidence. But we don’t know.” Commander Cosgriff ordered his navigator to calculate whether the ship could make Bandar Khomeini by the time it said it would arrive. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Anderson gazed through his field glasses while another young officer spoke with the pilot of the Brad- ley’s helicopter, which had returned from overflying the Maria Kay. The USS Bradley Vessel: A 3,600-ton Navy frigate armed with guided missiles. It is 453 feet long and 47 feet wide. Crew: 215, including 15 officers. Home port: Charleston, S.C. The interrogation edged on for about 10 minutes. At the end, Com- mander Cosgriff came on the radio and politely informed the Maria Kay that it was free to steam past. The captain of the Maria Kay broke in to thank him and asked whether the channel north to the Iranian port was still open. “It’s only because of recent ne that I ask,” the skipper said. Lieutenant Anderson, one of five Naval Academy graduates out of the Bradley’s 15 officers, explained how the men on the bridge try to determine ‘whether a ship is telling the truth when it says it isn’t going to Iraq. “You kind of see if it all fits,” he said. “For instance, you look for wheth- er the name of the ship is freshly paint- ed, and whether names on lifeboats match the name on the ship.” Since the Iraq crisis broke, Com- mander Cosgriff and his men have in- terrogated about 50 merchant ships by radio. All but one have complied with the Bradley’s orders. That was the Ira- qi motor vessel Baba, which on Aug. 18 refused an order from Commander Cosgriff to stop. The Bradley fired a warning across the Baba’s bow. The Baba — evidently under orders to provoke a confrontation — defied the warning shots and kept on sailing. To many of the Bradley crew mem- bers, this seemed like a good time to settle some old scores with the Iraqis. On the bulletin board near their dining tables, the crew has posted an article by columnist Jack Anderson contending that the Iraqi attack that killed 37 Americans on the USS Stark in 1987 was deliberate. “We Owe Him One,” reads the crayoned aie above the article. But that day, no repayment was al- lowed. The U.N. Security Council had not yet clearly approved the use of force at sea and, to the dismay of the crew, an admiral’s voice came on the radio and ordered the Bradley to let the Baba pass. The confrontation was tense, but the crew remembers the General Quarters call on Aug. 2 as the peak of their adrenalin. “A lot of guys grew up very fast that morning,” remembered Commander Cosgriff. “All of a sudden, we went from a peacetime footing to a wartime footing.” As the northernmost American warship in the gulf, the Bradley spent the first few days of the crisis escorting American-flagged ships away from the vicinity of Kuwait. They were close enough to the coast for radio operators to pick up anguished messages from people ashore trying to resist the Iraqi encirclement. On Aug. 5, the Bradley tied up at the Saudi port of Dammam for what was supposed to be a routine port visit. As it happened, the sight of an American warship — even a small one — was a tranquilizer for the alarmed inhabit- ants of the Saudis’ eastern province. Accompanied by the U.S. consul general, Commander Cosgriff paid a As the luck of the sea has played out over the past 45 days, the crew of the Bradley has lived a bigger slice of the crisis than anyone else. ceremonial visit to the province’s gov- ernor , who is a son of King Fahd. Com- mander Cosgriff thus became the first U.S. military officer to show the flag with the Saudis. While the captain was doubling as a diplomat, the crew members were en- couraged to walk the streets in Saudi Arabia, making their presence seen by as many Saudis as possible. All this time, there was no Ameri- can air cover. But then, on about Aug. 8, the silver-gray F-15s began streak- ing in after their transatlantic voyage from Virginia. “If there was one thing that improved morale, it was the Air Force showing up,” said Commander Cosgriff. Since then, the Bradley crewmen have watched as more tlian 100,000 Americans poured in behind them. Chief Petty Officer Jimmy Casey, 29, of Augusta, Ga., said the only way to deal with the sense of menace is to for- get about the big picture. “You get to know how to isolate yourself from the rest of the world and focus on the task at hand,” he said. “I don’t even see the picture of what is go- ing on 50 miles away from me. I worry about what goes on here on this ship.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 16, 1990 \f"

He is not even Moslem. But when he contemplates the Western behavior he believes has jeopardized his business and the future of his nation and his region, @ streak of raw anger breaks ‘through Azar’s quiet demeanor. _ “I hate Saddam’s methods.

Jordanian appliances, deter- gents and other light industrial production, usually heavily export- ed to Iraq, are denied government export licenses now in keeping with the embargo. The Jordan Stock Exchange dropped 25 per- cent since Aug. 2, and firms with export business to Iraq lost one- third of their value, Fanek said. might as well be on Saddam’s side. I’m being hurt as much as the Iraqis.” His position is not isolated. Bit- ter resentment is common here, especially over international sanc- tions against Iraq and the effect they are having on Jordan. The decisions taken to counter Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait — the embargo, the blockade to enforce it and the dispatch of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia — are seen here as the latest chapter in an arrogant history of colonialism that disre- gards interests of the small and weak. With its tangle of economic ties to Iraq, Jordan has been one of the countries hardest hit by the prohi- bition against doing business with Iraqis. Direct losses are estimated Another effect of the crisis is that Kuwait has been virtually shut down, and some 100,000 Jor- danians who worked there will not be sending money back home. An estimated $320 million came into Jordan last year from Kuwait. The Western media have por- trayed Jordan as sitting in the midst of a war zone, said Azar, who is the managing director of the Jordan Phosphate Mines Co., Ltd. That portrayal has made custom- ers wary about buying Jordanian exports or supplying spare parts for industry here. “My loss is not the direct loss, but the shifting of customers,” said Azar. ‘‘One country said, ‘Look, we cannot depend on a source that is threatened.’ So they switched at $2 billion, which is nearly one- third of the gross domestic prod- uct, while some government analysts say spin-off effects could bring economic erosion to more than 40 percent. Jordanians feel they are being punished because they did not im- mediately buckle to Western desires. Jordan has not condemned Iraq’s invasion, although it has called the aggression unacceptable. And the ruling monarchy here con- sistently has criticized the pres- ence of U.S. soldiers in the region, saying Washington should have given the Arabs time to find a solu- tion without foreign interference. Jordan has sought and probably will get some exemption from the sanctions imposed by the U.N. Se- sources. How do I get them back?” Azar maintains such decisions are not based on economics, but are intended to pressure Jordan to fall in line with Western powers. “It’s political. It’s definitely po- litical. There’s nothing (danger- ous) in Aqaba. People are still swimming there. Nobody bothers them,” he said. When Azar looks across the bor- der at his neighbor Saddam Hus- sein, he sees a leader who has stood up to the Americans, and that is enough to win his support. “We have learned that being weak there is no place for you in this world,” said the businessman. “You have to direct blow against blow.” Austin American-Statesman - September 16, 1990 \f"

In fact, it is Iraq against the world,” said Mr. Bush, whose words could be heard and read simultaneously in an Arabic translation. He said Saddam, the Iraqi president, had led his nation to “the brink of war,” but “‘it is still possible to bring this crisis to a peaceful end” if Iraq ends its oc- cupation of Kuwait. Meanwhile, the U.N. Securi Council unanimously adopted a harsh resolution condemning . Irvaq’s raids on diplomatic mis- sions in occupied Kuwait last week. The Iraqi government re- jected the resolution, saying it was based on lies. Iraq has de- nied that its soldiers barged into he French, Canadian, Dutch and Belgian diplomatic quarters in Kuwait and took three French- men into custody. ' Diplomats also began writing a new resolution to close off Iraq’s air routes and punish na- tions flouting the trade embargo, US. officials said.

' It said the videotape’ was filled with “claims and lies of - President Bush” and denigrated - Mr. Bush as “naive” if he be- lieved he could turn the Iraqi people against their president. ‘» “Bush believes fhe whole world is ready for a new world, drder, an order in which the Ynited States is the sole leader,” the commentary said, accusing Mr. Bush of desiring to become “the dictator of the whole world.” ' ToMr. Bush’s contention that the rest of the world is lined up in opposition to Irag, the govern- ment spokesman replied that the conflict is “a dispute between right and wrong.” He called it a fight between: the United States and its allies on one side and “Iraq and all Arabs and all Muslims and all believers in the whole world” on the other. During his address, Mr. Bush took a paper from his pocket and quoted what he said were Sad- dam’s words in a 1988 speech: “An. Arab country does not have the right to occupy another Arab country. “We would want Arabs to send their armies to put things right. ... If Iraq should become intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm another Arab state, the Arabs would be right to deploy their armies to check it,” Mr. Bush quoted Sad- dam as saying. Mr. Bush said the rest of the world is standing up against a “monstrous” aggression in which “Kuwait was the victim and Iraq the aggressor.” He maintained that the inter- national sanctions against Iraq are not meant to hurt the Iraqi people but are a tool “to convince Bhan’ leadership to withdraw om Kuwait. The decision is in the hands of Saddam Hussein,” he said. * In connection with the raids on diplomatic missions in Ku- wait, the Italian government an- nounced it was expelling Iraq’s military attache and his staff and confining all Iraqi diplomats to the Rome area. France took simi- lar actions Saturday. Iraq also said it would not ac- cept another U.N. resolution that calls for humanitarian ship- Iraq under the supervision of in- ternational relief agencies. Iraq called the resolution unjust and humiliating. An Indian cargo ship left port Sunday with 10,000 metric tons of food and medicine for an esti- mated 125,000 Indians stranded in Kuwait, but it remained un- certain whether blockading war- ships would let it pass through the gulf without assurances from Iraq that the supplies would be distributed in accordance with the U.N. resolution. On the military side, an array of nations answered the U.S. call for more forces. Egypt pledged to send another 15,000 troops to the gulf, one of the largest non- American forces. Britain, France, Pakistan and Bangla- desh also have offered to send a total of 15,000 additional troops, plus aircraft and tanks. Syria reportedly is about to raise its military strength in the gulf from 4,000 soldiers to 15,000, plus 300 tanks. The U.S. contingent is more than 150,000 strong, including soldiers, sailors and airmen, and is continuing to grow. In another development, the Soviet Union took another major step toward realigning itself in the Middle East when it an- nounced plans to re-establish diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud Faisal, arrived in Moscow on Sunday “to hold ne- gotiations with the Soviet leader- ship and sign a treaty to establish diplomatic relations,” the gov- ernment news agency Tass re- ported. The two countries broke ties in 1938. Journal-Constitution corre- spondent T. Elaine Carey in Mos- cow and The Associated Press Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 17, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Hunger reigns in Kuwait Locals caught hiding Americans are being hanged, says refugee By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Journa!-Constitution correspondents DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — Kuwaiti refugees pouring into Saudi Arabia by the thousands Sunday told of lootings, hangings, pillage and food short- ages in Kuwait City, which only six weeks ago was among the richest cities in the world. Refugees arriving in Jordan told similar stories of growing hunger and atrocities but said armed Kuwaitis were continuing to resist the Iraqi invad- ers. Saudi sources‘also disclosed Sunday that Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait have seized more than 30,000 valid Kuwaiti passports by breaking into passport offices or taking them from departing Ku- waitis, Both Saudi and U.S. officials said the risk of ter- rorist attacks on American troops has increased because of Iraq’s unexplained decision to seize the passports and drivers’ licenses of the more than 3,000 Kuwaitis it has allowed to cross into Saudi Arabia since Saturday. Roughly 30,000 blank Kuwaiti passports fell into Iraqi hands during the early days of the occu- pation of Kuwait City, the Saudi sources said. And. over the past few days, the Iraqis grabbed hun- dreds more documents, including drivers’ licenses and car papers, as they searched carloads of Ku- waitis backed up at the coastal border crossing of Khafji. Sadi security officials were demanding proof that the carloads of Arabs streaming south from Kuwait City were really Kuwaitis and not disguised Iraqis. One Kuwaiti satisfied the Saudis by produc- ing a copy of his school yearbook containing his photograph. A Kuwaiti businessman, Khalid Salem, 30, told journalists waiting on the Saudi side of the border that for the past two weeks, Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait “have “been: harassing us, searching every house very, night. They were looking for Americans and gold.” wy ; “They are stealing everything. We have been trying to get the foreigners to a safe place, but un- fortunately they are too scared to move.” f Another refugee, a retired petrochemical com- pany employee named Mubarek, said he had seen Iraqi soldiers hanging Kuwaiti teenagers suspect- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 17, 1990 City \"TALES FROM KUWAIT —_ ed of helping to hide the foreigners Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants to use as human shields. “They telephoned the parents of these children 12 to 16 years old and said they were giving them back,” Mr. Mubarek said in an interview after reaching a hotel near the oil city of Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. “When the parents came to get them, the soldiers hung the children from a bar on the rear of the truck.” Mr. Mubarek said some Iraqi soldiers appeared to be hungry and tired of occupying another Arab country. He said many Iraqi troops carry swatches of white cloth inside their tunics that they could use to surrender if U.S. Marines burst ashore. He said one of his neighbors was hanged by Ira- qi soldiers last week after they broke into his house and found him hiding an American family. The Americans were seized, blindfolded and taken away, Mr. Mubarek said. At least 3,000 Westerners, including hundreds of Americans, are believed to be still trapped or hiding in Kuwait more than six weeks after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion. Hundreds of others have been captured and sent to Iraq. A Kuwaiti religious leader interviewed in Am- man, Jordan, over the weekend said occupying Ira- qi soldiers have been snaring young men believed to be in the resistance and killing them. , A Filipino nurse who arrived in Amman on Monday said her bus leaving Kuwait City last Thursday had been delayed four hours due to fight- ing in city streets. Last week the hospital where she had worked was routinely receiving Iraqi soldiers shot by resis- tance fighters, she said. The nurse was among a group of Filipinos who left Kuwait in late August for Baghdad, Iraq, but were allowed to return last week to retrieve sala- _ ries owed them and to sell possessions they had left behind. A Filipino X-ray technician who gave his name only as Mel said that when he went back to sell off his belongings, nothing was left. Refugees also reported that food shortages were worsening. “The food is out of stock now. I couldn’t find in- fant’s milk. Even bread sometimes we cannot get, and when we can it is one bag for a family,” said the nurse, who asked not to be identified further. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Ex-captives train rebels in Kuwait By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE @ GULF NOTEBOOK/SA AMMAN, Jordan — The under- ground resistance against Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait is being trained by ter- rorists ‘eq once were the séed most notori- who ous prisoners of the Kuwaiti regime — a group of Shiite Moslems who launched a 1983 wave of bombings there. The imprisoned Shiites were re- leased by the invading Iraqis, but quickly joined with Kuwaitis struggling to regain their nation. In aremarkable alliance, they have been teaching the underground to carry out guerrilla warfare tactics such as assembling Molotov cock- tails and performing suicide bombing missions, according to sources interviewed in Iraq, Saudi , Arabia, Syria and Jordan. “The Shias run the under- ground,” said a source in Bagh- dad, who recently had returned from Kuwait. A Kuwaiti who arrived in Saudi \"Arabia on Sunday said in an inter- view that he knew at least three of the Shias, “I have worked with some of them. Some are working with the resistance,” said Mubarek, a re- tired petrochemical executive who asked not to be further identified. The pairing of the Shiite prison- ers and their former captors is the most peculiar of the political con- volutions spreading through the Arab world since Iraq attacked and annexed Kuwait. The alliance has left the United States working on the same side as Islamic terrorists holding Ameri- can hostages. Kuwaitis have teamed up with former enemies held in Kuwait’s prisons for almost seven years. And the Shiite terror- ists are conspiring against the man who is responsible for their free- dom, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. The Shias are among 17 people sentenced to prison in connection with a December 1983 wave of car bombings that struck sites in Ku- wait including the U.S. and French embassies, an industrial complex and an electric power station. An- other six men were sentenced to hang for the bombings, in which at least five people died, The attacks were carried out to protest Kuwait's aid to Iraq in its eight-year war with Iran, which ended in 1988, as well as the in- ne of Western troops in The defendants were pro-lrani- an, and the Kuwaiti government charged at the time that some had ties to the Dawa movement, an Iranian-backed underground group that wants to overthrow the Traqi government, The imprisonment of the 17 Shi- ites led colleagues in Beirut to be- gin the kidnappings that have left six Americans and nine other Westerners as hostages, Some of the 17 Shiites are believed to have ties to the group Islamic Jihad, which claimed responsibility for truck bombings in Beirut in Octo- her 1983 that destroyed U.S, and French military barracks and killed 300 troops. Release of the 17 prisoners has been a key demand of fundamen- talist groups holding the Western hostages in Beirut, but the Ku- waiti regime of Sheikh Jaber Ah- med Sabah refused to make any deals. After Iraq's Aug, 2 invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi authorities released the 17 Shiites from prison and re- portedly took them to Baghdad. Within three days they were set free, according to the source in Baghdad, The government there expected the released prisoners to show their gratitude by railing against the Kuwaitis who had imprisoned them.

        "ocr_text": " A Marine Light Assault Vehicle passes a herd of camels in the Saudi desert. me it’s lonely in the dese U.S. troops trv t By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service FORT APACHE, Saudi Arabia — SFC Russell Fauver reached down in the darkness last Friday night and picked up a piece of rope. The rope started wriggling. Fauver, 32, of Hop Bottom, Pa., and thousands of other members of the 24th Infantry Division (Mecha- nized) from Fort Stewart, Ga., are now making their homes in sand viper country. So far, these children of the per- missive '70s and ‘80s are making many soldiers of the past look like softies. The question is whether they can continue to do so if their Saudi Arabian duty lasts through Christ- mas. Impatience seems to be the worst enemy of their morale. “It’s very lonely, being out here in the hot sun,” said SP4 Tracy Turner, 21 of Sumter, S.C., who is attached to an artillery unit of the 24th. “I’ve even cried since I’ve been here. It’s too much being here. Being in desert, it really doesn’t seem human. ... A lot of people here feel it is really not a war, it’s a hostile environment. You are just sitting around waiting for something to happen.” Another thing hurting spirits is the word from Washington that soldiers on duty here have lost mil- itary meal allowances, which many have grown used to as part of their pay. ‘‘Morale has its ups and downs,” oO keep their morale from wilting ‘I’ve even cried since I’ve been here. It’s too much being here. Being in desert, it really doesn’t seem human.’ said SP4 Timothy Cox, 20, of Clar- endon, Tex., who is here to shoot a cannon from inside a Bradley Fighting Vehicle. “When you are sitting here in the middle of the day and a dust storm is blowing, the guys get pret- ty down. But during the evening and the morning, when the air is aeecy 2 calm, it is really nice out ere.” In a camouflage tent about 15 miles away, scout SP4 Andy Ray, 26, of Cordele, Ga., said of morale, “Tt’s high in places and low in plac- es. We have MREs (Meals Ready to Eat, a military packaged food) and plenty of water. We could use more supplies, like shaving stuff.” “We are doing okay,” Ray said, “but it would be nice if they could maybe rotate us back so we could phone home, just to call and say ‘hello, I love you.’ ” Another trooper, SP4 Shedrick Mills, 23, of Los Angeles, said, “You get your morale from your loved ones. Three days ago, I got two letters at once from my wife, and that helps. Other times, I got to get my morale from my friends.”’ — SP4 Tracy Turner It was Lt. Col. Glynn Pope, the 6 foot, 5 inch commander of Raider Forward, the forward scout unit of the 24th, who planted his size 12 combat boots on this patch of no- where and called it Fort Apache. “This is John Wayne country,” he explained to journalists who got a ride on a Blackhawk helicopter. “I get up each morning and won- der if they are going to play Pon- derosa,” the theme from the old TV show “Bonanza.” The scouts of the 4th Cavalry are the eyes of the general who com- mands the 24th Division. They moved out of the port two weeks ago and rolled their M-1 tanks and Bradleys forward to real fighting positions that back up the Saudi front line tanks. The American scouts are still far south of the Saudi Army tank lines, which are themselves about 70 miles south the Saudi border. But it sustains the scouts going to know that they are the farthest forward of any troops in the 24th Division. Whether it is true or not, they have also been told that they are farther forward than the Ma- rines. Santa Cruz Sentinel (California) - September 17, 1990 \f"

They ied food. They need medicine. They need shelter,” said Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who was named personal envoy for humanitarian assistance by UN See- retary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, “Some way must be found to assist these people in transit, Some way must be found in co-operation with Iraqi au- thorities, or these people will die, The planes will be taking back dead bodies,” Aga Khan said at a news conference, So far, Iraqi authorities have refused to co-operate with the special envoy, who wants to arrange direct flights out of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, and if necessary also out of Kuwait. Iraq turned down a direct appeal from the secretary general to work with his envoy, but efforts are continuing to win Iraq's help. Aga Khan said the Iraqis “unfortu- nately are under some misconception’ that his job is connected with the UN resolution Pat humanitarian ship: ments of food and medicine into [raq only if their distribution is monitored by international relief agencies, “They took this as an insult to their integrity,” said Aga Khan, emphasizing that his duty is unrelated to that resolu- tion. “My mission was to speed up the de- parture of third-country nationals,” he said, Iraqi officials said on Tuesday that they would not try to interfere with dis- tribution of the first major shipment of food and medicine now en route from India, The Indian ship, which is carrying supplies for Indian citizens and other foreigners in need, also has on board re- lief officials who will be responsible for distributing the cargo once the ship ar- rives in Iraq, Aga Khan said international agencies know that 250,000 to 300,000 people are awaiting departure from Iraq, most of them camped out or living in temporary quarters around Baghdad, along the Tigris River or at their embassy grounds, But there is no solid information on how many are planning to exit Iraq, and even less intelligence on how many wish to leave Kuwait, Privately, some United Nations ? cials have said in recent days ee Baghdad government appears ready use food as a political lever, in the ho that shortages among Iraqis as well as foreigners would become an embarrass- ment to the United States and other Western nations, and induce then to ease the sanctions, \"I think there is a chance that. the whole thing could rebound on Washing: ton, once television starts to show pic- tures of women and children going hun- gry,” one official said, Aga Khan said the major concern now was with the “tens of thousands, or hun- dreds of thousands” of Asian and Arabs still expected to flee to Jordan, He said that United Nations informa- tion on the numbers involved, and on their food supplies and medical condi- tion, remained sketchy, but that with Iraq refusing an airlift out of Baghdad and Iran blocking an exodus across Iraq's eastern frontier, contingency plans were being made in Jordan to handle at least as many new arrivals as have al- ready fled here, more than 600,000, “We really don’t know what to expect,” he said, Ottawa Citizen - September 19, 1990 \f"

A U.S. soldier was slightly injured in the leg by flying shrapnel when a 105mm howitzer shell flew off course during one of the live-fire drills. Viper bite imperils GI from Fort Stewart Cooler Saudi nights bring out the snakes By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent 28TH COMBAT SUPPORT HOSPI- TAL, Saudi Arabia — A U.S. soldier was evacuated to West Germany after he was bitten by a sand viper and went into con- vulsions, doctors disclosed Wednesday. Maj. Leonardo Thompson said chan- ces are “‘gi Stewart, Ga., would recover after doctors at the tent hospital in the desert per- formed emergency surgery. The soldier’s name was not available from military officials in Saudi Arabia or Washington. The soldier, stationed in the desert with the 24th Infantry Division (Mecha- nized), was bitten twice on the big toe five days ago. The snake struck him as he was walking between tents at night wearing shower clogs, Major Thompson said. Doctors are worried that the advent of - cooler evenings might lead to more viper bites. “The weather is real cool in the eve- - ning, so the snakes are coming out,” said - a hospital’s overseer, Lt. Col. Michael “The biggest thing we are trying to do is try to prevent snakebites by not letting people walk around at night without their boots,” Major Thompson said. A second soldier, who had snakebite punctures in his left hand, also was evac- uated to West Germany, but his case was described as “minor” because the snake apparently failed to inject venom. In an unrelated event, another soldier was slightly injured in the leg by flying ”’ that the soldier from Fort ° anneal ——ooOOoOoOo OOS shrapnel when a 105mm howitzer shell flew off course during an 82nd Airborne Division training exercise Wednesday. The shell exploded 220 yards from where the soldier was standing. The epi- sode was witnessed by a dozen reporters and photographers who were standing between the point of impact and the sol- dier. The soldier was the only one. wounded. t Lieutenant Colonel Ball was asked how the giant cluster of inflated, suppos- edly air-conditioned bubbles that form ° the main U.S. Army hospital in Saudi Arabia compares to the scene known to the American public through the “M*A*S*H” television series. “I guess you are seeing the real ‘M*A*S*H’ here,” he said. “On TV that is all acting. They are going to glamorize some of the medicine that’s done, and they make fun of a lot of things. ... W: don’t have male soldiers walking around _ in skirts and things like that. This is the real Army.” The vietiant population was 48 Wednesday; the remaining 112 beds were © 4 empty. Those in the hospital had ailments varying from heat exhaustion to stomach viruses to a broken leg. All the patients, and those of the 281 hospital staffers on the day shift, were sweating because the - air conditioning was overloaded. Techni- cians said sand had blown into air in- takes, damaging some air conditioners. One patient from the 82nd Airborne, Sgt. Phillip Webb, 29, of Fayetteville, N.C., said he had been sent to the hospital _ because of blood in his urine. “They tell me it’s caused by not drink- ing enough water,” he said. “But I’ve se drinking eight or nine gallons a y.”” Two of the 48 patients were female soldiers. One — Sgt. Paula Herring, 24, of Fayetteville and the 18th Army Corps — said she was hospitalized because of a stomach virus. “My dad will be OK when he hears about this; he’s retired mili- tary,” she said. “But my mom will go into shock.” Major Thompson, a staff surgeon at Walter Reed Army Hospital serving in Saudi Arabia, said the Fort Stewart sol- dier bitten by the viper “had a tremen- dous amount of swelling as well as some systemic symptoms — nausea and vomit- ing — which went away rapidly with in- travenous fluids.” He said surgeons cut open the muscles in the foot and lower leg so they could expand beyond their nor- mal covering of tissue. “The big thing you worry about is ne- crosis, which means tissue death that is caused by the venom,” Major Thompson said. “The other thing is that the swelling can cause them to have what is called the compartment syndrome. That is where the muscle is squeezed of its blood supply _and the tissue gets starved.” Major Thompson said doctors gave the soldier an intravenous dose of anti-vi- per venom to counteract the necrosis. This was the first serious snakebite reported since the more than 150,000 U.S. soldiers began spreading out into the gulf region Aug. 8. Reporters visiting troops in the desert have been told from time to time of soldiers killing snakes and of at least one snake found inside a headquar- ters tent.

        "ocr_text": "Traq wants equal time on U.S. TV White House says it won't bar broadcast : Met nen 7 AMMAN, Jordan — Iraq asked the US. networks Thurs- day to:give President Saddam Hussein equal airtime for a vid- eotaped message to Americans, and the White House said it would not object. The Iraqi News Agency did ‘not detail contents of the video, which Saddam already has \"taped. Iraq broadcast an eight- minute videotaped talk by Presi- dent Bush on its state-run televi- sion Sunday, _ None of the major U.S. net: works reported that Iraq had ap: proached them with a formal re- quest to air the tape. Saddam’s. earlier speeches from Baghdad have been aired in the United States.on CNN. CNN said Thursday that it vis, ‘prepared to broadcast Saddam's statement in its entirety” but would make a final decision only “after making every effort to learn in advance the content and - duration of the tape.” The network’s statement add- ed that “if advance information on the tape is unavailable, CNN may review the tape prior to its broadcast, in whole or in part, to determine its content and du- ration.” In messages made public Thursday in Amman, Saddam promised that his country would _ fight U.S. forces for years if nec- essary. Another Iraqi official warned that all oil wells in the re- gion would go up in flames if war broke out. “If need be, we will fight for three, four or five or six more years,” Saddam said, recalling . _ that Iraq held out for eight years in the war against Iran that end- ed in 1988. His vow to battle long and hard was made in the Turkish newspaper Milliyet, which pub- lished an interview with Saddam conducted by Bulent Ecevit, a former Turkish prime minister. It followed by a day Mr. Bush’s promise that the United States would take “additional steps” to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait if in- ternational sanctions and peace- ful negotiations do not bring a , withdrawal. In the Turkish interview, Saddam said the embargo may © continue, but that his people “have prepared ourselves to stand this for years.” If the next step is war, he said, the Iraqi people are ready for that, too. “We know that the United States is the leading superpower in the world. But we are confi- dent that we are in a position to harm it,” he said. “We are not a people to grovel before someone who threatens us.” The Iragis want peace and will sacrifice for it, Saddam said, “but if someone wants to force us to bow, we know how to cut off their heads before we fall.” Equally strident were the words of Iraqi Information Min- ister Latif Jasim, whose com- ments to Jordanian journalists visiting Baghdad were printed Thursday in the Jordan Times newspaper. Mr. Jasim threatened to ex- pand hostilities throughout the gulf region, saying that Iraqi armed forces would destroy ev- ery oil field. And he raised the specter of chemical weapons that Iraq is accused of having used in the past, with the comment that Iraq “has the right to use all weapons under its disposal if Iraqi territo- ry is exposed to an aggression.” The airing of Saddam’s video- tape apparently will be an issue between the Baghdad govern- ment and the U.S. networks, a matter into which the White House will not intervene. “We've made it quite clear that it is not a controlled press in the United States as there is in Iraq,” said White House spokes- man Roman Popadiuk. “We have a free press. The press is avail- able to do anything it wants.” Nor would the Bush adminis- tration be likely to seek rebuttal time if Saddam’s message is aired, Mr. Popadiuk said. After Mr. Bush’s videotape was broad- cast Sunday, a government spokesman read a response that included charges that Mr. Bush had lied. The thrust of Mr. Bush’s mes- sage was that Iraq stands isolat- ed against the rest of the world and has no chance of keeping Kuwait. Meanwhile, discussions con- tinued at the United Nations on a proposal to add airline flights to the trade and financial embargo against Iraq and occupied Kuwait. In southern France, the first contingent of 4,000 additional French soldiers gathered for a sealift to the Saudi port of Yanbu to join a multinational force sent to prevent further Iraqi expan- sionism. West German tanks that detect poison gas in the air were borrowed by the United States and flown into Saudi Arabia. Egypt said it soon would have 20,000 soldiers in the region, along with additional tanks and heavy artillery. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 21, 1990 \f"

Vlahos rolled in and set up his unit next to the Air Force wing, its commander was so glad to see him that he started sending over videocas- sette movies and_ television. shows so the Army troops ‘wouldn’t get bored. The Air Force wing even gave - the Army troops some of its pre- cious air-conditioned trailers so they could sleep soundly. Why? Captain Vlahos, 30, of Dayton, Ohio, commands the only kind of unit that has much chance of knocking down an in- coming Iraqi Scud _ ballistic missile. His supersonic Patriot mis- siles are designed to destroy in- coming missiles at least 50 miles before they reach the runways used by the Air Force. The radar operators in the Patriot command center spend their work hours scanning moni- tors inside air-conditioned work spaces. Among the blips on their screens are “tracks” of any planes or missiles detected by the Air Force AWACS planes constantly circling over eastern Saudi Arabia. “We want to make sure their attention span is the best we can possibly get it to be,” Captain Vlahos said. ‘“‘That’s why we af- ford them as much rest as possi- ble, so they can do their mission, execute it’ quickly, efficiently, with a great deal of precision.” Precision means that if.a mis- sile zings in at them, they would have less’ than five minutes’ warning time, according to unof- ficial estimates.

Captain Vlahos’s syperior, — Lt. Col. Lee Neel, 42, of Houston — spoke confidently of his ability to knock out incoming planes or missiles.

They might still get a sec- S6nd opinion, but at least they are “asking.” ors Six weeks after the US. sbuildup started, the number of ‘“women serving in Saudi Arabia exceeds 3,000. They include at least 800 members of the Geor- gia-based 24th Infantry Division ~ (Mechanized), 100 Marines, 100 members of the 82nd Airborne Division, hundreds of Air Force ground personnel and hundreds of Army and Navy hospital workers. Most are living in the com- parative comfort of air-.° ndi- tioned tents. But the women of the 24th Infantry are in the de- sert full time, and are unavail- able for interviews, a division spokesman said. Saudi women are optimistic As more U.S. military person- nel stream into the kingdom, the Saudi royal family is known to be “reflecting” on the social impact of the U.S. women. So far, the Saudi military men reportedly think the sudden ap- pearance of female professionals ‘in their midst will hasten a desir- able trend toward sexual equali- ty that was inching forward in. Saudi Arabia. Some Saudi men have said privately that their young female relatives think the U.S. women are the best thing that has ever happened to their male chauvin- ist culture. One man described how one of his female relatives gleefully pointed out that Saudi men need women to protect them. Another young Saudi woman told her male relative that she was optimistic that Saudi women will be accorded the right to drive within a year or so as.a re- sult of the favorable impression left by U.S. servicewomen. Yet some effects are notice- able now. A Saudi source recounted how one citizen approached the royal governor of the Eastern Province to report something he had never seen before: a woman wearing soldier’s clothes driving a military vehicle down the highway. What was the meaning of this e behavior, the befuddled strang Saudi asked the governor, Mo- hammed bin Fahd, a Western- educated prince whose father is: King Fahd. Not to worry, the prince re- portedly told him: Seeing Ameri- can women on the roads was an inevitable result of the U.S. mili- tary presence. Female doctors might serve . One unexpected byproduct was the king’s announcement early this month that Saudi fe- - male doctors were about to be re- cruited into military service to help defend the kingdom. There was no indication of whether the female doctors will live in dormitories or remain at home. If they are moved out of their homes, it would appear to clash with centuries-old desert traditions by which unmarried Arabian women are expected to live with their mothers. Sergeant Olson is one of rela- tively few American women whose work takes them face to face with Saudi military men. But she is far from unique. Sgt. Paula Herring, 24, of Fay- etteville, N.C., drives a van that carries supplies from a head- quarters to subordinate units. Each time she wheels into a Sau- di military base, she has to show her military identification to a security guard. “One of the Saudi guys raised his hand and gave me a ‘V’ sign,” she said. “But some of them frown and look the other way.” In most units, servicewomen are under orders that they can- not strip down to their T-shirts near Saudis — a restriction that does not apply to male soldiers. Of about 20 women inter- viewed, most thought the cloth- ing restrictions were unfair. But most said they were glad to be serving in the region. Army Pfc. Amber Dietzel, 19, a radar operator on a Patriot anti-missile battery, said she finds it “exciting” — in part be- cause she’s learning something about Saudi Arabia. Only one woman interviewed — Army nurse Maj. Gail Robin- son, 37, of Bladensburg, Md. — was outspoken in complaining about being in the Saudi desert. She said she was upset by her lack of personal privacy and the outhouse-type toilets assigned to female nurses at the Army’s 28th Combat Support Hospital. “It’s terrible,” Major Robin- son said. “We have got to use out- door toilets that are right out in front of the men’s tent. They can see my head whenever I go inside.” Like many U.S. women serv- ing in Saudi Arabia, Major Rob- inson left her husband, Nathan- iel, at home to care for their chil- dren.

        "ocr_text": " Kuwaitis enjoying upscale exile Refugee families live at no cost in eras Saudi apartments By Joseph Alright Journal-Constitution correspondent DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia — Even in a potential combat zone, Saudi children have to be educated, So the royal council of ministers has decreed that schools across the kingdom will open today, That means tens of thousands of Kuwaiti refu- gees are being moved out of the Saudi boys’ and girls’ schools that have been their shelters for the past six weeks — and into high-rise luxury apart- ment buildings with white marble foyers. It was moving day Thursday for Harid, a 31- year-old Kuwaiti lawyer who has been living in a school with his extended family of nine. He and his brother loaded the black-veiled women and bounc- ing children into their 1987 Ford sedan and their 1985 GMC van. “This is very lucky for me,” he said, “We have six rooms and four air-conditioners — everything we need except a water cooler.” Qutside the apartment complex, a laborer hosed down the grass seed that will turn the front yard from sand to lawn. The school and apartments are 225 miles south of Kuwait City. That is where Harid — who de- clined to give his last name — used to live in a sprawling one-story villa. He and his family fled south in their two cars a week after Kuwait was oc- cupied Aug. 2. Harid’s brand-new apartment is on the seventh floor of a 19-story building that the Saudis built for ~ FRSTCLSS CAMP their own citizens during the 1970s oil boom. The building is part of a $530 million housing complex that has been empty for a decade because no Saudis wanted to live in vertical villas. But after six weeks living with 100 other Ku- Wwaitis in a Saudi school, Harid was relieved to get one of the 1,664 apartments in the Dammam Tow- ers — free of charge. Fifteen minutes after Harid checked in, he took a reporter up the elevator of the world’s poshest refugee camp, In his kitchen was a Kelvinator frost-free re- frigerator, an Ariston electric stove and wood-pan- eled kitchen cabinets. The three bathrooms have pastel-blue American Standard sinks, toilets and bidets. On the floor was brand-new brown carpet: ing, installed in all the apartments during the past two weeks, Harid’s apartment was devoid of furniture. He hadn’t picked up his free mat resses from the Saudi government. And he has not received the furniture that he expects to be paid for by the treasury of the exiled Kuwait government. For 10 years the 32-building Dammam Towers complex has been a symbol of excess that some- times characterized Saudi planning during the 1970s oil boom. Nobody wanted the apartments, and nobody could live in them because they weren’t air-condi- tioned, Then the flood of 200,000 Kuwaiti refugees into Saudi Arabia propelled Prince Mohammed to dust off the old plans.

        "ocr_text": "Saudi Arabia is 58, but it’s In no mood for a birthday bash By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — One would have thought that a kingdom in the vortex of a world crisis would have launched some fireworks or at least hung out a few flags to mark its 58th birthday Sunday. But no. Saudi Arabia National Day provoked no public displays of patriotism, either organized or spontaneous. It was a three-day week- end for most of the staff of the Saudi Aramco oil company. Quite a few American staffers took the opportunity to drive across the causeway to Bah- rain, a less strict Muslim country, for a good dinner and a bottle of wine. But for most of the roughly 11 million Saudis, National Day was just like any other day: They drove to the office or played with their comput- ers or tended their goats. The newspapers carried stories saying that celebra- tions of National Day would be canceled out of respect for Kuwait. The announcement puzzled old-timers, who said the Saudis didn’t do anything special to celebrate National Day last year either. “This is not like the Fourth of July,” one Saudi said. “Our National Day is mainly for the benefit of our foreign embas- sies, so they can have re- ceptions.” It was a revealing peek in- . side the perplexing culture that more than 150,000 U.S. troops have come half-way around the world to protect. The Saudis have a public persona that is open, modern and accessible to the outside world. But coexisting with the public face is an inward-look- ing, deeply Islamic culture that is difficult for those out- side the religion to fathom.. From their strict Islamic viewpoint, it makes sense that there should be no revelry on National Day. When the Koran was written more than 1,000 years ago, the holy book didn't happen to mention National Day — and so it couldn’t be a legitimate feast. In the West, holidays cele- brate a grab bag of religious, patriotic and historic events. But in a strict Islamic country, only two holidays can be cele- brated. ) The first — al Adha — marks the end of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. ' The pilgrimage, which or- dinarily attracts a million Muslims from all over the world, is due next in March . 1991, The second feast — Id al- Fitr — marks the end of Ram- adan, the month when Mus- lims refrain from eating dur- ing the day. The Id is an especially joyous festival that brings about exchanges. of ‘ feasts and visits but no animal sacrifices. Next year, it will begin about April 15. For a Saudi living in the modern world, it is a chal- lenge just to keep track of » time. The country lives by three sets of calendars, and some Saudis use specially pro- grammed pocket computers to convert dates between the three. For international business, Saudis have become accus- » tomed to the Western-style . Gregorian calendar of 365 . days a year. Some use it with » reservations, knowing it was the work of a Christian pope. For their religious life, all Saudis rely on a lunar year. containing about 354'4 days. - Each lunar month contains 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 2.8 seconds. The difference between the Islamic and Gregorian — years explains why the. Islam- : ic holidays aren’t fixed to a. certain day in the Western cal- ; endar. If that isn’t complicated enough, the National Day is - set each year by a third calen- dar, called the solar zodiacal calendar. The zodiacal calendar yields approximately the same dates as the Gregorian calendar, without having to use a calendar invented by a pope. Under the zodiacal cal- endar, National Day falls each year on the first of the month of Libra. But the Gregorian and zo- ~ diacal calendars don’t com- pletely coincide. This is why the Western history books say King Ibn Saud declared the unification of Saudi Arabia on Sept. 18, 1932, while this year the National Day celebration - fell on Sept. 23.

With its American-made M-60 tanks and its Soviet-made 120-mm artillery guns, the 15,000-member Egyptian armored unit will give a modern fighting punch to the Arab multilateral force, which up to now has been a lightly-armed “trip: wire.” \\ As the first Egyptian tanks were rolling out of the belly of an Egyp: tian freighter, an advance party of French officers was landing at the Yanbu airport to prepare for the formal arrival of 4,000 members of the French Foreign Legion within the next few days. “The French are already here, many of them,” said a Saudi port official, The Egyptians and French Le: gionnaires are expected to occupy neighboring sectors in the desert north of Hafar al-Batin, a northern Saudi trading town astride the main road from Kuwait to the Sau: di capital Riyadh. The Saudis already have several hundred of their own M-60 tanks in that sector, spread out in a line about 50 miles south of the Kuwait and Iraq borders, Once the Egyp: tian tanks begin arriving, the Sau- di northern sector commander will be make it harder for the Iraqis to pull an end run around the Saudi tank forces, The more modern American tanks of the Georgia-based 24th In: fantry Division (Mechanized) are arrayed well to the south of Hafar al-Batin.

But with all their advantages in the air, the American, Saudi and Egyptian tanks remain considera: bly outnumbered by the estimated 2,600 Iraqi tanks in Iraq and Ku: Walt.

Even when a new busload of evacuees from Kuwait and Iraq arrived on a recent midmorning, most of them were swallowed into the bowels of the camp too quickly to be heard or seen. The place is that big. It also is neat and orderly, with water stands, latrines, hos- pital tents and daily food rations practically delivered to the flap of each tent. Azraq One and Two within Jordan, run respectively by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Jordan Na- tional Red Crescent Society, are a world removed from the filthy, chaotic scene of swarming bod- ies that awaited new arrivals at the camp on the border of Jordan and Iraq that closed last week. “The only problem now for the people is to leave,” said Phi- lippe Lazzarini, the Red Cross di- rector at Azrag One. For now evacuees are depart ” ing fairly rapidly. Some stay only one night, while others must wait six days or a week. The big popu- lations of Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans normally are stalled the eS ae Pa eS VICTIMS OF CRISIS longest, because they and their countries are so poor. Jordan’s government and in- ternational agencies, caught un- prepared for the waves of people that began rolling in from Ku- wait and Iraq last month, have harnessed the flow so it not only comes into the country, but also has a way out. Usually these days the numbers of incoming and outgoing, most of whom leave on special flights to their home countries, are roughly equal. If a new rush of people is frightened into fleeing Iraq, con- ditions could deteriorate again. And harder times are inevitable in the coming six weeks or so, when the weather turns cold and rainy and thousands of people out here will be slogging through lakes of mud. As for creature comforts now, the sun burns without reprieve and fine, dry dirt swirls through the camps. Nature’s hostility keeps people mostly inside their tents, except to wash at a shower or water,standpipe. That makes the place quiet. The dry and canned food is adequate, although water some- times causes trouble. One day last week a fight broke out at the water line, and 20 people were roughed up, a relief worker said. Water pressure fails at the camp's outer reaches, said Anto- nio Rollo, so he and his two Fili- pino friends were carrying wa- ter-filled buckets the size of kitchen trash cans at least half a mile to their tent from the closest good water tap. “We have to accept it,” Mr. Rollo said. “It’s the situation.” And most of the Asians miss the rice that normally is the bulk of their diet. Bernard Broughton of CARE- Australia said that at least 10,000 tons of rice is available, but no one has been able to figure out how to cook it safely. Central kitchens for mass feeding re- quire people to stand in lines, and fights accompany lines. Mr. Broughton said his agen- cy is ready to supply thousands of individual cook stoves, but Jordanian authorities fear fires in the tents, So they await a deci- sion while 20,000 people eat dry bread and canned tuna. Though the situation is not bad, no one knows what to expect next. “It’s a political question,” said a U.N. worker who asked not to be further identified. “One ru- mor could send 50,000 people across the border.” U.N. officials are on hand in the camp trying to plan for just such contingencies, including the worst one imaginable — war.

        "ocr_text": "iraq vows revenge for sanctions| By Marcia Kunstel Joumal-Constitution correspondent AMMAN, Jordan — In an om- inous new threat, Iraq warned Sunday that it will destroy Per- sian Gulf oil fields and strike at Israel if Baghdad is “strangled” by a circle of opposition. “The oil, the areas it is in and Israel will be transformed into something different from what they are now,” said a statement issued after a joint meeting of Iraq’s ruling Revolution Com- mand Council and Baath Party leadership. “America must realize clear- ly that itis pushing the entire re- gion... in fact, even the whole word rt the er at a bot- ens 0 Of: eee? the statement ~~ Traqi President Saddam Hus- sein has threatened before to de- molish both Israel and the re- gion’s oil, but only if Iraq were attacked. This is the first time he has threatened aggression in re- action to international sanctions aimed at punishing Iraq until it withdraws from Kuwait. Iraq also announced Sunday its refusal to attend the U.N. General Assembly session that opens today because its delega- tion was not being allowed to travel to New York on Iraqi Air- ways. The airline has no landing rights due to the U:N. trade em- bargo. A State Department offi- cial said the matter is still under consideration. miset Tuesday to consider tight- ie the trade embargo against Baghdad with an air blockade. Baghdad also is expected to re- e widespread condemnation ‘General Assembly debate. é* «In an apparent effort to im- Brove relations with France, Iraq admitted that its soldiers had raided the French ambassador’s residence in Kuwait 10 days ago. It apologized for the incursion, which sparked a wave of retalia- tory expulsions and increased tensions between Iraq and Euro- pean nations. U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday that de- spite the huge deployment of troops, the United States is seek- ing non-military means of forc- ing Iraq out of Kuwait. Mr. Baker, interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” was asked about the possibility of war. “We have said many times we hoped there won’t be,” he re- plied, but added that President Bush is not ruling out any options. Also on Sunday, a charter flight carrying 111 evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait arrived in North Carolina from London. . The passengers had left Baghdad a day earlier aboard what the State Department said would be the last U.S.-chartered airlift planned from Iraq. ‘In Iran, President Hashemi Rafsanjani denounced the U.S. call for a new security arrange- ment in the region, calling it an “arrogant scheme” for foreign forces to tighten their grip on vi- tal oil resources. He spoke at a banquet for vis- iting Syrian President Hafez As- sad, who has taken the U.S. side in the dispute by sending froops to join a multinational force lined up in the gulf against his long- time foe, Saddam. Mr. Assad, who took the posi- tion that foreign troops must leave the region as soon as the crisis is resolved, was criticized’ by Iran’s press Sunday for his unexpected cooperation with the United States. Iran’s decision on observing or breaking sanctions against Iraq will be critical to the inter- national embargo, as Iran is a neighbor with easy access to Iraq. Mr. Assad ostensibly will be urging Iran on behalf of the United States to keep up sanctions. In its statement Sunday, Iraq said, “We will never allow any- body, whoever he may be, to strangle the people of Iraq with- out having himself strangled.” It accused the United States of committing “deep criminal acts” by placing troops in Saudi Arabia, the country holding the holiest shrines of the Islamic re- ' ligion, and by instigating sanc- tions against Iraq “in a way that exceeds all humanitarian lim- its.” The efforts to isolate Iraq, it said, are lower than “the law of the jungle.” The message renewed the as- sertion that the only resolution to the current crisis will encompass resolution of all the frictions de- stabilizing the region, primary among them the issue of Israel’s continued occupation of Pales- tinian and other Arab lands. The communique urged Ar- abs trying to achieve a regional solution to the crisis and not to accept a partial solution that ig- nores other outstanding issues. Jordanian officials Sunday tried to play down the deepening breach between Amman and Saudi Arabia, which is expelling diplomats of Jordan, Yemen and Iraq for engaging in ‘activities which undermined the security of the kingdom and its safety.” Officials in Amman said they have: had no formal notification that their diplomats are being ex- pelled for spying. Jordan has been critical of foreign troops in the region, and its news media and public have condemned the Saudis for letting them in. In Washington, the world’s seven leading industrial nations tried Sunday to present a unified front against the threat that the Persian Gulf turmoil could plunge the world into a reces- sion, but signs of discord emerged from the private dis- cussions. Finance ministers from Brit- ain, West Germany and France stressed the need for vigor in fighting inflation. But the United States, represented by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, continued to assert that lower in- terest rates are needed to ward off a recession. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 24, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Where the Army goes, IMIASH is sure to follow Surgeons know thev can’t save evervone By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent STH ARMY HOSPITAL, Saudi Arabia — Two months ago, nobody dreamed that a family doctor like Col. Ken Steinweg would be over here talking about how to “triage” Americans — dividing those with achance to live from those on their way to Arlington National Cemetery. Ifyou want to get revved up for war, go to an Air Force base and let them tell you about how many Iraqi tanks they could knock out with their pinpoint-accurate missiles, But if you want a place that makes you think that starting a war is not such a neat idea after all, visit a Mobile Army Surgi- cal Hospital, or MASH. “The casualties will come in groups of four, either by ambulances or by Medivac helicopter,” Colonel Steinweg said. “The surgeon stands among them and looks at their wounds and sorts them out.” That surgeon is the MASH’s triage of- ficer, and he is backed up by two teams of enlisted soldiers who are litter bearers. Colonel eee said the sg wil patient and assign him a category. “Good signs are when they are talking to you and saying, ‘My leg hurts,’” said Colonel Steinweg, 41, of Fayetteville, N.C. “But the guy who is lying there not paying any attention to you, or is out of it, is prob- ably in shock or dead, You can quickly as- sess visually the categories.” There is a category called “expec- tant,” but it doesn’t mean the patient ex- pects to get better. It means the triage of: ficer expects the soldier to die. Once the “expectants” are culled out, the MASH devotes its resources to treat: ing the most seriously injured first, A soldier who is in shock with a bullet in the abdomen will be called an “immedi- ate.” The triage officer will write that word on a piece of paper hanging around the patient's neck, Then litter bearers will haul the patient into a tent to prepare him or her for surgery. Those who are less seriously wounded — perhaps with a bullet through the leg and no loss of blood pressure — will be put into the “delayed” category. They will be loaded into the MASH’s “delayed” ward and given pain-killing drugs until the surgeons have finished with the “im mediates,” The least serious cases are called the “minimals.” They may get a Purple Heart and a ticket home, but they will have to wait a while before they get sewed up. The Sth MASH practiced all this long before it left Fort Bragg, N.C., and flew to Saudi Arabia about 10 days ago. In fact, the Army issued a Halloween-like prac- tice kit that allows the staff to apply bits of plastic to simulate injuries on make-be- lieve patients, One surgeon, Maj. Arthur Dalton, 33, of Hampton, Ga., said the MASH is better equipped to handle combat injuries than were MASH units in the Vietnam War, The tents have better temperature con- trols, and that should mean better sani- tary conditions for conducting medicine, _ the other hand, he said, most ofthe injuries are like, even though they have gone through every advanced trauma course the Army has to offer. The 5th MASH is one of the smaller of the fully staffed and equipped combat hospitals the military has rushed to this region in the last six weeks. There is a 50- bed Air Force hospital a 10-minute drive away. Another 200-bed Army hospital is half an hour's drive beyond that, Up the highway is a 500-bed Navy hospital, And. offshore in the Persian Gulf are two Navy 1,000-bed hospital ships, the Mercy and the Comfort. For the moment, only one-tenth of the Sth MASH’s 60 beds are filled. The pa- tients attended by the 16 doctors and 32 nurses range from a male soldier diag- nosed with psychiatric problems to a fe- male soldier with an ovarian cyst. The doctors let journalists talk to one patient, Pfc, Reg Dallaire, 19, of Allegany, NY, “Got the Saudi blues,” said Private Dallaire, an Army helicopter mechanic, “I got diarrhea, cramps and I can't keep anything down. When you don’t have any water in you, the heat will just dry you out like a piece of beef jerky.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 25, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Army to take Gls off $4-a-gallon bottled water By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau SAUDI ARABIA — The Army disclosed Monday that it has decid- ed to “wean” most troops from the pleasant-tasting Saudi bottled wa- ter before Thanksgiving. “There is an extreme cost in- volved with bottled water,” said the Army’s chief water expert, Capt. William Robert Stanley, 28, of St. Louis. “It costs about $4 a gallon. It is more expensive than gasoline in the States.” Besides the cost, the Army wants to avoid having to truck thousands of bottles of water every day to forward positions — some- thing the Army has never underta- ken on a large scale before. The logistics of distributing the sweet-tasting bottled Water to the troops was simpler a month ago, when there were fewer troops liv- ing deep in the desert. For most soldiers, the Saudi bottled water has become the hap- piest surprise about living in Saudi Arabia. “To us, this is champagne,” as one Marine said several weeks ago. The Saudi bottled water tastes better than Army-made water be- cause it is lower in salt content and because the Saudi bottling plants don’t put in as high a proportion of chlorine as the Army requires. In addition, the American Army’s de- salination equipment leaves the water with a rubbery aftertaste. Commanders are supposed to discourage their soldiers from add- ing Gatorade or other sweet drinks to kill the taste of Army-produced water. The reason, Stanley said, is that the sweetener from the drinks can stick in canteens and grow disease-causing bacteria, he said. The Army’s water chief said the military is shipping in extra water desalinization units and water chillers so it can become “more self-sufficient” in making water for the troops by Thanksgiving. Fach soldier is under orders to drink at least 4 gallons of water every day to avoid dehydration. Supplying the more than 150,000 U.S. troops in and around Saudi Arabia with Saudi bottled water would cost someone $2.4 mil- lion a day, judging by Stanley’s cost figures. Making drinkable water from the briny water of the Persian Gulf is much cheaper, Stanley says. To do that, the Army is operat- ing two big water purification ma- chines in a central site along the coastline plus 20 miniplants to de- salinate water for individual units. Another reason for moving off bottled water is troops are moving farther out into the desert, in some cases to positions many miles from paved roads, he said. To help address this, the Army is beginning to iay flexible pipes to pump its desalinated water across the desert. In an interview a month ago, American logistics chief Gen. Wil- liam Pagonis said the Saudi gov- ernment was paying for more than half of the water then drunk by the U.S. troops. The U.S. taxpayers were paying for the rest. Stanley — whose unofficial title is ‘“Cinc-Water” of the Army field units in Saudi Arabia — said he doesn’t know who is footing the bill for the bottled water these days.

        "ocr_text": " Syria, Iran say Iraq must leave Kuwait By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondent AMMAN, Jordan — The pres- idents of Syria and Iran, after four days of meetings in Tehran, said Tuesday that they agree Iraq must withdraw its forces from Kuwait. But there were signs that Iran is resisting ap- _ peals to strictly observe the trade embargo against Iraq. “We are in full agreement that the aggression [against Ku- wait] must be eliminated and the foreign presence must be elimi- nated,” said Syrian President Hafez Assad. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said he and Mr. As- sad had discussed all issues and had settled on a course of action for a number of possible scenari- os in the Persian Gulf crisis. “Whether the situation in the region remains the same, or Iraq is devastated, or the anti-Iraq front is weakened, or war breaks out or Israel intervenes — we have common positions on what to do in each case,”’ Mr. Rafsan- jani said. - There were indications, how- ever, that agreement may not have been total. Without explanation, Mr. As- sad extended by an extra day his planned three-day visit, the first to Iran since before the 1979 Is- lamic Revolution. There were reports from Tehran that the Syrian leader needs more time to present his argument that Iran should withhold from Iraq ship- ments of food and medicine, which some Iranian leaders have said must be permitted on a hu- manitarian basis. +, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 26, 1990 “We are in full agreement that the aggression... and the foreign presence must be eliminated.” -Hafez Assad Even if Iran supplies some food shipments to Iraq, it report- edly has decided not to take the more important step of purchas- ing Iraqi oil or helping Iraq to sell it elsewhere. Although both leaders agreed that foreign military troops building up in the region should. be withdrawn, they earlier dis- agreed on the timing. Mr. Raf- sanjani said the troops must leave right away, while Mr. As- sad maintained that the multina- tionai force should stay until Iraq pulls its troops out of Kuwait. “It was the attack on Kuwait that led to the presence of for- eign forces,” Mr. Assad said Tuesday. ““We should realize who has brought whom, otherwise we would not be realistic.”’ The Syrians have sent troops to join the forces lined up against Iraq, teaming Syria with West- ern interests for the first time in decades. There was no comment from the leaders on the subject of 13 - Western hostages held by pro- Iranian groups in Lebanon. The hostages’ fate was thought to be one of the subjects discussed in : their meetings. « \f"

        "ocr_text": " Terrorist peril real to Marines MARINE HEADQUAR- TERS, Saudi Arabia — “I think he would be a pretty foolish ter- rorist to take us on, it’s my per- sonal opinion,” said Marine Chief Warrant Officer Charles Rowe, who might have died when 241 other Marines were killed in the truck bombing of a barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. “And again, as a personal opinion, I wouldn’t mind evening the score.” Seven years ago, Warrant Of- ficer Rowe lost six close friends and 50 foxhole acquaintances when the suicide Beirut truck bomber pierced the security of the last Marine headquarters in | the Middle East. Never again: That is a thought that transfixes Warrant Officer Rowe and thousands of other Marines in Saudi Arabia. Every branch of the military worries about security. To the Marines, anti-terrorist protec- tion in Saudi Arabia has become a consuming passion. Atlanta Journal-Constitution ‘NEVER AGAIN’ The Marine in charge of headquarters security, Lt. Col. Tom Hayden, said Tuesday that the threat of a terrorist attack outweighs the threat of a cross- _ border Iraqi invasion. “I don’t think we have any- thing to worry about right now from Saddam Hussein,” said Lieutenant Colonel Hayden, 48, of Camp Pendleton, Calif. “Right ~ now we are worried about. . . the same type of people who have been trying to blow up. Ameri- cans for the last 10 years.” He listed Palestinians, Irani- ans and unspecified others as having potential motives for at- tacking American installations. He confirmed that about two weeks ago, many U.S. units went on the highest state of alert after American intelligence heard that a terrorist attack might be immi- nent. About three days later, the alert was canceled and the Ma- rines returned to their normal state of vigilance. To a casual visitor, the Ma- rine headquarters in Saudi Ara- bia doesn’t look like a fortress. The rows of electrified’ barbed-wire fences that charac- terize security installations in the United States are nowhere in sight. If an outsider managed to drive into the headquarters, he would see a lot of khaki tents scattered around a parking lot and some Marines ambling September 26, 1990 In addition to keeping the Marines from concentrating in one building, Lieutenant Colonel Hayden hinted that he is using sleight of hand to convey the im- pression to potential terrorists that the Marines actually are staying somewhere else. “We have some deception go- ing on so they may think some- thing is important and it may not be,” he said. From the outside, no one could know a tent or low building is the office of Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. As Lieutenant Colonel Hay- den was talking to journalists in the parking lot of a major Saudi port, he kept his eye on a red and white garbage truck that ap- peared to be taking on plastic bags from a Marine dumpster. “See that truck over there?” he said. “If that vehicle would turn and start to go any place else, there would be a lot of peo- ple trying to stop it.” Warrant Officer Rowe was more emphatic, “To reach any significant target, he would have to go through a gauntlet of fire.” Warrant Officer Rowe nar- rowly missed being killed by the last truck bomber. In 1983, he slept for three months in the sev- en-story administration building at Beirut Airport that served as.a barracks and headquarters for the Marine peace-keeping force there. ul He was rotated out of Leba- non a day before one of the most infamous events in Marine Corps history — the Oct. 23, 1983, truck bombing that killed 241 N \f"

Marines in desert are told to expect a long deployment General says morale will be no problem By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — The commandant of the U.S. Ma- rines told his troops Wednesday they better get used to the Saudi desert, because they might have to stay in it for six months or longer. “There will be no morale problems in the 1st Marine Ex- peditionary Force because I say there will be morale,” Gen. Al- fred M. Gray Jr. told a group of Marines through a_bullhorn. “There also will be no boredom.” General Gray, a four-star member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, clearly was intent on fore- stalling the kind of televised griping that greeted the top American commander, Army Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, when he toured Air Force and Army units Sept. 14. The Marines who gathered to hear General Gray at Landing Zone Foss in northern Saudi Ara- bia obliged him. The most serious complaint heard by a pool of journalists came from a. communications sergeant who ‘said the extreme heat was cutting the life of his ra- dio batteries. In a 45-minute pep talk to the Marines, General Gray said their quick deployment probably had saved Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, a tract that contains 25 percent of the world’s oil reserves. “T believe that Saddam Hus- sein and the Iraqi military fully intended to invade this region of Saudi Arabia.

A 24- hour sentinel guarded his hotel room. Caution is even more advis- able now, since a caustic war of words last week slashed deep new wounds in the once firm re- lations between Jordan and Sau- di Arabia. As the leaders of opposing Arab camps in the Persian Gulf crisis, Jordanians and Saudis are laying the groundwork for long- term regional enmity and even instability with their increasing- ly corrosive exchanges. The immediate effect of these jabs and counterpunches, which have deteriorated into personal insults, may be better gauged in. Amman on Monday. It is a holi- day celebrating the birth of the Islamic prophet Mohammed and will include rallies, speeches and parades. High emotionalism and mili- tancy threading through the day’s events may signal trouble to come, while a more controlled, - less political celebration will in- dicate the government’s desire to leave a few bridges standing. The religious holiday is a likely occasion for hot rhetoric, because the bitterest complaints in Amman target the Saudis’ willingness to let non-Muslim foreigners — led by U.S. troops — congregate near Islam’s holi- est shrines. Although most of Saudi Arabia has never been off- limits to non-believers, the cities of Mecca and Medina are open only to Muslims. : The religiously conservative Saudis are considered “custodi- ans” of the holy places, and ques- tioning their stewardship is a grave affront. “It’s a religious issue, - and the Saudi government is afraid of that. Ties wake Giey gathered the leaders, to have them say it’s all right to have Americans there.” Asad Hamzeh A Jordanian on the street “It’s a religious issue, and the Saudi government is afraid of that,” Asad Hamzeh, 26, said out- side Amman’s blue-domed cen- terpiece mosque as he left noon prayers Friday, the Islamic sabbath. “That’s why they gathered the religious leaders, to have them say it’s all right to have Americans there,” said Mr. Hamzeh, referring to a meeting in Saudi Arabia at which reli- gious scholars endorsed the presence of foreign troops for de- fensive reasons. “In Jordan they don’t tell peo- ple what to say like that,” Mr. Hamzeh added. Belittling statements from the general population come as no surprise after the hard charges leveled across the bor- der last week by Saudi and Jor- danian leaders. The crescendo of insults started rising two weeks ago, at a m in Amman of Arab na- tionalists who decried the Sau- dis, Americans and others taking uncompromising stand against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein by demanding that he unconditionally withdraw his troops from Kuwait. They also: called for the overthrow of Per- sian Gulf leaders aligned with the United States. Within days, the Saudis cut ' As the war of words heats up in the Middle East, U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia blow off some steam with off oil shipments to Jordan, claiming the sudden shutdown was based on Amman ’s failure to pay past bills. Then the Saudi government expelled a group of Jordanian, Yemeni and Iraqi diplomats on charges they had been spying for Iraq. Jordan re- called its ambassador to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, last week. “The stands which the Saudis have taken against Jordan ... will not benefit or help them or ' change the huge danger really happening on the ground,” the Arabic newspaper Al-Ra’i edito- a in Amman on Wednes- ycHistory will never forgive them,” the paper said. Even more bruising, personal invective appeared last week. . Aletter to the editors of ma- jor East Coast newspapers from the Saudi ambassador to Wash- ington, Prince Bandar bin Sul- tan, held Jordan’s King Hussein responsible for the loss of anoth- er Islamic religious site, Jerusa- lem, in the 1967 war with Israel. “Is that the kind of protection that you want us to give to the holy places in Saudi Arabia?” the ambassador asked. : That war was fought not just by Jordan, but also by Egypt and Syria, all of which lost territory after Israel initiated what it called a pre-emptive assault. Prince Bandar hurled insults, questioning King Hussein’s com- mitment to the Palestinians and the very legitimacy of Jordan as a state. The Press a game of football. noe ay ee Day ew likely will bring more caustic rhetoric. The responding attack came in an article by a Jordanian writ- er and Information Ministry offi- cial, Khaled Mahadeen, who ac- cused Prince Bandar of “turning into an employee for the U.S. State Department implementing all of its demands, even if that in- volved’ the destruction of the Arab and Muslim role of Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islamic shrines.” The “petty Saudi princes,” he said, abandoned the quiet diplo- macy of their elders and rushed to American protectors who promised them continued rule of Saudi Arabia and “a more luxuri- ous life of leisure and pleasure,” Mr. Mahadeen c’ f How long the bitterness will linger from such deprecations depends largely on how the gulf crisis is resolved — peacefully or by war — and when. In the short run, Jordan al- ready is suffering from the cleav- age with the country that had been its greatest benefactor. Saudi Arabia had been giving Jordan $360 million a year in outright aid, dropping back only last year to ‘$200 million. So far this year, it had paid $100 million as part of a 1990 aid package that is hardly likely to be completed without some dramatic, unex- pected reconciliation. Danger also exists that sim- mering bad feelings could erupt in personal acts of violence, even if the governments paper over their differences. Grumbling talk of coups and assassinations cannot be ignored in this volatile part of the world. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 30, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Irag holds talks with Jordan, denies it will starve foreigners By Marcia Kunstel Joumal-Constitution correspondent AMMAN, Jordan — With world pressure bearing down harder upon Iraq, the Iraqi for- eign minister made a brief sur- prise visit to Amman Saturday to meet with Jordan’s’ King Hussein. — At the same time, Baghdad tried to soften its image by back- ing off from threats that foreign- ers in Iraq would be denied food- rationing cards that will be nec- essary after Monday to obtain basic foodstuffs. Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz arrived in Amman around noon and stayed only a few hours, just long enough to deliver a message from Iragi President Saddam Hussein, officials in Amman said. There were no details re- leased on the talks between Mr. Aziz and the king, who has been heading efforts to reach a com- promise on the Persian Gulf cri- sis sparked when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Mr. Aziz reportedly carried a response to the leaders of Jor- dan, Morocco and Algeria, who held a summit in Rabat, Moroc- co, earlier this month. They are reported to have asked Saddam for a written assurance that he would withdraw troops from Ku- wait, an assurance that the Arab leaders could use as the basis for broadening peace talks. There was speculation that Mr. Aziz also may have dis- cussed the increasing pressure on Jordan to join other nations in tightening U.N. sanctions against Irag. Jordan has allowed a trick- le of goods to continue into Iraq. Mr. Aziz’s visit was his first since August and follows Fri- day’s meeting in New York be- tween Crown Prince Hassan, who is King Hussein’s brother, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Edward A. Shevard- nadze. The two diplomats report- edly pressured Jordan for great- er compliance with U.N. sanctions. Mr. Shevardnadze, in com- ments on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press” program that was taped Saturday for today, said Soviet ogps would partigipate in mili- ca iat The Associated Press U.S. airmen huddle over cards during a game Saturday at an air base in Saudi Arabia. Playing cards is a popular break from the daily routine for Air tary action against Iraq if such action was authorized by the United Nations. The new tack on food for non- Arab foreigners in Iraq came ina. statement by Iraqi Trade and Fi- nance Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, who said the new rationing program would assure that food is available “‘for Iraqis, Arabs, diplomatic missions, for- eigners working in Iraq and all those who arrived as guests of Iraq without any preferential _ treatment for any group.” “There are no instructions whatsoever to deprive any for- eign nationals of the right to ben- efit from the ration card system, as claimed by some hostile and suspicious media reports within the context of their rabid cam- paign against Iraq,” Mr. Saleh said in a statement to the Iraqi News Agency. Last week, Iraqi officials an- nounced they were expanding the rationing program to cover rice, flour, sugar, tea and cook- ing oil, and said in a private memorandum to diplomats that most foreigners would not be eli- gible to receive rationing cards. Only citizens of Arab nations were to be allowed to purchase the rationed items. The move Force support personnel stationed at air bases in the gulf region. provoked an outcry of protest from around the world, including a warning by White House na- tional security adviser Brent Scowcroft on Friday that it would be an act of aggression. Developments Saturday came after a week of increasing pressure on Iraq. The U.N. Secu- rity Council voted to impose an air embargo to keep supplies banned by trade sanctions from reaching Iraq. And several world leaders said at the opening of the U.N. General Assembly and else- where that military action may be necessary to force Iraq to withdraw, from Kuwait and allow reinstatement of the Kuwaiti leaders who fled in the invasion. The movement of anti-Iraq troops continued Saturday, with Britain announcing that it had begun the deployment of up to 9,000 ground forces to Saudi Ara- bia. And The Observer newspa- per reported today that British forces will retaliate with battle- field nuclear weapons if Iraqi troops attack them with poison gas.

        "ocr_text": "A soldier In the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division sights a 60mm light mortar Friday during exercises near By Joseph Albright Cox News Service AREA GEORGE, Saudi Arabia — Eight weeks after the invasion of Kuwait, the soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division have handed off their defensive assignments to ar- mored Marine units and are prac- ticing offensive maneuvers. Back on Aug. 23, the lightly armed 82nd Airborne rolled out in the desert for its first large-scale exercise in Saudi Arabia. Back then, the United States had hardly any tanks there, and it would have been up to the 82nd to whittle down an Iraqi tank column if it came thundering south toward Dhahran Air Base. If an Iraqi in a T-72 lumbered within a few hundred yards, Air- borne troops were supposed to pop up from behind sand dunes and fire shoulder-mounted antitank missiles. Meanwhile, other Air- borne troops in desert buggies were prepared to kick in with TOW antitank missiles. Things were different Wednes- day as the 82nd Airborne went through its latest field exercise. This time, it was practicing of- fensive infantry tactics. Shooting live ammunition from M-60 ma- chine guns and M-16 rifles, the Airborne troops were practicing how to capture a sandbagged Iraqi machine-gun nest and keep mov- ing forward, Area George is a rolling patch of desert that the Saudis have turned over to the U.S. Army as a live-fire practice range. The assignment for the Airborne of Charlie Company was to advance half a mile in day- light and capture a lightly sand- bagged bunker that concealed an enemy machine gunner. Each of the nine men in an as- sault team has an assignment. One member, a staff sergeant, is a kind of quarterback in that he can “check off” and call a new tactic if the enemy pulls an unexpected defense. Pfc. Rowdy Inman, 21, a gre- nade launcher operator from Cor- pus Christi, says the desert exercises are “not all that \"AP the Saudi Arabian-Kuwaiti border. Troops fired live am- munition and practiced offensive infantry tactics. 82nd Airborne Division switches from defensive to offensive moves glorified.” But he likes these exercises bet- ter than others he’s been a part of. “A lot of time we do stuff and we don’t know why we are doing it,” said Inman, whose parents live in Round Rock. One night last week, Inman and other soldiers in his unit donned 80-pound packs and set off to prac- tice offensive raids and ambushes. They would hike silently for about five miles, then launch a mock assault on a patch of desert their officers had designated as an Iraqi bunker. When they “took” the first tar- get, the unit moved on and cap- tured another spot and another until they had walked more than 15 miles through the soft sand. The hardest part, they found, was spotting the crest of a sand dune under a moonless sky. “Sometimes we’d hit these drop- offs and you would roll right down for 50 feet like a sand ball,” said Inman.

        "ocr_text": "Stay out of crisis, Saudis warn Israel By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondents DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia, worried about an expanding theater of conflict, warned Israel on Sunday that it “must stay far away” from the Iraq crisis. Prince Sultan, the Saudi defense minister, told report- ers, “We will not allow Israel, regardless of how severe in- ter-Arab conflicts are, to de- fend us against Iraq or against anybody else. Let it be very well-known and let it be very well-understood.” Meanwhile, in Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hus- sein said Sunday that he wants an early dialogue to end the Persian Gulf confrontation, but he indicated no clear will- ingness to compromise. “We have to encourage any behavior by foreigners, including those who have be- come involved in the naval buildup [in the gulf], to pull back, while not bargaining over our aims and principles,” Saddam said in a milder speech than usual, which broke little new ground either in invective or concessions. > An American joins the Foreign Legion > Bush will address a newly potent U.N. AQ “Ag In his comments to report- ers, Prince Sultan, 66, who is second in line to succeed his brother King Fahd to the throne, appeared worried that some act by Israel might cut off the possibility that the gulf crisis still can be resolved without war. He answered questions at an air base in what the Saudis call the Emp- ty Quarter, an uninhabited de- sert 750 miles southwest of Dhahran. “Israel must stay far away totally from the gulf problem, mainly because Israel didn’t have much weight in adopting the [resolutions] of the Securi- ty Council,” he said. That remark is likely to grate on Israelis’ nerves, be- cause Israel has had to keep many of its views on Iraq in check out of deference to the Bush administration. The American view has been that any visible Israeli involve- ment would tend to splinter the U.S.-led coalition. Asked under what circum- stances a war might start, Prince Sultan replied, “Maybe the mili- tary can give a better evaluation, but when the doors for peace are closed, the ghosts of war will start appearing.” When pressed on whether Saddam has given any sign of withdrawing from Kuwait, Prince Sultan replied, “He put 1 million soldiers in Iran and then withdrew. It wouldn’t matter for him to withdraw from Kuwait. The distance is short, as a solu- tion to this problem.” As the defense minister was calling on Israel to stay out of the conflict, U.S. forces took another; step to prepare for battle. A U.S. military spokesman announced Sunday that Marines aboard 18 U.S. warships in the northern Arabian Sea had begun a week- long amphibious landing ex- ercise. The practice landing, pre- sumably in the friendly Arab state of Oman, was described as a routine training maneuver by elements of the 4th Marine Expe- ditionary Brigade, based in Nor- folk, Va. In Baghdad, Saddam spoke on the occasion of the birthday of the prophet Mohammed, the founder of Islam. He repeated his government's earlier expres- sion of interest in a plan broadly outlined last week by French President Francois Mitterrand. Saddam said Iraq was trying te get clarification of the plan, which calls for assurances from Iraq that it will withdraw forces that seized Kuwait on Aug. 2, as- surances that foreign troops will withdraw from the region, and steps toward resolving other re- gional problems such as Lebanon and the 23-year Israeli occupa-, tion of Arab lands. “Despite our objections [to elements of it], we see the French president’s address as different in its language from others,” Saddam said. “We hope that our positive conclusion is correct.” He held largely to positions taken earlier — for example, in calling for a jihad, or holy war, to remove foreign troops from the region, in demanding that out- side forces be withdrawn com- pletely, and in insisting that the international community end. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq. One new element was a repri- mand of Arab leaders seeking a compromise that would be seen as an “Arab solution” rather than one imposed by outsiders. “These mediations, even if well-intentioned, take a position in between wrong and right. ... An Arab solution cannot be achieved in the shadow of for- eign forces and threats,” Saddam said, In Amman, the head of Jor- dan’s Evacuee Welfare Commit- tee warned of coming troubles in caring for evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait. Salameh Hammad said he might be forced to ask the gov- ernment to limit admission of evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait if the numbers building in Jor- dan are not otherwise stemmed. The number inside Jordan had held at 33,000 for the past few weeks, but iA recent days it has erawn tn 42000 he said Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 1, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Men, women mix it up during R&R in desert By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent IN SAUDI ARABIA — R&R, Saudi style, began for American troops on Sunday with a munch of hamburgers and a splash in the pool inside a secret desert compound. . “There is American music, it can blast, it’s in the middle . of nowhere,” said Army Maj. Gen. William G. Pagonis, who greeted the first 500 soldiers on the opening day of the un- named recreation center. He said that over the next four months, all front-line Army troops should get their turn for a day trip to this Stealth recreationland. After their 12 hours of so-called “lax time,” the troops are sup- posed to file onto their buses and return to their tanks and . foxholes. There will be no overnight stays. They will find no Saigon bar girls in slinky dresses, no Manila tattoo parlors and no booze. Even beer is forbidden in compliance with Saudi law. But the troops will find bowling alleys, non-stop mov- ies, tennis courts, an Olympic- size outdoor swimming pool and a place where they can eat free fast food and ice cream. There will also be chaplains mingling with the troops, as well as a medical and dental clinic. In coming weeks, male and female soldiers will be attend- ing the recreation center on the same days, General Pa- gonis said. They will be able to swim in the same pool and go to the movies together, just like back home. ' “Females can wear Ameri- can-size bathing suits,” Gen- eral Pagonis said. But if they want to buy a ba suit for the day, they won’t find bikinis. ‘‘The bath- ing suits being sold there are very conservative,” he noted. General Pagonis, the depu- ty commander for logistics in Saudi Arabia, said he asked troops from the first batch of buses what they wanted most. Their typical reply: ‘I don’t want steak. I want ham- burgers, hot dogs, french fries and ice cream.” General Pagonis said the military is not planning to throw open the doors to full media coverage for two rea- sons. One is the fear of expos- ing the troops to a terrorist threat. The second is the fear of offending sensibilities in the puritanical Saudi society, which believes women should be veiled and segregated. “You have to be careful in how you cover it in the press,”’ he said. “I don’t need the Sau- di religious leaders thinking somebody has sold them out.” General Pagonis put the recreation center into action about 72 hours after an enlist- ed soldier reported to his su- perior that he had seen a Sau- di recreation facility that looked tempting. The word rocketed up through channels to General Pagonis, who was already un- der orders from Gen. H. Nor- man Schwarzkopf, command- er of the American forces in the gulf region, to work out an R&R plan, pronto. General Pagonis sent con- tracting officers to persuade the institution owning the compound to rent it out three days a week for the exclusive use of the American troops. The other three days it will be used by Saudis. General Pagonis said the U.S. government got a “super good”’ price for the center and that he hopes to extend the contract so troops can use the place five days a week. He has two other objec- tives: to add pizza to the menu in the dining room and to in- stall 10 to 20 telephones so sol- diers cancallhome. | Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 2, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Saddam orders 9 French captives freed in Baghdad By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondent AMMAN, Jordan — Iraqi President Saddam Hussein or- dered the release Monday of nine French hostages in an apparent effort to curry favor with France and weaken the wall of interna- tional opposition to Iraq. Also on Monday, a group of Islamic leaders completing a peace-seeking tour through the region reported in Amman that they believe peace can prevail if it is given enough time, but that war will be more serious than anyone envisions if it breaks out. The nine French hostages were held by Iraq as part of a “human shield” of hundreds of foreigners whose presence might deter attacks on its strategic mil- itary and energy installations. They will be turned over to mem- bers of a Franco-Iraqi friendship delegation now visiting Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, according to the Iraqi News Agency (INA). Saddam ordered the French ’ releases as ‘‘a humanitarian ges- ture,” INA said. The sudden be- nevolence appeared linked to a peace initiative offered last week by French President Francois Mitterrand. Saddam, who quickly warmed to portions of the plan, said Sunday .that he was seeking clarification. However, a French government spokesman said there had been no direct contact between Baghdad and Paris, and no movement that could be de- scribed as negotiations. And French officials said the releases would change nothing, since Iraq must set free all for- eign nationals without condition. Mr. Mitterrand’s proposal before the U.N. General Assem- an) a OME) eR ment to withdraw the troops which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, international guarantees to with- draw foreign forces deployed in the gulf against Iraq, and efforts to resolve a range of longstand- ing and contentious Middle East issues, including Israel’s occupa- tion of Arab lands. In Paris, Mr. Mitterrand’s plan was deplored by several newspapers as a Capitulation that would make concessions to Iraq on the basis of mere promises to pull out of Kuwait. While the gov- ernment said the interpretation was a misreading of the plan — in which an actual Iraqi with- drawal is necessary — Saddam may have been encouraged to make an overture to France on the basis of a similar interpre- tation. ' Saddam’s move to release the French hostages also followed recent comments by a high French official who suggested the world was overreacting to Saddam, whom he described as no worse than some other strong- men in the region. Reports out of Baghdad said diplomats there interpreted the hostage release as an effort to dislodge France from the anti- Iraq camp. : France had been the Europe- an nation with the closest eco- nomic and diplomatic ties to Iraq before the invasion and annex- ation of Kuwait. Now, France has pledged 13,000 troops to the mul- tinational force lined up against Iraq in Saudi Arabia, and it has been a firm supporter of U.N. Se- curity Council resolutions con- demning the invasion and impos- ing sanctions against Iraq. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 2, 1990 \f"

Mr. Ramadan, who is considered a step beneath President Saddam Hus- sein in Iraq’s official hierarchy, focused more in a news conference on the need to open a dialogue than on demands that U.S, and other foreign troops be with- drawn from Saudi Arabia before any talks can begin. A spokesman for Mr. Kaifu, howev- er, said the two leaders found no points of agreement in their two-hour meeting and that Mr. Ramadan insisted that for- eign troops must leave before any settle- ment could be reached. Nearly 1,900 Americans, mostly women and children, were permitted to fly out of Iraq and Kuwait last month on nine charter flights. The flights were stopped Sept. 22 because, the State De- partment said at the time, all those Americans who had received permission from the Iraqis to leave had done so. A State Department official said late Thursday that since Sept. 22 an unspeci- fied number of the roughly 900 Ameri-: cans remaining in Kuwait and Iraq have indicated they want to leave. The total consists ‘of at least 600 in occupied Ku- wait and at least 300 in Iraq, the depart- ment has said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia was quoted as saying after a meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand that he does not believe economic sanc- tions will force Iraq to retreat from its occupation of Kuwait but that sanctions and political efforts nonetheless must continue. Also on Thursday, the aircraft carri- er Independence left the Persian Gulf two days after entering the waterway. Military experts had said the carrier was vulnerable to attack.

The new placards feature Iraqi President Sad- dam Hussein — new nemesis to Americans, new hero to Jordanians, “I believe he has become the Arab symbol,” said Fuad Afghani, who sells Saddam buttons in his downtown souvenir shop. “For a long time we had no strongman, People here, they have a belief in him.” ‘ There certainly is reason to believe Saddam is a strongman. First he threatened to pelt Israel with chemical weapons, then he steamrolled his army through Kuwait, and now he stands unflinching against a multinational force across the border in Saudi Arabia, Boys who normally sell newspapers now hawk Saddam posters at busy intersections, They do a fairly brisk business as they weave around cars stopped at red lights, The boys ask two dinars (about §3) per poster, but the frugal shopper can find a bigger variety at half the price downtown, where samples are strung along a fence across from Amman’s oldest mosque, Some of the posters show Saddam next to Jor: dan’s King Hussein, The two sometimes are dressed in uniform, all green khaki and smart black berets, sometimes in Western business dress and sometimes in traditional Arab headdress, One of the most intriguing images appears on the doors of the Iraqi Embassy. It is a full-igure shot of King Hussein and Saddam, both smiling and Clasping an automatic rifle as though one is pre: senting it to the other, ft mad e = S we 4 Ew = 2 Fe 7 Youssef Alla Saddam Hussein (bottom left), PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat (center) and Jordan's King Hussein. But itis impossible to guess who is doing what, and the question daily is a source of speculation among sweating crowds who wait outside the em- bassy, usually in quest of a visa that will let them into Iraq, The poster seems to carry the message that, if need be, these men will stand or fall together be- hind the gun, And that is perfectly fine with the Jordanians, The majority of the people in Jordan are Pales» tinians, who still resent the loss of their land to Is- rael in the 1948 war and the loss of their rights to Israel in 1967, when Israel captured Arab land it still occupies, without giving the Palestinians any political voice, The people here, who share a long border with the Israeli-occupied land, cannot understand why the United States is willing to go to war to get Iraq ut of Kuwait but has done nothing to get Israel o opulace of Arab territory. Saddam, who champions the Palestinian cause, has assumed heroic proportions, “There is much anger in the Arab world, Twen- ty year’s ago you told us Nasser was Hitler, Now you tell us Saddam is Hitler,” said a Jordanian of Pales- tinian background who gave his name only as Mo- hammed, Mohammed made the often-cited comparison of Saddam to the late Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, Nasser was the voice of Arab nationalism in the 1960s, He was the young soldier who overturned a soft and corrupt regime, the flint that sparked two war's with Israel. It is not unusual even today to find Nasser’s picture high on the walls of Palestinian households, Dr. Mario Abdel Razak, 34, a physician, brought his tiny daughter to cheer a food convoy headed for Iraq. “We are here to say hooray” to Saddam, he explained, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 7, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "In Saudi Arabia, government is all in the family By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent NAJRAN, Saudi Arabia — With the night breeze fluttering the tent flaps, a princely Saudi “source” sat cross-legged on an Oriental carpet spread in the middle of the desert and began discoursing on the risks of elec- tive democracy. The 5,000 members of, the ruling Saud family are trying their best to teach the Western scribblers something about how this dynasty dispenses its brand of benevolence. Taking a leaf from the Wash- ington stylebook of “spin doctor- ing,” Saudi princes are holding “background” briefings every week or so. None has been as candid as the moonlit back- grounder last week at the desert encampment of the California- educated p , who wants to be called only “a Saudi source.” In between bon mots about Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion leader Yasser Arafat and the American arms sales policy, the “source” also spoke of the rela- tive merits of coffee. After directing a thermos- bearing Pakistani servant to pour more coffee for the dozen journal- ists, he asked a female reporter whether the strong black brew tasted more like the coffee in Phoenix or Los Angeles. Halfway into this taste tease, he sprang a surprise: This was Saudi-grown coffee from this comparatively lush southwestern province next to the Yemen border. But it was time to get serious. A Defense Ministry plane was waiting to fly the journalists back across the country to their hotels. It was time to start the lesson. “In my opinion,” the source said, “to have democracy in the Middle East is opening the way to anarchy. In the West, if a party loses an election, they will take it in a sportive way. But in the Mid- dle East, this doesn’t happen. Look what happened in Syria — it went to army officers.” One thing Westerners should realize, the prince said, is that “pure” elections won’t bring to power the same educated elite of Saudi princes and technocrats who are now running things. “You won't get university peo- ple,” he said. “You get some trib- al leaders and many others.” Someone got the prince onto the subject of the leaders of other Arab countries. “Israel has profited through- out history through the mistakes committed by Arab leaders,” he said. “Remember, it was Presi- dent [Gamal Abdel] Nasser of Egypt who was responsible for Israel’s expansion in 1967. Frankly, it’s in the interests of Is- rael to have some rulers like President Nasser, and [Libyan leader Moammar] Gadhafi and certainly Saddam Hussein.” “What the Israelis don’t want is Arab leaders who are quiet, re- sponsible and want to have fruit- ful relations with the West. They hate the Palestinian intelligen- tsia. In their hearts they love to have someone like Arafat, be- cause he is making an unappeal- ing case for the Palestinians in atl aris @ Ne As for the United States, the prince was gracious in thanking the Bush administration for sending troops. At the same time he was fuming at the news that Congress is resisting Bush ad- ministration plans to sell ad- vanced weapons to Saudi Arabia. . “Believe me, we hope. that one day there will be a country with more sophisticated weap- ons than the U.S., so we could buy from them,” said the source, after decrying. what he called “the Israel lobby” in Congress. Monarchy works so well that democracy would only foul things up: That is the message conveyed by three princely back- ground briefers over the last fortnight. : These Saudis believe theirs is an ideal system because it allows every citizen to take his com- plaints directly to the rulers. They say they don’t need any written constitution, because they live by the laws of God as laid out in Islam’s holy Koran. That’s the way it’s been since a tall warrior named Ibn Saud united the squabbling tribes of Arabia in the first third of this century to form what may be the only nation in the world named after the founder’s family. Ibn Saud created Saudi Ara- bia by taming most of the 100 or more rival tribes spread across the Arabian Peninsula. He did so by being fiercer, more zealous about Islam and smarter in ar- ranging tribal alliances. And he cemented his hold by marrying and having children with at least 22 daughters of tribal notables from across Arabia. Those who resisted his mari- tal diplomacy Ibn Saud con- quered by sending his ruthless Bedouin warriors, who laid waste in the name of a puritani- cal form of Islam called Wah- habism. . In 1932, Ibn Saud assumed the status of king of one of the poorest, least developed coun- tries in the world. Six years later, Standard Oil of California found the first Saudi gusher. King Saud didn’t live long enough to see Saudi Arabia get rich. But he did seed a dynasty to share the wealth he could see coming. By the time he died in 1953, he had sired at least 45 sons. In a sense, Saudi Arabia is now a family business partner- ship run by King Saud’s 30-odd surviving sons, now mainly in their 50s and 60s, as well as their up-and-coming male children. By urispoken family consen- sus, two branches of the extend- ed family are considered the ablest in governmental affairs, and they control most of the lev- ers of power.

        "ocr_text": "Deaths in Israel are side issue to Arab soldiers facing Iraq NEAR THE KUWAITI BOR- DER, Saudi Arabia — As word of the killing of 19 Palestinians by Israeli police bullets spread Tuesday among front-line Saudi and Egyptian troops, Arab com- manders said their soldiers’ mo- rale has not been harmed. Maj. Gen. Turki Nefai, whose Abdul Aziz armored brigade is just 35 miles south of the Kuwaiti border, said the bloody episode was an outgrowth of efforts by Yasser Arafat and other Pales- tine Liberation Organization leaders to open a “second front” to combat Saudi Arabia. “This [incident] is the reac- tion of Palestinian people to the call of the PLO leadership in their race to be the first to dem- onstrate their support of (Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein,” the general told correspondents visiting his desert headquarters. The first reaction of senior Saudi and allied Arab command- ers was to treat Monday’s kill- ings in Jerusalem as sad but ir- relevant to their task of getting ready to fight Saddam’s jugger- naut just north of the border. As far as outsiders could tell, the Saudi and Egyptian units fac- ing Iraq’s half-million soldiers remained in high spirits and were ready to fight when the or- der comes. Capt. Tabeth Khadrani, the young commander of a Saudi ar- tillery battery, said, “We came here to defend our country from any attack from anywhere. ... We are ready when the signal [for war] comes, so that we can do what everyone expects of us.” A 23-year-old Saudi corporal named Saad said, “I thank the Saudi people for the support they have shown by volunteering as recruits for the defense of our re- ligion and our country.” Though the enmity toward Saddam seemed genuine among the Saudi troops, that emotion did not appear to erase their even deeper sense that Israel is their enemy for the long haul. Asked whether the Saudi forces would assist Israel if it goes to war against Saddam’s Iraq, Saudi Lt. Col. Abdullah Sharani left the impression that he regarded that as impossible. “The No. 1 enemy of the Arab people is Israel,” he said, adding that eventually the exiled Pales- tinians must achieve “the right to return to their homeland.” At a tent camp perhaps 15 miles away, Egyptian Col. Abdul Rahim Mohammed Sayed said he and his 2,000-strong army ranger battalion were ready “to sacrifice ourselves for the de- fense of Saudi Arabia.” He said he had not heard of the shootings in Jerusalem, Overall, the front-line Arab forces look much more like a fighting force than they did on two similar tours by journalists in August and early September. The main difference is that scores of Egyptian tanks and ar- A Palestinian mother (center) weeps with relatives in Jerusalem on Tuesday over the death of her son, who was killed in Monday's riots. mored personnel carriers have arrived at the front lines, plug- ging what used to be 10-mile- wide gaps between the lonely Saudi tank units. The American 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) has its tanks positioned as a second de- fensive band some 100 miles be- hind the foremost Saudi and Egyptian units. Meanwhile, an- other American tank unit, the ist Cavalry from Fort Hood, Texas, is beginning to arrive at a Saudi port. Another change from a month ago is that some Saudi front-line units now say they have Ameri- can Special Forces detachments serving with them as “advisers.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 10, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Jilted GI digs hole for relief _ By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT of Cox News Service A NORTHERN MARINE OUTPOST, Saudi Arabia — Today was going to be Lance Cpl. Raymond Walters’ wed- ding day. But Saddam Hus- sein and Walters’ fiancee, Rhonda, have combined to give him the ax. Walters, 22, of Lebanon, Mo., was standing guard du- ty in his foxhole the other oo nee, ee ian oe Ist Platoon gathered in the tent a ~ year ago in California. Walters was - for mail call. A Marine buddy picked up his letter. It was ad- dressed to Lance Corporal Raymond Walters, Kilo 39, Ist Platoon, FPO San Fran- cisco, 96608-8650. His buddy walked the let- ter out to him at the foxhole. He saw Rhonda's writing and tore it open. “My fiancee’s letter said, “Maybe this was not meant to be,’”’ Walters said two days later. He had to do something. He started digging. He dug all day, filling more and more sandbags in the 110-degree heat, getting madder by the minute. His foxhole had been maybe four feet deep when Rhonda dinged him. Two days later, he had dug a world class foxhole for his grief. “I dug down three and a half feet, just to get off my aggression,” he said. “It used to be four feet deep. Now, counting the sandbags, it is about 10 feet deep.” He said he still loves Rhonda, who is somewhere back in Colora- do, “and I am not giving up.” Rhonda could not be reached for comment. But her roommate confirmed that she had broken off the engagement and said there was no chance Rhonda would change her mind. Walters lives in a swatch of des- olation maybe 40 miles into the des- ert from Landing Zone Foss, a northern airstrip. He said he passes the days by looking forward to two things. One is music on a portable stereo like a Walkman. The other thing is getting letters. Walters said he met Rhonda a then stationed at the Marine base at Camp Pendleton, Calif. After going together for a few months, they fell in love and decid- ed to get married in the fall of 1990. Then, about six months ago, some higher headquarters cut orders put- ting his Marine unit on notice that it 661 held it all day until that night. That's when | started crying... 99 — Raymond Walters, jilted soldier ee was about to be sent overseas, Walters, who has now been in the Marines three years and eight months, didn’t want to put off the wedding. So he took a gamble: He decided to extend his enlistment so he could transfer to another unit that wasn’t on orders to go overseas. He and Rhonda set the wedding date — Oct. 13. Re-enlistment is what landed him in the “Striking Third” Battal- ion of the 9th Marines, which was on peacetime duty at Camp Pendle- ton. Little did he and Rhonda know that the “Striking Third” would be one of the first American combat units to hit the ground in Saudi Ara- bia — and one of the furthest for- ward even now. When his buddies saw him dig- ging in the sun the other day, they got worried, One by one, they sidled up to his foxhole to try and talk to him about what he should write to Rhonda. “I had the whole chain of com- mand talking to me,” said Walters. “The staff sergeant, the gunnie (gunnery sergeant), the first ser- geant and a lot of guys in the pla- toon. We're kind of a family.” Whatever they said, Walters tried to behave the way he figured a Marine was supposed to behave: He sucked it in and kept on digging. “I held it all day until that night,” he said. “That's when I start- ed crying. They (his buddies) said I don’t know how to deal with it. That's when I broke down.” With their help, he wrote Rhon- da a letter. After he mailed it, one of the sergeants said he would be glad to call the chaplain. Walters was a religious man even before he got sent to Saudi Arabia. Even though his parents (both deceased) were Pentecostal Christians, he considers himself a Baptist. When his sister Angie sent him a Bible, he was glad to have it. But Walters said no, he didn’t need to see the chaplain. “I said I could make it,” he said. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 13 , 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Tank units complete U.S. forces By Joseph Albright Cox News Service DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — The last major gap in the 200,000- strong American and allied fight- ing force began closing Sunday as hundreds of tanks and armored ve- hicles poured off supply ships. The deployment of two big Tex- as-based U.S. tank units and a British tank brigade roughly dou- bles the armored punch of the American and allied forces, ac- cording to unofficial estimates. These new shipments bring to more than 200,000 the number of U.S. troops in the region in a force that now includes 1,200 tanks, nearly 500 combat aircraft, and 59 Navy warships. With some exceptions, this is es- sentially the force that U.S. offi- cials have been promising to put in place in Saudi Arabia since Presi- dent Bush announced plans more than two months ago to undertake a military initiative in the Middle East to stop Iraqi President Sad- dam Hussein’s aggression. “This is it,” a senior military of- ficial declared. “If it comes to bat- tle, this is what we'll have to fight with.” Nevertheless, Secretary of De- fense Dick Cheney on Sunday left open the possibility that addition- al troops and equipment might be sent overseas if U.S. commander Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and others decide it is necessary. “We've now surpassed the 200,000 mark within the last few days, and the deployment is not yet complete,” Cheney told report- ers en route from Washington to London, where he will meet with top British defense officials. Military officials here cautioned that even with the new tank rein- forcements, U.S. armored power would not be able to carry out a successful frontal assault on dug- in Iraqi defenders, who have an es- timated 430,000 troops and 3,500 tanks along the frontier of Kuwait and Iraq with Saudi Arabia. But with the armored force here now at projected full strength, the commanders stressed that the United States for the first time has the capability of pinning down Ira- qi ground forces in coordination with any U.S. strike against Iraq by air and sea. For the past month the U.S. command has concentrated on building up supplies and ammuni- tion while the number of front-line combat units grew only slowly. The pause in the combat-unit buildup ended with a flourish on Sunday when chartered ships started unloading the M-1 Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehi- cles of the 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood. Shortly after the 1st Cavalry’s debut in a Saudi port, the even more advanced M-1A1 tanks of the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Bliss near El Paso ar- rived. These carry a larger, longer- range main gun and are equipped with cooling suits designed to keep individual tank crew members ETI The British “Desert Rats” — a 120-tank brigade — is also due to begin arriving from Germany within the next few days. Once as- sembled, the “Desert Rats” bri- gade will be attached to the US. Marines and will take combat or- ders from a Marine general, said the British forces commander, Lt. Gen. Sir Peter de la Billier. In recent weeks, as the Iraqis shifted hundreds of tanks into Ku- wait and southern Iraq from their Iran front, the weakest link in the Western-Islamic alliance has ap- peared to be a paucity of U.S. and Saudi tanks, artillery and other ar- mored forces. Saturday, on the eve of the ar- rival of the three new tank units, the military arm of the anti-Iraq alliance included the American and Saudi core forces, assisted on the ground by an Egyptian ar- mored unit, French Foreign Le- gionnaires, Egyptian commandos and Moroccan commandos. The allied air forces include hundreds of warplanes from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Brit- ain, France, Canada, Italy, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and the exiled Kuwait regime. Scores of warships participating in the sea blockade of Iraq include those un- der the flags of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Britain, and Spain. Austin American-Statesman - October 15 , 1990 \f"

Mr. Amiri said he remains optimistic that the gulf crisis can be resolved short of war. If that happens, he predicts world oil: prices will “stabilize” at a higher level than that of before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. “Once this crisis is resolved peacefully, I think prices will stabilize to the target level set by OPEC, which was about $21 a barrel,” he said. Before the Iraqi invasion, the international price of oil had fall- en to below $16 a barrel on some markets. Since Aug. 2, the price has escalated above $40 a barrel. Once Iraqi troops withdraw from Kuwait and the Kuwaiti emir is restored to power, the Kuwaiti government will be pre- ‘pared to negotiate with Iraq about ownership of two disputed islands and an oil field, Mr. Amiri said. “Then, there will be room for discussion and negotiation about any pending issues,” he told cor- respondents at a conference of 750 Kuwaiti ruling family mem-. bers, intellectuals and opposition figures, As the conference drew toward a close, participants in the closed meetings said the rul- ing Sabah family had agreed to the formation of standing com- mittees that will advise the fam- ily in its exile home in Saudi Arabia. Kuwaiti dissidents support exiled emir Exiles pledge to die to free homeland By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia —. Kuwaiti pro-democracy dissi- dents on Monday joined mem- bers of the ruling Sabah family in a ringing pledge of support for the exiled emir, who has agreed to restore a limited form of de- mocracy if Kuwait is liberated. “One and all, men and wom- en, old and young, stand solidly behind our legitimate leadership whose true embodiment is our | emir ... and his crown prince,” the statement said. After three days of often heat- ed internal debates, a “people’s conference” of 750 exiled Ku- waiti scholars, business leaders, cabinet ministers and opposition figures also managed to unite around a common declaration pledging to die if necessary to re- store a free Kuwait. The Kuwaitis also agreed to call on the U.N. Se urity Council to pass a resolution authorizing the world community “to use ev- ery possible means” for the im- plementation of Security Council resolutions demanding the with- drawal of Iraqi occupation forces from Kuwait. The section appealing to the United Nations was watered down at the last moment because senior Kuwaiti participants de- cided the time was not ripe to call on the world body to act militari- ly against Iraq. Language calling overtly for military action was scrapped by a 20-member drafting committee to leave more time for a possible diplomatic solution, an exiled Kuwaiti minister said.

With Mideast rivals flying similar jets, the ‘bad guys’ can be hard to recognize By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent .AN AIR BASE IN SAUDI ARABIA — Every flight Lt. Skip Peters takes in his F-14 Navy fighter, he has to worry about whether a Mirage jet streaking toward him belongs to Iraq or to one of several air forces allied to the United States. ’ Never before in the history of aviation have fighter pilots faced such a complicated problem of split-second recognition as they confront over Saudi Arabia: whenever the French-built Mi- rage F-1 fighter is in the air. . If combat should break out, Lieutenant Peters could well find ‘himself in a triangular dogfight, joining one Mirage in trying to’ shoot down another. * “You've got to have some way to:know who the good guys are,”’ said Lieutenant Peters aboard 120 miles north of the Saudi bor- der. From that range, an Iraqi Mirage could dash south at more than Mach 2 and enter Saudi air- space in about 10 minutes. If an air battle started and the gulf region’s F-1s were scram- bled, it would be up to pilots like Lieutenant Peters to sort out who belongs to what. Lieutenant Peters, 29, of Pen- sacola, Fla., has been chosen to be the resident expert on the Mi- rage F-1 among F-14 pilots the carrier USS Independence in the northern Arabian Sea. The allied air forces don’t talk much about the problem of “fratricide’’ among the multina- tional fighter force poised to take on Iraq’s jets. But they have thought a good deal about the ’ problem. Brig. Gen. Turki bin Nasser, the commander of one, of Saudi Arabia’s largest air bases, said Tuesday, ‘“‘Mirages are no secret. The Iraqis have them. The Ku- waitis had them and have them still. The air force of Qatar has it. The [United Arab] Emirates have them. The French have them. It is truly an international airplane.” During the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, American and Saudi jets oc- casionally encountered Iran’s American-made F-4 and F-14 jets, which had been part of the Iranian air force since the days aboard the Independence. He has read up on the fighting char- acteristics of the plane and has given a lecture to his fellow pilots. But Lieutenant Peters hasn’t been able to tell his mates how to eyeball an oncoming Mirage and tell its nationality. From 10 miles off, a pilot sees only a moving dot. Royal Saudi Air Force wing commander Col. Maed al-Le- haibi said, ‘“‘there are plenty of of the shah. But in those days, the permutations never were as complicated as encounters might get over the Persian Gulf, with Mirages flying from all di- rections. The Saudis, the Americans and the other friendly air forces - have worked out classified rec- ognition procedures to avoid fratricide. The procedures are designed to prevent Iraq from sending in so-called “leakers’”’ — warplanes that could sneak through the allied air defense lines in ones or twos by mimick- ing non-Iraqi jets. The allied war planners espe- cially have been concerned about Iraqi leakers because these theo- retically could become President Saddam Hussein’s delivery sys- tem for chemical weapons. Most of the Iraqi Mirage F-1s have been based at the al-Chi- bayish air base in southern Iraq, ways of recognizing friend or foe, which we are keeping to ourselves.” : Some of those ways are al- ready well known to the Iraqis. For one, continual patrols by. American and Saudi AWACS ra- dar planes watch every Iraqi air base. The moment an Iraqi plane takes off, the news is flashed to a joint U.S.-Saudi air combat com- mand center in Saudi Arabia. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 17, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Fort Hood cavalry rides into Saudi desert — By Joseph Albright Cox News Service SAUDI ARABIA — If the gen- erals meant for the meek to inherit this patch of the earth, then they sent the wrong outfit. The 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood has moved into its first desert home, and already the troops have begun to tell tales of derring-do. Not that the troops sound like they are itching to attack anybody. Moving nearly 100 miles out to- ward the front lines seems to have brought the youth of the division to its senses about what a real war might be like. “If somebody tells you it doesn’t bother you, they are lying,” said a tank company executive officer, 2nd Lt. Jay Magruder, 24, of Aus- tin. “It is a little tough to really be- lieve you are going to fight. But if we have to do it, we will. It is what we signed up for.” A 19-year-old tank driver, Pvt. Jeffrey Hendrickson of Galena, Ill, said, “If we have to do it, we'll do it. But it does scare a lot of peo- ple thinking about it.” But if these troops are nervous about going into battle, they are not shy about their abilities or the capabilities of their machinery. Crisis in the Middle East “These thermal sights are so good I can see a tarantula at 500 meters,” M1 tank gunner Sgt. John Hawkins, 22, of Albany, Ore., said Wednesday. Aw, come on, John, don’t exag- gerate, his buddies told him. “Well, OK, I can pick up a rabbit at 500 meters, and that’s for sure,” Hawkins said. At least he could back on the firing ranges at Fort Hood. How hard is it to shoot the 105mm main gun at an enemy tank, he was asked. “It’s like shooting a big rifle,” Hawkins said, “and I am the best. “Back at Fort Hood we fired 36 practice rounds, and I hit 90 per- cent of the targets.” _Hendrickson is the one who drives Hawkins’ M1 Abrams battle tank so Hawkins can get a shot. Hendrickson says driving an M1 is just like driving the motorcycle on which he used to tool around on weekends in Texas. Only easier. “The handle bars are just about the same as a motor- cycle,” said Hendrickson. “With a motorcycle, I lean for- ward, while on an M1, I lean back- ward. It’s a lot easier to drive be- cause you don’t have to worry about balancing. And it will do some pretty tight corners.” The M1 is a 60-ton, 1,500-horse- power iron spider that can move at up to 42 mph and sting an enemy target with a 105-mm shell at a range of about two and a half miles. Hawkins and Hendrickson are two of the four crew members on one M1 tank in a unit called Bravo Company of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment. A third crewmember is Pvt. Ar- chie Salazar, 19, of Tierra Amar- illa, N.M., the ammunition loader. The fourth is SFC David Bowl- ing, 35, of Oxnard, Calif., the tank commander. He is a seven-stripe sergeant with 17 years of army ex- perience, mostly in tank units. “We can hit almost anything we shoot at,” Bowling said. “Even a beginner can hit a tar- get. The challenge is not that, but keeping the machinery maintained so it can always shoot.” The 75 men of Bravo Company walked down the ramp of a char- tered commercial jet about two weeks ago at a Saudi airbase. The troops spent the first few days getting rid of jet lag, then watched Bravo’s 14 new M1 tanks clank out from the maw of a ship. It was Tuesday afternoon before the Bravo tanks and troops moved into the desert to their first fight- ing position. Sgt. Gary Hutton, 30, of Colora- do Springs, Colo., has disposed of the only enemy that has so far raised its head. “A guy was taking a shower last night from the shower bag hanging on the tank,” said Hutton. “He saw a big scorpion six or eight inches from his feet. He jumped real quick and got up on the fank, and I killed it with a stick.” Austin American-Statesman - October 18, 1990 \f"

U.S. warships had a role in 191 of the boardings. & The U.N. Security Council was considering a resolution that would al- low nations hurt by Iraq's in- vasion to seek repa- rations. Bush met at the White House with Yevgeny Primakov, an aide . to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and they agreed that the two superpowers would re- main firm in demanding the un- conditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. “One cannot allow a situation ‘where actions that are incompat- ible with a civilized society would be in order,” Mr. Prima- kov said after the meeting. Earlier, speaking to Italian- American leaders, Mr. Bush said he remained ‘‘as determined as I was the day the first [U.S.] troop left” for the Persian Gulf that there would be no compromise with Iraq over the Kuwait issue. There have been persistent reports in the past week that Iraq was seeking a compromise that would let it retain part of Kuwait in return for pulling its forces out of most of the country. But Mr. Primakov, who recently visited Iraqi President Saddam Hus- sein, said he was not carrying any message to Mr. Bush from the Iraqi leader. Also Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ended a four-day visit to Moscow by say- ing Mr..Gorbachev had assured . him of unwavering Soviet sup- port for U.N. resolutions de- manding a full Iraqi pullout. The second announcement out of Baghdad on Friday. said all foreigners still in Kuwait must register or their residency cards would be canceled. Foreigners living in Iraq without residency cards may face fines or jail sentences. About 400,000 foreigners are believed still in Kuwait since an exodus that began immediately _ after Iraq invaded. An estimated 2,000 of those are Westerners hiding from Iraqi authorities out of fear they would be held as part of the “human shield” of foreign- ers sent to Iraq’s strategic mili- and economic installations to 1 military attack.

        "ocr_text": "Marine sergeant takes on his last mission Seasoned warrior to retire after brief tour in desert By Joseph Albright Jouma-Consttution correspondent NEAR THE KUWAIT! BORDER, Saudi Arabia — Grandpa Grunt is getting ready to Outen “After two months in the desert and nearly 20 years in the Marines, Gunnery Sgt. LeRoy Ford of Alexandria, La., is retiring and leav- ing behind his beloved Alpha Company. “t's scary,” said Sergeant Ford, 38, who has one grandchild and a second due next month. At night he sits out under the stars and talks with his old friend, the first ser- geant, about what it will be like in a civilian job. “As a civilian, I am not going to be part of the establishment. J am not going to be able to tell these guys, ‘Hey, you got to get up and go to a 1 am going to have to start all over ag in ‘ Back in 1970 the Marines brought him his first dose of fear, in Vietnam. Now, in Saudi Arabia, he has become Al- pha Company’s unofficial combat counselor. Many of the Marines of the 1990s with whom he serves are younger than his 23-year-old son and 22-year-old daughter, “T am getting them ready,” he said. “T tell them how it was as a private. I was a private, 18 years old, scared. Didn’t know nothing, Just finished boot camp, had 10 days leave, and I was gone to Vietnam. My squad leader took me aside and told me, ‘When I say some: thing, do it, don’t question me, just do it.’ “And so I tell them, when bullets start fly- ing at you, you have to just do things when they tell you, You don’t have time to sit down Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 23, 1990 “As a civilian, I am not going to be part of the establishment... Tam going to have to start all over again,” ee Gunnery Sgt, LeRoy Ford i ‘oa vctiig pel and say, ‘Well, I might want to do that.’” Not all that much has changed, even though the Marines now ride around in fast, hard-shooting, light-armored vehicles, he tells them. “Then we were grunts; right now we are mobile grunts,” he said. Sergeant Ford’s 20-year hitch runs out in March, But he expects to go back to Camp Pendleton, Calif, in December or January to begin the lengthy pre-retirement medical tests, The Marines also will put him through: what some of them call a “demilitarization” course lasting several weeks, It is supposed to equip him for the vagaries of civilian life. He won’t have the option of staying in the Marines to become sergeant major. Back in 1986, he tore up a knee playing halfback for the Camp Lejeune Wolfpack football team. The injury was bad enough that a Marine medical board tried to force him out after 16. years of service, Sergeant Ford appealed and got to stay in so he could retire at 20 years, Then in 1988, he got his second knee oper- ation after sliding into a base playing softball, ‘When Saddam Hussein did his thing in Kuwait, an alert order came to Alpha Compa- ny and the other units in the Light Infantry Battalion of the 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. __ Because Sergeant Ford was a short-timer with gimpy knees, he had to argue hard to go to Saudi Arabia, Most of Alpha Company flew there ahead of him. He had to stay back to take care of shipping the eight-wheeled ar: mored personnel carriets in which his far- forward scouting unit travels, “I would drive my wife crazy,” he said, “I ~~» Sald,“T need to get over there, I need to get over there.’ My wife said, ‘Please, dammit, relax,’ ” Sergeant Ford bowled over the paper pushers and got on a plane to rejoin his com- pany, é After eight years as a gunnery sergeant, Sergeant Ford is acknowledged as'one of the best scroungerss, When another unit has an excess of plas- tic slats or trash bags or empty water bottles, “Gunny” Ford tries to get that other unit to share the wealth. He does it by trading some of Alpha Company's goodies — say, some ex-' cess toilet paper. “The way you get things is a matter of your personality,” he said. “You know, you stroke them.” As a civilian, he hopes to get into hotel management and put the gunny’s training to use, He wants to work his way up in some technologically advanced hotel in California for maybe seven years, Then he wants to move back home to Baton Rouge or New Or- leans to get a more advanced hotel job. Now that he’s decided he will have to get out of the Marines, he has one item on his wish list: to get home to his family fo Christmas. No way, say the younger members of Al- pha Company. They say Gunny Ford is going to have to stay around and play Santa Claus one more time. \f"

        "ocr_text": "The Palm Beach Post 58 PAGES TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1990 25 CENTS lragis may free hundreds Hussein promises release of sick, elderly By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau CAIRO, Egypt — Hundreds of foreign hostages in Iraq, including American, British and French men who are part of a “human shield” against attack, may gain freedom in coming days in an apparent effort by Saddam Hussein to weak- en the wall of international opposi- tion isolating his country. During a meeting Sunday witha delegation from the U.S. Iraqi- American Friendship Foundation, Hussein promised to release an undetermined number of sick and elderly Americans, said the group's president, Salim Mansour, It was not clear when they might be released. The State De- partment had no comment. The Iraqi government also was expected to release by today a list of the sick and elderly British citi- zens promised their freedom after a personal plea by Edward Heath, the former British prime minister who went to Baghdad last weekend to try to secure their release, But the possibility of help came too late for one British detainee, 62-year-old Ron Duffy, who the British Embassy in Baghdad said died Monday after a heart attack. Also Monday, a Saudi defense minister's suggestion that Kuwait’ could make territorial concessions in exchange for an Iraqi withdraw- al alarmed the Bush administra- tion, but the United States said the comment did not reflect Saudi gov- ernment policy. American officials hurriedly contacted the Saudi ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, after the minister, Prince Sultan Ibn Abdelaziz, was quoted by Arab journalists in Riyadh Sun- day as saying Arab countries were ready to grant Iraq “all its rights,” ready to grant Iraq “all its rights.” The ambassador assured the United States “that there is no change in the Saudi policy and that they continue to believe the U.N, sanctions are effective and will work and should be pursued,” said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. In the Persian Gulf Monday, a tense confron- tation subsided after an embargo-busting Iraqi vessel stopped defying U.S. warning shots and was discovered to have quietly dumped its prohibited cargo of steel and plywood at sea, The ship was permitted to continue toward Yemen because it no longer was in violation of a U.N.-imposed trade embargo, military officials said in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Another signal Monday of Iraq’s possible softening was Hussein's calling of a special session of the Iraqi Parliament, a rubber stamp legislature. He asked it to meet today to consid- er releasing all 350 French hostages because _ France has been opposed to the use of military \"force in the crisis that began with Iraq's Aug, 2 Invasion of Kuwait. Bulgarian Vice President Atanas Semerjiey arrived in the Iraqi capital Monday on a mission to gain freedom for about 700 Bulgarian work- ers trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. And a wave of 600 Vietnamese workers crossed into Turkey Monday. Vietnamese offi- cials had complained that 16,000 of their citi- zens were on the verge of starvation in Iraq. Another 500 are expected to arrive in Turkey today. It was uncertain whether the remaining Vietnamese would be permitted to leave Iraq. Mansour said Hussein pledged during a Sunday meeting with the U.S. friendship group that he would free an unspecified number of sick and elderly Americans. “President Saddam Hussein is releasing some of the guests with us. He assured us of this, and we are just working on the numbers,” said Mansour, whose group went to Baghdad on a mission to get some of the Americans out. The State Department has compiled a list of 69 Americans it has asked be set free because of their age or physical condition. Palm Beach Post - October 23, 1990 HOSTAGE SITUATION @ TRAPPED: 700-800 Americans are still trapped in Kuwait and Iraq. @ ROUNDED UP: 106 Americans have been detained. i ILL: 69 seriously ill Americans are being held. @ TOTAL: 5,000 Westerners are still held hostage. Authorities believe 106 Americans are held at sensitive security and economic installations as part of the “human shield” designed to deter foreign attack. Hussein’s initiative on the French hostages and willingness to release some American and British citizens seemed clustered together to form a message to the West: Iraq is willing to deal with whomever shows some flexibility and readiness to talk. \f"

Powell, said Tuesday after an intensive intelli- gence and operations briefing that he sees no evidence that Ira- qi forces have begun withdraw- ing from the Kuwaiti border. “The Iraqi forces still remain very solidly in Kuwait in the numbers we have been reporting all along,” General Powell said. “And frankly, I have not seen any evidence of withdrawal.” In Washington, Pentagon of- ficials said the Defense Depart- ment is considering a new wave of troop deployments to the Per- sian Gulf, taking the gulf buildup beyond the 240,000-troop force Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 24, 1990 pg sees no signs of pullback by Iraqi army in Kuwait now planned. Pete Williams, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Che- ney, said thaf more than 210,000 U.S. forces now are in and around Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield to de- fend the desert kingdom against possible Iraqi attack. That’s 10,000 more than the last official count issued by Mr. Cheney on Oct. 13. Mr. Williams said General Powell is consulting with U.S. and Saudi officials on the possi- ble need to expand Desert Shield deployments. Nervous world oil markets have reacted sharply in the past few days to a report from Ku- waiti exiles that Iraqi troops have begun pulling back to a fenced enclave in northern Ku- wait. General Powell’s remarks were the first authoritative com- ment by someone with full access to satellite photos and other clas- sified intelligence. General Powell gave a brief interview at a nearby Saudi air. base after he had finished eight hours of discussions with troop commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and 10 of his senior staff in Saudi Arabia. Aides said the sessions included a review of the latest intelligence on Iraq and Kuwait, a discussion of the exact deployment of American troops and ‘an analysis of Ameri- can and allied contingency plans. General Powell didn’t give a direct reply when asked whether he and General Schwarzkopf dis- cussed sending more tank divi- sions to reinforce American forces. \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Adam Nossiter Journal-Constitution correspondents CAIRO, Egypt — Iraq began releasing a new wave of detainees Tuesday, including 14 Ameri- cans who flew to Jordan, and authorities said they would set free all 330 French citizens held in Iraq for almost three months. Another 33 Britons were expected soon, after former British Prime Minister Edward Heath led a mission to win their freedom. > The releases came as the Pentagon considered U.S. deployments in the gulf beyond the 240,000 troops now planned and Saudi Arabia’s ambassa- dor assured U.S. officials that the kingdom has not softened its demand that Iraq completely with- draw from Kuwait. The Americans released Tuesday included at least one U.S. official who had been stuck in Bagh- dad after leaving the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait. William Hollingsworth, 64, of Huntsville, Ala., was in Kuwait as a technical representative for the Army Missile Command, said Dave Harris, a spokesman for Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville. “He would have been involved in routine proc: essing of missile repair parts for the Kuwaiti armed forces, Mr. Hollingsworth was involved in the routine business of keeping the systems sup- plied, ... He was there as a logistics representa- tive,” Mr. Harris said. The Kuwaitis operated two U.S.-supplied mis- sile systems — the TOW anti-tank missile and the Hawk anti-aircraft missile. At least 144 Hawk mis- siles were captured by the Iraqis, and U.S. military planners are concerned about them as a possible threat to U.S, air power in the gulf, Mr. Hollingsworth’ son, Ron, said from Hunts- ville; “All I can say is he was a diplomat working out of the embassy in Kuwait, ... Dad’s position over there was extremely sensitive,... There are several countries that would like to talk to him [about] what he does over there ... There are several people who are still over there he worked with.” Mr. Hollingsworth’s wife, Nancy, said in Carrollton, Ga., that it is “quite possible” that her husband’s job put him in danger from the Iraqis. “T don’t think he would have been [released] if they had known,” said Mrs. Hollings- worth, who had been among the embassy dependents allowed to leave Iraq on Aug. 28. Mr. Hollingsworth was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in Baghdad before boarding the flight to Jordan, “T’m just thrilled that I’m going. “It’s a strange coincidence, but I’m leaving the gulf and my son is in Saudi Arabia,” Mr. Hol- lingsworth said. He explained that his son is with the U.S.-led multinational force assembled after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. In Washington, the State De- partment said the release of Americans is not enough. More than 1,000 Americans and thou- sands of other foreigners are be- ing denied permission to leave Iraq and occupied Kuwait. _ “While it is important that these individuals are free, and we welcome it,” said spokes- woman Margaret D. Tutwiler, “there are still many Americans and foreign nationals who are not free to leave Iraq and Kuwait.” She said Iraq should “immedi- ately” release 63 other Ameri- cans whom the State Department has identified as being in imme- diate need of medical attention. Also Tuesday, the Saudi am- bassador to the United States as- sured Secretary of State James A. Baker III that his country i not in favor of Kuwait conceding territory to bring about a peace- ful settlement of the crisis. Prince Bandar bin Sultan made his remarks in a meeting with Mr. Baker — and reiterated them to reporters outside the State Department — in the after- math of reports quoting the Sau- di defense minister, Prince Sul- tan Ibn Abdel-Aziz, as raising the possibility Monday that Iraq might gain territory in return for ending its occupation. Prince Sultan is Prince Bandar’s father. Tuesday’s spate of hostage releases seemed calculated to di- lute international hostility to Iraq, but world leaders contin- ued demanding full withdrawal of Iraqi forces and the release of thousands of foreigners. The 14 Americans arrived Tuesday in Jordan after Iraqi au- thorities released them to an Ira- qi-American friendship delega- tion, but journalists were not permitted to interview them at the Amman airport. “This is a mixed group; most of them are official Americans, the rest are private citizens,” Jonathan Owen, press counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Amman, told reporters at the airport there, according to wire service reports. In Washington, Ms. Tutwiler said that of the 14 Americans, six are sick, two have critically ill relatives and six are students. None had been among the hundreds of foreigners turned into “human shields” at military and other sensitive installations, where they are kept in hopes their presence will deter foreign attacks. Besides the “human shield” hostages, other foreign- ers are staying at hotels, at their homes or — especially in Kuwait — are in hiding. The freed group arrived on an Iraqi Airways flight from Baghdad, where they had been turned over to Salim Mansour, leader of a delegation from the Iraq-American Friendship Foun- dation. He had been trying to se- cure freedom especially for sick and elderly Americans. “I was waiting for this mo- ment. I am extremely happy, but sad at the same time because I am leaving many of my friends and colleagues,” said Jack Fra- ser, 53, of Santa Ana, Calif. Another American, 44-year- old John Thompson, said he is eager to see his 68-year-old mother in Germany because she is going blind. “I’m her only child and she wanted to see me badly,” he said. Also leaving Iraq was Lloyd Graham, 48, who said he was go- ing home to his wife, three daughters and son in Houston. Five Finnish citizens also were set free and flew to Amman on Tuesday, leaving nine compa- triots behind. _ In addition to the 33 Britons expected to leave Baghdad, the Iraqi Parliament voted in a spe- cial session Tuesday night to set free all 330 French citizens held in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraqi Presi- dent Saddam Hussein had asked his compliant legislative body to consider the gesture to France because he said the French had shown they want to resolve the gulf crisis peacefully, not through war.

On Aug, 7, the strategy be- came Operation De- sert Shield, the U.S, military inter- vention in the Per- sian Gulf crisis, Joseph Albright/Staff Army mastermind stays ahead Af the ‘game’ Strategy hatched in Georgia making history in the desert By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent | THIRD ARMY HEADQUARTERS, Saudi Arabia — Starting in March 1989, Army Lt. Gen. John Yeosock and his 500 war-gamers, fuel esti- mator's and other planners sat at a Georgia mili- tary base and thought about how they could move 200,000 troops to Saudi Arabia, The planners left one big blank. They called i’ C-Day. That was the hypothetical future date when some unspecified president might decide that he needed to go to the aid of Saudi Arabia against an enemy to the north — presumably Traq or Iran. The top-secret work in Building 363 of Atlan- ta’s Fort McPherson spelled out the Army's part of the enterprise, By July 1990, the cigar-smok:- ing General Yeosock and his three-star and four-star counterparts in the Navy, Marines and Air Force were ready for a test run. In small groups, they and their top subordinates made their way to Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla. Over about a week, they used computers to “fight” a simulated . war in the Arabian desert, code- named Operation Internal Look 90. When the exercise was over, they had a contingency plan the size of a big city’s Yellow Pages. It spelled out which divisions would go to Saudi Arabia, what radio frequencies they would use, where they would get their water, how they would treat their casualties and how they would handle the news media. A month later, Iraqi Presi- dent Saddam Hussein’s airborne troops landed in Kuwait City, leaving President Bush to draw his “line in the sand.” Mr. Bush’ ordered the plan to commence Aug. 7. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - Today marks C plus 79. So far, the plan that General Yeo- sock helped write has brought - about the biggest, fastest and least fouled-up mobilization in U.S. military history. General Yeosock said he has been surprised that there have been so few “anomalies” as the plan has unfolded. “I believe history will reflect that we exceeded all expecta-- tions in terms of our capability,” General Yeosock said. “We have generated forces at a rate five or six times that which was achieved during the first big buildup for Vietnam.” President Lyndon B. Johnson notched up U.S. troop strength in Vietnam to about 265,000 over a year in the mid-1960s, and that was considered rapid. This time, it has taken a little more than two months for about 200,000 American troops to reach an equally distant location. Over the decades, U.S. gener- als have seldom wished to stress their achievements as war plan- ners because they preferred to think of themselves as battlefield Back in the 1960s, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara challenged that philosophy when he forced the Pentagon to adopt rigorous techniques of comput- er-assisted “what-if” analyses. Partly because of resistance by the generals, Mr. McNa- mara’s computer-assisted war- gaming came too late to have much effect on planning for Viet- nam. But many of today’s colo- nels and generals grew up speak- ing the lingo of systems analysis. Until this year, McNamara- style war-gaming and operations research has never been put to a test on a level involving more than 100,000 troops, scores of ships and hundreds of airplanes. Operation Desert Shield marks the first test. It is too soon to say how clev- er the Internal Look ’90 plan will appear in retrospect. Even if there is no war, the deployment could look a lot different by C plus 140, the day civilians call Christmas. October 25, One achievement, however, is that the plan did not leak. General Yeosock took com- mand in Atlanta in March 1989, but his name first appeared in Atlanta newspapers Aug. 24, 1990. That was when the Army announced that he was taking over as three-star general com- manding the Army component of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. At 53, General Yeosock — a non-West Pointer — had the most challenging assignment of any Army general except for his immediate boss, U.S. forces com- mander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. By C-Day, General Yeosock and one other officer had been secretly sent to Saudi Arabia to take charge of the biggest Ameri- can buildup since Vietnam. He is now commander of the Third Army. Except for special forces troops that report directly to General Schwarzkopf, General Yeosock has direct control of all Army units in Saudi Arabia. If war comes, he will be the top Army field commander in charge of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized), the 82nd Air- borne, the 101st Airborne, the ist Cavalry and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. Judging from his military background, General Yeosock is running the Army show in Saudi Arabia because he combined three disparate svecialities. First, he is one of the first generation of Army war-games specialists, having graduated from Penn State as an industrial engineer and taken a post-gradu- ate degree in systems analysis from the U.S. Naval Post Gradu- ate School during the McNamara heyday. Second, he is one of the few U.S. generals. who already had experience working with Saudi generals. In the early 1980s, he ah: h: [0 \f General: Army commander putting year of war game computing to the test spent two years in Saudi Arabia as the senior U.S. adviser to the Saudi National Guard. Third, he has bumped his way up the ladder, commanding big- ger and bigger U.S. tank units. Between 1986 and 1988, he was chief of staff of one of the most prestigious Army divisions, the Texas-based ist Cavalry. In Saudi Arabia, General Yeosock said, he and his subordi- nates continue to refine the de- ployment plan. They are using the same computer-assisted techniques that helped create the Internal Look 90 plan. “What you can now do ina matter of minutes would take months if you worked out the fi- nite details [by hand],” he said. For instance, the general said he could use his computers in Saudi Arabia to figure out how to put together the right array of sealift ships to move a military unit if ordered to do so. His computers will tell him how many of a specific ship might be needed, where they can be found on the high seas and how they could best be loaded. Though General Yeosock wouldn’t talk about this in detail, his comments suggested that this kind of calculation is duck soup for the 3rd Army computers be- cause they are equipped with data-base programs that keep track of the location and capacity_| of all available ships in the world. “I can change a force list to- day and put it against an avail- ability of ships,’ he said, “be- cause of the data being captured in terms of ship capacity. ... I can come out with another array in minutes that would otherwise have taken scores of smart guys figuring things out with their slide rules.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 25, 1990 (Continued) AN INTERVIEW WITH: tok ‘Stormin’ Norman’ Gen, H.

H. Norman Schwarzkopf is asking the American public to be patient, saying that 2 ground war in Hie desert could “last a long, The 56-year-old West Pointer — contrary tohis nickname of “Stormin’ Norman” — said he still hopes the huge allied troop deploy- ment will cause Iraq to withdraw from Ku- wait, leading to an international settlement _ that would allow him to take his troops home from Saudi Arabia without a single combat casualty. General Schwarzkopf twice wounded in Vietnam, said the average U.S. ground soldier will experience the same “profanity that is war” that soldiers went through in Vietnam mand World War II if'a full ground war breaks * out, “We have developed more sophisticated ways to destroy things,” he said in a wide- ranging interview, his most extensive since Operation Desert Shield got under way. “It will certainly be a much more lethal battle- field. But to the fundamental soldier on the ground, it is still going to be a question of life and death, | “War is a profanity because, let’s face it, you've got two opposing sides trying to settle their differences by killing as many of each other as they can,” he said. “That is sort of a profane thing when you get right down to it. So i there is going to be war, iti is going to be tas profs th had.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - The top American general in Saudi Arabia disclosed that he and the top Saudi command- er, Lt. Gen. Prince Khalid bin Sultan, have now agreed on a “very, very comprehensive, inte- grated defensive plan” for pull- ing together the 340,000 allied notebook his organization chart ‘that shows how the top com- manders of the American, French, British, Arab and other forces have agreed to fight in what amounts to a single, loose- jointed harness. General Schwarzkopf said he and General Khalid meet almost every day to decide overall mili- tary strategy and approve plans developed by their respective planning officers. As an example of actions that he and General Khalid have taken together, General Schwarzkopf disclosed that he and the Saudi general issued parallel orders to separate an American and a Syri- an unit that originally were as- signed to ee an sectors in October 28, General Schwarzkopf said he took the matter to General Kha- lid when he learned that the Syri- an unit was expected to bring So- viet-made armored vehicles that were identical to Iraqi armored weapons. After discussion, the two gen- erals agreed to reduce the risk of accidental clashes by inserting another Arab unit that has Amer- ican-made weapons — presum- ably the Egyptians — between the Americans and Syrians. He said that one level below them, moment-to-moment coor- dination is carried out through a joint Saudi-American operations center known as “the C3IC” (pronounced See-Cubed Eye See). ' C3IC is short for the Coali- tion, Coordination, Communica- tion and Integration Center. It is a top-secret Saudi-American fa- cility near Central Command headquarters where operations officers, planners and intelli- gence officers work in shifts around the clock. ah: h: [0 \f"

Though General Yeosock wouldn’t talk about this in detail, his comments suggested that this kind of calculation is duck soup for the 3rd Army computers be- cause they are equipped with data-base programs that keep track of the location and capacity_| of all available ships in the world. “I can change a force list to- day and put it against an avail- ability of ships,’ he said, “be- cause of the data being captured in terms of ship capacity. ... I can come out with another array in minutes that would otherwise have taken scores of smart guys figuring things out with their slide rules.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 25, 1990 (Continued) AN INTERVIEW WITH: tok ‘Stormin’ Norman’ Gen, H.

H. Norman Schwarzkopf is asking the American public to be patient, saying that 2 ground war in Hie desert could “last a long, The 56-year-old West Pointer — contrary tohis nickname of “Stormin’ Norman” — said he still hopes the huge allied troop deploy- ment will cause Iraq to withdraw from Ku- wait, leading to an international settlement _ that would allow him to take his troops home from Saudi Arabia without a single combat casualty. General Schwarzkopf twice wounded in Vietnam, said the average U.S. ground soldier will experience the same “profanity that is war” that soldiers went through in Vietnam mand World War II if'a full ground war breaks * out, “We have developed more sophisticated ways to destroy things,” he said in a wide- ranging interview, his most extensive since Operation Desert Shield got under way. “It will certainly be a much more lethal battle- field. But to the fundamental soldier on the ground, it is still going to be a question of life and death, | “War is a profanity because, let’s face it, you've got two opposing sides trying to settle their differences by killing as many of each other as they can,” he said. “That is sort of a profane thing when you get right down to it. So i there is going to be war, iti is going to be tas profs th had.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - The top American general in Saudi Arabia disclosed that he and the top Saudi command- er, Lt. Gen. Prince Khalid bin Sultan, have now agreed on a “very, very comprehensive, inte- grated defensive plan” for pull- ing together the 340,000 allied notebook his organization chart ‘that shows how the top com- manders of the American, French, British, Arab and other forces have agreed to fight in what amounts to a single, loose- jointed harness. General Schwarzkopf said he and General Khalid meet almost every day to decide overall mili- tary strategy and approve plans developed by their respective planning officers. As an example of actions that he and General Khalid have taken together, General Schwarzkopf disclosed that he and the Saudi general issued parallel orders to separate an American and a Syri- an unit that originally were as- signed to ee an sectors in October 28, General Schwarzkopf said he took the matter to General Kha- lid when he learned that the Syri- an unit was expected to bring So- viet-made armored vehicles that were identical to Iraqi armored weapons. After discussion, the two gen- erals agreed to reduce the risk of accidental clashes by inserting another Arab unit that has Amer- ican-made weapons — presum- ably the Egyptians — between the Americans and Syrians. He said that one level below them, moment-to-moment coor- dination is carried out through a joint Saudi-American operations center known as “the C3IC” (pronounced See-Cubed Eye See). ' C3IC is short for the Coali- tion, Coordination, Communica- tion and Integration Center. It is a top-secret Saudi-American fa- cility near Central Command headquarters where operations officers, planners and intelli- gence officers work in shifts around the clock. ah: h: [0  Schwarzkopf: Gulf war would ‘kill an awful lot of people’ The C3IC is managed jointly fF by U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Paul R. Schwartz, who reports to Gener- al Schwarzkopf, and Saudi Brig. Gen. Abdullah Batil Harbi, who reports to General Khalid. ‘General Schwarzkopf gave this description of how the C3IC | operates. “Let’s say for some reason we got an early warning report that it looked like the Iraqis were get- ting ready to fire Scud missiles. ... That information would go right into the C3IC. And the C3IC - would make sure that that infor- mation was distributed to every unit we have out there in the } field.” He said a big part of his the- ater commander’s job is trying to plan “the smart way” to counter the Iraqis “so that I don’t just wantonly destroy human life.” Once a war starts, he said, it would be up to field generals be- low him to lead troops in battle — in the same fashion that Lt. Gen. George S. Patton commanded the tank breakthrough into Germany under Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhow- er’s overall direction. As a strategic planner, Gener- al Schwarzkopf said he can envi- sion several possible “levels of escalation” between today’s stage of mobilization for combat and possible full-scale ground war. Among them: @A partial pullout of Iraqi forces from southern Kuwait — followed by some form of allied response. a“Some sort of an interna- tional incident” that would lead to what he described as a “skir- mish.” After the “skirmish” there would be a military pause while ‘a lot of people would come to their senses” and call off the war. If fighting cannot be avoided, General Schwarzkopf said, he and his Saudi counterpart would do everything to end it quickly. He said Washington has giv- en him full ery to pursue a Spec. Michael Hixon/U.S. Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf says he hopes the huge allied troop de- ployment will persuade Iraq to remove its invasion force from Kuwait. out imposing the kind of target- ing “restrictions” that in his opinion cost extra American ca- sualties in Vietnam. Yet he said that, even without such “restrictions,” his two tours in Vietnam have left him skepti- cal about whether unquestioned allied air superiority can force Iraqi ground forces to stop fighting. He recalled several experi- ences as a U.S. battalion com- mander in Vietnam when Viet Cong units “came right out of their holes and fought like dev- ils” even after their villages had been devastated by American ar- tillery and air strikes. He acknowledged that open Saudi terrain would make it harder for an enemy to hide and that Iraqi front-line units are showing signs of deteriorating morale. Nonetheless, the eight-year Iran-Iraq war has convinced him that desert wars don’t always end in lightning victories. . Even troops with bad morale fight hard when the battle be- gins, he said, because “they are fighting to stay alive. So just be- cause you hear reports of bad morale, you can’t assume that the entire military is going to col- lapse in the event battle starts.” If fighting does break out, he said, “I hope it is not going to last along, long time. But it could. We didn’t think Vietnam was going to last a long, long time. We didn’t think Korea was going to last a long, long time. And they did. Some people thought that when they invaded Normandy, it wasn’t going to last a long, long time.” General Schwarzkopf spoke for 90 minutes Wednesday with a Journal-Constitution correspon- dent in a briefing room in his headquarters, whose location is kept secret because of the poten- tial threat of terrorist attack. As a tape recorder turned, the 6-foot- 3, four-star general sat near a sheaf of classified military maps that were covered with, camou- flage cloth. He also said: wThe Saudi oil complex is now immune from serious dam- age even if Saddam Hussein tries to carry out his Sept. 23 threat to destroy all Middle East oil fields. But a ground war would damage the oil fields in occupied Kuwait — the site of the world’s third- largest oil reserves, behind Sau- di Arabia and Iraq. @ Washington is considering his recommendations on how long-serving troops such as those of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) could be rotated home after “‘six to eight months” in the gulf region. While making no commitments, he said. it “could be” that some units that have served longest will go home by Christmas. = The United States and Arab ground forces will conduct their first “large-scale” combined ex- ercise in coming weeks.

H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of Ameri- can forces in Saudi Arabia, The questioner is Journal-Constitution correspondent Joseph Al- bright. The interview, conducted last week, has been edited for length. Q: As the former commander of Georgia’s favorite division, the 24th Infantry Division . (Mechanized), how long can troops like the 24th Mech, which are out in the desert, stick it out before they have to be relieved? Christmas? Memorial Day? A: We are looking at a rotation policy right now. Vietnam, it was one year. I think the con- ditions here that a lot of the people are living under are probably more austere in some cases, particularly the 24th, for instance. ’... But I tell you right now, we are looking at a ro- tation policy, and that rotation policy will prob- ably be focused in the six- to eight-month time frame to do unit rotations. It’s a very complicat- ed thing, Joe, because first I have to maintain combat readiness. 0: Do you think there will be any big units rotated home by Christmas? A: There could be. Q: Anthony Cordesman of Georgetown Uni- versity told a Brookings Institution conference on Sept. 12 that the cost of winning even a limit- ed objective like liberating Kuwait is so high and filled with risk that we should understand the reasons for patience. He said that it was ab- surd to think that the war could be won by “a scalpel and high technology” ... that there would be thousands of casualties. Is this correct? A: We shouldn’t assume away any war. ... You have to define what a win is. If a win is Sad- dam Hussein withdrawing from Kuwait and re- storing the country of Kuwait back to its peo- ple, you can have a win without a single casual- I think Cordesman is talking about the ground battle. And he is absolutely correct. You just have to look across that border and recognize that there are 400,000-plus Iraqi troops over there and more than 3,000 tanks. If they choose to fight, and if we have to fight them, then it is a dirty war. That is all that there is to it. ‘ Q: And there will be American casualties? A: Of course. If we have to fight that kind of war, there are going to be. ... : Cordesman, there, is obviously talking about an offensive campaign in which we would go in and fight eyeball on the ground. ... You know there are an awful lot of these [pause], yeah, I guess I’ll say this: There are an awful lot of these people that keep saying that WE ought to go over there and do this, WE ought to go over there and do that, but they are not talking about being over here with us when it happens. The WE that they are talking about is the hundreds of thousands of American sol- diers, sailors, Air Force and Marines. They are the people who are going to be doing it, and therefore we’ve got to be careful when we just cavalierly say, “Oh, yeah, we ought to go in and do this, that and the other thing.” We ought to think a little bit about what the cost is going to be. Not only us, but to the enemy, too. ; Q: I have wondered whether the American planners have been taking into account the long-range implications to our interests of a war in which we go in and kill 10,000 Iraqis. ‘ A: Sure, I think about that a lot. One of the things I told my commanders over here is that we don’t want to win the war and lose the peace. \"The file on Schwarzkopf BORN: Aug. 22, 1934, in Trenton, N.J., the son of an Army general who head- ed the New Jersey State Police at the time of the Lindbergh kidnapping and who subse- quently commanded the shah's police in lran from 1942 to 1948.

NICKNAMES: “The Bear” and ‘'Stor- min’ Norman.” RARASEARSEL SS Lae Ae LR — Joseph Albright Ast Lt. Steven Gover/U.S. Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, says, “You don’t go out there and say, ‘OK, let's have a nice war to- day.’. .. We've just got to be patient.” We're over here for what I think are the long- term best interests of the entire world. ... Q: A lot of servicemen’s parents ... are worried about how the Saudis, Americans, Egyptians, Syrians and everyone else could ac- tually pull behind the same harness. Nobody in history has had experience trying to meld to- gether a force that includes so many nations’ fighting forces. Is there an agreed-upon com- mand structure and, if so, what is it? Could you sketch out a diagram? A: There is a good, agreed-upon command structure in place today. . . . It is exactly identi- cal to what existed in Vietnam. In Vietnam, CO- MUS-MACV (Commander U.S.-Military Allied Command-Vietnam) commanded all the U.S. and President [Nguyen Van] Thieu command- ed all the Vietnamese forces in Vietnam. A lot of people forget that we had Australians in we had Koreans in, Vietnam, we. had British forces in Vietnam: And every one of those nations was sensitive about their sover- eignty and how their forces were used. They didn’t willingly give their forces over to some commander from some other sovereign state who would use them as he saw fit. That is very much what we have here. Q: Going back to Vietnam, did they have sectors [of geographical responsibility]? A: In any military operation, even if it in- volves only a U.S. division commander who is working side by side with another division commander, one of the things they work out very, very carefully before they ever go into battle is coordination of so many different things. You know, coordination of fire, so that one fellow’s artillery isn’t falling on another fellow’s troops. ... We are making sure that we don’t have ‘fratricide.’ I will tell you very candidly, when we were | putting together some of these plans, the Syrian unit that was going to come in here was going to be on the left flank of the U.S. unit. I very quick- ly pointed out that that is not a good idea be- cause ... the Syrians have exactly the same kind of equipment that the Iraqis have. So it would make it very difficult for my troops to identify the tank that was in front of them and say, “That is an Iraqi tank,” or, “That is a Syri- an tank.” So what we did is geographically sep- arate the Syrians. Q: Is there one committee that unifies you with the Saudis at the top? A: Yeah, there is one committee. It is called General Khalid [Saudi Lt. Gen. Prince Khalid bin Sultan, commander of Joint Forces] and Norm Schwarzkopf. . ... We have an integrated command center downstairs in the basement. We have Saudis and Americans sitting side by side. ' Q@: Do you feel you are pretty much ready from a planning point of view if you have: to fight a war? A: Sure. I’ve been ready for a long time. 0: You've gotten better at it? A: Yeah, exactly. But if you go down and talk to the corps commanders, the last thing they do every night ... is make sure they are ready to fight the next day if they have to. ... We can defend the kingdom of Saudi Arabia re- gardless of what [Saddam] throws at us. 0: As to whether you could recapture Ku- wait today. ... A: That is a whole different question. Re- member, our mission is to deterand defend. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 28, 1990 > Schwarzkopf: Gulf war would ‘kill an awful lot of people’ Q: You have been quoted in C.D.B, Bryan's book “Friendly Fire” as remarking on how hard it was for you as an Army battalion com- mander in Vietnam to visit wounded soldiers in the hospital. As the overall commander here, how do you minimize casualties? A; Tam not one of these guys who is just go- ing to waste American lives by throwing people needlessly in frontal attacks up against the ene- my if] can avoid doing that. My job is to try and figure out the smart way to do this, whatever my mission is, so that I don’t just wantonly de- stroy human life. And to my mind, the way you do that is to make sure that you maximize your strength against his weaknesses, 0: What role does patience play? hs: Everything. Right now, we have people saying, “OK, enough of this business; let’s get on with it.” Golly, the sanctions have only been in effect about a couple of months, We had the U.N. resolution, but it took some time before we got the ships out and really started enforcing the sanctions. And now we are starting to see evidence that the sanctions are pinching. So why should we say, “OK, gave ’em two months, didn’t work. Let's get on with it and kill a whole bunch of people”? That’s crazy. That's crazy. You don’t go out there and say, “OK, let’s have a nice war today.” God Almighty, that war could last along, long time and kill an awful lot of people. And so we've just got to be patient. 0: Would you give us your best assessment of what is going on inside the Iraqi Republican Guards and other elite units on which Saddam has to depend? What about Iraqi military morale? A: The Republican Guards are feeling pret- ty good about themselves right now. They were the ones that got to go down and take all the booty out of Kuwait and take it back home with them. That is the way Saddam has always taken care of the Republican Guards. But a lot of the other regular army forces that are deployed to Kuwait, we get reports about them almost every day: They don’t have food, they don’t have water, they have not been paid for a very long time, But they can’t go. home because if they go home, they will get killed, So I would say they probably have some morale problems. The unfortunate part about battle is that even units that have bad morale sometimes fight very well. When the battle starts, they are fighting to stay alive. 0: What you've said suggests that you be- lieve our air power superiority has not guaran- teed the outcome. A: We had incredible air power in Vietnam. We were totally unopposed in the air in Viet- nam. ... I can remember many times in Viet- nam where we sat outside a village and getting ready to go into a village, and we pounded it with both artillery and air ahead of time, and you sat out there and said, “There is absolutely nothing that could live through that,” and you call off the air and went into the village and they came right out of their holes and fought like devils, 0: You were quoted in Bryan's book as say- ing, “War is a profanity. ... Nobody is more anti-war than an intelligent person who has been to war.” If a war happens here, how will it be different from World War II or Vietnam for the average serviceman? A: To the soldier on the ground, it is going to seem exactly the same. We have developed more sophisticated ways to destroy things. It will certainly be a more lethal battlefield. But to the fundamental soldier on the ground, it is still going to be a question of life and death, It is going to be the profanity that is war. It is a question of surviving and depending on your buddy to your left and your right. It is nota fun thing, War is a profanity because, let’s face it, you've got two opposing sides trying to settle their differences by killing as many of each other as they cal That is sort of a profane 0: Reports from the financial markets say that a protracted war would severely damage world markets no matter how the war came out. As you figure it, what are the chances that a war could be over in two weeks without sig- nificant damage to the oil installations? A: .... thateto talk about hypothetical {mat- ters]. But if we really, truly get into a ground war, OK, it is hard to envision that happening without damage to the Kuwaiti oil fields. ... But I don’t think you are going to see a lot of damage to the Saudi oil fields. ... They are very well defended right at the present time. 0: Congress issued a document back in the mid-1970s which examined the vulnerability of the gulf oil fields. It laid out in considerable de- tail in unclassified form the choke points in the Saudi oil fields. You probably know them by heart. A: I just don’t think the Iraqis have the ca- - pability to do that [damage] today. 0: Did they back on Aug. 2? A: Aug. 2, they could have just driven down the highway and just taken them all. It would have been that simple. Who was going to stop them? - 0: When was the point when you felt they couldn't move south? Was it the arrival of the 24th Mech? A: Yeah. I would say that, as a military commander, I felt a lot better when the 24th Mech came in country because, of course, they ‘had a heavy anti-tank capability themselves. And the 101st Airborne came in, and they had their attack helicopters, and that gave us a bet- ter capability. Q: Discuss why the 3rd Brigade of the 24th Infantry — the one made up of the Georgia weekenders — was not sent here? Can the re- serves hack it on the front lines? A: Sure. I used to command that brigade. I used to command the 24th Mech. The 48th Bri- gade was what I used to call my 3rd Brigade. The issue on the round-out brigades is a very simple issue. Right now, the authority is in place to call them up for six months and six months only. ... You train them up for two months, then you get them over here. ... It is probably another month before you get them up to the front where they can do you any good, Now three months have passed. ... $0 you look at the backside of the thing and say, “It’s probably go- ‘ing to take us another month to get them loaded up, back on the boats, muster them out of the service.” So what does that give you? Two months in country, If you went out and talked to some of those guys in the 24th Mech, they'd tell you it took them a month before they felt comfortable that they really knew the terrain, knew the area, know how to operate, were acclimated and that sort of thing. Given my choice of a unit, the one T want over here is not one that I am only going to have for two months, I want the unit that I can have in country as long as I can possibly keep them. .. Another thing you've got to remember — how do you think the 82nd (Airborne Division} would feel if they saw a unit come in country three months after they got here, and that unit stayed here two months and turned around and went home, and they [the 82nd} were still here, There is an equity thing here. And I don’t think the National Guard wants the reputation of “ast in, first out.” 0. Could it end up that you win this one without having to kill anybody? A: that i exactly what it is all about, ... Nothing would make me happier than to have presided over this entire buildup, to have de- ployed our forces, to have been ready to fight, and then have Saddam Hussein withdraw from Kuwait, and have an international settlement ' and restore peace and stability in this area, and take every single American home and not have lost one single American in battle, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 28, 1990 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Egyptians crunched in economics in gulf By Marcia Kunstel MAIDUM, Egypt — Goats and chickens vie with half-naked chil- dren for space on the dirt lanes of this primitive agricultural vil- lage. Teeming homes and work sites are more crowded than usual now, as the Egyptian countryside strains under an influx of men from Iraq and Kuwait who con- tinue arriving jobless and most of them virtually penniless. “I am bankrupt, broke,” said Hussein Abdel Fattah Ali, 35, who returned last month from Iraq. “I had been sending plenty of money back. Now my family is fed up. My wife is ready to kick me out.” The Gulf crisis stemming from Iraq’s Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has sent more than 375,000 work- ers back to a country where some economists already esti- mated unemployment at nearly 20 percent. It has decimated the tourist industry and had spin-off effects everywhere from the Suez Canal to a candy stand in a Cairo market, where the vender said he can’t sell 40-cent chocolate bars to money-conscious customers these days. Uhe regime of President Hosni Mubarak is offering encourage- ment to an increasingly wary population, giving wide publicity to the financial windfalls Egypt expects to receive for throwing its lot with the West and the rich Arab oil nations in the Gulf crisis. For siding with them against Iraq, Egypt is getting low-cost loans, new grants, promises of more jobs for Egyptians in the Gulf, and the cancellation of pos- sibly $15 billion in foreign debt. In the long run this aid is sure to make a difference in Egypt's precarious economic state. In the here and now, however, repercussions of the Gulf crisis are hitting Egyptian families squarely in the pocketbook. In Maidum, a village about 50 miles southwest of Cairo, Ali is scraping by like most returnees with help from relatives and, when he is lucky, part-time work mixing concrete for a couple of dollars a day. %%4‘‘Now they work two days a week maybe. They do nothing the rest of the time,” said Ahmed Abdel Motaleb, a university stu- dent who counts more than a score of his relatives returned to this area. “The standard of living has become worse and worse. The jobs available had not been enough for the people here even before all these came back,”’ he said. The biggest source of foreign currency here last year, $3.5 billion, was remittances from workers like Ali and Motaleb’s relatives who sent a chunk of their pay home every month. N has come from Iraq and Kuwait since the invasion, and that will cost the Egyptian economy an estimated $1 billion over a year’s time, economists say. The impact reaches beyond the families of these newly unem- ployed men come home. Zekariah, a tile layer who lives in a lower middle class neighbor- hood in Cairo, is feeling a small pinch even though he didn’t work abroad. The problem is too much manpower. In the day-labor system here, men sit at a local cafe every morning and wait for an employ- er in search of workers, he ex- plained. “Now another ten people come to the cafe and want to work. So where they used to ask for ten piasters (for piecework) now they take five piasters,’’ said Zekariah. He used to make one Egyptian pound (which is 100 piasters, the equivalent of about 40 cents) for laying the same area of tile that now earns him only 90 piasters. It is this neighborhood where the one pound (40-cent) chocolate bars no longer sell. Affected in yet another way was Negwa, who was talking with Zekariah and some neighbors last week at the perimeter of a mar- ketplace where unlicensed ven- dors were doing scant business at their food and trinket stands. Negwa and her husband had worked at a restaurant in Jordan, where they lived with their three children. They left three weeks ago out of fear of war. “Now I'm not doing anything. I just lay around at home,” she said. Negwa’s husband is seeking work In the tourist trade, Egyptians are getting crunched from the top to the bottom of the economic scale. Tourism is the second largest source of foreign exchange in Egypt, totalling about §2 billion last year. Iraq’s aggression, fol- lowed by a countering buildup of U.S. and other foreign troops in the Gulf, have produced a war scare sharp enough to frighten away 30 to 50 percent of the tourist trade during peak season. If business continues slack, half the annual tourism income could be kaput. One of the premier tourist ho- tels in Cairo, the Nile Hilton, has shut down five out of 13 residen- tial floors in what should be the busiest time of the year, accord- ing to Ashraf Abaza, assistant front office manager. ‘Any piece of business coming, we have to negotiate (the rates) with him,” Abaza said. ‘We're taking in anybody.” The salaries of what he called “guest contact’? employees are linked to the number of guests registered in the hotel, so every- one from executives like himself to the housemen who clean rooms has been touched. “For me, it lowered my salary by 30 percent,” he said. The disaster has hit as well over in Suez, where hotels cater to ship hands transfering to and from vessels going through the Suez Canal, as well as to tourists en route to spectacular diving sites on the Red Sea. af Santa Maria Times (California) - October 28, 1990 \f"

Mr. Pri- makov’s mission had gotten an unexpected boost with the sched- Baghdad for Sunday night, after which Mr. Primakov was sched- uled to go to Saudi Arabia for more discussions today. ' Mr. Primakov’s latest round of talks in the region came as key players consistently have muted the more bellicose approaches of past weeks and were expressing hopes that Saddam may be on the verge of compromise. Both Soviet and American of- ficials expressed views that Iraqi leaders were reassessing their past hard refusal to withdraw from Kuwait, which Iraq seized in an Aug. 2 invasion, spawning the crisis. The Soviets were instrumen- tal in delaying a U.N. Security Council vote Sunday on a resolu- tion that would declare Iraq re- sponsible for war damages in Kuwait and could lead to Iraqi leaders’ being tried as war crimi- nals. Mr. Primakov’s mission was widely viewed as the reason the Soviets wanted to avoid un- settling Iraqi leaders further with another anti-Iraqi reso- lution. Soviet President Mikhail S. nals that it realizes the gulf crisis cannot be resolved by issuing ul- timatums. . uling of a second talk session in — In a surprise move, Iraq said Sunday that it was halting gaso- ‘line rationing imposed earlier in response to global economic sanctions. The cancellation of the Tationing was reported by the of- ficial Iraqi News Agency, which also said Iraq’s oil minister had been fired and replaced by Sad- ‘dam’s son-in-law, The rationing was imposed ‘not because Iraq was short of oil — it controls 20 percent of the world’s supply — but reportedly because the additives needed for gasoline refining were affected by the embargo. At the time, Iraqi officials blamed the sanctions for causing the shortage. But the news agen- cy said the Oil Ministry had mis- calculated the amount of chemi- cal additives necessary to refine crude oil into gasoline and other products. In Honolulu, President Bush said Sunday that he believes the buildup of military forces in the gulf confronting Iraq is having an effect on Saddam. “T think as he sees the U.S. forces moving in conjunction with many Arab country forces, in conjunction with many Euro- pean country forces, on land and on the sea, he’s taking another look because we are deadly seri- ous,” Mr. Bush said. The Soviets are closely guarding the substance of Mr. Primakov’s talks and are avoid- ing any characterization of the round of visits, which included Syria and Egypt, as a last-ditch effort to achieve a peaceful solu:., tion. “Primakov's mission ‘is not’ the last hope,” Soviet Foreign Minister Edward A. Shevard- nadze said in Spain. © “There is always the very last chance or the last, last chance” for success, said a Soviet diplo- mat in Cairo, responding to re- ports in some Persian Gulf news- papers that Mr. Primakov’s visit may be the last opportunity for diplomacy to succeed. A knowledgeable source said Mr. Primakov was not present- ing specific proposals in his meetings Sunday with the Iraqi president and foreign minister, but has been maneuvering with the possibilities laid out by all parties. _ “The only answer is uncondi- tional withdrawal,” the source said, but added that that did not rule out the possibility of “sub- terranean agreements between Arab brothers” regarding possi- ble concessions to Iraq after a withdrawal. Recent statements by both Saudi and Kuwaiti leaders sug- gested that an answer may lie in exactly that — the promise that Iraq’s complaints against Kuwait will get.a fair hearing once Sad- dam gets his soldiers out of Kuwait. A source close to the Egyp- tian government said. Sunday that such a deal might include as- surances that a longstanding Iraq-Kuwait border dispute would be submitted to an inter- national tribunal for arbitration.
