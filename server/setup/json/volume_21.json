        "ocr_text": " PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT Peace brings joy, questions for Kuwaitis Twice during September, Marcia Kunstel made day trips from Baghdad to occupied Ku- wait City. After its liberation, she revisited the shattered capi- tal, linking up with her husband, Joseph Albright, who had been covering the ground war with a U.S. artillery unit. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Jgumal-Constitution correspondents | KUWAIT CITY — Fires bleed into the nighttime horizon like a perpetual sunrise. Multi- story hotels wear black aprons from the arson that gutted them. Goats’ and cows graze around city villas, and swarming flies are incorrigible pests. + None of these conditions ex- isted in September, one month into the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. i Trash piles are bigger. Bashed, cannibalized cars litter the roadsides, and water and power systems that were intact six months ago are wrecked. * But the greatest difference in Kuwait is in the people. It is the difference between a coun- try occupied and one liberated. + Last September, when Iraqi soldiers populated the streets of uwait, residents didn’t stray far from their homes. Today people are everywhere, and they all have stories to tell. They have broken the ghostly aura of an abandoned city. ‘ What they are saying is touching, inspiring, sad and of- ten disquieting, not only about what happened under Iraqi rule . Qut also about what is happen- ihg now. Abdullah Nibari, an econo- mist and former member of the Parliament that Sheik Jaber Ah- med Sabah dissolved in 1986, said it’s a dangerous time for Kuwaitis who oppose the emir’s authoritarian regime. , “‘We have to change houses every night,” he said. ‘‘We know hot to walk alone.” His friend amad Jouan, a lawyer and member of the opposition move- ment, was shot two days after liberation by someone who came to a secret entrance to his house and asked for him by name. He lies paralyzed in a hospital, Mr. Nibari said. Mr. Nibari said he fears that militias are being formed by the sons of senior sheiks and Cabi- net ministers and that they may be hunting down opposition ac- tivists, not just Iraqis and the Palestinians who collaborated with them. “Everyone has his own mili- tia. They are holding people, trying them and executing them,” said Mr. Nibari, who was .interviewed in his expansive, luxurious villa in a suburb of the capital. “We have no way of get- ting complete security.” As Kuwaitis wait for their government to. unravel the chaos the Iraqi occupiers left behind — they await electricity, water, food, a semblance of nor- mality — some families are an- guished at prospects that every- thing will indeed get back to proper order. Yousra Abri, 30, is among them. She and her husband took in one of the babies the Iraqis reportedly disconnected from incubators when they stripped the hospitals of major equip- ment to carry back to Iraq. Hospital workers saved the children they could, and social agencies found temporary homes for them. Now Ms. Abri fears that the parents of 8- month-old Walla may be found, and she will lose the baby she has nursed to well-being. “I can’t give her back,”’ said Ms. Abri, her eyes welling with tears as she held the tiny infant to her chest. ‘‘We’ve been mar- ried seven years and no children.” One legacy of occupation that will not soon be overcome is the thousands of Kuwaitis who were tortured or killed or who disappeared. Every Kuwaiti has a son or cousin or neighbor touched by tragedy. Wafa Hashem said her son is lucky that he was merely ques- tioned and beaten by Iraqi sol- diers. He was with her last week to celebrate liberation with the crowds that gather daily on the corniche outside the U.S. Em- bassy. Her neighbor was less A soldier tries to keep order as Kuwaitis jam a kerosene distribution center in Kuwait City on Satur- lucky: She was raped and her breasts were mutilated, Ms. Ha- shem said. f Maj: Jamal Hassan, a physi- cal therapist at a military hospi- tal, also was fortunate. An active member of the Kuwaiti resis- tance, he never was discovered. His two brothers-in-law, howev- er, were taken away by the Ira- qis and have not been heard from since. “God help us,” he said. Fikrai Guda, 20, a Palestin- ian student, fears that the hostil- ity Kuwaitis are showing toward Palestinians will grow worse. Palestinians routinely are spread-eagled face down on the ground while soldiers level guns at their heads and frisk them. “TI was born here,” Mr. Guda said. “I am Kuwaiti from the tip of the feet to the top of my head.” But he proclaimed his pride to be a Palestinian as well, and his dismay at the stand tak- en by Palestine Liberation Or- ganization Chairman Yasser Arafat on the side of Iraq. “The PLO does not repre- sent all Palestinians,” he said. “We are Arabs and this is an Arab country. We don’t like what Iraq did.” The PLO’s position, along with the acknowledged collabo- ration with the Iraqis by some Palestinians, has left Palestin- ians in a tenuous position in Kuwait. “They are very mad at us,” Mr. Guda said. “We are very afraid of them. We think a very dangerous situation may devel- op between us.”’ Despite the pain and fears that remain, the vast majority of Kuwaiti residents are joyous at their liberation. For days they have been rediscovering their city, exploring places where they haven’t been in months and absorbing the damage and de- The Associated Press day.

Until early last week, Mr. Bush and his top advisers were in- tent on keeping pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein until he could be swept from power. They were prepared to do that even if it meant keeping American troops in Iraq and preventing Sad- dam’s army from using helicop- ters against the rebels. At an Oval Office meeting March 26, Mr. Bush and his top advisers reached a consensus that it was no longer prudent for the United States to keep Sad- dam from crushing the rebels. No authentic “insider” ac- counts have emerged about who said what at the meeting. The most illuminating record on the evolution of U.S. policy is a com- pilation of what has been report- ed publicly day by day: Feb. 15: Mr. Bush called on the Iraqi people to rebel. “And there’s another way for the the United Nations resolutions and rejoin the family of peace- loving nations.” March 1: Two days after the liberation of Kuwait, Mr. Bush renewed his appeal to the Iraqi my own view . . . the Iraqi people should put him aside, and that bloodshed to stop, and that is for — the Iraqi military and the Iraqi people to take matters in their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside and then [to] comply with in Iraq could produce instability. “In the first place, we never have felt that it was in the interest of the gulf or certainly of the United States to create a vacuum in Iraq. And we have not wanted an un- stable Iraq.” March 13: Mr. Bush warned Iraq not to use its combat heli- copters to attack civilians, saying there would be no permanent end of the war until Iraqi combat operations cease. March 14: Mr. Bush repeated his warning against Iraqi use of ioe ba wonnd capac hs te UN of lren by a fendoruceaiel Shiite regime as a “negative.” March 20: The Air Force shot down an Iraqi fighter-bomber over northern Iraq, and Mr. Bush said, “If other planes vio- late the agreement, they will be shot down.” But a senior admin- istration official was quoted as saying, “There clearly is a bit of ambiguity in our position. We've talked a lot about getting Saddam out, but the clear priority is to get the troops home.” March 22: Adding to the am- biguity, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. troops will re- main in southern Iraq “for some months to come” to maintain pressure on Saddam while the in- surrection by Iraqi rebel groups whittles away his power.

Final details of the agreement still have to be worked out, Mr. Talabani said after the meeting between Saddam and four Kurd- ish leaders. But Kurdish leaders told The Associated Press that Saddam had offered new terms for granting autonomy to Iraq’s 3.5 million Kurds. The White House had no offi- cial reaction. Some officials pri- vately said such an agreement could help entice fleeing Kurds to return to their homes. But they were skeptical of Saddam’s long- term intentions, warning that he might wait until U.S. and U.N. forces have left northern Iraq be- fore taking revenge on the Kurds. Mr. Talabani said all Kurdish refugees on the border with Tur- key and Iran were being told to return to their homes.

Some of the 1,500 U.S. troops stationed in northern Iraq said gunfire and even mortar rounds are a nightly event. “T don’t sleep at night,” said Army Spec. Alonza Carswell, 22, of Atlanta. The clashes are certain to shake the Kurds’ confidence in U.S. promises to provide them a refuge from Iraqi government retaliation.

Galvin, commander of the military relief operation called Task Force Pro- vide Comfort, confirmed at a press conference Thursday that there had been shooting in the town of Zakho. “We could hear it. We heard sporadic gunfire in the town. It shows that things are not entirely settled in Zakho,” General Gal- vin said. Soldiers living on the edge of town might find that an under- statement. “One night there was one hellacious firefight down here between the Kurds and Iraqis, There were mortars, heavy ma- chine guns,” said Capt. Law- rence Knapp, 31, a civil affairs officer from Buffalo, N.Y. He and others said the firing awakens them nightly. One Ma- rine stopped a journalist walking away from the operation com- mand center and warned her not to go into town alone. “There are a lot of guys with AK-47s down there. Iraqis,” said ist Lt. Demetrius Bellizaire, 31, of New Roads, La. He referred to Iraqi paramilitary police who have emerged as the main obsta- cle to coaxing the Kurds from their mountain retreats. After U.S. officials in Wash- ington threatened Thursday to use force to evict the Iraqi police, Iraq agreed to withdraw all but 50 from northern Iraq. A reporter passing through town in a taxi Thursday saw doz- is ~ UIOLINEU DOLUCCTIIET standing on the street in groups. In Silopi, Dayton Maxwell, deputy director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the U.S. Agency for International Development, gave details on the new effort to bring an advance contingent of 1,000 young, single Kurdish men from the moun- tains to Zakho to help the mili- tary build the tent communities. What Mr. Maxwell called a “hitch” in the plan developed Thursday when three carloads of Kurdish rebel fighters — armed and clad in traditional fighting regalia — appeared at the U.S. military site to discuss the pro- posal. The Americans have been dealing with Kurdish elders, not fighters, in an apparent effort to stay clear of Iraqi politics. Americans at the scene con- sulted with superiors in Wash- ington when the resistance lead- ers arrived and were told not to meet with them, Mr. Maxwell said, They will try again to talk with the elders today. Mr. Maxwell said he felt there would be little effect from the meeting in Baghdad on Wednesday at which Kurdish re- sistance leaders and Saddam re- portedly reached an agreement in principle for some form of Kurdish political autonomy as well as other political freedoms. “I don’t think it makes any difference. They [Kurds] have such little confidence in the Baghdad government it makes little difference in terms of their coming out of the hills,” Mr. Maxwell said.

Teams of.U.S., British and Dutch marines fanned out Friday morning through the partly de- serted town of Zakho, defusing oc- casional encounters between re- maining pro-Saddam Iraqi police officers and carloads of Kurdish guerrillas who had come to protect the townspeople. Zakho was an important guerril- la base during the Kurdish revolt in northern Iraq. It was retaken by Baghdad’s troops April 1. Witnesses said a British patrol arrived just in time Friday after- noon to talk the guerrillas and Iraqi police officers out of an armed street fight. Up on the hilltops, American Marines stood beside 105mm how- itzers and 81mm mortars. On a ridge line south of Zakho, allied in- fantrymen are occupying bunkers that were abandoned early this week by Iraqi forces, Especially at night, it is spooky duty for the several thousand Western ground forces camped out inside Iraq. On Friday night, for instance, journalists bivouack- ing with the troops heard three loud booms that sounded like ar- tillery rounds, as well as a few dis- tant rifle shots. That was not how it was sup- posed to happen. “We are here to protect everyone in the area, and we are trying to create an area where people can talk and not shoot each other,” said Fred Cuny, the senior State Department relief expert charged with trying to arrange the return of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees from their unsanitary camps across the Turkish border. His remark reflects a deepening American commitment to enforce some semblance of stability in this fertile slice of northern Iraq. In just a month, the Bush administration ‘has turned from a hands-off policy that allowed Iraqi President Sad- dam Hussein to crush the Kurdish rebellion to the present situation where the allies have forced Sad- dam's loyalists to vacate a sensi- tive border region.

In New York on Friday, Sec- retary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said the United Nations hoped to take over the refugee camps within a matter of days. But Officials at the State Department and the United Nations said the slow process of securing the area and enticing the Kurdish refugees’ out of the mountains may delay that for weeks. Iraqi police loyal to Saddam still were catching buses out of Zakho on Friday afternoon, a day after American military negotiators won an agreement from Iraqi au- thorities to remove all but a maxi- mum of 50 Iraqi police officers.

Dirty water is chief cause of deaths among refugees By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent ISIKVEREN REFUGEE CAMP, Tur- key — Things are getting a little less hor- rid for the 60,000 Iraqi Kurds stuck in this . Turkish mountain death hole. The rains have stopped. The nights are less frigid, Fewer Kurds are getting trampled in the rush for food packets. But that doesn’t mean much to Zekia Hussein, a mother of 10 who fled to the Isikveren Refugee Camp. Under a strip of blue plastic that serves as her family tent, Mrs. Hussein was preparing the body of her daughter Areen, 3, for burial Satur: day. She closed the child’s eyes and wrapped her in a blanket. - Outside and down an embankment, her husband — an Iraqi army deserter — was digging another grave. He knew the routine: their 1-year-old son Chalang died four days ago. Mrs. Hussein, the 35-year-old sol- dier’s wife, said she didn’t know what killed her son and daughter, Probably a combination of the cold nights and wrack: ing diarrhea, she said, “This is just destiny for me,” she said. A few hundred yards away, at a makeshift tent infirmary run by European volun- teers, Dutch nurse Nel Degraaf said about 12 to 14 Kurds die every day on these pes- tilent mountainsides at Isikveren, “The number is decreasing,” she said, “When we came here, it was about 20 a day.” Clearly, part of the explanation is that at this most photographed of the refugee camps, the world’s relief effort is geting: into high gear, If Vietnam was the first living room war, the Kurds are the first living room, refugee crisis, And now, with the world’s conscience aroused, most of the Kurds of Isikveren are being pulled through.

The stoic-looking Kurdish men were put to work helping U.S. Ma- rine construction crews finish this blue and white tent city that could hold 20,000 refugees — if the Kurds are willing to'retun from the mountains, Another 250 are expected to ar- rive today, but it was far from clear whether this was the start of the mass migration from the moun- tains that the Western allies have been trying to engineer, Nor was there any guarantee that the Kurds, who have been fleeing for weeks after President Saddam Hussein's forces put down a Kurdish rebellion, will move from the camp to their homes. An estimated 600,000 to 800,000 refugees are along the Turkish bor- der, and about 1 million have fled to the border with Iran. “We don’t want to lose our homeland,” said Fawzi Ramadan, 22, a student among the 250 men who were flown 30 miles from the Isikveren refugee camp in Turkey, “But we first want the Iraqi forces to withdraw from all of Kur- distan and have Kurdistan under control of the United Nations.” he said, “Today, Saddam Hussein is very weak. But if we give him the opportunity, he will revenge the Kurds later on.” Despite the fear held by many Kurds, about 6,000 Kurds volun- teered Saturday morning for the pick-and-shovel duty of helping set up the Zakho camp, said Day- ton Maxwell, the U.S. Agency for International Development's spe- cialist in charge of disaster relief. Perhaps more significantly, in the valleys and gorges scattered along the Iraqi side of the moun- tains, people were coming back on their own Saturday in groups of tens and twenties.

        "ocr_text": "U.N. prepares to run refugee camps By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT © Cox News Service ZAKHO, Iraq — A United Nations team unexpectedly drove into this allied-run tent city for Kurdish refugees yesterday to begin preparations to take over the “safe haven” camps that have threatened to mire U.S. forces in a permanent relief operation. Meanwhile, it was disclosed that U.S. and British troops have begun reconnais- Afghan and other refugee cam- paigns, said the United Nations will open a small headquarters in Zakho tomorrow. The United Nations eventually will run supply convoys both from Turkey in the north and from the Iraqi capital of Baghdad in the south, he said, symbolizing the Iraqi government’s approval both of the camps and of U.N. participation in running them. Until now the camp at Zakho, which received its second influx of about 300 Kurdish male refugees yesterday, has been supplied only from across the Turkish border and has had no help from international agencies. Iraq has objected to allied troops building the camp and virtu- ally becoming an occupying force. The United Nations also has re- fused to sanction the allied military actions, which have raised fears in the United States that American troops could spend months or long- er ministering to the needs of’Kurds who fled their homes in northern Iraq when their rebellion against the government failed. Demistura emphasized that U.N. agencies will not take over any camp until all military troops are re- moved. The British government moved yesterday to try to extricate allied troops from northern Iraq, winning European Community approval for its plan to set up a U.N. peacekeep- ing force as a replacement. The pro-_ posal now goes to the U.N. Security council. Military reconnaissance missions east of Zakho are concentrating on an area near the Iraqi town of Al Amadiyah, where camera-wielding troops in helicopters and on the ground are scouting for water and roads that define a usable site for a second big tent community. U.S. Army reserve officers in a sance missions 60 miles east Zakho, seeking a second campsite that will ex- pand the security zone allied forces are creating for returning Iraqi Kurds. The initial allied-protected security zone was to have encompassed a 630- square-mile area that stretched 18 miles south and 35 miles east of Zakho. The new zone is envisioned to be about 1,350 square miles. Also yesterday, renewed clashes were reported between Shiites and Iraqi forces near the southern city of Basra. civil- affairs unit, who have been alerted to head for the site today, said they believe at least two more refugee centers will be raised close to the Iraq-Turkey border. While plans proceed to set up more camps, delays caused by Turkish authorities, who fear that contraband goods will cross the border, have practically brought new construction in Zakho to a standstill. In southern Iraq, meanwhile, the U.S. Army began an airlift to Saudi Arabia of refugees who fear repri- sals from Iraqi security forces if they remain. That was seen as a ma- jor step toward the U.S. troops’ own departure. Five Air Force transport planes took off from Safwan with 339 Ira- qis, one-third of them _ children, bound for the Saudi border camp of Rafha. The refugees were allowed to take only what they could carry. Safwan lies in the Iraqi portion of a demilitarized zone that is to be pa- trolled by a 1,440-member U.N. ob- server force. Saddam’s birthday Saddam Hussein’s hometown, Tikrit, celebrated his 54th birthday yesterday with music, traditional dances and official predictions that he will be president for a long time to come. About 3,000 people attended the celebration, only a fraction of the usual 100,000 who come from all over the country. One organizer blamed transportation difficulties in the war-ravaged country. Government officials who attend- ed the celebration said Saddam re- mained popular despite the trauma of war. “The West would have to kill 18 million Iraqis before they could wound Saddam Hussein,” said Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of the na- tion’s ruling Revolutionary Com- mand Council. The fighting caused heavy casualties among government forces, and at least two personnel carriers were set ablaze, Iranian radio reported. The broadcast, monitored in London, also claimed rebels attacked government intelligence posts in the southern cities of Al-Amarah and Kar- bala, killing some Iraqi troops. The report could not be independently verified. The U.N. team that arrived in Zakho yesterday was led by Staffan Demistura, an envoy of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, Iran camps need water Water-purifying machines are desperately needed at Iranian refu- gee camps and could prevent the ill- nesses now ravaging the Kurds who fled Iraq, relief workers say. “Nothing that’s going to be done in the future is going to mean re thing unless we get water purifi- ers,”’ said Patrick Stanton, a relief worker from a private aid organiza- tion in England. Hundreds of thousands of refu- gees could face illness and death when sources of clean water dry up. That will happen as the number of Kurds in refugee camps grows. Iraqi army rebuilding? A respected British newspaper re- ported yesterday that Saddam is re- building his defeated army in defi- ance of the United Nations. The Observer quoted Jordanian sources as saying that the Iraqi leader has set up an operation in Jordan to illicitly buy military tech- nology and equipment. Jordan sup- ported Iraq during the gulf war. Iraq is also smuggling in spare parts and ammunition, reportedly from North Korea and China, the Observer cited U.S. sources as say- ing. In addition, it said arms fac- tories are being reassembled to pro- duce mortars, ammunition and ar- mor plate for tanks. To buy such weapons, Iraq uses money from accounts in Jordan and from funds in Swiss bank accounts, it said. iran to keep planes Iraqi planes flown to Iran during the war will be grounded until sta- bility returns to Iraq and a compre- -hensive peace pact is signed with Tehran, a state-run Iranian newspa- per said yesterday.

Iran said 22 planes would eventually be returned; Iraq claims that 148 planes are in Iran. Prisoners won’t go home About 14,000 Iraqi prisoners of war have refused to go home, the commander of Arab coalition forces said yesterday. Some sought Saudi guns and aid to topple Saddam but were rebuffed. “We'll just abide by international law on prisoners of war, which sim- ply says they stay in their camps un- til either they go back home or they go to other countries,” said the commander, Lt. Gen. Khalid bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia. The 14,000 are among the remain- ing 17,000 prisoners in custody. Jordan claims suffering Jordanian officials complained yesterday that the allied coalition that defeated Iraq is crippling Jor- dan’s economy by _ halting ships heading for its Red Sea port of Aqa- ba. The U.S. Navy, however, noted that the U.N. embargo on Iraq re- mains in effect. Jordan’s economy was devastated by the embargo imposed shortly after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2. Before the war, much of the car- go passing through Aqaba was bound for Iraq, and some allied offi- cials claim Jordan allowed some goods to flow into Iraq during the war. But Jordanian officials have com- plained that the coalition forces are still turning back goods clearly marked as bound for Jordan itself. Information for this story was also gathered by The Associated Press. Louisville Courier-Journal - April 29, 1991 \f"

His counterpart is a three- star general in the Iraqi army, whose white Mercedes is sometimes seen parked outside the main American military compound in this half-deserted Iraqi town. “This way we can talk out problems before they happen,” said Lt. Gen, John Shalikashvili, the senior American commander in charge of repatriating 400,000 Iraqi Kurds who have fled to Turkey, The general said that at his personal request, the Iragi military has dispatched Brig. Gen. Nushwan Dhanoun to live in Zakho and serve as the allied Iraqis to wl out of the way and avoid fire fights as the allies make a “safe haven” for Kurdish refugees, He said the American representative, Col, Richard Naab, has met Dhanoun “daily, even hourly” to work out potentially explosive details such as the partial withdrawal of Iraqi police officers from Zakho, In talks that seem to have few precedents, the victors and the vanquished agreed how many police Iraq can station in its northernmost city — and what they must wear, Iraq had sent in several hundred heavily armed policemen even as it accepted the allied demand that its soldiers must leave Zakho. For several days, their presence seemed likely to derail western hopes of repatriating Kurds from the mountains of Turkey, The American bargainer agreed that Iraq could retain a force of 50 “indigenous” policemen in Zakho, provided that the Iraqis wear American-supplied arm bands and carry special ID cards prepared by the allied occupation forces, “It has been extraordinarily useful,” Shalikashvili said, “He has been proper, open and forthcoming in our negotiations, He seems to have a fairly open line to Baghdad because he makes things happen.” One oddity in the arrangement is that the United States seems to be working more closely with the Iraqi military than it is with the military arm of the 1 Kurlsh minority, whose interests the allies Palm Beach Post - April 29, 1991 \f"

Refugee families began arriving Monday after U.S. military officials dis- patched patrols to order Kurdish guer- rillas to open mountain roadblocks. The movement also comes as French doctors reported that cholera had broken out in crowded refugee camps in Turkey. As of sundown, with the first fam- ilies arriving at the new camp near Zakho, there were only about eight func- tioning latrines for more than 1,000 blue and white family tents expected to hold several thousand people. Trucks carrying 960 more prefabri- cated latrines had been promised to ar- rive at midday from Turkey. But U.S. military officers said the shipment is stuck across the Turkish border in a line of several hundred aid trucks awaiting Turkish customs clearance. Also trapped at the border were two large tank trucks needed to give the camp a ready source of water. There had been plans to pipe clean water to the camp from a nearby spring or river, but the water pumps and pipes have not ar- rived from Turkey. There also were no portable cook stoves, flashlights or lanterns for the refugees. Dayton Maxwell, the senior U.S. offi- cial of the civilian-run Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, said a $200,000 procurement order by the U.S. Agency for International Development had been countermanded by a military staff offi- cer 400 miles away at a U.S. air base in Incirlik, Turkey. Mr. Maxwell said the military had decided that the natural gas cook stoves ordered for the camp were “too danger- ous” and had vetoed flashlights and lan- terns as a potential security threat. “Human assistance efforts cannot be managed from locations remote from the site of the disaster management team,” said Mr. Maxwell, who was exas- perated. “I don’t like to get second- guessed by people who haven’t been here.” Maj. Ron Gahagan, a U.S. military spokesman, said, “They were using State Department funds to order through military channels. There is a bureaucratic protocol that didn’t hap- pen. I am not sure why. The order is be- ing resubmitted.” At dusk, the first caravan of Kurdish families — about 150 people, including newborn infants — arrived at the Amer- ican camp with no warning. One of the new arrivals, Anwar Kha- lil Sadaq, 36, said after nightfall that the refugee trickle would soon become a flood. “They are coming,” he said. “They will fill up these tents and any- thing else,they can build in a week.” For the past week, Kurdish resis- tance leaders known as the Pesh Merga, or “those who face death,” have posted roadblocks in the mountains in what turned out to be a vain effort to pressure the allies for more political and security guarantees against Iraqi retribution. Mr. Sadaq, flanked by his wife and five children, said he was able to drive down the mountains into Iraq because the Pesh Merga allowed them past a checkpoint. ‘They said the way is open, go,” Mr. Sadaq said. “They never said this before today.” The Kurdish families were escorted to the camp by British marines from the allied military force. It remained un- clear whether the Pesh Merga would continue to allow refugees back if there are no allied escorts. Kurdish relief efforts @ Refugee camp ® Proposed refugee camp Food, supply airdrops: (through April 27) U.S.: 1,028 missions, 5,568 tons. Britain: 264 missions, 1,195 tons.

Four neighborhoods make a block, four blocks constitute a village. | Four villages to a community Helicopter | ‘| landing zone | oe The resistance roadblocks have been a knotty problem for the allies, and U.S. Marine Col. Jim Jones responded Mon- day by sending patrols out “to tell them to knock it off.” Colonel Jones said the roadblocks have become toll gates, with Pesh Merga charging people trying to pass. “I find it absolutely immoral what they’re doing,” Colonel Jones said. “They’re taking anything they can get. They’re straight-out bandits.” The urgency of getting the refugees out of the Turkish mountains increased after French doctors there reported the first outbreak of cholera — a disease that spreads through water contaminat- ed with human wastes. Dr. Michael Toole, an epidemiolo- gist from the federal Centers for Dis- ease Control in Atlanta, has been dis- patched to Cukurca, Turkey, in a Ma- rine helicopter to collect samples that could confirm the présence of the dis- ease, which can spread to epidemic pro- portions. Cukurca is about 60 miles northeast of Zakho, and officials plan to create a second tent city 60 miles to the east to handle refugees from there. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 30, 1991 \f"

Allied troops moved into north- ern Iraq 10 days ago to prepare more amenable refugee camps for the Kurds in a “safe zone.” British marine patrols were found Tuesday to have taken posi- tions about 30 miles west of Ama- diyah — meaning the allies had pushed the existing security zone 12 miles to the east. In Amadiyah, about 60 road miles east of the allied occupation headquarters in Zakho, there was no sign of allied military on the ground. But U.S. helicopters and jets droned over the area through- out the afternoon. The round-trip to Amadiyah traversed rutted, buckled roads on which the pavement often gave out to dirt stretches. One route con- tained hairpin turns down a steep mountainside. Clearly, if allied forces hope to build a huge refugee camp near here, they cannot truck the needed quantities of tents, equipment and food over these roads from the Turkish border. Flying everything in for the refu- gees would be expensive, although there is a partially completed Iraqi airfield near here. Twisted steel and crushed concrete near the run- ways attest that it was hit by allied air attacks during the war. Another potential problem is posed by the scores of Iraqi sol- diers who remain in the area. So far, the soldiers generally have co- operated with the Americans. One Iraqi officer Tuesday told the passing journalists that his men are relocating to Dahuk. Iraqi soldiers seen along the route from Zakho to Amadiyah smiled and waved at the Americans motoring past in a jeep, never threatening them or even asking questions at checkpoints. Otherwise, the countryside of northern Iraq remains eerily unpopulated. In Amadiyah itself, local resi- dents said that only about 500 peo- ple had come back up the winding road to the city.

        "ocr_text": "Troops near key lraqi city Saddam forces slow in leaving Kurd zone By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondents DOHUK, Iraq — American soldiers pushed 16 miles further south to the edge of this key Kurdish city today, nudging Sad- dam Hussein’s increasingly re- sistant troops out of their path as they cleared a security zone for Kurdish refugees. In Dohuk, however, reporters saw more than 1,000 Iraqi troops who gave little sign they were preparing to pull out. Most of them were inside the perimeter of a sprawling military fortress, although dozens patrolled the city as well. Advance U.S. Army airborne infantry units moving the allied line southward said they had sev- eral tense confrontations with Iraqi troops who initially were reluctant to vacate their posi- tions in the face of oncoming forces. “We have an agreement for them to pull out, but they didn’t expect us this fast,” said ist Lt. Mark Eckman of Torrance, Calif., who is with the 3rd Battal- ion of the 32Sth Airborne Infan- a Regiment based in Vicenza, Italy. If the American-led allies oc- cupy Dohuk, it would mark a sig- nificant expansion of the securi- ty zone designed to permit up to 800,000 Kurdish refugees to re- turn. Dohuk, about 30 miles south of Turkey, would become the largest city in northern Iraq to be occupied by the allies. At one mountain pass about 10 miles north of Dohuk, Lieu- tenant Eckman said the armed Americans and Iragis faced off, but the American colonel in com- mand persuaded his Iraqi coun- terpart to leave. Maj. Kim Kadesch, the bat- talion executive officer, said the Americans moved all the way to the outskirts of Dohuk because they learned through aerial sur- veillance that some Iraqi troops were pulling out. The Americans moved in and cleared virtually the entire announced security zone before the Iraqis could move back. “Basically, there is a standoff now,”? said Major Kadesch, 35, of Lithopolis, Ohio. ~ ed A Kurdish boy cries out Sunday as Army medic Sgt. -, administers a mea- Rob Cornett of Milledgeville, Ga While the airborne battalion shoved toward Dohuk from the northeast, the 24th Marine Expe- ditionary unit was moving toward the city from the north- west. By midmorning the Ma- rines were about 10 miles from Dohuk, while the airborne infan- try unit was scarcely more than a mile away. Although the U.S. soldiers said they are eager to advance south all the way to the 36th par- allel, Col. Dick Naab said today at a briefing in Silopi, Turkey, that there is no order yet for American troops even to move into Dohuk. Colonel Naab, the liaison co- ordinating allied troop move- ments with the Iraqi military, said it has yet to be determined how far inside Iraq the coalition forces will move or for how long they will stay. The aim is creat- ing comditions to which Kurdish refugees feel comfortable to re- turn, he said. The refugees fled Iraqi troops after their short-lived Kurdish uprising failed, running to moun- tains on the Turkish and Iranian borders where thousands have died for lack of food, medicine and sanitation. About 10,000 fled from Do- huk, a city said to be about 16,000 population, and thousands more fled from the area around it. Many Kurds in the mountain ref- ugee camps say they will not re-. turn to the Dohuk area until the Iraqi soldiers have been pushed out and replaced by allied troops. Coalition soldiers leading the push down into Iraq said they were followed immediately by returning Kurdish refugees. “It’s really gratifying,” said Lieutenant Eckman. “‘Not more than a couple hours after our troops cleared the area, the Kurds started moving back.”’ Reporters who drove south- ward past the American lines into Dohuk found residents ask- ing why the Americans and Brit- ish and other allied troops have not moved into this city as they have other parts of the Kurdish north. They said the city was still full of Iraqi troops. Several quar- ters of the city appeared to be va- cant, but the downtown market area was filled with people crowding impromptu outdoor food stands. “‘We hear the Americans and British will come soon,” said a teacher in Dohuk, who identified himself as Paul. ‘‘People in Do- The Associated Press sles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

They appeared to be put- ting in the trucks items such as household furniture and clothes. In other areas, Kurds say the Ira- qis have looted their homes and stores before leaving. Another reason allied forces want to secure the city of Dohuk is to gain control of the hydro- electric power plant there that serves most of the region they al- ready have occupied.

But this time, Iraqi soldiers have been looting from fellow Iraqi citizens, not from foreigners. By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent OUTSIDE DOHUK, Iraq — Troops of Saddam Hussein’s army are looting stores and houses in this predominant- ly Kurdish provincial capital in prepa- ration for abandoning the city to the al- lies, a British military official said today. “The Iraqi army seems to be setting about the systematic looting of Dohuk ; at the present moment,” the official told a group of correspondents at the Se uy British military headquarters 20 miles yo north of Dohuk.

What seems unusual about this is that in Dohuk and smaller towns to the north, the Iraqi soldiers have tain path as they leave the Uzumlu refugee camp on the Turkish-lraqi border Mon- been looting not from foreigners but from fellow Iraqi citizens who happen to be from a hostile ethnic minority. Journalists were being stopped about 4 miles north of Dohuk by Iraqi soldiers who had allowed them to pass freely into the city 24 hours earlier. The British command was reported- ly told of the looting spree by U.S. Ma- rines who can observe the flow of furni- ture-laden Iraqi trucks heading south from Dohuk toward Baghdad. Allied airplanes were also flying over Dohuk several times an hour. The British official said senior Brit- ish officers are convinced that unless the allies can find a way to occupy Do- hyk, it will be extremely difficult to persuade masses of Kurdish refugees in the mountains to return voluntarily to Iraq. “Our appreciation of the situation is that without the security of a major cen- ter of population, it is unlikely we will attract very many people out of the hills,” the official said. The American, British and French commanders were awaiting word from their capitals on whether to try and push south into Dohuk. U.S. soldiers were told that American and Iraqi gen- erals were meeting today to attempt to negotiate the turning over of the city to the allies. Iraqi tyoops could still be seen in Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 7, 1991 hilltop bunkers 6 miles north of Dohuk. In some places, these Iraqi holdouts were positioned no more than 100 yards from advance U.S. airborne units, At one forward American position, Sgt. lst Class Fred Thomas, 36, of But- ler, Pa., said he and two fellow U.S. sol- diers were in a “holding position” be- tween three Iraqi outposts that were 150, 200 and 800 meters away. Sergeant Thomas and his crew, riding a U.S. Humvee vehicle equipped with a TOW missile launcher, said the Iraqis had given no sign that they were leaving. “We understand the generals are getting together, trying to work out a means of us having Dohuk,” Sergeant Thomas said. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Allies ready to bring Kurds out of Turkey The allies hope to move most of the 500,000 Kurd refugees in Turkey yack to Iraq by June 1. By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau ' ZAKHO, Allied-occupied Iraq — Having pushed nearly all Iraqi troops from a 3,500-square-mile “safe haven’ in northern Iraq, al- lied forces said Monday that they are about to execute a plan for the mass return of Kurdish exiles, About 200,000 Kurdish refugees will be moved down from their disease-wracked hideouts in the Turkish mountains over the next two to four weeks, announced U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Jay Garner. The plan, which the American military calls Operation Gallant Provider, aims to haul many of the refugees down from their camps in allied-chartered trucks and buses. Others are expected to walk or use their own cars, tractors and road graders they abandoned in the foothills during their flight from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's soldiers a month ago. The old and the sick are to be flown. | “The plan is to bring them down, get them organized, find out where they are from and put them in transportation back to their vil- lages,” said Garner, the command- er of the allied Joint Task Force Bravo, which is clearing and occu- pying the coalition forces security ‘zone in northern Iraq. Garner said he hopes to move the vast majority of the estimated 500,000 Kurdish refugees from Turkey into Iraq by June 1. That is the time when crops have to be harvested in Iraq and when snow- | fed streams in the Turkish moun- tains are expected to dry up. The reaction of the Kurdish ex- iles to Gallant Provider is likely to be split. At one emotional meeting in the cholera-afflicted Cucurka refugee camp Sunday, visitors heard camp leaders telling U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers that they still feared Iraqi retribution if they agreed to return before Hus- sein gives the Iraqi Kurds their own autonomous region. Many refugees whose houses lie inside the ‘safe haven” will want to catch the first truck home —if only to salvage the belongings they left behind. But others who live farther south —or who have de- serted from the Iraqi army — will try to hold out through the summer, pressing for international guaran- THE ASSOCIATED PRESS A British soldier on patrol in the northern Iraqi town of Amadia joins Kurdish children playing Mon- day. Allied troops are providing security for the town. tees of their long-range safety. Gallant Provider was scheduled to kick off today, but it had to be postponed for a day or more to allow the United Nation's world food program time to truck in food to feed the returning refugees for a transitional period. Also, the U.S. military needed extra time to rent scores of trucks from a variety of entrepreneurs on both sides of the Iraq-Turkey border. To increase the incentive for Kurds to return voluntarily, the 3,000 allied forces in Iraq have pushed south and east in the past 36 hours on the heels of retreating Iraqis. The French pushed the security zone about 25 miles into a largely unpopulated region to the east. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army and Ma- rines pushed about 16 miles south, nudging the Iraqis out of the south- ern fringes of the security zone announced by the allies last week. The allied troops were awaiting orders on whether they should con- tinue their advance into the Iraqi provincial capital Dohuk, which an- chors a region that is home to tens of thousands of Kurdish refugees still holed up in the Turkish moun- tain camps. Washington, London and Paris — and probably the half-dozen oth- er allied capitals providing smaller troop contingents — will no doubt have a say in whether to insist on an Iraqi pullout from Dohuk and the fertile valley immediately to the south.

The first surge of refugees has material- ized days before coalition forces are ready to start their own transportation system and supply stations along the route. Marine Lt. Col. Paul Wisniewski, chief lo- gistics officer of the effort to bring more than 300,000 Kurdish refugees down from the mountains, said loads of supplies were de- parting today for the first of eight way sta- tions designed to provide bread, water, fuel, sanitation systems and first aid. Refugees have taken to the roads and mountain paths on their own, rather than waiting for allied trucks and buses that are not expected to begin hauling the Kurds down until Friday or Saturday at the earliest. Lieutenant Colonel Wisniewski said more than 20,000 people moved out from the west- ernmost camps on Tuesday. Allied efforts could be overwhelmed by the premature movement and by families that may choose to stay at the way stations rather than return home. “The potential is there, but I don’t see it yet,” Lieutenant Colonel Wisniewski said when asked at a briefing whether the pace of refugee movement may overtake allied sup- port systems. “It’s a concern that the people won’t go home.” British forces in the area said refugees al- ready are beginning to camp around the first . key way station at the abandoned Iraqi vil- lage of Kani Masi. Some wondered whether it may become a “little Dohuk,” or semi-per- manent camp for people still afraid to go back to their homes in Dohuk, about 50 miles from the Turkish border. Allied troops have created a security zone across a northern swath of Iraq by pushing out Iraqi troops and occupying the territory themselves. But as of today, U.S. officers here said there still had been no order for al- lied troops positioned on the outskirts of Do- huk to go into the city. Lieutenant Colonel Wisniewski said ‘‘not taking Dohuk will complicate the problem.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 8, 1991 \f"

By Tuesday evening, an estimat- ed 3,000 refugees were sprawled in the grass on the outskirts of the Zakho tent camp, where military and relief workers were rigging up impromptu shelters such as large tents and what looked like green tarpaulins staked to the ground. More than 10,000 people were living in the camp by Tuesday eve- ning, said Renee Bafalis, a spokes- woman for the State Depart- ment’s Disaster Assistance Relief Team. It is expected eventually to hold more than 20,000, but about half the tents and support services are not yet in place. Operation Gallant Provider, the _ allied push to transport 200,000 refugees home, was stalled Tues- -day and now is not expected to be- gin until Friday or Saturday at the earliest, Army Lt. Col. Robert Flocke said. “We have to wait for the logis- tics,’’ said Flocke, referring to . placement of food, tents and medi- cal aid at Zakho and at way sta- tions further east that will be set up to service the refugees as they are brought down from the moun- tains along the Turkish border. Many refugees decided not to wait for allied-sponsored trans- port, but began the trek down on their own. “They had 7,000 to 10,000 who were taking matters into their own hands,” an Army Special Services officer said. He was referring to ref- ugees from the Isikverin camp north of Zakho, who were walking, hitching rides or rumbling down” the mountainsides in everything from cement mixers to tractors to regular automobiles. Thousands of refugees simply bypassed this camp and headed straight for home. Others have registered, received a food allot- ment, and only stayed for a night before continuing to their homes.

The American lines were as close as 150 yards from a rear guard of armed Iraqi soldiers still holding onto three bunkers overlooking the road into Dohuk.

A month ago, fear of Saddam Hussein’s poison gas caused them to take to the mountains. Now, fear of cholera in the Cu- kurca refugee camp has caused them to begin straggling home. Standing by the road with his kin and hand luggage, Mr. Isma- il, 31, said he wishes he never left his hometown of Dohuk, 60 miles south of the Turkish border. “If I knew the Turkish border would be closed in my face, we would have stayed in Dohuk and taken our chances of dying there,” he said. Thirty-seven days ago he headed for Turkey with a wad of Iraqi dinars worth $1,250. As of Thursday, he was down . to $87.50 and facing a dilemma. The going rate to hire a Kurdish- owned truck to move his family the rest of the way down to the valley was $75. If he paid, he could get his family out of the cold and down to Zakho with $12.50 left. If he waits another day or two, he might get a ride for free In-overstuffed trucks, tractors and on foot, thou- sands of Kurdish refugees join a convoy at Shiranish, on an American-chartered truck. But that would mean gambling on their food supply. He had car- ried along a sack and a half of wheat and 3 kilos of cooking oil. They could make bread for a few . days, but the family was out of tea and sugar. Back in Dohuk he wasn’t rich, but he was well off. He figured he had invested $6,000 in his parts . dealership. He had an apartment with a TV set, two washing ma- chines and a freezer. As a refugee, he and his fam- ily have been nickeled and dimed toward having nothing. During their seven-day walk into the mountains in early April, his mother lost her shoes. He had to buy her some rubber slippers from a Turkish merchant from a village near the Cukurca camp. His 2-year-old son lost his shoes as well. So did his brother’s son and his wife. And three other relatives. Each pair cost $10. | He paid another Turk $8 for a small teapot. From time to time, he would buy wheat and rice on the camp black market because his family didn’t like the odor of U.S. military rations. A few days ago, the over- crowding and the filth at Cu- kurca made him pack up the healthiest half of the family to head down to the valley. His mother and father and some chil- dren stayed behind to wait for American transportation. Nobody in the family has died, but half a dozen suffered severe diarrhea. Of those who are on the move toward Dohuk, his brother and his two-year-old son are still fighting it. He thanks Allah and George tain encampments on the Iraq-Turkis Bush for keeping everyone ative. ' It cost $250 to hire the truck and tractor that hauled them over the high mountains ‘and! down as far as Kani Masi, a. Kurdish village on the Iraqi side of the frontier. He hoped to drive the rest of the way from Kani Masi in his brother’s Toyota Corolla, which they had to abandon in April’ on their journey to Cukurca. | On Wednesday afteryigon they found the Toyota. The, four tires and wheels were gone,’ “the spare was gone, and so were, the carburetor, the generator: gnd the gear box. ‘ He also got word from a rel a- tive back home that his ment and shop in Dohuk been looted: the TV set, the fréez- er and all the furniture gone, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 10, 1991 \f"

The United States is “attracted” to an Iraqi propos- al that would turn the Iraqi provincial capital of Dohuk into a demilitarized, internationally supervised city, a key US. negotiator said Friday. “What we're looking at now is a way we mutually can make Dohuk more attractive,” said U.S, Army Col.

Sweating from the weight of their tents and tea kettles, Kurds plodded down a mountain path toward the trucks as their return from Turkey grew into a human wave. But for many of the Kurds, the first day of Operation Gallant Pro- vider marked a joyless return. “We will return to an empty house, a damaged house, but what can we do?” said Nahouri Mustafa, 47, who said her home in the town of Sarsenk had been looted by Ira- qi soldiers. Judging from the human flow at half a dozen unofficial border crossings, the allies are making headway toward their goal of emp- tying the camps in Turkey before June 1, “We had 1,000 people pass here by noon, and then we stopped counting, said British Royal Ma- rine 1st Lt. Tim Cook. By dusk, Isikveren, a refugee The U.S. effort to build a postwar gulf alliance suffers setbacks. E4 center in Turkey that once held about 100,000 people, was down to only about 3,000, said Special Forces officers. But at Cukurca to the east, where most of the 100,000 refugees are from Dohuk and the surround- ing villages, almost no one had left for Iraq. Thousands of Kurds are also be- ginning to gather in new, unsani- tary tent clusters in the foothills. They are refusing to go farther be- cause many of them live in the pro- vincial capital of Dohuk, which remains under Iraqi control. “People don’t want to go down any further,” said Dayton Max- well, chief of the State Depart- ment’s Disaster Assistance Response Team, as he surveyed a spreading tent encampment near the village of Kani Masi. The allies have carved out a pro- tected zone in northern Iraq for the refugees, but it does not in- clude Dohuk, home of more than 200,000 of the refugees. Allied negotiators pushed on Saturday with their efforts to make Dohuk an “open city.” Un- der this plan, all military forces would withdraw and the city would be administered by Iraqi civilians under international supervision. In an effort to persuade Kurdish Austin American-Statesman - May 12, 1991 leaders that such a plan would work, the chief U.S. negotiator ar- ranged for two senior Kurdish guerrilla leaders to tour Dohuk and meet there with a high-level Iraqi Army delegation. “They appeared to be talking to each other like brothers,” said ne- gotiator Richard Naab, a U.S. Army colonel. Two Kurdish guerrillas were to fly by helicopter to Cukurca after they tour Dohuk, a U.S. military spokesman said. The evident in- tention was for the guerrillas to vouch for the safety of Dohuk and urge the refugees to return. Naab reported that the Iraqi general said that giving up the city, the gateway to the Tigris River valley and a major highway run- ning all the way to Baghdad, would be “really embarrassing.” U.S. forces are posted about three miles from the city, which is occupied by an estimated 300 to 400 Iraqi soldiers backed by two tanks. The U.S. military says an- other 200 Iraqi troops and a dozen artillery pieces are positioned on a highway west of Dohuk. In Turkey, the head of the U.N. relief effort, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, said after visiting refugee camps that the United Nations plans to expand its humanitarian operations in northern Iraq.

Elders keep 200,000 refugees from returning to Dohuk. By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau ZAKHO, Iraq — Thousands more Kurds emptied out of moun- tain refugee camps Sunday, but their elders rejected a U.S.-bro- kered compromise that would send most of them home immediately to live under Iraqi civilian control.

The elders refused to send more than 200,000 Kurds back to the city of Dohuk because they insisted on either a written guarantee from Baghdad of future Kurdish politi- cal rights or the presence of allied troops to protect them. Their rejection raises prospects of a long-term U.S. and allied mili- tary presence to provide security in a permanent refugee zone in north- ern Iraq. In Baghdad, a Kurdish rebel leader said the guerrillas and the government are making progress urdish autonomy in northern Iraq. Massoud Barzani gave his assessment one day after meeting with President Saddam Hussein. The appeal for the Kurds to return to Dohuk, just south of the allied security zone, was brought to the elders by an unlikely delegation of Kurdish rebel and Iraqi military negotiators, who normally are archenemies, They arrived with a U.S. colonel aboard a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter. “The leaders told them some very positive things are going on, but that didn’t seem to be enough” for the elders, said Col.

In a second violent flare-up 35 miles away, British marines exchanged bursts of automatic weapons fire with Iraqi guards who were inside one of Hussein’s palaces, wounding two Iragis.

The U.S. Special Forces troops that helped bring order from chaos here said they are pulling out today. They leave be- hind a few hundred holdout refu- gees and broad hillsides littered with rubble. On Tuesday other mountain camps with names strange to the Western ear — Cukurca, Uzumlu, Yekmal — were in vary- ing stages of emptying, too. But many of the estimated 800,000 Kurdish refugees who fled to the Turkish mountains rather than face the weapons of Iraqi soldiers quelling their up- rising are simply moving their problems to a new location. Disease hits ‘model camp’ So far, 30,000 of them have been resettled in allied-built ref- ugee camps in the foothills near the Iraqi town of Zakho. They will be closer to home, and they will be living in a planned camp with good tents, latrines, hospi- tals, food and water, the full range of relief services. They also will be living in the middle of a typhoid outbreak. The French medical group Action Nord/Sud said it is treat- ing five or six new cases of ty- phoid every day. Typhoid, spread by bacteria through poor sanitation, causes a sustained high fever and attacks vital organs. Why has it appeared at a model camp? “It was built as a model camp. It isn’t being used as a model camp,” said Dr. Ron Waldman of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, who has been working in the camps. rdish re’ People in Zakho relieve them- selves in the fields rather than the hot, cramped sheet metal la-’ trines, he said. In the refugee way station at the abandoned Iraqi village of Kani Masi, there are no tents and few latrines waiting for the refu- gees coming down from the mountains and beginning to fill the landscape. Few leaving way stations Rather than treat it as a pit stop or rest place for a day or two, thousands are settling in Kani Masi. An estimated 12,000 to 16,000 were there Tuesday. “The problem we have now is that this is supposed to be a way station, but the population keeps growing,” said U.S. Marine Capt. Peter McClenahan. A British major said he ex- pects to see as many as 45,000 people staying at Kani Masi, while doctors there said they hope they are flexible enough to gear up quickly for as many as 100,000 people.

From their hilltop bunkers Wednesday, George and other Americans watched through binoculars as Iraqi troops pulled 82mm mortar rounds out of protective boxes, They were only 600 yards away, well within range, Methodically the Iraqis pounded an aim- ing stake into the ground and prepared the mortar tube to fire, “We could see the end of the tube and the Palm Beach Post - May 16, 1991 aiming stake in our direction,” said First Sgt.

By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondent AMMAN, Jordan — Cabbies no longer kick Americans out of their taxis these days. Pro-Iraq posters are scarce. And Uncle Sam’s coffee shop has had its name _ restored in Jordan’s calmed postwar atmosphere. Jordanians, the most stri- dently and thoroughly incensed of all the Arabs over the allied war against Iraq, are more meas- ured now in their view of what happened and why. During. the war, Fuad Afgh- ani’s souvenir shop in the central market sold thousands of Sad- dam Hussein buttons and watch- es, as well as key-chain replicas of the Scud missiles the Iraqi president shot at Israel and Sau- di Arabia. But he has found little market for his family’s latest invention: a T-shirt bearing Saddam’s like- ness and the question, “Who will make it 40?” The reference is to the 39 Scuds that Saddam landed on Israeli soil. Mr. Afghani said sentiment in the streets toward Saddam today is mixed. To many he remains a hero, while some Jordanians fault him for miscalculating the strength of his opposition. “There are some people who ask why he made this war,” Mr. Afghani said. ‘“‘We lost so much, especially economically.” He said people blame Saddam for the loss of jobs formerly held by Palestinians and Jordanians in the gulf states and for the embar- go that cut Jordan off from its biggest trading partner. Anger lies beneath surface The anger that produced anti- Western demonstrations has dipped below the surface in Am- man and other Arab capitals, but it can be summoned back in a flash. When it became known that the United States recently helped airlift Jews out of Ethiopia for re- settlement in Israel, for example, editorialists from Algeria to Ye- men fulminated. In Amman, one writer charged Washington with directly helping Israel “to imple- ment its long-sought programs of filling the occupied Arab land with Jews brought from Europe’ and other parts of the world.” Another target has been the U.S.-led rescue of Kurdish refu- gees who fled Saddam’s guns. “We see the help of the Kurds as hypocritical,” said Zaki Ayyoubi, a businessman and member of the World Affairs Council, a Jordanian think tank. “You are making a big show to help a few thousand people, when 17 million Iraqis are in bad shape.” Like many Jordanians, Mr. Ayyoubi thinks the allied bomb- ing was an excessive penalty a against innocent Iraqi citizens, who he believes should not be held responsible for the acts of Saddam. And the continuation of the economic embargo, he says, is an unwarranted extension of that punishment. The core of hostility today is the same one that nourished Arab anger during the war: The West acted quickly and massive- ly against Iraq, but will not move against Israel’s continuing occu- pation of the Arab territories it won in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Mr. Ayyoubi cited U.S. Secre- tary of State James Baker’s re- cent comment that new Israeli settlements in the territories are the biggest obstacle to Middle East peace. So why, he asked, doesn’t the United States do something about it? End of war means easy living But the peace process, the Kurds and Ethiopian Jews are not topics central to the lives Jordanians, who w more these days about resuming their own routine. . Discos have reopened, fancy weddings are back on schedule, and Jordanians can vacation abroad again, now that the war tax that almost doubled air fares has been dropped. One Amman restaurateur has been bold enough to remodel his place into a replica of a New York bistro, with neon trim, a big central bar and live soft ~~ music. The owner admitted to some concern about potential trouble from lingering anti-U.S. senti; ment. “We'll know, if , ve get bombed,” he said, crowding De trons into the few Rinpty chairs Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 7, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Baker asks for delay in Israel loan cuarantee By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Secretary of State James Baker said Wednesday that he wants Congress to delay _ action on a $10 billion loan guaran- tee for Israel, applying new, tough pressure to the Jewish state at a crucial moment in Middle East peace negotiations. “We hope and expect and be- lieve that the Congress will give us the time we need to study and further explore this request,” Bak- er said. TG a Jews justified in using terror- ism, Shamir says 2A - Israel increases defense spending and deficit 10A As reasons for delay, he cited the magnitude of the loan request, the delicacy of diplomatic negotia- tions over a Middle East peace process and the uncertainty over exactly how much up-front money the U.S. government must supply to cover the loans. The move comes after Baker and President Bush have criticized Israel’s refusal to stop building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Baker called the prac- tice the “biggest obstacle’ to achieving Middle East peace. Besides raising U.S. anger, the steady growth of settlements in the occupied lands not legally part of Israel has long drawn fire from neighboring Arab nations now be- ing asked to sit with Israel at the Palm Beach Post - September 5, 1991 peace table. _ The loans, which would be ob- tained from private U.S. banks and guaranteed by the U.S. govern- ment, are needed to help absorb hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union. The money would finance housing, roads and related construction. “Israeli officials say money from previous guaranteed loans ,has not been used to build in the Occupied territories. But it has freed up Israeli money for housing rojects there. ... Israeli Ambassador Zalman 'Shoval is scheduled to make the ' uest for housing loan guaran- ‘ tees at a meeting Friday with Bak- _et, embassy spokeswoman Ruth ~¥aron said. “We are satisfied with the sec- .Fetary’s emphasis that the adminis- tration is committed to helping Israel in the successful absorption of Soviet immigrants,” she said. Yaron refused to comment on whether the delay is viewed by Israel as a form of pressure. Baker did not put any time limit on delaying action but did say the administration “remains fully committed, as we have since we came to office, to helping Israel successfully absorb Soviet immi- grants.” One spokesman of a pro-Israel organization in Washington, who asked not to be identified, ques- tioned whether Congress will go along with the delay. Most mem- bers of the House and Senate will not return to work until next week. A congressional source close to Middle East issues said he could not predict the stand Congress will take on the loan guarantee request. “The secretary of state has tried to get all parties focused and energized on getting the peace talks started, and has asked Con- gress to refrain from doing any- thing that might upset that effort or derail it,” he said. ‘So far they have. Whether Congress will con- tinue to do so, I don’t know.” \f"

Gorbachev has achieved some- thing rare in the last 500 years of Russian czars and Communist chieftains: He has clawed his way back to the center of power after stumbling into oblivion. There he was Thursday, the gladiator at the microphone, bul- lying the Soviet Legislature into submission. He cut off debate, refused to accept amendments and forced the delegates to vote several times until he finally got his way. “You’ve had three or four days to discuss it,’”’ barked Mr. Gorbachev, virtually ordering members of the Congress of Peo- ple’s Deputies to surrender pow- er to a new transitional govern- ment. “Either make a decision or not. That’s all!” Working behind the scenes with the power brokers from Rus- sia, Kazakhstan and half a dozen other big republics, Mr. Gorba- chev twisted arms until the Legis- lature essentially junked the So- viet Constitution and agreed to trust him and the republic lead- ers to share authority over the world’s largest empire.

Both sides gave strong signals Friday that Congress will be the venue for a bat- The loan guarantees would enable Isra- el to borrow $10 billion from commercial banks, with repayment on favorable terms over 30 years. “We have very serious economic prob- lems,” Mr. Shoval said at the State Depart- ment. “And it’s no secret we need that mon- ey quite urgently. It is a problem.” In Israel, officials said they are enlist- ing America’s powerful pro-Israeli lobby to make an end run around the administration and take their case for quick action to Con- gress. More than 800 supporters of Israel from at least 40 states are planning to fly into Washington next Thursday and fan out across Capitol Hill to press the issue with their members of Congress. The State Department confirmed that Mr. Baker was engaged in his own lobbying campaign, continuing rounds of calls to lawmakers to win them over to the admin- istration’s side. And Mr. Bush made an un- usual public pitch for cooperation. “As president of the United States, I'm making the strong recommendation ... tle over Israel’s request for $10 billion in loan guarantees to help resettle Soviet Jewish immigrants in Israel. President Bush personally appealed to Congress to “give peace a chance” by de- laying action on the issue for four months, until a Middle East peace conference is in the works. that this be deferred,” Mr. Bush told jour- nalists summoned to the Oval Office. “This is no time to inflame the passions on both sides,” he said, expressing fear that “acri- monious debate” in Congress “would be counterproductive to peace.” Administration officials said repeated- ly that they want to keep the limelight off the loan guarantee question so that it won’t become linked to difficult issues at the cen- ter of the Middle East conflict — particu- larly Israel’s continued building of Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab terri- tories. Supporters of Israel, however, say they fear that the administration wants to with- hold the loan guarantee to force Israel into halting its settlement policy and perhaps to press the Jewish state into other conces- sions at the negotiating table. The administration has called building of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip a major obstacle to the peace process. The Arabs who would be negotiating partners at the peace table long have con- demned the settlement policy, saying their Despite Mr. Bush’s appeal and earlier requests from Secretary of State James A.

More recently, they. have expressed fears that the influx of hun-° dreds of thousands of Soviet Jews will prompt even more Jewish settling i in the’ occupied territories, and they view aid to: the Soviet emigres as furthering such od tlements. Israeli officials denied Friday that thi country was considering withdrawing from: the Middle East peace process over the ig: sue of the loan guarantees, but the striden:. cy of both sides in the controversy lead to derailment of the already tenuotis peace process. Israel agreed last February to hold oft on the loan guarantee until after Labor\" Day, fulfilling a Bush administration re« quest. When Mr. Baker asked for a further, postponement until the peace conference. begins, Israeli leaders balked. If no one gives ground soon, the halls of Congress could become a hotbed of exactly what Mr. Bush warned against: acrimoni- ous debate. The pro-Israeli lobby is viewed as the strongest in Washington.

By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent WASHINGTON — In a creaky micro- film cabinet at the National Archives is the record of an almost forgotten episode in which American ex-military officers and other aid workers traveled to the Soviet Un- ion and fed several million starving Rus- sians following a harvest failure. During the Cold War, neither Moscow nor Washington seemed eager to commem- orate their first fling with international co- operation that began 70 years ago this month. But now, as Washington worries anew about the prospect of Soviet famine this winter, the forgotten events seem sud- denly relevant. It was a muggy August of 1921 in Wash- ington when the cables brought news of the calamity in the Soviet wheat fields. The Communist Central Committee admitted _ that crops had failed in a broad band of - Russia and the Ukraine inhabited by 18 mil- - lion people. The rest of the Soviet Union had no grain to send; the Soviet rulers were ’ appealing to the rest of the world for help. The Republicans in the White House had their minds on the domestic economy, which was in recession. After all, the Amer- ican people were still recovering from a war. But the president — the now unla-° mented Warren G. Harding — decided that it would be un-Christian and immoral to let the Russians starve. Desperate and dying Letters from MHarding’s diplomats sketched the horror of what was already happening in Russia. One dispatch quoted a Moscow newspaper saying “crowds of starving, both children and adults, all under the open sky, all begging and gathering up scraps and wandering in any direction, often dying on the way of typhoid or cholera.” Russian peasants ate roots, horses’ , hooves and entrails from slaughterhouses. - Russian newspapers reported instances of “cannibalism. The job of overseeing Russian relief fell - to Harding’s commerce secretary, future , president Herbert Hoover, who already 3 “wore a second hat as head of a big New York ~ private charity organization that had super- “vised food distribution in Western Europe vafter World War I. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - File This 1921 photograph shows a group of starving children in the area known today as Ka- zakhstan. Then, as now, a poor harvest and government disarray led to an appeal for aid. In a few weeks, Hoover pulled together a team of 180 American aid workers, headed by retired U.S. Army officers and including a corps of Rhodes Scholars borrowed from their studies in England. They would become the first American representatives inside the Communist state, at a time Moscow and Washington had no diplomatic relations. The Communist newspaper Pravda re- ported on September 21, 1921, that the first American ship, the Phoenix, arrived with an initial cargo of cocoa, milk and sugar. Taking charity from the capitalists wasn’t pleasant for the more doctrinaire Bolshe- viks. ‘‘Let us take the gifts of American charity without gladness,’’ Pravda contin- ued. ‘‘Alms-taking is bitter.” Warmed to Americans Gradually, the Soviet press warmed up to the American envoys. One Moscow arti- cle described them as “young men in starched collars and neckties’? who man- aged to get things done. “The Americans differ from us Rus- sians,”’ the Soviet commentator wrote. “We, in tackling any task, commence with a plan. The plan is tremendously large . . . extend- ing over dozens of years. The Americans do not reckon with years, but with weeks and days.” With the help of hired Russian employ- ees, the Americans set up thousands of soup kitchens in an area extending from the Ukraine to Soviet Asia. American cargo ships carrying surplus American corn and pork began streaming into Soviet ports un- der the protection of American Navy de- stroyers. The scale of the American enterprise stunned everyone. Benjamin Weissman, one of the few scholars who has studied the American aid mission, has written that by the end of the first winter, 180 American aid workers supervised 18,073 feeding kitchens in 25 provinces. In addition, Hoo- ver’s organization — the American Relief Administration — was supplying medicine to 1,800 hospitals and 3,600 other Soviet in- stitutions. The money came not only from charitable donations but from the American taxpayers. At Harding’s request, Congress appropriated $20 million to buy surplus American farm commodities to feed starving Russians. The Navy Department agreed to turn over “‘sur- plus” food, clothing and medicine left over from World War I. Criticism, mistrust developed After the worst of the winter passed, some of the more doctrinaire Soviet Com- munists began peppering the aid program with criticism. Why, one article wondered, didn’t the Americans send along some loco- motives and some of their abundant supply of automobiles as well? About the same time, the American gov- ernment’s mistrust of communists began to reassert itself. No locomotives until Russia “swings further to the right,’’” Hoover wrote in the spring of 1922. By the end of the first year, the Ameri- cans had fed 9.4 million Russians. The Communists were eager to have the Americans stay on a second year, but Her- bert Hoover decided to pull out. The Soviet agents were beginning to pester the Ameri- can feeding centers with “propaganda,” his aides told him. Also, there were signs that the 1922 Soviet grain harvest would be bet- ter than 1921. “The great famine in Russia is over,” Hoover declared — an achievement he would sometimes point out to voters when he ran for President in 1928. One irony about his achievement is that by alleviating Soviet hunger in the winter of 1921-22, the fiercely anti-communist Hoo- ver helped save the shaky Communist re- gime from being overcome by the anger of the Russian mobs.

In tough remarks made be- fore a meeting with Republican congressional leaders, Bush for the first time warned that he is not even committed to the full $10 billion in guarantees re- quested by Israel to help settle thousands of Soviet Jewish emigres. “My view is that a delay is in the interest (of the peace proc- ess) and J am going to fight for it, and I think the American people will back me on it when I take the case to the people,” the president said. Bush said he is committed to the principle of Soviet immigra- tion to Israel, but challenged re- ports from Israel that he would accept the proposed $10 billion at the appropriate time. “IT am not committed to any numbers and I never have been,” the president said. His stand came despite in- creasing talk about possible compromise on the guarantees, which supporters of Israel say are needed immediately to pro- vide relief to the thousands of So- viet Jewish immigrants crowd- ing into the Jewish state.

By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — An eyewitness said Wednesday he watched from his front porch . Es as four or five Washington policemen beat Andrew “Bo” Young III, 18, outside his car while the son of the former Atlanta mayor put up no apparent resistance. “There was no provocation I could see,” said Ricky Reeves, 22, of East St. Louis, Ill., a student at Howard University. “He didn’t put up any kind of resistance at all. He wasn’t trying to fight.” He said policemen held Mr. Young down with their knees and hit him about 20 times with their fists. “They had their billy clubs out, but I didn’t see them use them.” A Washington police spokesman said the episode is under investigation. The official police version, issued in the form of a press statement, is that “when the officers attempt- ed to talk to the motorist, he allegedly be- came combative, at which time he was re- strained and placed under arrest.” Mr. Reeves, a junior, and Mr. Young, who is a freshman, do not know each other. They are among the 12,000 students at Howard. The episode occurred in a middle-class black neighborhood that sits between the Howard campus and a tougher neighborhood that stretches toward the Capitol. All sides agreed that Mr. Young was driv- ing his car through the neighborhood at 1:30 a.m. Sunday when he happened upon a tense situation in which several carloads of police The Associated Press Andrew Young Ill says Wednesday in Washing- ton that police beat him and kicked him. were trying to quell tempers after a loud ar- gument and a fistfight in the street. Mr. Young said he had spent Saturday evening at the house of another student, Troy Mickens, about two blocks away from the scene of the fistfight. Around 1:30 a.m., Mr. Young said, he began to drive the roughly, eight blocks back to his dormitory i in his car, with Mr. Mickens riding in the passenger seat to point out the way. At that time, according to Mr. Reeves, he and some friends were having their own par-. ty in their off-campus rowhouse. It was about’ 1:30 a.m., he said, when he noticed the fist- fight in the street about 25 yards from their porch. Shortly afterward, he said, he saw sev-' eral police cars arrive and watched as police: tried to restore order. Just then, according to Mr. Reeves, Mr.’ Young’s car drove up and stopped next to 4’ police car. He said he wasn’t close enough to’ hear any conversation between Mr. Young. and the officers. But the next thing he saw‘ was an officer pulling Mr. Young out of the: car and beating him. The police version says that officers wert called to the scene after neighbors had heard some gunshots. Several neighbors agreed that they had indeed heard loud noises, but™ one said it sounded like a car backfiring. _ On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Young spoke with several reporters in his dormitory room at the university widely known as the “black Harvard.” He disputed the police statement that he had become “combative” in the face of questioning, saying that he’ didn’t recall any conversation with police. Mr. Young said he plans to pursue un: specified legal remedies against the police*” men and has contacted a lawyer to investi: gate the incident.

        "ocr_text": "Bush vows to veto any bill requiring Israeli loan backing GRASS-ROOTS LOBBYING: 1,200 Jewish leaders knocked on Capitol Hill doors Thursday, drumming up support for a $10 billion loan guarantee for Israel. By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — President Bush promised Thursday to veto any legislation thwarting a four- month delay of loan guarantees for Israel, appealing at the same time for public support against the powerful pro-Israel lobby and its congressional backers. “For the first time in history, the vision of Israelis sitting with their Arab neighbors to talk peace is a real prospect,” Mr. Bush said at a news conference. “Nothing should be done that might interfere with this pros- pect. And if necessary, I will use my veto power to prevent that from happening,” he vowed. Since Mr. Bush first asked last week for the postponement of $10 billion in loan guarantees, the administration has main- tained that immediate action will shatter the fragile process now leading toward a Middle East peace conference as early as’ next month. The loans, which would help resettle thousands of Soviet and Ethiopian Jews immigrating to Israel, also raise questions about Israel’s continued construction of Jewish settlements in the oc- cupied Arab territories that are not within the state of Israel. Mr. Bush said he needs the de- lay to avoid raising “contentious issues, issues so sensitive that a debate now could well destroy our ability to bring one or more of the parties to the peace table.” He refused to specify which Arab nations might withdraw. Speaking in Paris, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said failure to get the loan guar- antee would not keep Israel away from the negotiations, and Israeli leaders in Jerusalem said they are not seeking a confrontation with Mr. Bush over this issue. Mr. Bush spoke as 1,200 Jew- ish leaders from across the coun- try were knocking on doors all over Capitol Hill to make the op- posite case — that the loan guar- antee must be extended now to help the continuing waves of emigres arriving homeless and jobless to Israel.

Mr. Bush referred to himself as “one little guy down here” against such a formidable lobby- ing effort, saying he already had worn out one ear in phone calls to members of Congress. More se- riously, the president acknowl- edged he is confronting “some powerful political forces.” In appealing to the American public for support, he said the Constitution invests the presi- dent with authority to conduct foreign relations. As happened sporadically during the Persian Gulf War, he said, “now again there is an attempt by some in the Congress to prevent the pres- ident from taking steps central to the nation’s security.” “But too much is at stake for domestic politics to take prece- dence over peace.

        "ocr_text": "SHOULD U.S. CO-SIGN ANYTHING? Loan tees tie guaran up funds for decades ‘By Marcia Kunstel “Joumal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The furor over when to offer $10 billion in loan guarantees to Israel ‘has smothered debate over whether the U.S. government should co-sign the loans at all. Supporters of Israel describe the loan guarantees as a basic humanitarian gesture intended to aid hundreds of thousands of So- viet Jews arriving in Israel as homeless, job- less immigrants. Some members of Congress, however, see Israel as an ever-hungry, socialist mon- ey-eater that has refused to reform itself in the way Eastern Europe and now even the Soviet Union are trying to do. They wonder . Whether they will be guaranteeing trouble. On the humanitarian side, the Soviet Jews “left oppression and darkness and came to democracy and light to lead produc- tive lives,” said Shoshana Cardin, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. “What Israel is asking for is only a loan guarantee. Not loans. Not grants. Not mon- ey,” said Mr. Cardin, who led a 1,200-person lobbying effort in Washington last week aimed at persuading the Senate and House to grant the loan guarantees now, not wait four months as President Bush has asked. No money to be transferred Rather than say this can happen at no ‘cost to the American taxpayer, proponents carefully say that no money will be trans- ferred from the U.S. Treasury to Israel if the .guarantees are granted. That’s true. A loan guarantee is simply a promise by the U.S. government to pay off ‘loans Israel obtains from commercial U.S. banks in the event Israel is unable to meet its debt. Israeli leaders want the guarantee be- cause it makes them eligible for loans at lower interest rates and at repayment schedules that may be decades longer than available to non-guaranteed borrowers. Soviet Jews are arriving in Israel in unprece- dented numbers, spurring construction in occu- A multimillion-dollar ‘set-aside’ But U.S. tax dollars do make a key cameo appearance in this scene. A new federal law requires that Con- ‘gress make a “set-aside” in the budget for loan guarantees. The amount of the set- aside depends on how creditworthy the Of- fice of Management and Budget determines the recipient to be. Technically, the set-aside could range from zero to 100 percent of the amount of the loan guaranteed. A more realistic top range hovers around 8 percent. If the OMB decided that a 3 percent set- aside were required, for example, on a $10 billion loan guarantee, that means $300 mil- lion would be appropriated in a foreign af: fairs sector of the budget. The money would not be spent, and so would not add to the fed- eral deficit, unless Israel defaulted on its loan. But with new caps on federal budgets, that leaves $300 million less available for spending on other foreign programs, such as aid to the Soviet Union or Africa, One knowledgeable analyst said the OMB scoring, or determination of the set- aside required, would depend on the lan- guage of the loan guarantee. If the legisla- tion were conditional on Israeli economic reforms, the set-aside would be less than if there are no demands for change. The money set-aside would be tied up for the life of the loans, perhaps 20 or 30 years, And if Israel for some reason defaulted on any part of its guaranteed loans, the U.S. Treasury would have to pay everything left unpaid, up to the full $10 billion. Spending rules are vague Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.) is one con- gressman with vocal reservations about massive loans to Israel. His view is weighty, since Mr. Obey chairs the House committee pied territories. Supporters of Israel argue that U.S. housing guarantees are humanitarian aid. . that would handle a loan guarantee. “We don’t know how much this will cost _ the United States, or if we'll have to supply more aid for Israel to be able to pay these loans back. We don’t know what the money will be used for,” Mr. Obey said. The bill that has been drawn does not specify any uses for the proceeds of loans, saying only that the money would be used “in - connection with the extraordinary costs” re- lated to absorbing Soviet and Ethiopian refu- gees in Israel. Such vagueness means the funds could be spent on almost anything, Mr. Obey said he agrees with Mr. Bush’s plan to delay action on the loan guarantee for four months, but the congressman said he is not certain he would support a guaran- tee next January. He would be more in- clined to approve “if Israel were on the way to [economic] restructuring.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 16, 1991 \f"

Starting next month, thou- sands of the beacons will be shipped to Army and Marine di- visions around the world, said Richard Childress, director of the Army’s advanced systems concepts office. First to receive the “‘anti-frat- ricide” devices will be the Army’s “contingency units,” in- cluding the 24th Infantry Divi- sion (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. The 24th was the first heavy tank unit dispatched to Saudi Arabia last year, and it reportedly remains Central Command’s “contingency” tank unit for use in any future Persian Gulf flare-up. The beacons are meant to be stuck onto the exterior metal sur- face of tanks and Bradley Fight- ing Vehicles with tape or Velcro fasteners. Once a crew member gets the order to switch on the beacon, it will blink out pulses of “near infrared” light that can be observed from several miles away by other allied tank crews and pilots of tank-killing helicop- ters and fighters. Up to now, the ground forces have never found it necessary to equip their fighting vehicles with electronic recognition devices comparable to those used by commercial airliners and mili- tary jets throughout the world.

The Army acknowledges that these first-generation beacons have drawbacks, but says it is working to perfect devices that will be much more reliable. One failing of the soon-to-be- issued beacons is that they are useless in daytime. They work by transmitting narrow beams of in- visible light that can be seen through the military’s high-tech night vision goggles. Amore serious drawback, ac- cording to Army officials, is that the beacons are capable of re- vealing the position of U.S.forces to anyone on the battlefield — en- emies included — who have night vision equipment. Even though the Iraqis lacked night vision devices in the Persian Gulf War, the Army fig- ures its next enemy may well have managed to develop night vision devices or will purchase them on the black market. \\ \f"

        "ocr_text": "Loan backers try to salvage package By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Reeling from the Bush administration’s vigorous resis- tance to a $10 billion loan guarantee for Israel, members of Congress and Isra- el’s supporters worked Tuesday on a compromise that would give the presi- dent his four-month delay. Key lawmakers : and some Jewish leaders are trying to devise a solution that | would allow them to back off demands for immediate action on the loan guarantee, but still provide con- |} 4 | gressional promises . to pass the $10 billion President Bush package in January with no strings attached. “We are exploring the possibility of an alternative to an out-and-out confron- tation with the administration,” said a congressional source close to the discus- sions. “The general assumption is that it’s not to the advantage of Congress or the White House or U.S.-Israel relations _ or the peace process to get into a monu- mental conflict.” Under a compromise scenario pro- posed by Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.), the House and the Senate would pass a Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 18, 1991 resolution saying the members of both chambers support the loan guarantee and are prepared to pass it in January. If back- ers find broad, bipartisan support, it could be introduced as early as next week. Pro-Israel lobbying groups are de- scribed as supporting the plan or inter- ested in seeing a final version. But all- out endorsement by the strong lobby will not happen unless the Israeli govern- ment agrees. Israel is requesting loan guarantees to help assimilate thousands of Soviet Jewish immigrants who require hous- ing, jobs and social services. Mr. Bush has promised to veto any legislation passed before January, say- ing it could disrupt the Middle East peace conference he hopes will begin next month. Immediate action could be a negative signal to Arab negotiators, who fear the Soviet immigrants will add.to the Jewish settlements already erected on Arab land Israel occupies. While Israel has substantial congres- sional support for quick action, even its supporters in Congress doubt they have a veto-proof majority of two-thirds votes in either chamber. Israel’s supporters have been ‘stunned at how quickly and broadly the ‘American public has approved of Mr. Bush’s position. An ABC poll released earlier this week showed 86 percent on the president's side. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Traq’s tricks needled Bush for months WASHINGTON — Iraq’s series of half- truths and obstructions, ranging from con- cealing uranium enrichment plants to shoot- ing toward international inspectors, has brought the United States to the brink of mili- tary action again. Iraq’s refusal to let arms inspectors roam freely over the countryside in their own heli- copters with pilots they choose was only the last addition to an irritating stack of straws. The pile started building five months ago, with the very first report Iraq filed in compli- ance with the U.N. Security Council resolu- tion declaring a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War. The resolution demands that Iraq coop- erate in the destruction of its chemical, bio- logical and nuclear weapons systems and ballistic missiles. US. officials immediately said Iraq’s re- port, a list of weapons and places they are manufactured, wasn’t close to complete. It got worse. The inspection team from the Vienna- based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was denied access to several sites on its first visit in late May. At bomb-damaged facilities that investigators were allowed to visit, they found suspicious removals of ev- erything from records to equipment to entire buildings, according to the team’s report. By the IAEA’s second visit in June and July, a building site had been bulldozed and Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 19, 1991 more remnants of bombed facilities had van- ished. On June 28, Iraqi security agents fired shots over their heads to warn the visitors away from one sensitive location. By the third visit, Iraqi officials finally admitted that the inspectors were right. Iraq had conducted a huge uranium enrichment system — from the mining of ore to sophisti- cated research to enrichment processing plants — and had tried to hide what was left All “telltale equipment,” as the IAEA re- port said, “had been removed and turned over to the Iraqi army for destruction and concealment.” The report was skeptical about official declarations that the uranium was not intended for use in a weapons pro- gram and speculated that more equipment and material may remain hidden. A team investigating Iraq’s capacity to make biological weapons also ran into trou- ble. The day that team arrived in August, Ira qi authorities retracted their earlier denials and admitted to having a research facility. But when the team got to the bomb-dam- aged site, it discovered that the remains of important buildings recently had been re- moved. There was enough evidence left for the team to conclude that Iraq had a capabili- ty to research, produce, test and store biolog- ical warfare agents. By mid-August, the Security Council was sufficiently dismayed at Iraq’s stonewalling to pass a resolution demanding again the full, final disclosure of everything it had request: ed back in April. It demanded that Iraq end its efforts to hide weapons-related equip- ment and material: And it demanded full ac- cess for all inspection teams, including sur- veys via airplanes and helicopters, without interference. After this specific order, Iraq’s actions last week preventing inspectors from taking their three helicopters airborne was not well received. \f"

        "ocr_text": "U.S.-Israeli standoff over loans highlights nations’ growing rift ‘By Marcia Kunstel ‘Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The fight “over loan guarantees is the clear- ‘est mark that relations between Israel and the United States are changing. An accusation Thursday by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, one of the strongest he ‘thas made, is only the latest surge _of trouble. ANALYSIS < ““\"Now there is euphoria in the Arab world because of the Arab “perception that the United States Stands on their side, and thus this is not advancing peace but rather ‘making it more distant, Mr. Shamir said. a In some ways the bitter feud is an obscure foreign affairs de- bate. But cutting through the ar- guments on both sides reveals a steady divergence in the paths of Mr. Shamir’s government and - the Bush administration. The difference is over peace and land — what the shape of Is- rael should be when it finally achieves peace with its Arab neighbors. How does this relate to loan guarantees? On the surface, the $10 billion in loan guarantees, which would enable Israel to borrow at mon- ey-saving terms, is about neither land nor peace. It is about help- ing Israel provide homes and schools and jobs for a tidal wave of Soviet Jewish immigrants. But Mr. Bush is demanding that Congress wait until January to act on the guarantees — a date he hopes will be well after the start of an Arab-Israeli peace conference. Mr. Bush said he does not want the issue linked to the peace talks. Israelis and their supporters in Washington charge that the postponement is indeed linked to the peace talks, as a tool to force Israel to cooperate. 5 Both points of view are valid. The connection between loan guarantees and peace is the Jew- ish settlements that Mr. Shamir’s government has been raising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Arab land Israel has occu- Pied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. More than 1.7 million Pales- A construction crew is busy building new housing for Jewish refugees Thursday in the occupied West Bank. President Bush considers such settie- ments the greatest Obstacle to peace in the Middle East. : tinian Arabs live there, and they want the Israeli governors out. Arabs who would be negotiat- ing partmers .with Israel in the peace talks fear that the influx of Soviet Jews will be an excuse for further settlements. The more settlers who arrive, the harder it will be for the Arabs to reclaim their land. Like previous U.S. presi- dents, Mr. Bush holds that set- tling the occupied land is wrong. He has pressed Israel to stop set- tlements and has demanded that earlier loan guarantees, and in fact all U.S. aid, not be used in the territories. The Shamir government is taking the same approach adopt- ed successfully by the late Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, when the fledgling state of Israel want- ed to keep the land it occupied outside boundaries drawn by the United Nations. That approach was to create ‘‘facts’”’ in the form of settlements where Jews would live and work and hold the land, so no outsiders would be able to take it away. Israel’s rightist government is ideologically far removed from predecessors that accepted the U.N. plan for peace, Resolu- tion 242, which calls for Israel to give back the occupied land if the Arabs will give peace in return. Mr. Shamir has forthrightly and repeatedly stated that he is un- > willing to give back land.» The Bush administration still premises peacemaking efforts.on Resolution 242 and believes the details should be worked out be- tween Israelis and Arabs in a peace conference. The president has been delib- erately vague in the argument over loan guarantees, saying that raising the issue now would dis- rupt the peace conference he hopes to begin in October. Arab leaders would cry that. Mr. Bush is promoting Jewish settlement in the territories if he offered the loan guarantees with- out strings. More important, the adminis- tration does not want to give Is- rael carte blanche with billions of dollars that banks make avail- able only because of U.S. back- ing. It is the president who would have to raise the sticky issue of settlements now, and for the mo- ment he does not wish to create that link in public. In the short term, the delay is a favor to Israel. Rather than Mr. Bush demanding a halt to settle- ments in return for loan guaran- tees, the administration wants the issue hashed out in a peace conference so Israel can get something in return from the Ar- abs if it agrees to halt settle- ments. An end to the 43-year Arab economic boycott of Israel is the most likely gain, since sev- eral Arab leaders have offered such a deal. On top of that, Israel then would get the loan guarantees in January. But Israeli leaders aren’t willing to stop settlements, be- cause they aren’t ready to give up land.

Bush asks end to link of Zionism - and racism - Repeal resolution, assembly is urged By Marcia Kunstel Joumal-Constitution Washington Bureau~ ~ BGgkhALAAA ALLA WASHINGTON — President Bush extended an olive branch to; Israel on Monday when he asked: the U.N. General Assembly to re-: peal its 16-year-old resolution: equating Zionism with racism. « He also promoted continuing. reform of the United Nations into. a more neutral arbiter of hard, emotional world issues, analysts’ said. . And the president sent anoth-: er message as well, telling the: Arab states they should not ex-: pect a free ride into a Middle: East peace conference just be-; cause U.S.-Israeli relations have: suffered remarkable tensions in; recent weeks. In his annual speech to the: General Assembly, Mr. Bush: asked delegates to reverse the, 1975 resolution, which was a: breathtaking blow to Israel. “To equate Zionism with rac-’ ism is to reject Israel itself,” Mr.: Bush said Monday. “This body: cannot claim to seek peace and at: the same time challenge Israel’s: right to exist.” Zionism is the theory or? movement to establish a national’ home — later a state — for Jews: in Palestine. It is the foundation: for the creation of the state of Is-- rael, just as it remains the philos-; ophy supporting current efforts’ to bring Soviet and Ethiopian: Jews to Israel. : The resulution that said Zion-’ ism is the same as racism was: doubly provoking because it» came in a resolution that also: condemned the treatment of: blacks in South Africa and Rho-? desia (now Zimbabwe), thus link-~ ing Zionism to apartheid. The General Assembly’s ac- tion transformed Israelis’ edgy: questioning of the international. body into complete mistrust that- the United Nations could play: any role in Middle East peace-: making, a sentiment that contin-: ues strong in Israel today. The resolution, which passed: on a 72-35 vote with 32 absten-- tions, also was one of the early- signs of revolt by the less devel-- oped nations against the West in. the United Nations. It was fol-: lowed by years of contentious de-° bate in which the Third World: and East bloc often united to: thwart Western democracies. - Mr. Bush’s appeal to revoke. the resolution fit in well with his speech’s theme of “resuming” history once held in a Commu- nist hammerlock. While the former East bloc nations may go along with re- pealing the resolution, it was less certain that the Arab nations that spearheaded it 16 years ago -would agree. “I hope the Arab states have enough sense to go along with this, but I’m not sure,” said Rob- ert Neumann, former U.S. am- bassador to Saudi Arabia and di- rector of Middle East studies at the Center for Strategic and In- ternational Studies in Washing- ton. “If the Syrians were behind it, that would do it.” James Zogby, director of the Arab-American Institute, said much will depend on the word- ing. If the legitimacy of both a Palestinian state and the state of Israel were addressed, he said, acceptance would be more likely. But, he added, he doesn’t think reversing the resolution would enhance the peace process ‘Jor the role the igited Naticns is permitted to play in the peace conference Mr. Bush is trying to put together next month. “I think Israel’s reasoning behind not wanting the U.N. in- volved has less to do with a par- ticular resolution and more to do with an absolute desire to resist any involvemegt of any party or any venue that would put pres- sure on Israel to make conces- sions,” Mr. Zogby said. The president’s other aim in asking for revocation was to calm * increasingly irritated U.S.-Israel relations. Mr. Bush’s refusal to endorse Israel’s request for an unconditional $10 billion in loan guarantees, needed to help settle Soviet Jewish immigrants, raised anguished doubts in Israel about U.S. support for the Jewish state. Daniel Brumberg, visiting Middle East fellow at the Carter Center and member of the politi- cal science department at Emory U.N. resolution on Zionism On Nov. 10, 1975, the United Nations General As- sembly adopted Resolution 3379, defining Zionism* as “a form of racism or racial discrimination,” on a 72-35 vote with 32 abstentions and three absences, At the time, U.S, Am- bassador Daniel Patrick Moy- nihan said, ‘The United States . .. does not acknowl- edge, it will not abide by, it will never acquiesce in the in- famous act.” The Israeli Knesset rejected the U.N. resolution, * The movement for the establishment oa support of the Jewish national state srael, University, said “smoothing the ruffles” with Israel clearly was one of Mr. Bush’s intentions, as was sending a message that the Arab states must recognize Isra- el’s legitimacy as a state. But he questioned how effec- tive the tactic would be, at least in warming Israeli hearts. “I feel the Israelis will look at this in a cynical way, that the United States is trying to buy Is- rael into the peace process and at the same time the U.S. is not backing down on settlements or loan guarantees,” Dr. Brumberg said. “The Israelis are not as in- terested in symbols as in con- crete actions.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 24, 1991 \f"

By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — To as- sure that last month’s Soviet coup would not end in nuclear war, officers loyal to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev opened the briefcase of the top-ranking coup leader and took away his nuclear command equipment, a Soviet official said Tuesday.

He gave his ac- count of Mr. Yanayev’s brief- case in a conversation with re- porters after a Senate hearing. He told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that four Soviet officials must issue a series of matching codes be- fore a launch can proceed. They are the Soviet presi- dent, the defense minister, the chief of the military general staff and one of three top mili- tary commanders of the strate- gic nuclear forces.

Of these, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 25, 1991 about 15,000 are long-range strategic weapons targeted mainly on the United States;’ the other 12,000 are tactical’ weapons intended primarily for a battle in Europe. Mr. Pavlov told the hearing that all Soviet long-range mis- siles and bombs are under such tight electronic control that it is impossible for anyone at a weapons site to detonate a weapon without a rigid set of, orders from Moscow. He expressed less _ confi-. dence : that tactical nuclear weapons will always remain in: authorized hands, although he: said they too are heavily safe- guarded. In pescetime, the tactical nuclear weapons are kept be- hind multiple locks in high-se- curity storage areas, he said. But under conditions of a war- time alert, tactical nuclear weapons are dispersed to field commanders without Moscow- controlled electronic locks. ‘‘' \f"

        "ocr_text": " Steadfast Texas diplomat leads defiant U.N. team By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Surrounded by armed Iraqi agents ina Baghdad parking lot all day and into the morning hours today, David Allen Kay has kept his team of U.N. inspec- tors organized, calm and adamantly refusing to surrender what the Iraqis want. Kay is a Texan whose voice never qua- vered Tuesday as he repeatedly talked to the world — his Iraqi guards hovering — over a satellite telephone linked to CNN, “Oh yes, we're prepared to wait. The team is actually in very high spirits,” Kay said in a call about 11 p.m. Baghdad time. “We believe in what we're doing,” What Kay, 51, and his 43 inspectors have been doing, as ordered by the U.N. Security Council, is raid Saddam Hussein's treasure chests of nuclear secrets, \"This team is not a cadre of rash military commandos, but scientists and technocrats who probably never dreamed they'd be held at gunpoint over a bunch of papers. Kay, a Houston native who graduated from the University of Texas, then got his B.A. and Ph.D, from Columbia School of International Affairs, did not surprise friends and colleagues with his gunpoint resistance, “He's a level-headed, mature, thoughtful person,” said Richard Gardner, a law profes- sor at Columbia University and former U.S, ambassador to Rome who worked with Kay on UN. affairs in the mid-1970s, In the days Gardner knew him, Kay still was an academic teaching at the University of Wisconsin and serving as adviser to the U.S, delegation to the United Nations. Afterward, he directed research on inter: national organizations at the American Soci- ety of International Law. One area he studied was how regulatory principals of interna- tional agencies can be better applied on the ground, Pure academia gave way for Kay in 1978 to a position as senior evaluation officer at the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, then in 1983 to his current job as director of Program and Project Evalua- tion for the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has headquarters in Vienna, One hobby of Kay's is photography, which might have raised the Iraqis’ level of irrita- tion this week. They tried to confiscate the videos Kay's team shot. Palm Beach Post - September 25, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bringing home warheads may. spike the need for K-reactor By Joseph Albright Joumat-Constitution Washington Bureau’ WASHINGTON — By cutting the nation’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, President Bush has slashed the military’s need for tritium and thereby weakened the argument to reopen an idle nuclear reactor at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The government's plan was to crank up the hulking old giant called the K-reactor in the next few months so it could produce its first lot of fresh tritium by next spring. Now it seems clear that for at least a few more years, the mili- tary can get its quota of tritium by recycling. There should be plenty of the radioactive gas available in the innards of the more than 2,300 warheads Mr; Bush is removing from Europe. Many of the nuclear weapons in the nation’s 19,000-warhead stockpile already contain recy- Cled tritium. The nation stopped making fresh tritium in 1988, when the aging Savannah River production reactors were shut down to fix defects. Since then, the government has been draining tritium from obsolete Pershing and cruise missiles, purifying it at Savan- nah River, and inserting it into the core of new warheads. Now the president has put four times as many artillery shells and Lance warheads on the scrap heap, and warhead de- sign experts say there is no tech- nical reason the tritium cannot be scavenged from these as well. | So after a three-year, $2 bil- E = lion project to rehabilitate the K- reactor, the Department of Ener- 2 gy now must go back to the draw- [esl ing board and decide whether it |g2s should slow down and keep the | reactor in mothballs. ‘| Entwined with that decision is fim the future of the giant $5.6 billion New Production Reactor that was |F totake up the load of making triti- um in the year 2000. A go-ahead decision had been expected this mber, and many of Savan- } nah River’s 27,000 employees had been hoping the government would put the reactor there. Now there will be fierce new ~ arguments over whether the na- tion can fulfill its tritium re- quirement indefinitely with a smaller, cheaper reactor — or perhaps some advanced device sven as a laser separator. , nergy Secretary James D. , the overseer of the $10 © Pee nuclear weapons complex, issued a one-paragraph tement supporting Mr. Bush’s itiatives and declaring that the department “stands ready to do éverything within its power to complete its tasks safely and ex- peditiously, as directed by the president.” » Congressmen and journalists were not told what the presi- dent’s announcement would mean for the weapons complex. * ~“Tt’s all so quick that we don’t have anything to say yet,” De- artment of Energy spokesman k Maddox said Friday night. pepavannah River Plant spokes- At the Savannah River Site, the K-reactor, which has undergone a three-year, $2 billion rehabilitation, ~. Rep. Butler Derrick (D-S.C.), district includes the Sa- yannah River Site, said, “it is hard to know yet” whether Mr, Bush’s decisions will alter plans reopen the K-reactor. “I don’t ow how much tritium can be cavenged from the older weap- ons, and a lot depends on that.” Mr. Derrick said he was con- fident that the tritium-making capacity of the Savannah River Site would be needed for many years because “President Bush said we would need a strong nu- clear deterrent, and as long as we have a nuclear deterrent there will be a need for tritium.” Only about 2,000 of Savannah River’s workers are assigned to start and run the K-reactor. Even if it never starts, the rest of the 300-square-mile site will be busy for years on a multibillion-dollar, long-range environmental cleanup. The work force, which has grown by 33 percent over the last two years, faced likely cutbacks even before the president’s File may not reopen soon if fresh tritium isn’t needed. The military will continue to get it through recycling. speech. The pressure to cut was applied last spring by the House Appropriations Committee, which reported to Congress that the Savannah River Site ap- peared to be overstaffed. Tritium is the ingredient that enhances the blast from a hydro- gen bomb. Each modern nuclear weapon only requires a few grams of this super-heavy iso- tope of hydrogen. The government must re- place tritium in weapons be- cause the artificial isotope de- cays into an inert form at the rate of 5 percent a year. As a result, the military has to obtain more so the existing nuclear weapons stockpile doesn’t lose its punch. Atlanta Journal- Constitution September 28, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "‘Release puts Dead Sea Scrolls on brink of rediscovery \"By JQSEPH ALBRIGHT COX NEWS SERVICE Worshipers of the Western world, hold onto your hats. In the spring of 1947, a Pal- estinian Arab shepherd boy, Mo- hammed el-Dib, tossed a stone into a hole near the Dead Sea. He caused a tinkling noise that is still echoing in academia — and could rattle the biblical foundations of the Jewish and Christian religions. Mohammed's stone hit a clay jar. The sound scared him and he ran away. But he came back with his cousin Ahmad, and to- gether they squirmed down the hole. Inside eight tall stone jars they found foul-smelling lumps which turned out to be long manuscripts, each wrapped in linen and coated with black pitch. They were the first of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Their uncle sold the crum- bling parchments to an antiqui- ties merchant in Bethlehem, who peddled them to some Jew- ish scholars and Christian mon- asteries in Jerusalem. Before long, hundreds of other scrolls were found in other caves in the cliffs over the Dead Sea. Forty-three years later, the results of this re-examination “are tantalizingly incomplete. But after decades of scholarly dither- ing, the day is nearing when the Western religions might have to reckon with a revised set of their fundamental literature. _ The first two-thirds of the Dead Sea Scrolls appeared in scholarly journals a generation .ago. Then, for no apparent rea- ‘son, the flow of information from ‘their scholarly custodians In the meantime, younger . scholars grew thirstier and thirstier to see the texts, which are still in the hands of a coterie ‘of academics who have permis- sion from the Israeli antiquities department to study them. Now, after decades of delay. the remaining third of the scrolls is bursting into the public do- _main. They are surfacing thanks ‘to the computers and cameras of .some American academic whis- tle-blowers who aren't waiting ‘for the officially sanctioned aca- demices to finish their work. ‘History mummified What the Bedouin boys dis- covered was an ancient library of which at least 800 scrolls survived. In cave after cave were hun- dreds of papyrus or leather manuscripts wrapped like mum- _mies, They had been written be- tween 200 B.C. and A.D. 70, mostly in Hebrew and a few in _ Aramaic. There was every book of the ‘Hebrew Bible except Esther — and all in a form that was argu- ably much more authentic than the gold-leafed texts from which millions of Jews and Christians worshiped. When the first scrolls were deciphered, it turned out that the Dead Sea library had a more detailed version of the Book of ‘Genesis than existed in any ac- -cepted Bible. Except for the scrolls, the old- ‘est known version of the Old Testament wasn't written down until the ninth century after Christ. That meant that today’s Old Testament is not derived directly from ancient Hebrew. It has been hand-copied and recopied dozens of times, in a succession of Latin and Greek translations. In the process, the original Bible had quite possibly been altered. Besides offering the prospect of a more accurate version of what God told Moses and the other prophets, the Dead Sea li- brary also included what a He- brew University scholar called “the oldest record of Hebrew military craft that we have ex- tant.” Detailed plan for war Called the War Scroll, this document spelled out how the people of Israel — the Sons of Light — were supposed to gath- er their trumpets and begin a 40-year battle against the Sons of Darkness who made up the tribes surrounding Israel. It was a detailed war plan that specified everything from the composition of a heavy in- fantry force (21,000 men from 40 to 50 years old) to the use of towers on the battlefield. All of this came out in the first wave of authorized publica- tions more than two decades ago by the clique of a dozen scholars who were granted exclusive ac- cess to the scrolls — first by the government of Jordan in 1953 and by the government of Israel after 1967. No religious bombshells ap- peared in the early Dead Sea Scrolls translations. But there were enough tidbits to make peo- ple wonder about what might be in the scrolls that hadn't been published. The curiosity surged in the 1980s. One who wondered most was Hershel Shanks. A middle-aged Washington lawyer who followed archaeology as a hobby, Shanks landed in the controversy in the 1980s af- ter he bought a staid specialty magazine. the Biblical Archaeol- ogy Review. Under Shanks, it often became a forum for Dead Sea investigative reporting. Finally this summer, two scholars at Hebrew Union Col- lege in Cincinnati, Ben Zion Wacholder and Martin Abegg, gave Shanks his most delicious Dead Sea scoop. Together they revealed thal the two scholars had used 2a OeSkKTOND pmMmD ° 0 econstrucl one of the secret texts ery, the authorized scholars had not got- ten around to publishing. The Cincinnati scholars had started with a bootlegged copy of an index to the Scrolls showing each word and its context. The computer back-calculated how the text must have read before it was made into an index. No sooner had Shanks began publishing these computer-gen- erated texts than the director of a private library in California independently announced that he was going to break the aca- demic monopoly once and for all — by releasing its set of photos of the original Dead Sea scrolls. The library got them in a roundabout way. During the dis- ruptions after the 1967 Arab- Israeli war, a California philan- thropist, Elizabeth Hay Bechtel, persuaded the Israeli antiquities authorities to let her personal photographer make a _ photo- graphic record of the original scrolls so that a future war couldn't rob the world of the Dead Sea treasure. Before her death in 1987, Bechtel endowed a vault in Hun- tington Library in San Marino, Calif., and secretly deposited one master set of the negatives. Ten days ago, William A. Mof- fett, the new director of the li- brary, decided it was up to him to release the 3,000 photograph- ic negatives. Now the world is waiting for a fresh crew of translators to do their work. It won't be easy: the films show hundreds of fragments of e scrolis strew (Ol Ul- der. “IT am certain nothing will be found that will upset generally held ideas of the origins of Juda- ism or Christianity,’ said the Rev.

Even the quieting of the latest ruckus in Baghdad will not imply Iraq is re- treating from conflict. Confrontations are sure to continue. Belligerent treatment of United Nations inspectors probably won’t end until the teams have ferreted out all of Hussein’s weapons secrets and dismantled the remnants of his war machine. That is exactly what he is trying to prevent. Such aggressive actions are outra- geous in a country that suffered swift and total defeat only six months ago. Why was the brash Iraqi dictator not humbled by his loss? What does he think he is doing? Hussein is doing what he has done repeatedly, after every setback he and his ruling clique have endured. He is consolidating what resources he has left and stepping into bold action, for both material and symbolic reasons. Within months after Iraq’s bruising eight-year war with Iran, for example, Hussein did not lay back to salve his wounds but barged into an offensive against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq who had sided with the Iranians. Within two years, his population and military still battle-weary, he marched into Ku- wait and claimed it for his own. Just as he did after the Iran-Iraq war, though with radically less credibility, Hussein told his people that he won the Gulf War. That was a prelude to the current events that are mystifying West- erners, who believe they creamed this guy and can’t figure out why he refuses to act like a loser. Marcia Kunstel covered the Per- sian Gulf War for Cox Newspapers. “When he accepted the cease- fire it was under duress. And his assumption was, if there’s no choice, you accept it and hope that circumstances will change to let you do what you want,” explained Laurie Mylroie, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College and co- author of a recent book on Hussein. In the U.N. cease-fire, Iraq agreed to give up all its weapons of mass destruction — biological, chemical, nuclear, and _ ballistic missiles — and its ability to pro- duce them for the future. It also agreed to let the U.N. inspect the premises. But circumstances have not changed, so Hussein in his bluster- ing manner has chosen to defy the cease-fire to accomplish what he wants. ' The main thing he wants now is weapons. Thus he has hidden com- ponents of his weapons systems and withheld documents that pinpoint Iraq’s weapons development. Ma- terials the Iraqis tried to keep away from U.N. inspectors last week are among the keys to Hus- sein’s arsenal. “In this particular instance there are important material things at stake,” Ms. Mylroie said, analyzing the standoff in Baghdad. “The documents themselves, to the extent they give a complete picture of Iraq’s nuclear program, make it much easier to track it down. That and the (list of) foreign suppliers. “Saddam looks to rebuild this whole thing,” she said. Unchastened by loss Other Iraq-watchers agree. “His prime consideration is to have his regime survive and regain some kind of influence in the Mid- dle East,” said Donald Reid, pro- fessor of Middle East history at Georgia State University. “I think he’s willing to go to the brink’ or almost to the brink in hopes he can keep some of his weapons systems secret.” Palm Beach Post - September 29, 1991 Unchastened by his loss, Hus- sein is trying to pick up the pieces and remake himself into a regional power again. The destruction of conventional weapons in the Gulf War make a rebuilding of non- conventional weapons that much more important. At the same time, Hussein’s obstructionist moves buff up his battle-tarnished image as the sin- gular Arab leader who doesn’t fall before Western imperialists. This is important at home, where Hussein is contending with domestic political problems after putting down rebellions by Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north. He must hold tight the center. “A time-honored way through- out history of pulling together a divided internal nation is to be ina defiant mode to an outside threat,” said Jarrold Post, professor of psy- chiatry, political psychology and international relations at George Washington University. Power on the world stage Muscle-flexing also plays to au- diences in Arab streets throughout the region, where average people often showed an emotional sympa- thy to Hussein’s belligerence even when their leaders had hooked up with the U.S.-led alliance. Mr. Post said that support, especially from Palestinians, may have been ‘a transformational experience’ in which Hussein believed he finally was carrying out the role history assigned to him. He is not about to abandon it. “The magnitude of his power drive is really quite extraordinary. He is not a man who can be expect- ed to be content to be a nation builder inside Iraq,” said Mr. Post. “For him to survive psychological- ly means to be exercising power on the world stage.” Hussein is described as engaged in a tough poker game of interna- tional brinkmanship. In the last big gamble, Hussein stepped over the brink, and much of the world ended up in war. The problem now is that no one knows how closely the edge \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bombers _ off 34-year alert status By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — “The weap- ons are being downloaded now,” said B-1 nuclear bomber crewman Capt. Johnny Lott Saturday after- noon at a Strategic Air Command strike base in Abilene, Texas. Twenty hours after President Bush’s nuclear disarmament speech, the Air Force was in the final stages of taking 40 bombers and 450 Minuteman II missiles off their quick-launch alert status. To- day is the first day since 1957 the Air Force will have no long-range bombers ready to streak for Mos- cow on 20-minutes notice. “It makes me feel kind of sol- emn,” said Lott, 34, of Bossier City, La., in a telephone interview. “I have been doing this (pulling alert - duty) for 10 years.” The Pentagon said the crews of SAC bombers were the first to see the effects of the Bush speech, because they were being sent home Saturday night instead of remain- ing in their flight ready rooms a few yards from their bomb-loaded aircraft. Minutemen disarmed And at Minuteman II silos from Missouri to Montana, technicians were carrying out Bush’s order to “stand down” the missiles by re- moving a critical component in the launch system to render the missile “safe.” For the present, the Minutemen will remain inside their silos carry- ing their warheads, a Pentagon spokesman said. Even though the missiles have been rendered inop- erable, their launch crews will con- tinue to occupy the underground command centers around the clock “for safety reasons,” he said. Bush said Friday that these old- er Minutemen missiles will be eliminated on an accelerated basis once the United States and Soviet Union have ratified the strategic nuclear arms treaty that was signed before last month’s failed Soviet coup. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Saturday that the START treaty would be submitted to Congress within a few weeks. Over the next few years, the most profound effect of Bush’s nu- clear speech may be to cut the likelihood that a band of crazies will set off an American or Soviet tactical nuclear weapon on the Eu- ropean continent. The U.S. Army has 1,700 nucle- ar artillery shells and Lance short- range missile warheads stashed in overseas storage depots, nearly all of them in Germany. The Red Army has an estimated 5,100 simi- lar short-range warheads, most of them in the Russian Republic. Since the collapse of commu- nism in Eastern Europe, these 6,800 warheads have had no appar- ent military value to either side. They were built to stop tank columns back in the 1950s and ’60s, when U.S. and Soviet tanks were jaw to jaw across the Fulda Gap in Germany. Now the Red Army has pulled back hundreds of miles from East Germany and Czechoslovakia, making battlefield nuclear weap- ons obsolete. By announcing the dismantling of American ground-based tactical weapons, Bush is trying to nudge the Soviet leadership into disman- tling Soviet battlefield nuclear weapons before they become en- meshed in the chaos of a disinte- grating empire. Boris Yeltsin, the Russian pres- ident, has proposed junking all bat- tlefield weapons, and now Bush has given him some leverage to force a decision out of the rest. of those struggling for power, Another immediate conse- quence will be that the U.S. Navy’s carriers, cruisers and other surface ships will stop carrying nuclear arms. And the Navy’s P-3 sub- hunter planes based on land in Iceland, Japan, Italy, Okinawa and Diego Garcia will give up their nuclear depth-charges. In all, the Navy will be giving up about 350 nuclear cruise mis- siles and 1,350 bombs and depth 4 charges. Gen. Colin Powell, chair- man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said all the cruise missiles and about half of the Navy bombs and depth-charges will be kept in re- serve in the United States. He said the remainder of the bombs and depth-charges will be destroyed but declined to provide a number. What the Navy likes best That will leave the Navy’s sur- face fleet in the role it likes best: sending carrier battle groups across the seas to respond with conventional weapons to regional flare-ups such as the Persian Gulf War, For one thing, admirals can expect fewer protests when they steam into Japan, Australia and elsewhere because they can de- clare their ships free of nuclear bombs. 5 While giving up nuclear weap- ons for surface ships, the Navy will keep its Trident and Poseidon sub- marines, and the government will continue to procure the advanced D-5 missile warhead for the Tri- dents, Cheney said.

In Iowa, which has the first party nominating caucuses, the figures were 6.5 percent for guarantees Without conditions and 48.6 percent for not giving the loan guarantees, Comparable figures in New Hampshire, the first state holding presidential primaries, were 4 per- cent and 44.2 percent, The poll was taken before President Bush ignited controversy by calling for a four-month delay in considering the loan guarantees, The survey results thus were unaffected by that raging debate, but some question remains as to how many people even now understand that giving a loan guarantee is not the same as giving US. dollars in direct aid.

In the national poll, §0 percent favored the idea, and about 27 percent opposed it.

The surplus warheads will be loaded onto C-141 trans- | ports to begin a potentially risky odyssey. The trail will | lead to a bomb plant in Texas. The military will carry the warheads as far as an Army _ ordnance depot on the East Coast. — _ There, they will be picked up by Department of Energy truck driv- ers who will haul them on the high- ways to the plains of West Texas. The Department of Energy has | decided to dismantle the weapons at the Pantex Plant outside Ama- rillo, which has served as the gov- ernment’s final assembly plant for — nuclear bombs since 1951. Once inside the gates of Pantex, they will be stored in earth-cov- ered concrete “igloos” until their turn comes to be disassembled. Then, one by one, the old war- heads will be trucked into one of about a dozen round concrete workshops on the Pantex grounds, where they will be taken apart by teams of mechanics. The workshops are called “‘Grav- , el Gerties” because they are built with 17 feet of blast-absorbing gravel atop the roof. Considering what the mechanics | are working with, it is not hard to imagine why. Each warhead con- sists of an inner “pit” of plutonium — and a small canister of tritium gas, both surrounded by a blanket of high explosives. Tom Walton, a spokesman for Pantex, wouldn’t talk about the specific steps in taking apart a nu- clear weapon. But he said it is a lot like stripping down a car engine. “Some of it can be taken apart with wrenches and screwdrivers,” he said. “Other steps take special tools, but it is all done by hand.” The first step in disassembling a warhead is to. unscrew the bomb casing and ease out a metal bottle of tritium gas. Next the mechanics strip out the wiring, the firing circuits and the detonator. Now comes the scary part: peel- ing away the ball of powerful plas- tic explosives that surround the plutonium and uranium parts in the weapon’s nuclear core. The pieces don’t come apart freely. The workmen must use a solvent to loosen the glue that binds the high explosives to the metal components that con- tain plutonium. One risk is that a mechanic could drop a piece of explosive. That is why the floor in the “Gravel Gertie” is covered with a blue- green rubberized carpet. Even with the carpet, the jolt could cause a piece of explosive to blow up like a bundle of hand grenades. Once the warheads are taken apart, workers will remove the ex- plosive pieces and burn them in an on the Pantex grounds. open Diz Dayton Daily News - October 6, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Israel ‘will not sit’ with Palestinians linked to the PLO By LOUIS J. SALOME and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Staff Writers In a sweeping outline for Mid- dle East peace talks, Prime Minis- ter Yitzhak Shamir said Monday that Israel ‘will not Bie with Pal- estinians linked 7 in any way to the Palestine Liberation Or- ganization. Meanwhile, the peace talks cleared a poten- tial hurdle when a summit on wa- ter in the Middle East was post- In his speech marking the open- ing of parliament’s fall session, Shamir said Israel will approve Palestinian negotiators “in ad- vance,” and if those Palestinians “announce — at any stage — that they were appointed by or repre- sent” the PLO, “Israel will not sit with them.” Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization. His remarks on Palestinian rep- resentation at the talks set up a possible stalemate over the selec- tion of a Palestinian delegation. Shamir also said Israel is against a land-for-peace plan that would require giving back all or parts of Arab territory it has cap- tured in wars against its neighbors. Shamir sharply criticized Pres- ident Bush’s request for a four- month delay in congressional con- sideration of Israel’s request for $10 billion in loan guarantees to provide housing for Soviet Jews. The delay, which Bush sought so that congressional debate would not scuttle planned peace talks, ‘‘is harmful to the deepest fundamen- tals of the Jewish and Zionist con- sciousness,” Shamir said. Shimon Peres, leader of the op- position Labor Party, ripped Sha- mir’s hard-line government for its failure to meet the needs of Soviet immigrants, for spending money on new settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip instead of creating jobs and for jeopardiz- ing U.S.-Israel relations. But peace conference plans got a boost from the postponement of the water summit. “We are going to give peace a chance,” said Joyce Starr, chair- man of the Global Water Summit Initiative, who announced the post- ponement of the summit scheduled to begin in Istanbul Nov. 4. The Turkish government said the delay grows from expectations that the peace talks ‘‘could present more suitable conditions for having a successful Middle East water summit with the participation of all the countries concern The summit on water, one of the - most precious and controversial | commodities in the Middle East, . had been in planning for more than | two years when the Syrian govern- ; ment announced in late summer ' that it would not participate if’ Israel attended. Other Arab gov- . ernments also objected, and Tur- key as host held off issuing an } invitation to the Israelis. ‘ “‘We don’t want to give Israel an - excuse for getting the result of | peace without agreeing to peace,” » one Arab diplomat said recently, | explaining Arab reluctance to meet ‘ with Israel in a water summit that might produce regional agree- ments or joint projects. ‘‘The peace conference is the most important. step for starting the process. It leads to all other issues.” The water summit is planned as, a non-political series of meetings to join technical experts, rich indus= trial nations and the poorer Middle East countries, many of which are. entering a water crisis, with the aim of cooperating to find new sources of usable water.

        "ocr_text": "Thomas joked about porno films Joseph Albright and Elizabeth Solomon Cox News Service - WASHINGTON — Two former classmates of Supreme Court nom- inee Clarence Thomas said Wednesday that Thomas some- times watched pornographic films for amusement while they were friends at Yale Law School in the early 1970s. Their comments came as the Senate Judiciary Committee pre- pared to weigh the credibility of law professor Anita Hill’s allega- tion — strongly denied by Thomas — that in the early 1980s Thomas harassed her by describing in “viv- id” detail pornographic films he had watched. The two classmates agreed to talk about a report published in U.S. News & World Report three weeks ago. The magazine’s long, sympathetic Sept. 16 profile of Thomas included this sentence: “He was at the dining hall when it opened for breakfast at 7, some- times regaling other early risers with hilarious descriptions of the X-rated movies he liked to watch for relaxation.” Frank G. Washington, a campus friend of Thomas’ and now a cable television executive in California, was interviewed Wednesday by telephone. Washington said it was common in the 1970s for Yale students to watch X-rated films, as part of growing up and expressing inde- pendence. He said the practice was so widely accepted that the Linda Lovelace movie ‘Deep Throat” was shown in a Yale audi- torium. He cautioned that it would be in- correct to say that Thomas watched and talked about such movies frequently. A woman law school classmate of Thomas’, who refused to allow her name to be published, said it was true that Thomas sometimes amused male and female class- mates by recounting the plots of porno films he had watched. “There was nothing licentious about it,” said the woman class- mate. “It was all very lighthearted. There was no lack of taste ... Can you imagine how funny it would be to describe the plot of a porno movie, because there is no plot?” The woman classmate agreed with Washington that porno films were part of the campus culture when Thomas was at law school. She said that at one point, a Yale film club put on a 24-hour porno film festival. The only film she said she re- membered Thomas discussing was “Behind the Green Door,” which has been described by some critics as “soft porn.” Yale’s assistant to the dean of student affairs, Philip Greene, de- nied Wednesday that X-rated films were shown on campus while Thomas was a law student in the “We all had access to that kind of early 1970s. stuff, and on occasion did indulge, I am sure,” Washington said. “I don’t think he did it any more than any other male growing up at that period of time.” Grand Junction Daily Sentinel - October 10, 1991 He said the only time in the past 20 years when an X-rated film was shown in a college setting was five years ago when a student film or- ganization presented one showing of ‘Deep Throat.” \f"

Baker III warned Thursday that extremists from all sides may act to disrupt the Middle East peace process, in- cluding through terrorism, as the end of October and the potential convening of peace talks grow closer. Meanwhile, another snag de- veloped in Mr. Baker’s efforts to achieve a Mideast accord when Syria informed the United States that it does not intend to partici- pate in one of the three phases of the peace talks, according to a re- port in today’s New York Times. Washington fears the move may induce other Arab countries to remain on the sidelines and ‘make the negotiations less ap- pealing for Israel. _ According to Middle Eastern diplomats and American offi- cials, the Syrians told Washing- ton they do not plan to take part in the negotiations involving Is- rael about regional problems such as water rights, economic Pree and arms control, _ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 11, 1991 Mr. Baker issued his warning before he met with a delegation of Palestinians in an effort to work out what he called the ma- jor_unresolved issue blocking a Middle East peace conference — how and whether the Palestin- ians will participate. _ The secretary told journalists Outside the meeting room that he ‘believes the world will see “a tendency on the part of rejection- ists or extremists across the re- gion to take actions designed to disrupt the possibilities for peace.” Mr. Baker made the comment when asked if he. believes ex- tremist Israeli settlers who ‘stormed a group of Arab houses in East Jerusalem on Wednesday were acting to sabotage the peace conference. Mr. Baker said he did not mean to characterize that, inci- dent as one intended to disrupt the peace process, but said he agreed with the terminology of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who called the event “a mistake.” He added that he would not catalog the specific kinds of dis- ruptions anticipated, “because many of these things have to do with prospects for terrorism and come from highly classified in- formation.” The group of four Palestin- ians who met with Mr. Baker not only were trying to work out the composition of the delegation, but to solicit U.S. assurances re- garding the substance and for- mat of talks. * Whatever new assurances or: clarifications they received from Mr. Baker likely will be trans- mitted to the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion before any decisions are announced. “A  Palestinian-Jordanian delegation is one of the options - we believe can work,” Palestin- _ ian activist Faisal Husseini said before going into the session with Mr. Baker, But he said there was no an- swer yet as to the makeup of the Palestinian contingent or even if they would attend. \f"

        "ocr_text": "9 questions are at heart of the dispute By Joseph Albright - r WASHINGTON BUREAU i: rent WASHINGTON — Here=is the record on nine factual dis- putes likely to echo through the hearings as senators probe the credibility of Clarence Thomas and his accuser, Anita F. Hill: 1. Did Judge Thomas ask Ms. Hill for a date in 1981? Ms. Hill’s version: Judge Thomas asked her out socially, and he refused to accept her ex- planation that it was inappropri- ate to go out with the boss. (Na- tional Public Radio, Oct. 6) What Judge Thomas may have told the FBI: Unnamed con- gressional sources have been quoted as saying Judge Thomas acknowledged asking Ms. Hill out for a date, but said he dropped the matter when she de-' clined. (NPR, Oct. 6, and The New York Times, Oct. 10.) Judge Thomas to senators: Judge Thomas “denied that he had ever asked her for a date.” (Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), McNeil-Lehrer, Oct. 7.) 2. Did Judge Thomas dis- cuss pornography with Ms. Hill in 1981? Ms. Hill: “He spoke about acts he had seen in pornographic films involving such things as women having sex with animals and films involving group sex or rape scenes.” (NPR, quoting un- published Hill affidavit, Oct. 6.) Thomas defender: “He says ... that none of the alleged sala-' cious expressions were made by him to her.” (Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.), press conference, Oct. 7.) 3. If Ms. Hill was sexually harassed, why did she follow _ Equal Em Judge Thomas from the Edu- cation ae the t Opportu- nity Commission in 1982? Ms. Hill: “If I quit, I would have been jobless. I had not built a resume such that I could have expected to go out and get a job. And you'll recall that in the early ’80s, there was a hiring freeze in the federal government. (press conference, Oct. 7.) Thomas defender: There was ‘no rational reason for her not to believe that she could have stayed” at the Education Depart- ment. When Judge Thomas asked her to follow him to the EEOC, “she was excited, flat- tered and gushing with enthusi- asm about continuing to work with Clarence Thomas.” (An- drew S. Fishel, who worked with both Ms. Hill and Judge Thomas at the Education Department and the EEOC, NYT interview, Oct. 9.) 4. Did Ms. Hill know co- worker Phyllis Berry while they were both at the EEOC? Thomas defender: Ms. Berry, who says she worked with both Ms. Hill and Judge Thomas as congressional liaison officer for the EEOC, told a reporter that Ms. Hill’s allegations resulted from her disappointment and frustration that Judge Thomas had shown no sexual interest in her. (NYT, Oct. 7.) Ms. Hill: “Well, I don’t know Phyllis Berry and she doesn’t know me, and so I don’t have anything else to say to that.” (press conference, Oct. 7.) 5. How did Ms. Hill get her first legal teaching job at Oral Roberts University in Oklaho- -_ — leaving the EEOC in Ms. Hill: “I interviewed for that job. And at that time, after the interview took place, after I had been assured that I would get the job, I went to him [Judge Thomas] and said, ‘“‘Would you write a recommendation?” And that came only because the proc- ess at Oral Roberts University required some kind of letter from a former employer.” (Press conference, Oct. 7.) Thomas defender: Charles Kothe, then dean of the law school, said Judge Thomas played a more important part in her hiring than she has acknowl- edged. Mr. Kothe said he met Ms. Hill when she accompanied Judge Thomas to Tulsa so he could hold a seminar as EEOC chairman. (NYT, Oct. 9) 6. Did Ms. Hill voluntarily stay in touch with Judge Thomas after the alleged sex- ual harassment, and if so, why? Thomas defender: Handwrit- ten phone logs. kept in Judge Thomas’s office show 11 calls re- ceived from Ms. Hill between 1983 and 1990. “Needs your ad- vice in getting research grants,” a secretary noted in an Aug. 29, 1984, entry. Another entry said, “Wanted to congratulate you on marriage.” (Logs released by Mr. Danforth, Oct. 8.) Ms. Hill: “If there are mes- sages to him from me, these are attempts to return calls. ... I never called him to say hello. I found out about his marriage through a third party. I never called to congratulate him.” Weegee Post interview, Oct. ) 7. Did Ms. Hill call Judge Thomas in 1990 and ask him to make a speech at the Uni- versity of Oklahoma? Thomas defender: Judge Thomas says Ms. Hill telephoned him in November 1990, they chatted for 10 to 15 minutes, and she asked him if he would be re- ceptive to an invitation to speak at University of Oklahoma Law School. (Mr. Danforth’s press conference, Oct. 7.) Ms. Hill: “No, I did not invite him. The enrichment committee sent an Official letter to him invit- ing him. The chairman of that committee came to me and said, ‘Would you follow up to see, make sure he’s got that letter and that he’s going to pay some atten- tion to it.’ At that time, I stated very clearly to the chairman of the committee that I did not want him to come here. And I, howev- er, did make a phone call.” (press conference, Oct. 7) Thomas defender’s rebuttal: The Thomas phone logs will dis- close that Ms. Hill made the call “many days before” the invita- tion letter went out, not after- ward as Ms. Hill said. (Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., Senate floor speech, Oct. 8.) 8. What was Ms. Hill’s re- action when Judge Thomas was nominated to the Su- preme Court? Ms. Hill: “I was very dis- turbed. I have been very dis- turbed throughout this process. This has been a very painful process for me.” (press confer- ence, Oct. 7.) Thomas defender: Carlton Stewart, an Atlanta lawyer who was special assistant to Judge Thomas at the EEOC, said Ms. Hill expressed delight at the Thomas nomination in a conver- sation with him at the American Bar Association convention. (quoted in The Washington Post, Oct. 8.) 9. Did Ms. Hill provide the Senate Judiciary Committee a sworn statement in 1991? Thomas defender: “She did not furnish an affidavit. An affi- davit is something sworn to and then sealed. She chose to give a statement, a four-page state- ment.” (Mr. Simpson, speech to Senate, Oct. 8.) Ms. Hill: She gave a sworn af- fidavit to the FBI on Sept. 23. (written statement to press, Oct. 7.) Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 11, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Hearings put spotlight on eae facts Did Thomas ask Hill for a date? Yes, she insists; no, he maintains By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU WASHINGTON — The Sen- ‘ate Judiciary Committee hear- ings threw new light Friday on crucial factual discrepancies between the stories of Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Did Clarence Thomas ask Anita Hill for a date in 19817 Thomas: “‘Contrary to some press reports, I categorically denied all of the allegations and denied that I ever attempted to date Anita Hill when first inter- viewed by the FBI. I strongly reaffirm that denial. ... During my tenure in the executive branch as a manager, as a poli- cymaker, and as a person, I have adamantly condemned sex harassment.” Hill: She testified he asked her out 5 to 10 times between 1981 through 1983 and the ‘pressure to go out with him” embarrassed her. ‘‘I had a nor- mal social life with other men outside of the office. I believed then, as now, that having a so- cial relationship with a person who was supervising my work would be ill-advised. I was very uncomfortable with the idea and told him so.’’ Did Thomas discuss eer nography with Hill in 1981? Thomas: He flatly denied that and said, “I have been racking my brains and eating my insides out trying to think of what I could have said or done to Anita Hill to lead her to al- lege that I was interested in her in more than a professional way, and that I talked with her ao pornographic or X-rated ms.”’ Hill: Thomas “talked about acts he had seen in pornograph- ic films involving such matters as women having sex with ani- mals and films showing group sex or rape scenes.” She quoted Thomas as saying “you really ought to see these films I’ve seen” and said she felt that his comments amounted to an “im- plicit” invitation to have sex. if Anita Hill was sexually harassed, why did she follow Clarence Thomas from - momento the loyment peoniny Employment, OF- 9827? Thomas: “During my ten- ure at the Department of Edu- cation, Anita Hill was an attor- ney adviser who worked direct- ly with me. ... I recall being pleased with her work product and the professional but cordial relationship which we enjoyed at work. I also recall engaging in discussions about politics and current events. ... I do not recall that there was any ques- tion or doubt that she would be- come a special assistant to me at EEOC, although as a career employee she retained the op- tion of remaining at the Depart- ment of Education.” Hill: ““When Judge Thomas was made chair of the EEOC, I needed to face the question of whether to go with him. I was asked to do so, and I did. The work itself was interesting, and at that time it appeared that the sexual overtures which had so nee me hen ended: I -_ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 12, had no alternative job. While I might have gone back to private practice, perhaps in my old firm or at another, I was dedi- cated to civil rights work, and my first choice was to be in that field. Moreover, the Depart- ment of Education itself was a dubious venture. President Reagan was seeking to abolish the entire department.” Did Anita Hill know co- ee Phyllis Berry while re both at the EEOC? Did rot mention. Thomas defender: In. cross-examining Hill, Sen. Ar- len Specter (R-Pa.) challenged her comment quoted in The New York Times this week that . “TI don’t know Phyllis Berry and she doesn’t know me.” (Ms. Berry said Hill made charges against Judge Thomas because she was frustrated that he was uninterested in her sexually.) Hill: She acknowledged that she knew Berry as a co-worker and attended staff meetings with her, along with Thomas, at the EEOC. “We were not un- friendly with each other,” she said. But she said Berry wasn’t a close friend and would have no way of knowing about her sexual interests. How did Anita Hill get her first legal teaching job at. Oral Roberts University in. Oklahoma after leaving the EEOC in 1983? Thomas: ‘In the spring of 1983, Mr. Charles Kothe con- tacted me to speak at the Law School at Oral Roberts Univer- sity in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ... Anita Hill accompanied me on that trip primarily because this was an opportunity to combine business and a visit to her home. As I recall, during our visit at Oral Roberts Universi» ty, Mr. Kothe mentioned to me the possibility of approaching Anita Hill to join the faculty at Oral Roberts University Law School. I encouraged him to do so and noted to him, as I recall, that Anita Hill would do well in teaching. I recommended her highly and she eventually was offered a teaching position.”’ Hill: ‘‘In the spring of 1983 . I participated in a seminar — taught an afternoon session and seminar at Oral Roberts University. The dean of the uni- versity saw me teaching and in- quired as to whether I would be interested in ... pursuing a ca- reer in teaching, beginning at | Oral. Roberts University. I agreed to take the job in large part because of my desire to es- cape the pressures I felt at the EEOC due to Judge Thomas.” She said when she quit EEOC, Thomas told her “that now I would no longer have an excuse for not going out with him.” She said, “I told him that I still pre- ferred not to do so.” Did Anita Hill voluntarily stay in touch with Clarence. Thomas after the all sexual harassment, and why? Thomas: “This is a person I have helped at every turn in the road since we met. She seemed to appreciate the continued cor- dial relationship we had since Day One. .. . Although I did not see Anita Hill often after she left EEOC, I did see her on one or two subsequent visits to Tul- sa, Okla. And on one visit I be- lieve she drove me to the air-’ port. I also occasionally re-- on telephone calls from , er.” Hill: “From 1983 until to-' day, I have seen Judge Thomas | only twice. On one occasion, I needed to get_a reference from. him, and on another he made a’: public appearance in Tulsa. On - one occasion he called me at home and we had an inconse-:: quential conversation. On one occasion he called me without reaching me, and I returned the. , call without reaching him, and, nothing came of it.” She said... she sometimes called Thomas’s :; secretary, Diane Holt, “and on.: some of these occasions un-,_ doubtedly I passed on some ca- sual comment to then Chairman. Thomas.” Although she had.’ said in a press conference that ° she had never congratulated < Thomas on his second mar- riage, she testified that when Holt told her of it, “I' ag say, ’ ‘Congratulate him.’ ” 4 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Politics of right vs. left dominate hallway arguments By Marcia Kunstel © 1991 Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Emotions pent inside the decorous Senate Caucus Room burst into angry hallway shouts and accusations yesterday when the door swung open for a recess of the Clarence Thomas hearings. Impromptu, emotional arguments, in which supporters of Thomas sometimes drowned out efforts to interview backers of Anita Hill, re- flected the new course of this second round of hearings. If the spotlight had been on sexual harassment Friday, by yesterday it was point- ing, once again, at the politics of right vs. left. “Your group has been digging up dirt for weeks,” yelled Gary Bauer, a conservative from the Reagan administration who now chairs the Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas. “You have no proof of those allegations,” answered Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority. She had at: tracted a crowd of reporters a few steps out: side the committee room’s heavy double doors. Faced with diametrically opposed state- ments from Judge Thomas and Professor Hill, attacks on them or their motivations were the only weapons left for advocates in the Senate or on the sidelines who lacked proof of what happened a decade ago. Smeal herself was fuming over the line of questioning just completed by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. Hatch used his questions to fashion a case against Hill, the former aide who charged Thomas with repeatedly making grossly lewd comments to her. The essence of Hatch’s reasoning was that special-interest groups were behind Hill, to the point that their lawyers “found” and fed her two references to smutty remarks that she at- tributed to Thomas, These interest groups “have the whole coun- try blanketed, trying to dig up dirt,” said Hatch, who dominated the hearings all morning with a well-prepared argument, delivered with dra- matic courtroom flair reminiscent of Ray- mond Burr as Perry Mason. “And let me tell you, these aren't itty-bitty tort attorney investigators. These are the smartest attorneys from the best law schools in the land, All paid for at the public-interest ex- pense,” Hatch said. “It’s what's ruining our country in large measure,” The switch to traditional political attacks disappointed feminists who had sensed that an important issue — sexual harassment in the workplace — finally was being aired in a na- tional forum. “I would like you to put us on the stand,” Smeal said to her hecklers outside the hearing room. “You are on the stand,” shouted a finger- pointing Armstrong Williams, who described himself as a friend and employee of Thomas. “It's unfair what you have done to this man, What you are subjecting him to and his fam- ily.” “This is outrageous,” said Smeal. “It's to de- flect the argument. Instead of dealing with Hill and her corroborating witnesses, they're trying to use us as a red herring. ... We're not the issue here. The issue is an individual who brought this case by herself,” Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, was one of those named by Hatch as conspiring to dig up negative information about Thomas, She and Smeal said separately that women’s groups never heard of Hill before the story about her allegations was publicized on radio and in newspapers last weekend. Thomas supporters, including Bauer, said they had no proof to link Hill — whose former empioyers included the Reagan administra- tion and Oral Roberts University — with coaching or prompting by feminist and liberal BrOUpS. “Does anyone not believe that this is basi- cally a battle between liberal special-interest groups and conservatives who support Judge Thomas? Does anybody believe if Judge Thomas signaled during his hearing that he Was pro-choice on abortion that he would be going through this hell right now?” Bauer asked.

One agency is citing “clear indica- tors of impending famine” in a new re- port, another unpublished report said eight to 10 children were dying daily of malnutrition in Baghdad, and a third agency tallied 4,800 cases of typhoid ina single city in southern Iraq over 10 weeks this summer. In the north, the U.N. High Commis- sioner for Refugees has mounted a $15 million effort to reach 640,000 Kurdish refugees with timber, iron sheeting and tools so they can build protection from temperatures expected to plummet within weeks. As workers scrambled last week to beat the winter, thousands of new refugees were fleeing outbreaks of fighting between government troops and Kurdish militias in the northeast. Iraq blames the international com- munity for maintaining sanctions that prevent Iraq from selling its oil freely and importing what it wishes. But the U.N. Security Council maintains Iraq could come to its own aid if it chose to cooperate. The 18 million people of Iraq are ~. in Ai a vise that is press- “Pre-famine conditions, commonly observed in Africa, are appearing in Iraq,” said a recent report by Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Eating up tomorrow's food Iraqis are eating feed grain, which normally is used for livestock. They are eating breeding stock of goats and lambs, which wipes out future supplies of animals for food, and are migrating to cities to seek day labor, according to Douglas Broderick, a CRS representa- tive in Iraq. The Food and Agriculture Organiza- tion (FAO) said in a new report that its staff “have confirmed a rapid deteriora- tion in the food and nutrition situation in all parts of the country.” The FAO also found conditions that it said indicate impending famine: The price of red meat doubled in September fromy its already “exceptionally high level” of July; poor and middle-lass are making “distress sales” of pe property so they can buy food; andlaw and order are breaking down in cities due to increasing unemployment. nee food prices also have climbed levels in July, when a U.N. study “i ‘wheat was 45 times more expensive thatta year earlier and rice was 22 times m 8 costly. ihe medical side, it’s fair to say the teal care system is teetering on the brink of collapse,” said James Fine, who recently returned from three months in Iraq assessing relief needs for the American Friends Service Com- mittee. He said drugs — from simple Atlanta Journal-Constitution - antibiotics to treatments for cancer, tu- berculosis and hypertension — are in short supply. “At one point in mid-July all the hos- pitals were out of anesthesia and couldn't perform operations,” Mr. Fine said, “I talked to UNICEF workers who knew of women who died in childbirth for lack of anesthesia to perform Cae- sarean sections.” Mr, Fine saw “lakes of sewage” in halfa dozen cities in the south. Other ob- ‘servers gave similar accounts of sanita- tion problems mounting because Iraq lacks chemicals and spare parts for. treatment plants. ‘Everything points to collapse’ Mark Turpin of the British relief agency Oxfam predicted deep trouble this winter. “Just one by one each thing is being knocked over. The combination of the collapse of all the services in all the dif- ferent sectors, everything points to a crisis,” he said. The government continues a ration- ing system begun a year ago to provide basic food at subsidized prices people can afford, but it can offer only about one-third of the food that a family needs each month. Iraqis must supplement ra- tions on the open market, and that is where prices have soared, Before Iraq invaded Kuwait in Au- gust 1990, Iraq imported 70 percent of its food, as well as machine parts and other materials necessary to operate systems ranging from health ca care to ie] al trade embargo against Iraq, followed by bombing raids in the Persian Gulf War, slashed imports and crippled much of Iraq's infrastructure. The international debate now under way centers on Iraq’s refusal to sell $1.6 billion of oil under a strictly monitored UN. formula, which would result in about $900 million of the proceeds being spent on food and medicine and the rest on war-related debts, That still falls about $800 million short of the amount recommended as necessary by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. representative investi- gating postwar conditions in the region. Iraqis blame the West The Iraqis claim the scheme violates their sovereignty, and they have yet to accept the plan. Nor have they agreed on another solution, which would unfreeze some of Iraq's assets held in interna- tional banks, The money, to be spent on humanitarian needs, also would be tightly controlled. The Iraqis — and some relief work- ers — accuse the West of trying to bring down the regime of President Saddam Hussein by placing untenable condi- tions on Iraq. “The intent is to make life unbear- able enough that someone in the mili- tary or the [ruling] Baath Party will come forward and overthrow the pre- sent regime,” Mr. Fine said. “You can’t use political necessity to justify a situa- tion in which a population is not allowed sufficient food and medical care.” 1991 October 13, \f"

        "ocr_text": "Soiree reasons to trust 'Thomramas or belheve FAs By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Here is some of the ammunition senators will find in the transcripts to justify votes for or against Judge Clarence Thomas’s confirmation: | A CASE FOR CLARENCE THOMAS |. Ms. Hill’s memory is faulty. Two witnesses contradicted her version of a conversation about the Thomas nomina- tion at an American Bar Association convention in August. Her testimony: “I did say that it is a great opportunity for Clarence Thomas. I did not say that he deserved it.” Stanley E. Grayson, an in- vestment banker and former deputy mayor of New York, and Carleton Stew- art, an Atlanta management consultant, both testified that Ms. Hill told them Judge Thomas “deserved” it. 2. Ms. Hill embellished. Her ac- count of Judge Thomas’s sexual conver- sations got much more detailed between Sept. 23, when she talked to the FBI, and Friday when she testified to the Senate. Her explanation: “I am finding I’m re- calling more about the situation. I really am finding that I repressed a lot of the things that happened during that time.” 3. Ms. Hill changed her story. First she testified that she didn’t recall that any Senate staffer discussed with her the possibility that Judge Thomas could be quietly pressed to withdraw his nomination if she gave a confidential statement. Under cross-examination, she acknowledged that James Brudney, an aide to Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) did tell her that Judge Thomas might not want to press ahead with the nomination if she came forward. 4, No physical evidence. Despite her familiarity with sex discrimination law, Ms. Hill did not make any notes at ‘the time about Judge Thomas’s behav- ior. Furthermore, a parade of former Thomas employees testified that he nev- er made sexual advances to them and that they never heard rumors that he had made advances to other employees. 5. Why did Ms. Hill keep seeing and calling Judge Thomas if she was ha- rassed? Patricia Johnson, a former sub- ordinate of Judge Thomas at the EEOC, testified she could not believe “that a woman who has been victimized by the outrageously lewd, vile, and vulgar be- havior that has been described here would want to have, let alone maintain, any kind of rélationship with the man that victimized her.” Ms. Hill’s explana- tion: “I was afraid of retaliation. I was afraid of damage to my professional life, .. It takes an expert in psychology to explain how that can happen.” 6. If she was so disgusted by Judge Thomas, why did she volunteer in 1987 to drive Judge Thomas from a breakfast in Tulsa to the airport following a Thom- as speech? Ms, Hill testified: “I really don't recall that I voluntarily agreed to drive him to the airport. I think that the dean suggested that I drive him to the airport and that I said that I would.” The host of the breakfast, Dean Charles Kothe of Oral Roberts University, told the committee “as I recall it, she volun- teered to take him to the airport in her sports car. ACASE FOR ANITA HILL . 1. First corroborating witness, El- len Wells, a friend of Ms. Hill’s who now works for the American Welfare Associ- ation in Washington, testified: “In the fall of 1982, Professor Hill shared with me in confidence the fact that she con- sidered ‘Judge Thomas’s behavior ration, he said he wasn't sure if Ms. Hill mentioned Judge Thomas by name. 3, Third corroborating witness, | Susan J. Hoerchner, a friend of Ms.. | Hill’s in Washington a decade ago and, now a workers’ compensation judge in, California, said Ms, Hill told her by tele-. phone in the early 1980s “that she was.

Professor Hill did not at that time, nor in subsequent conversations; provide exact details about the action she found inappropriate conduct. She did tell me they were sexual in naturé:\"?, Later, a pro-Thomas witness, his long. time secretary Diane Holt, testified that Ms. Hill did have a friend named Ellew - Wells during that period. 2, Second corroborating witness, John William Carr, a Wall Street law- yer, testified that in 1983, when he was dating Anita Hill, she once told him in a, telephone call “that she was upset be-. cause her boss was making sexual ad. vances toward her.” Mr. Carr contin- ued: “I asked her to tell me what he had: done. It is my recollection that she told. me that Clarence Thomas had asked her out on dates and showed an unwanted sexual interest in her.” On cross-exami- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - being harassed, that she was being re;., peatedly asked out on dates.” Judge. Hoerchner said Ms. Hill told her “heey depressed and demoralized she was.’ 4. Fourth corroborating witness, American University law professor J od Paul testified that in 1987, while cons ering Ms. Hill for a teaching job, : asked her why she left the EEOC, “Pro- , fessor Hill responded, reluctantly and: with obvious emotion and embarrass»: ment, that she had been sexually ha-; Hil’ passing a polygraph test. ey rassed by her supervisor at the EEOC,” . according to Mr. Paul.

Undercutting their suggestion that she was part of a left-:, “ wing vendetta against conservative ju-., rists, law professor Joel Paul testified. that in 1987 Ms, Hill gave “her strong : support” for Supreme Court nominee. - Robert H.

        "ocr_text": "Massacre comes on eve: of House gun debate By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — A leading congressional opponent of assault gun limits predicted Wednesday that the Texas mass killing won’t affect the impending House vote on whether to outlaw pistol clips hold- ing more than seven rounds. “I don’t think it will change anyone’s mind,” said Rep. Steven Schiff, R-N.M. “I think those who believe criminals will always get weapons will believe that crimi- nals will always get weapons. And what you make illegal will not affect that.” The Texas cafe killer struck on the eve of a House debate on the long-pending crime bill that would, among other things, ban sales of 20 brands of assault guns. The bill also would ban clips for weapons larger than .22 caliber with more than seven rounds. The House bill contains a “grandfather clause” that allows existing assault guns and large- capacity ammunition clips to re- main in circulation. The suspected Texas murder weapon, an Austrian-made Glock 17 service pistol, could still be sold legally if the House bill is enacted because the Glock is not among the assault gun brands that the House Crime Subcommittee determined were most prevalent in crime. But if the bill is enacted, distrib- utors would have to stop selling Glocks and many other varieties of pistols, rifles and shotguns with clips holding more than seven rounds. Under House parliamentary ground rules for the crime bill, it is too late for the sponsors to add the Glock 17 to the ban list. The National Rifle Association is lobbying to block curbs on large- capacity clips as well as-on assault weapons.

        "ocr_text": "Atomie agency relied on spies By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — American and British intelligence enabled an international inspection team to dig out Baghdad’s nuclear secrets, the team’s leader told a Senate committee Thursday, warning that more such help is essential to keep the nuclear bombs away from Iraq and other rogue nations. : “We need to pay far greater attention to clandestine, rogue na- tions,” said David Kay, the pro- gram director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who led an inspection team held hostage in an Iraqi parking lot for four days last month when they refused to give up documents key to Iraq’s nuclear weapons development. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who also testified Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Commit- tee, outlined a proposal to give the JAEA some ammunition Kay said it needs to fight nuclear prolifera- tion. Kay said his agency requires “much closer collaboration with individual states,” pointing to the far greater capacity individual na- tions have for intelligence gather- ing. The “unique” intelligence shar- ing of recent months made success possible in Iraq, and it must be repeated, Kay said, Strong backing by the United Nations Security Council, including the use of sanctions, also is needed if the IAEA inspection system is going to work, Kay told the com- mittee. The IAEA is a United Na- tions agency. It was western spy-masters who produced the leads that sent Kay’s team to the buildings holding important documents, while it was Security Council demands for ac- cess that got inspectors into Iraq. Iraq, which continues to with- hold information from inspectors, still maintains a frightening capac- ity to rebuild its nuclear system because the scientific and technical know-how “remains firmly in the hands of the Iraqi personnel who directed and carried out this pro- gram,” Kay said. ‘There is no region of the world you will find that did not contribute’ to Iraq’s nuclear program. DAVID KAY U.N. weapons inspector “Clearly a long-term monitor- ing and verification program of substantial intrusiveness must be maintained in Iraq to ensure that a clandestine program does not re- start,” he said. Simply finding the companies that sold vital machinery and ma- terial to Iraq has not been easy. Kay said he did not see a single dual-use machine in Iraq that re- tained a nameplate or serial num- ber. And shipping cartons had names blotted out with paint. The documents Kay’s team cap- tured on its last harried trip to Baghdad, however, do contain com- pany names from which a list now is being compiled. “There is no region of the world you will find that did not contribute to that program,” Kay said. “It is a procurement network of breadth d ’ eoae . y histication. Is both companies and tries that Glenn wants to target in the first of two proposals. His bill would authorize the president to place sanctions against companies or individuals engaging in illicit nuclear commerce. For example, they would be banned from selling items to the U.S. government, or, in the case of foreign firms, they! would be prohibited from export-* ing goods to this country. . Nations helping other countries develop a nuclear program could also face cuts in foreign aid. Glenn's other proposal, a joint resolution filed this week, seeks: exactly the kind of help Kay said the IAEA needs, It urges the presi- dent to take initiatives at the Unit: ed Nations that would grant the’ agency routine access to certain intelligence material, a bigger agency budget and expanded pow-” ers, such as making unannounced ' inspections, to carry out its job of safeguarding the world from nucle- ar expansion. ; While Congress cannot reform an international agency, Glenn said, the U.S. government can and should pursue new initiatives to strengthen the IAEA.

        "ocr_text": "By MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Arabs and Is- raelis, shuttled into Middle East talks after months of cajoling by the American secretary of state, now must undertake what many view as an impossible mission: making the peace. Actions of the Israeli and Pales- tinian people in the days left be- fore the Oct. 30 peace conference opens in Madrid — assuming Isra- el’s cabinet formally agrees to the talks today — can determine the flexibility all sides carry with them to the negotiating table. Will Israelis and Arabs be so buoyed by prospects of peace, fi- nally, that they demand their leaders talk compromise? Or will hard-line Jewish settlers brandish Uzi submachine guns at huge, emotional rallies, crying never give an inch? Will Arab terrorists spill Jewish blood in the next ten days, calcifying already stiff posi- tions of Israeli officials? For now, a curious mix of opti- mism and pessimism pervades the process undertaken by Secretary of State James Baker III over the past six months. The simple fact that Baker’s immense effort is likely to draw all parties to a common peace table spawned the optimism. Pessimism grows from the wide, wide gap separating the sides as they prepare to be seated. “We'll see a deadlock from the first moment when, quite predict- ably, both sides put their well known positions on the table and none of them overlap,”’ said Wil- liam Quandt, a Middle East ana- lyst at the Brookings Institution. The primary worry is that Is- raeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Sha- mir has issued no sign that his government will compromise at all, particularly on withdrawing from any Arab land it occupies. Success will depend largely on whethér that is an opening posi- tion to bargain from or remains ‘ eee ie See Israeli settlements _ Jews israeli settlements a Jews E 4 Arabs SS RGRSL Ta gS Rk ASSES } Israeli settlements 12, + 420,000 Jews Arabs Source: Department Gannett News Service icicseibsditien iselicin-aithsins Unni ancianiiaiaes ANALYSIS an unyielding stand. Just getting to the table re- quired hard decisions and changes in position, Quandt said at a re- cent Middle East conference, and that is a plus. The Arabs have moved from problem-solving on the battlefield to trying the political process, he said. Another positive change is that Israelis are willing to have Palestinians represent themselves, rather than speak via the proxy of some Arab country. “On the other side, the Israeli government offers no incentives for the Arabs to negotiate. I think Shamir is more wedded to a hard- line view than many in his own party,” said Quandt, formerly a senior staff member of the Na- tional Security Council. A deadlocked conference will raise a serious snarl] in U.S.-Israel ‘another relations, he predicted, but it also may bring down Israel’s govern- ment and give the Israeli people unity to express what they want out of peace talks. : “If the Israeli electorate turns to power the same govern- ment, there is very little chance for peace,” Quandt said. ‘‘The U.S. can help clarify that choice for the Israeli voter.” Many Israeli conservatives do not even want to see the peace talks held, while those in the Is- raeli peace camp worry like Quandt that Shamir’s government will torpedo the conference. “The Ardbs have backed off ab- solutist positions, while Israel has. become more absolute,” said Ye- hoshafat Harkabi, emeritus pro- fessor at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University and former director of Israel's military intelligence. Harkabi, who described with- drawing from occupied land as a bad choice, but one necessary to achieve peace, said he does not see how it is “humanly possible” for Shamir’s Likud party to ac- cept such compromises. “Once they (negotiations) start they will hit the ground and be deadlocked,” Harkabi said. “If there is a community of interest, it is between the Israeli and Arab hard-liners.” Yet there is a sense that just holding « peace conference can make a difference. “The fact that we have a con- ference is a breakthrough. It is very important for the psyche of Israelis — to see on television Is- raelis sitting down at the table with Palestinians, Syrians, Egyp- tians Jordanians,” said Moshe Amirov, a Jerusalem City Council member who spoke here recently. Amirov, who left the rightist Li- kud Party to join the more dovish Shinui (liberal) Party in 1987, said the sight may have political rami- fications inside Israel. .

        "ocr_text": "Electrical glitches plague nuclear site 2 reactors at SRS had 22 ‘failures’ in past 14 months By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — An old prob- lem — unreliable electrical parts — has come back to trouble the Department of Energy as it pre- pares to restart the 37-year-old K-reactor to make nuclear bomb ingredients at the Savannah Riv- er Site near Aiken, S.C. The latest episode came Sept. 24, when a large transformer in the K-reactor building blew up. As four workers were getting ready to check out a circuit breaker, they heard ‘‘a loud noise . followed by sparks’ coming from the transformer, said an in- ternal DOE report on the episode. The broken transformer was part of a pattern of failures in electrical components of the re- actor’s emergency systems that has high-level Energy Depart- ment officials puzzled. Less than two weeks earlier, on Sept. 13, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had asked SRS officials for a special report on previous electrical malfunctions in the backup power supplies. Mr. Watkins, a retired admiral, is pre- paring to decide in December whether it is safe to restart the K- reactor now that it has undergone a $2 billion rehabilitation job aimed at curing its safety flaws. Replying to Mr. Watkins, the DOE’s resident K-reactor boss, Frank McCoy, listed 22 electrical component “failures” within the past 14 months at the K-reactor and a second dormant produc- tion reactor at SRS. Mr. McCoy dispatched his memo to Mr. Watkins on Sept. 24, only hours before the K-reactor’s transformer blew up. He and other DOE officials are now rushing to complete an investiga- tion on the transformer accident, with the results due in Mr. Wat- kins’s office this week. automatic circuit breakers that were designed to close during a E _ loss of power were verified to A large transformer in the K-reactor building at the Sa- vannah River Site in South Carolina blew up last month. The momentary blackout posed no threat to a working re- actor, because the K-reactor’s core has been shut down for three years. And even if the reactor had been running when the power failed, it would have constituted only a minuscule hazard, accord- ing to the government’s 1990 safety analysis of the K-reactor. The analysis says the reactor is designed to withstand power fail- ures “for extended periods.” In the Sept. 24 incident, elec- trical trouble spread beyond the blown transformer, even as four workers were escaping unhurt from the smoke-filled transform- er room. A circuit breaker that was supposed to isolate the trans- former room failed to trip, caus- ing an “overcurrent” in the 115,000-volt line that leads into the reactor building. The result was a brief “complete loss of power in the reactor building,” said the DOE’s incident report. Soon the reactor’s emergency diesel generators kicked on as designed, restoring power to safety systems. The exact dura-. tion of the power loss hasn’t been disclosed, but SRS spokesman Rick Ford said he understands it was a matter of seconds. The unexpected happened Inside the K-reactor building, the unexpected kept happening. Another circuit breaker failed to close, delaying efforts to restore normal power. One Energy De- partment document traced that to “wearing” in the circuit break- er due to age. After two hours and 45 min- utes, the K-reactor was switched back over to the normal plant- wide power grid. Everything seemed normal. But workers were stopped short again Sept. 25 when they tried to power up the air confinement system that is supposed to trap radioactivity in case of an accident. This time, one of the big motors that oper- ate the exhaust fans “burned out,” according to one document. Mr. McCoy’s Sept. 24 memo had told Mr. Watkins that the K- reactor had performed flawless- ly when it was put through a “loss of normal power test” in April 1991. “All automatic circuit break- ers that were designed to trip on a loss of power tripped open, all close,” Mr. McCoy wrote. The 22 other electrical mai- functions he listed took place both before and after the K-reac- tor passed its “loss of normal power test.” Among them were three fail- ures of K-reactor circuit break- ers similar to the Sept. 24 failure. There also was one instance when one of the K-reactor’s vital backup diesel generators failed to kick on due to “circuit problems.” : A decade of fix-up efforts SRS managers have been try- ing to cure similar weaknesses in the electrical circuitry of the K- reactor’s diesel generators and other emergency backup sys- tems for.more than a decade. ° None of the SRS reactors has ever had a major nuclear aeci- dent, but plant managers have had to withstand some close calls induced by electrical failures.- : On Dec. 5, 1979, the K-reac- tor was hit by a power brownout caused when a tractor sliced a downed power line 20 miles oitt- side the plant boundaries. A resulting brownout shut off four of the five sources of cooling water that the K-reactor crew had available to splash an irradj- ated rod that was being lowered into a cooling pool. One contributing factor in the 1979 near-miss was the electrical circuitry in the emergency diesel generators that are also sup- posed to give the K-reactor its emergency power. In the 1979 episode, one generator started and one failed. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 21, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Nuclear waste backlog piling up at Mound Restrictions stall shipments of contaminants By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE WASHINGTON — The Mound nuclear weapons plant in Miamis- burg “is becoming constipated with waste packages,” according to an internal Department of Ener- gy memo that surfaced Tuesday. The problem arose 18 months ago when a low-level nuclear waste dump at the government’s Nevada Test Site stopped accepting radio- logical waste from Mound and sev- eral weapons plants in other states, Since then, Mound has accumu- lated a backlog of 163,000 cubic feet of dirt and concrete contain- ing traces of tritium, plutonium and other nuclear contaminants. The nuclear wastes, packaged in more than 3,800 barrels and boxes, are being held inside Mound’s se- buildings and a fleet of 39 rented tractor-trailers, Mound officials said Tuesday. They said there was no threat to public health or the environment. “Waste storage (low-level, trans- uranic and mixed) is a significant issue at the Mound site,” wrote Steven M. Blush, director of the Energy Departments office of nu- clear safety, in a July 24 memo to “Due to restrictions on shipping waste to Nevada and continuing decontamination activity at Mound, the site is becoming con- stipated with waste packages. In- terim storage measures include storing drums in rented semi- truck trailers and storing bins (mostly contaminated soil) in vari- ous open areas around the site.” James Griffin, chief of waste management at Mound, said he hopes to obtain clearance by next April to resume cross-country truck shipments of the low-level wastes to the Nevada Test Site. He said his office has begun com- piling information now required by the Nevada waste dump on the precise contents of the first 682 boxes of wastes he wants to ship from Mound. “There is no environmental problem, there is no threat to the people around here, there is no threat to health, but the contain- ers are unsightly,” Griffin said. He acknowledged that the volume of stored wastes had reached an all- time high at Mound. Another Mound official, John Lemming, manager of radiological and industrial safety, said, “In fact, we do have a bit of a waste consti- pation problem.” ; Mound’s chief spokesman, How- ard Charbeneau, said the boxes of waste mainly contain radioactive dirt scraped up around the site as part of a long-term cleanup effort. Most of the barrels are filled with concrete containing traces of triti- um, In his memo to Energy Secretary Dayton Daily News - October 23, 1991 James Watkins, Blush said Mound should significantly improve its procedures for handling the accu- mulating wastes by taking two steps: @ Begin regular measurements of the levels of radioactivity inside buildings where wastes containers are stored. @ Take better care of an unspec- ified number of drums containing plutonium-contaminated sludge that were stored outside on a load- ing bay “for an extended period of time.” Griffin said that in keeping with Blush’s recommendations, Mound officials have begun routine radio- activity measurements and have moved about 50 plutonium sludge drums inside trucks, where they are better protected from rain. At the sprawling Nevada Test Site. spokesman Darwin Morgan said the government’s low-level waste dump has “become more stringent in recent years about what we accept.” In April 1990 the Nevada facility cut off all shipments from the gov- ernment’s nuclear weapons plants after inspectors from the Depart- ment of Energy found that the site’s overseers couldn’t document what kinds of wastes it had been taking in from Mound and other plants that make parts for nuclear weapons. Morgan said a team from Mound visited Nevada two weeks ago to begin working on a detailed appli- cation for resumed nuclear waste shipments. “We have to be able to certify to the state of Nevada that we know everything we are getting,” Mor- gan said. “It is part of our good neighbor policy.” \f"

        "ocr_text": " Schwarzkopf: Bush right to end war He says U.S. couldn’t aifoed to run Baghdad By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU ashington — Retired Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf said Wednesday that his troops could have marched into Baghdad “in two days,” but he insisted that that would have been a Vietnam-sized mistake. Previewing themes he is likely to trumpet in his memoirs next year, Mr. Schwarzkopf said the American-led alli- ance “would have fallen apart in a heart- beat” if he had been ordered to capture all of Iraq. He said that would have put U.S. troops in the same bind as their com- patriots in Vietnam, who had to fight a generation earlier without international “legitimacy.” _ Ebullient as ever with his 240 pounds tailored into a banker’s charcoal grey suit, Mr. Schwarzkopf told 2,000 trucking executives that American taxpayers _ saved billions because of President Bush’s decision to stop the ground war without trying to seize the Iraqi capital. “Once you take over a country, you are responsible for everything,” he said. “The school system, the government, the sewage — you name it, and you are re- sponsible. And I don’t think the United States of America is prepared today to come up with the amount of money it would have taken to occupy Iraq.” Troops could have gone on fighting Mr. Schwarzkopf said his troops could have fought on for another 24 to 48 hours and inflicted more destruction on Iraqi forces fleeing from Kuwait. “It wouldn’t have made a bit of difference in what happened later on in Iraq,” he said. He did not repeat the hint he dropped in a television interview seven months ago that he secretly recommended to Washington that the war should go on for another few days so that Iraqi Republi- can Guard units could be crushed. But he left no doubt that he felt Iraq’s capital was within his grasp at the end of Open tion Desert Storm. “Should we have gone on aid marched into Baghdad because we could have been Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 24, H. Norman Schwarzkopf says his Desert Storm troops could have made it to Baghdad in two days. “T don’t think the United _ States of America is prepared today to come up with the amount of money it would have taken to occupy Iraq.” — H. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF there in two days?” he asked rhetorically. “The answer is absolutely not.” ‘We kicked the bully’s teeth in’ Mr. Schwarzkopf said “it wouldn’t have broken my heart” if President Saddam Hussein had been killed in one of the 126,000 aerial sorties on Iraq. But he once again defended his decision not to “target” Saddam as an individual, saying this coun- try has never fought that kind of a war. “T say we kicked the bully’s teeth in,” said the former general, 57, finishing his talk with a tough-guy phrase as if to justi- fy his nickname, “Stormin’ Norman.” But through most of his 90-minute ap- pearance he seemed intent on softening his wartime image and projecting him-- . self instead as a wise old football coach after a global Super Bowl. “Do you think the Arabs would be © coming to the peace table to work out the Palestinian problem with Israel if Sad- dam Hussein still had any sway over mod-_ ern Arabs?” he asked. “Of course not. © “Frankly, if Saddam Hussein leaves, I am not too sure who he is going to be re- placed with,” Mr. Schwarzkopf said. “We might be worse off than we are.” - The American Trucking Association, a lobbying group that represents long- haul truckers in their perennial battle against the railroads, paid Mr. Schwarz- kopf an undisclosed honorarium to draw him from his $420,000 rented retirement home in a luxury golf course complex near Tampa. Civilian life taking a big adjustment In exchange for his fee, Mr. Schwarz- kopf filled a hotel ballroom with a rapid- fire briefing on the logistic wizardry of Operation Desert Storm, along with some philosophy on leadership (“Failure is not’ in my vocabulary and it shouldn’t be in yours”). He drew belly laughs when he told — about the “traumatic experience” of changing from a four-star general to a ci- vilian Aug. 31. “Seven months ago, I could give a sin- gle command and 541,000 people would immediately obey it,” he said. “Today I can’t get a plumber to come to my house.” Once several months ago, wearing blue jeans instead of his desert khakis, he drove his truck to visit some friends at a fishing club at Boca Grande, Fla. The — guard at the gate, not recognizing him, was skeptical about letting Mr. Schwarz- kopf inside, even after he had been cleared by his host. Finally, he said, the guard lifted the gate after advising ‘him to enter a contest for “Schwarzenberger look-alikes.” “You all live in a very strange world out there,” Mr. Schwarzkopf observed . with a laugh. “And I am having a hard ~ time adjusting to it.” \f"

        "ocr_text": " Israelis, Arabs have swapped positions on land for peace By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — In a critical Mid- die East convolution, Arabs and Is- raelis have swapped positions on the longtime linchpin of a regional peace settlement: trading land for peace. For years it was the Arabs — Syri- ans, Jordanians, Palestinians and others — who refused to accept U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, de- spite badgering by Americans, Euro- peans and, most of all, Israelis sound- ing eager for peace. Now it’s the Is- raelis who are balking, just as the Arabs finally are ready to talk. Israel's leaders do not disavow the U.N. resolution adopted after the 1967 Middle East war. But they say they met its terms by giving up the Sinai Peninsula ip the 1979 peace pact with Egypt, and they say they will not relinquish more territory. The only thing left, they imply, is for the rest of the Arabs to deliver peace. The Bush administration, the driving force of the conference that opens Wednesday in Madrid, contin- ues to cite this resolution as the bed- rock for building peace. Adopted five months after Israel occupied the Golan Heights, West Bank, Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula in the Six-Day War, the resolution emphasizes “the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace,” Key provisions call for “with- drawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict” and for an end to the con- tinuing state of war, with “respect for and acknowledgment of the sover- eignty, territorial integrity and polit- ical independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.” Arabs rejected this U.N. formula in 1967 and later. They refused to recognize Israel’s existence, refused to offer peace, and sometimes re- fused even to talk to international mediators working for peace. Rejection by Syria and Egypt translated into war again in 1973, but they were not alone in scorning peace with Israel. In 1974, the Palestine Liberation Organization reiterated its opposition to Resolution 242, and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat envi- sioned far the U.N. General Assem- bly a single state of Palestine that would erase Israel from the map. When Egyptian President Anwar Sadat finally swerved from militancy . to enter the Camp David peace proc- ess, culminating in a trade of land for peace under a 1979 agreement, Egypt was ostracized throughout the Arab world. But conditions changed. The So- | viet collapse ended huge infusions of arms to the Arab countries. The Pal- estinian uprising led to new calls for peaceful steps to liberate the occu- pied territories, And the Persian Gulf War created a realignment in which Arabs saw they could work with the West. Even Mr. Arafat articulated acceptance of Resolution 242. As the Arabs drew closer to the 1967 formula, Israel backed further ‘away. — Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 27, 1991 \f"

Whether Palestine was _ in- cluded remains unclear even today. Palestine population: Arabs, 600,000; Jews, 85,000. @ MAY, 1916 — Britain and France sign the Sykes-Picot agreement splitting Arab por- tions of the Ottoman Empire into spheres of influence and designating Palestine as an international zone rather than Part of the promised Arab nation. @ NOVEMBER, 1917 — In ef- fort to get Jewish help for the Allied cause in World War 1, Britain promises in the Bal- four Declaration to create ‘‘a national home for the Jewish people’’ in Palestine. @ 1922 — The League of Na- tions grants Britain a ‘‘man- date’’ to administer Palestine until local residents are ready for sovereignty. A clause calls for “a Jewish national home’’ there, but not a Jewish state, and Brit- ain permits free Jewish immigra- tion for the first time in modern history. @ 19396-1939 — The Arab rebel- lion, with strikes, disturbances and violent attacks by Arabs, protests British rule and increas- ing Jewish immigration, which Arabs blame for deepening eco- nomic troubles. Population in 1935: Arabs, 960,000; Jews, 375,000. @ JULY, 1937 — Britain govern- ment declares that Arabs and Jews are locked in ‘‘irreconcil- able conflict’’ and proposes di- viding Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem an international enclave. @ MAY, 1939 — Britain reverses itself, declaring that there should be a single Palestinian state with- in ten years and that Jewish im- migration must be limited to stop clashes with Arabs. @ JULY, 1946 — The bombing of British headquarters at King Da- vid Hotel in Jerusalem highlights a wave of Jewish terrorism, prompted in part by immigration caps retained despite the des- peration of Jewish refugees after @ NOVEMBER, 1947 — The Unit- ed Nations, inheriting the prob- lem of Palestine from Britain, votes to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem an international zone. Hostilities flare up between Arabs, who refuse the plan, and Jews, who accept it. Population: Arabs, 900,000; Jews, 600,000. @ MAY, 1948 — Britain pulls out its last troops. Jews declare the state of Israel, and neighboring Arab armies attack to regain Pal- estine for the Arabs. @ MAY 1948-APRIL, 1949 — In fighting, Israelis win more land than allotted by the U.N. parti- tion, including West Jerusalem. The war creates 750,000 to 800,000 Arab refugees, whom Is- rael refuses to let return to Israe- li-held land. Jordan takes over the rest of Palestine, which grows chaotic as it becomes crammed with refugees. The enemies sign | armistice agreements, but Israel fails to achieve a peace treaty | with any Arab foe. @ MAY, 1948-DECEMBER, 1949 — 340,000 Jews immigrate to Is- rael, quickly filling up former towns and homes formerly occu- pied by Arabs.

        "ocr_text": " Settlements policy used by Israel since 1948 to expand territory By Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service ASHINGTON — The Israeli settlements policy, which has provoked anger and dis- tress in the Bush administration, is hardly new. It is the tried and successful way Israel has en- larged itself since 1948, The policy that Secretary of State James Baker called one of the greatest obstructions to peace is what Israel's first president, Da- vid Ben-Gurion, called “creating facts,” As Arabs — and American lead- ers, too — watch Israel create new “facts” in occupied Arab lands, they see possibilities for negotia- tion disappear. In 1948, Ben-Gurion and his Cabinet devised a way to hold ter- ritory Israel seized after Palestine was partitioned into Arab and Jewish nations, The partitioning sparked the first Arab-Israeli war, during which Israel captured land the United Nations had designated for the Arabs. Even before the fighting ended, groups of young war veterans were dispatched to the captured areas to build settlements. Once armistice lines were drawn, Israeli leaders channeled thousands of new immi- grants to the border areas, making those lands irrevo- cably Israeli. Austin American-Statesman - October 27, 1991 As Israel creates new ‘facts’ in occupied lands, possibilities for negotiation seem to disappear. After the 1967 war, when Israel took the Golan Heights from Syria, the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip and Sinai from Egypt, settling was im- mediate. This was in spite of U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which said Israel should withdraw from land newly occupied in return for peace and rec- ognition from Arabs. Extensive settling came in Arab East Jerusalem, where Jewish apartment complexes soon sprawled across hillsides. Jewish neighborhoods now are so thickly settled there that even many Israe- li peaceniks cannot imagine relin- quishing them, not even for peace. The movement of ideological settlers, the Israelis acting ex- pressly to make the West Bank part of Greater Israel, did not pick up steam until 1977, when the right wing elected its first prime minister, Menachem Begin. Hard-line advocates of annex- ation have pushed the number of settlers to nearly 100,000. Govern- ment incentives to locate in subsidized housing — with amenities ranging from health clinics to super- highways — are attracting struggling young families who are not necessarily ideologues but cannot afford high prices inside Israel proper. The newest settlements are strategically located to form lines of construction connecting older settle- ments in the West Bank with the rest of Israel. \f"

Nobody would adhere to this because it is not practical,” Assad said, “But, | am discussing the final settlement, which must be a comprehensive one, On the other hand, if one committee is advancing rapidly, and another is moy- ing slowly, that is only the nature of things, and it is inevitable.” Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who ap- peared Sunday on ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, said he will be disappointed if the United States, which is co-sponsoring the conference with the Soviet Union, takes “an even-handed position when negotiations are held between Israel, the only democ- racy in the area, and countries run by totalitarian rulers that have time and again attacked Israel.” Also appearing Sunday on This Week with David Brinkley, Secretary of State James Baker pledged the United States will remain even-handed, He ao se ee ie ta * ing differences, “We should not go into this conference thinking that this two and a half to three days is going to produce peace in the Mideast,” he said. In separate interviews, Shamir and Dr. Haider Abdel-Shafi, head of the Palestinian delegation, ac- knowledged for the first time that each side has overlapping claims to land and that exact boundaries must be subject to negotiation. Israel and Palestinians want the West Bank, and to a lesser extent the Gaza Strip, which are overwhelm- ingly populated by Palestinians but controlled by Israel since the 1967 war. Shamir, rather than simply restating Israel's bibli- cal claim to the land, said the primary problem to be settled is the territorial one, “We cannot — nobody can — avoid it, avoid a discussion about it because this is maybe the essence of the conflict,” Shamir said, A broad gap separates the two sides, he said, but it can be bridged if there is political will to do it, Abdel-Shafi, speaking Sunday on the ABC pro- gram, said the Palestinians believed there should be “almost total” Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, in a rare if minor departure from the Palestinian demand for full withdrawal. But he ac- knowledged even that is negotiable, “However, if Israel sticks to this point, well, let us put it on the negotiating table,” he said, Regarding the dispute over the Palestinian delega- tion, Abdel-Shafi admitted one of the Palestinian delegates had been “provocative” in stating that he had been selected for the job by the leaders of the PLO, Israeli leaders have vowed not to sit at the table with anyone who says he represents the PLO, Palm Beach Post - October 28, 1991 \f"

WASHINGTON BUREAU WASHINGTON — Today's meeting in Madrid between President Bush and President Mikhail §. Gorbachev will starkly expose how yesterday's super: power Soviet Union is in danger of surviv- ing today as little more than a Third World supplicant. The brief meeting, probably little more than a two-hour lunch, will be on a distant power level from the summitry these two leaders joined as recently as last July. The only specific development consid- ered possible to issue from the meeting is aU.S. food aid package to keep Soviet citi- zens from starving this winter. Even that is questionable, since the administration has had trouble figuring out who could be held responsible for food loans in the dis- integrating Soviet Union or how to assure that commodities would get properly dis- tributed to needy people. The Madrid meeting will hardly resem- ble the heady days when a Soviet and an American leader could mold the fate of mil- lions of people in every corner of the world. One senior administration official said Mr. Gorbachev is becoming “irrelevant.” “What's different about this [meeting] is that it comes at a time when events are moving rapidly and negatively for him. His problems are increasing, certainly not get- ting any easier, and his ability to solve them has probably been reduced,” said the offi- cial, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The two leaders, who enjoy a good per’ sonal chemistry, are expected to talk fur- ther about weapons reductions after the unilateral proposals each recently made for dramatic nuclear cutbacks. But Mr. Bush is said to have no specific goals or timetables to present at this meeting, and officials said they expect no new arms announcements. One reason is that the Americans no longer are certain Mr. Gorbachev can de- liver. The administration already has estab- lished contacts with leaders of the repub- lies, “T think it’s less a case of looking for Gorbachev to be overthrown or anything like that, than that the ground is just slip- ms out from under him,” said the offi cial.

Gal- lucci, deputy chief of the U.N. special commission on Iraq, said Monday. “We have a substantial amount of leaking agents, we have overpressures develop- ing in the bulk chemical containers, The situation is not stable; it is not safe.” Mr. Gallucci identified the site as the Al Muthanna State Facility, a desert com- pound near the ancient city of Samarra, along the Tigris River. Before Operation Desert Storm, it was Iraq's main poison gas factory and gas storage site. During the air war, bombers knocked out the gas-making machinery, but thousands of containers of nerve and mustard gas still are stored there in open fields or in concrete bunkers. Mr. Gallucci said a large team of U.N. inspectors is now at Al Muthanna consid- ering the safest way to destroy Iraq’s re- maining chemicals, starting early next year. He estimated that the task will cost $100 million to $200 million and require one to two years. Mr. Gallucci said that in the last four months, U.N. inspectors in Iraq have found a “truly extraordinary” quantity of war chemicals at Al Muthanna and lesser sites scattered throughout Iraq. His list, which has been reported to the U.N. Security Council, included: > 30 warheads for Scud-type missiles filled with a mixture of nerve agents; > 45,000 artillery projectiles contain- ing nerve agent or mustard gas; > 600 to 700 tons of barrels containing nerve agent, mustard gas, and military- strength tear gas. He said the 30 Scud-type warheads, which Iraq disclosed to the United Nations last April, were found by the inspectors at an outlying site this summer and trans- ported tO Al Muthanna for safekeeping, At Al Muthanna, he said, the inspectors worked last summer in 115-degree heat in- side protective suits, inspecting hundreds of unmarked barrels and artillery projec- tiles. Mr. Gallucci said an Iraqi soldier was nearly killed last summer while helping a U.N. team destroy some projectiles. Iraqi supervisors on the site assured the inspec- tors the cylinders were empty. But one projectile, a small rocket, exploded and “ah nerve agent a few yards from the soldier. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 29, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Mideast talks could be Gorbachev's last hurrah By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Wednesday's opening of the Middle East peace conference in Madrid may have been Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev’s most urgent ap- pearance on the world stage. He used it to make not only an entreaty for peace, but a plain- tive plea for help in holding the Soviet Union together. “This is the last time Gorba- chev is going to have a shot at the world stage, ever,” said Martha Olcott, political science profes- sor at Colgate University. “If he doesn’t use this to get his mes- sage across, he’s given up his last shot. In a sense, he had to take this gamble.” Mr. Gorbachev's unusual ap- peal underscored both the dra- matic unraveling of his nation and the fact that what remains of the Soviet Union can play little role in nudging the Middle East Mikhail Gorbachev: “What is hap- pening in the Soviet Union has a larger bearing than any regional conflict on the vital interests of ... today’s world.” toward peace, despite the Sovi- ets’ co-sponsorship of the con- ference. Mr. Gorbachev delivered that message in the last third of his opening remarks, focusing on his problems at home. He appealed for international support to help him weather a crisis that he called more important than the long and costly Middle East con- flict he had come to Madrid to address. “The world community is be- coming increasingly aware that what is happening in the Soviet Union has a larger bearing than: any regional conflict on the vital interests of the greater parts of today’s world,” Mr. Gorbachev said, He boldly asserted that his nation’s crisis will blow over and leave a union able to resume the position of world power econom- ‘ically, politically and intellec- tually. But he stressed that the world community cannot remain indifferent to the Soviet Union’s urgent needs, especially because his country “launched the initia- tive to end confrontation and to join up with the rest of the world.” It would be surprising if Mr. Gorbachev had not slid his focus from the Middle East to his home front, said Michael Mandel- baum, director of American for- eign policy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. “There is the immediacy of the crisis, the overwhelming character of it, and the fact that he’s struggling without a lot o visible success to remain rele- vant to it,” Mr. Mandelbaum said, He questioned whether the Soviet Union at this point can have any impact on the Middle East peace process, anyway. James Millar, director of the Institute for Sino-Soviet Studies at George Washington Universi- ty, said the presence of the Soviet Union at a Middle East peace conference in itself testifies to its waning influence. “This meeting could never have taken place in the old days during the Cold War,” Mr. Millar said. “The reason it’s coming about is because the Soviet Un- ion no longer is a superpower and its clients in the Middle East have realized they must make some kind of reconciliation with the United States.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 31, 1991 \f"

And if Syria moves forward into the next round of talks — bilateral negotiations with Is- rael — the head-to-head con- frontation will be the most dif- ficult to push toward progress. “‘The Syrian speeches en- gendered nothing but pessi- mism,’’ said Robert Satloff, an analyst at the Washington In- stitute for Near East Policy. Mr. Satloff said a positive note is that Syria fell short of its goal to gain control over the other Arab delegations during the three-day ceremonial open- ing of peace talks in Madrid. Not only did the Palestinian and Jordanian delegates speak in measured tones hinting at possible compromises, but the Palestinians sounded eager to forge ahead into substantive talks with Israel. In other bad signs for Syria, the Jordanians acknowledged that resolving regional issues is integral to achieving peace, and other Arabs present as ob- servers indicated a continued willingness to enter the third round of negotiations — re- gional talks that are expected to begin in two weeks.

It can still buy the weapons so important to its tough image but must pay today’s arms merchants in cash and on time. The collapse of the Soviet Union provided a main reason Syria joined the peace confer- ence. It wants to improve rela- tions with the United States to open new avenues of trade and credit, especially if it can get removed from the U.S. list of states supporting terrorism. Mr. Lewis said that will be the biggest attraction for Syria to continue talking. 1991 \f"

Israeli authorities sum- marily shut down Palestinian schools for months during trou- ed times, commonly jail Pal- tinians without charges, and routinely put entire towns un- der days or weeks of curfews during which people cannot leave their homes. If they de- mand to keep these powers, talks will be difficult. “They [the Palestinians] would be garbage collectors and doing basic services the Israelis probably would rath- er not be doing,” said Albert Mokhiber, president of the American-Arab Anti-Dis- crimination Committee. “The Palestinian population doesn’t want to be left high and dry like the American Indian pop- ulation. They don’t want to be put on Indian reservations.” An Israeli official in Wash- ington, who spoke on condi- _ tion of anonymity, said his government’s view of Pales- tinian self-rule today “is way beyond garbage collecting.” “It’s daily control over their own lives short of any things that are attributes of sovereign- ty,” he said. He cited trade, education, and culture as ex- amples of areas to be controlled The Associated Press Lebanese villagers lis- ten to evacuation orders Saturday. See article, A2. by the Palestinians. Probably the toughest ques- tion is the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. The Palestinians want Is- rael to stop expanding and building new _ settlements, which frequently are raised on land the Israeli govern- . ment confiscates. Negotiating an agreement will be sticky, but talks cer- tainly would falter if Palestin- ians go a step further and de- mand, as some would like, that the nearly 100,000 Israeli set- tlers now living in the territo- ries be required to leave. If not that, will the Pales- tinians want to gain adminis- trative control over the Jewish settlements? The issue of water also could cause trouble. Now Isra- el gets much of its water from aquifers under the West Bank. Should the Palestinians try to stop its flow, Israel would balk. Despite these many snag points, analysts in Washington still say the Palestinian-Israe- li talks over self-rule carry the greatest prospect for success. “These are all issues you can negotiate about. They’re not ideological,” said Sam Lew- is, director of the United States Institute for Peace and U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Camp David peace talks. The finality of Israel giv- ing up land or of creating an independent Palestinian state does not enter these talks. “On all these issues there is a framework for a deal,” said Robert Satloff, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Even on the hardest issues, a solution is imaginable, he said. For example, a deal could tie the number of Israeli settlers allowed to the number of non-resident Palestinians permitted to return to the ter- ritories. Jordanians will be talking. also, as part of a joint delega- tion with the Palestinians, and that could further ease the talks. “The extent to which the Jordanians are willing to play a role [in the territories], es- pecially with security, affects how much Israel is willing to loosen its grip,” he said.

        "ocr_text": " Soviet seeks money to safeguard arms Up to $2 billion in U.S. aid is needed to remove and destroy nuclear weapons now in Soviet republics. By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The chief of the Soviet nuclear weapons complex has appealed to the United States for up to $2 billion in aid to help him move thousands of nuclear warheads from unstable Soviet republics. In meetings with senators and U.S. weapons ex- perts last month, Viktor Mikhaylov warned that all nuclear weapons storage depots in the Russian Repub- lic are already crammed with obsolete warheads. Mikhaylov, the Soviet deputy minister of atomic power and industry, said that unless his ministry gets a foreign cash infusion, he will have to store surplus warheads for as long as 10 years inside bunkers in the Ukraine and other independence-minded republics, That prospect has caused shudders among some nuclear weapons experts, especially since the Ukraini- an parliament has proclaimed its determination to create a 400,000-strong Ukrainian army. The republic, which borders Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, expects to achieve full sovereignty through a popular referendum set for Dec, 1. ‘If this is how much it would cost to get 10,000 nuclear weapons out of the hands of the republics and see them destroyed, it could be a bargain,” said Chris Paine, a weapons expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council who heard the presentation. In a reflection of the chaos besetting official Moscow, Mikhaylov launched his plea without going through ordinary diplomatic channels, Arriving as a member of a Soviet scientific delega- tion on Oct. 18, he spoke first to private American scientists and then in quickly arranged meetings with four senators. He is also thought to have met with at least one Bush administration official. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the ranking Republi- can on the Senate defense appropriations subcommit- tee, took interest in the proposal and urged the Soviet delegates to present it to the Bush administration through government-to-government channels, accord- ing to his spokesman. Mikhaylov also met with Sen. John Warner, R-Va., Sen, Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Sen. Jeff Bingaman, Palm Beach Post - November 4, 1991 D-N.M., and aides to Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. A Nunn aide said Mikhaylov laid out a plan to spend $2 billion in foreign money over the next four to five years. Mikhaylov said the money would build a new complex inside Russia that could temporarily store thousands of weapons, take them apart and then keep the resulting uranium and plutonium in long-term storage vaults. If the money is approved, his ministry will be ready to dismantle 10,000 to 20,000 nuclear warheads over the next seven to nine years, Mikhaylov said. These include the thousands of ground-based tactical missile warheads, nuclear mines and atomic artillery shells that President Mikhail Gorbachev promised to dis- mantle in an Oct. § statement. The Defense Department has estimated that the Soviet Union has 27,000 nuclear weapons, According to anew unofficial estimate by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 19,000 of these weapons are in Russia, 4,000 are in the Ukraine, 1,800 are in Kazakhstan, 1,250 are in Byelorussia and the rest scattered in eight other Soviet republics. \f"

        "ocr_text": " storm of outrage ngulfs proposal to help Kremlin By Marcia Kunstel INGTON BUREAU —A Ee proposal to di- vert $1 billion Ties oes the defense budget for Soviet aid ran into sudden and intense opposition Thurs- day, largely from legislators listening to voters’ de- mands to solve problems at home. “It’s outrageous to me that we’re making for- ely aid a priority over domestic aid,” Sen. Alan n (D-IIl.) said on the Senate floor. “How can help the Russians and continue to ignore our own citizens?” Other senators threatened to filibuster the en- tire budget bill if it comes to the floor with the pro- vision authorizing the president to spend the mon- ey getting food to the Soviet Union and helping the Soviets dismantle their defense apparatus. They talked of failing U.S. businesses, rising unemploy- ment and a host of needs in this country. Both Democrats and Republicans expressed displeasure with the proposal, and there were bi- partisan calls for removing it in order to save the $291 billion defense authorization bill. The $1 billion aid plan was devised by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) and tacked onto a compromise budget bill that was ex- pected to go back to the House for a vote this week. . Mr. Nunn had tried to head off criticism by sending out a summary emphasizing the measure “is not a blank check” and “is not foreign aid.” The president could use the money to deliver emergency food and medicine as well as to help the Soviets convert their military industries to civilian use and retrain military personnel. Aims include stemming civilian unrest, military disaffection and general instability in the country that still holds thousands of nuclear weapens, Mr. Nunn said in a letter to fellow senators. Helping the Soviets retool their military weap- ons complex was a frequent target of criticism by senators who asked how they could explain it to lo- cal voters seeing military bases close or defense in- dustries lay off workers. © Rep. Charles Bennett (D-Fla.) said he will ask the House Rules Committee to declare that the pro- vision is outside the scope of the bill and so should be stricken as a matter of procedure. If that doesn’t work, he will ask the full House to vote on an amendment deleting the Soviet aid. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 8, 1991 \f"

Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 10, 1991 > \fStealth | fighter Other factors helped clear the way. One of the biggest was polit- ical: The election of President Ronald Reagan in 1980 brought to the Pentagon free-spending hawkish managers who were looking for new projects to gaina military edge over the Soviet “evil empire.”’ The. combination of super- computers at the “Skunk Works” and superhawks in the Pentagon allowed the Air Force to win ap- Proval from Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger in No- vember 1981 to start spending research money on what was called the Advanced Technology Fighter. It was to be the Air Force’s dream plane for the 21st century — one as powerful as the F-15S and as stealthy as the F-117. It _also had to be the world’s deadli- est fighter, with missiles capable of knocking down the next-gen- eration Soviet MiG-29s from doz- STAFF ens of miles away. Seven aircraft makers sub- mitted schemes to build the Ad- vanced Technology Fighter after the Air Force laid out its require- ments in a 1984 “statement of need.’” In 1986, the Air Force nar- rowed the competition to the pro- posals by Lockheed and Nor- throp Corp. Then, for reasons that were at least partly political, Lockheed expanded its develop- ment team to include Boeing and General Dynamics. And throp went into partnership with the McDonnell Aircraft division | of McDonnell Douglas Corp. By mid-1990, Lockheed’s aeronautical systems _ division, headquartered in Marietta with branches in California, had gone beyond computer design and pieced together two handmade prototypes that were much more re diana than the older F- Fi Nor- _ Northrop had built two proto- types of its rival design, which emphasized raw speed and Stealth qualities at the expense Last the Air Force gave the two development teams a novel challenge. Before their planes flew the first time, Northrop and Lock- heed were required to submit predictions in sealed envelopes on exactly how fast their planes would fiy, how tightly they would turn and a list of other detailed flight characteristics. The idea was that if they were close in their early predictions, the Air Force could be more certain that the contractor could deliver when it came time to actually build airplanes. “They came very close; both of them did,”’ General Ralston said. Last April 23, the Air Force an- nounced that the Lockheed- ing-General Dynamics team won a $9.5 billion contract to build the air frame, and that Pratt & Whitey would get a $1.4 billion contract to make the engines. The Air Force has been vague in explaining why it ultimately chose Lockheed over Northrop. The most convincing explanation so far was put forward by Mili- tary Technology magazine. In May, it. wrote that Northrop failed by designing the ‘‘wrong’”’ Plane: one that was faster and stealthier, but inferior for the dogfight that is the apex of a mili- tary pilot’s life. In the coming decade, Con- gress and the White House will have scores of opportunities to stretch out or kill the F-22 pro- ject. If the Cold War keeps reced- ing, congressional critics may materialize as early as next year. But one factor seems unshak- able: From first lieutenants to four-star generals, the fighter pi- lots who run the Air Force are go- ing to keep pushing for the F-22 They realize the F-15 is get- ting older and the Air Force is getting smaller. They see this Plane as the Air Force’s ticket to the future. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 10, 1991 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "US. chill eo Soviet aid Problems mount -as Bush delays By Marcia Kunstel ' WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The Bush “administration, poised to send the Soviet Union only a fraction ~of the emergency aid it has re- juested, already has delayed sacting so'long that needed food and medicine cannot arrive un- til the depths of winter. _- And the longer it postpones action, the harsher the U.S. do- -mestic political climate be- ‘comes as Americans raise de- “mands for more spending at home, not abroad. ‘» The administration has con- ' facted such private groups as United Way International about «helping the neediest Soviets. “But the groups have yet to get the go-ahead to assemble plans and staff to carry out distribu- , tion across the broad and tough _ Soviet terrain. _ “We're really making the .gituation more difficult with ev- ery day that we delay,” said Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D- _Minn.), a member of the House Select Committee on Hunger. _«The shortages will be greater - by the time food arrives. Deliv- ery will be impeded by weather conditions. », “All of that will result in ad- ditional turmoil and distress and dissatisfaction on the part of the Soviet people, and that does not bode well for the reform government,” Mr. Penny said. No certain start date Christopher Goldthwait, as- sistant administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service in the U.S. Department of Agricul- ture, says it’s still uncertain when the administration might be ready to announce the scope of an aid plan or even whether it will give direct food aid. “Tt’s difficult to put a pre- cise date out there, because we're looking at a moving tar- get,” said Mr. Goldthwait, Speaking of ever-changing con- ditions in the Soviet Union. Word leaked from last week’s NATO meeting in Rome that the total aid package would come to around $1 billion, a fig- ure that congressional staffers and others following the issue said they also have heard. The Soviets asked for $3.5 billion from the United States, with $1 billion in the form of food and medicine and the remaining $2.5 billion in credits toward the purchase of commodities. Food riots, unrest feared John Glaser, chief operating officer of United Way Interna- tional, said he expects the di- rect aid to be “on a much small- er scale than the Soviets re- quested,” which means the distribution of food and medi- cine must be finely targeted to reach the right people. Ideally, he said, food should be in needy Soviet households by Christmas, but already it is so late that only token amounts could be distributed by then if action began immediately. Should the administration de- cide on its program before Thanksgiving, groups such as United Way could get most of it delivered by the end of Janu- ary, he said. In recent congressional tes- timony, Mr. Glaser outlined a distribution plan that would link a complicated network of Amer- ican private voluntary organiza- tions, local private voluntary or- ganizations in the various Soviet republics, and local govern- ments that could be trusted. “It would be necessary to follow each shipment from the time it arrives in the Soviet Un- ion until it reaches its final des- tination,” Mr. Glaser said, refer- ring to widespread theft and black marketing by what has be- come know as the Soviet mafia. While few observers predict widespread starvation in the Soviet Union this winter even without any U.S. aid, other un- desirable effects have been pre- dicted. Marshall Goldman of Har- vard’s Russian Research Cen- ter said food shortages of the most basic commodities were being seen as early as August. He said that if they continue and expand, they could lead to average Soviets staging “a coup from below.” Mr. Glaser, who pointed out that even bread is now in short supply, said there could be food riots as predicted by several So- viet officials. “The people are very angry,” Mr. Glaser said. Every day the administra- tion delays getting its aid pro- gram started, the U.S. political Climate worsens. Public de- mands to tend to domestic trou- bles continue to grow and may have affected Mr. Bush’s atti- tude about aiding the Soviets. A congressional plan to di- vert $1 billion from the defense budget for Soviet aid came un- der heavy fire late last week from lawmakers feeling a chill within the electorate toward aiding the Soviets.

Among the clues were a fingertip- sized fragment of a radio circuit board, shards of a brown Samsonite suitcase and shreds of clothing made and sold in theis- land republic of Malta. “Scottish police searched every blade of grass to pick up every conceivable fragment that could be found,” said Rob: ' ert Mueller, assistant U.S. attorney gen- eral for the criminal division. “The mag- nitude of that task is and must be unique in the annals of criminal investigation.” But the Scots were joined by a pha- lanx of investigators from more a dozen countries who pursued the clues across Africa, the Middle East and Eu- rope for three years after the Pan Am jumbo jet hurtled to the earth in balls of flames Dec. 21, 1988, killing 259 people on board and another 11 on the ground.

It held luggage from a feeder flight from Frankfurt to London: Pan Am Flight 103A. German au- thorities discovered that an un- accompanied bag had traveled from Malta to Frankfurt earlier on the day of the crash and been placed on Pan Am 103A.

The indictment states that Mr. Megrahi was the chief of air- line security in the Libyan secu- rity organization and was in the ‘Malta airport the day the bag was _put on the plane to Frankfurt. It charges that Lamen Khalifa Fhi- mah was an undercover agent who had worked as station man- ager for Libyan Arab Airlines at the Malta airport.

The indictment alleges the two de- fendants were agents of Libya’s intel- ligence service, the Jamahirya Securi- ty Organization, and says they acted in concert with unknown co-conspira- tors. It does not name Libyan higher ups as ordering the terrorist bombing. “This investigation is by no means over,” promised Acting Attorney General William Barr. “We will not rest until all those responsible are brought to justice.” Jay an U.S, attorney for the District of Columbia, said the indict- ment traces the intimate involvement of the two men in Libya’s intelligence operation, and said he does not be- lieve they were acting outside of offi- cial duties. “We have no evidence to suggest that this was a rogue operation,” said Stephens, whose office would handle a trial if the men ever are captured. Just as Fitzwater refused to elimi- nate any options, so did Justice De- partment officials when asked if the United States might attempt to kid- nap the men if they cannot be brought to trial neacefullv. “T’m not going to discuss any op- tions that we might have,” said Rob- ert Mueller, assistant attorney gener- al for the criminal division. “We have no extradition treaty with Libya, but we hold out hopes of obtaining the individuals.” Theories that Syria, Iran or other countries also had a hand in the dead- ly explosion were not supported Thursday. said, “We don’t rule out any options” when asked if a military strike was contemplated. He said that President Bush would consult with other leaders on “a cooperative interna- tional response to this latest terrorist atrocity’ by the Libyan government, headed by Moam- mar Gadhafi. Fitzwater said the United States would pursue all “legal channels available” to bring the Libyans to justice in the explosion that killed 270 people. But he declined to say As possible involvement of other nations, Mueller said only that “there is no evidence” that Syria, Iran or others are linked to this spe- cific crime. But he refused to answe: whether those nations were found \\ have connections with the defendant or with the Libyan spy agency. “We took the ordaias where the evidence led us,” said Mueller, wher asked whether the Justice Depart: ment “concentrated” on Libya rathe1 than Syria. “And I'll also that at no time were we in any way influ- enced to direct the investigation in one way or another.” During a meeting Thursday with an educational advisory group, Bush absolved Syria of guilt in the Locker- bie bombing. “*A lot of le thought it was Syrians,” he said. * Syrians took a bum rap on this.” An implication now that Syria was involved could shatter the fragile ; Middle East peace process just begun last month, in which Syria is a key player. : Families of the Americans killed in the bombing generally lauded the government for indicting the Libyans, but urged that the case not be whether the surrender of the officials would affect Bush's plans to punish Libya. “All Americans are horrified by the mon- strous nature of the Pan Am bombing,” said the White House spokesman. “We call to judgment those responsible.” The charges, announced simultaneously by the United States and Great Britain, culmi- nate three years of painstaking, worldwide in- vestigation by a cadre of forensic specialists, police and agents from more than half a doz- en countries, a g smuggled a bomb onto the jumbo jetliner that exploded 31,000 feet above the town of Lock- erbie on Dec. 21, 1988.

Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the special envoy, is to arrive in Baghdad 6n Tuesday to begin talks on extending the agreement that permits a small contingent of U.N. guards to pa- trol Iraqi towns and cities. The same pact gives U.N. humani- tarian agencies the right to im- port aid supplies and control their distribution. Most of the 500 U.N. guards -are posted in northern cities to prevent massacres of Kurds, who have been in sporadic re- volt against Saddam’s regime. Prince Sadruddin signed the memorandum of under- standing (MOU) with Iraq’s government last spring, follow- ing the Persian Gulf War and subsequent rebellions by Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south of Iraq. The memo- randum expires at the end of this year. A spokesman with Prince Sadruddin’s office in Geneva would say only that the envoy is Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 18, 1991 going to Baghdad to ncgpiichl “the future of U.N. humanitar- ian activity in Iraq” and that he “has a lot of options.” s<_ie The MOU is a spinoff of the cease-fire agreement Saddam accepted to end the Gulf War. That agreement maintains in- ternational sanctions and re- quires that Iraq dismantle ‘its weapons of mass destruction. “They say the current MOU infringes on their sovereignty. That is what the problem is,” said Alex Rondos of Catholic Relief Services, one of the few private organizations working in Iraq. Without the memorandum or a similar agreement, Mr. Rondos said, any humanitarian program would be alien, to continue. Prince Sadruddin also i is ex- pected to appeal to Saddam. to carry out the U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Iraq to sell $1.6 billion worth of oil under tight restrictions, with most proceeds to be used to. buy food and medicine or to pay off war debts.

WASHINGTON BUREAU _ Washington — In an effort to jump-start flagging Middle East peace talks, the Bush adminis- tration has asked Arabs and Is- raelis to resume negotiations in Washington on Dec. 4. But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir left the White House on Friday without agree- ing to rejoin peace talks, and Syr- ia and the Palestinians both had reservations about coming to the peace table in Washington. Israeli officials were said to be surprised and angry that invi- tations were cabled to Middle East governments before Mr. Shamir even met with President Bush to make a case for not hold- ing the talks in Washington. It is likely, however, that in- ternational pressure will bear on all the parties not to spoil a his- toric opportunity for peace sim- ply because they protest the loca- tion of talks. State Department spokes- woman Margaret D. Tutwiler, in announcing the American invita- tion to reconvene talks, indicated that the U.S. and Soviet co-spon- sors will not be happy if any par- ty chooses to turn it down. “Obviously, it would be an unfortunate choice,” she said. “It would obviously be very disap- pointing, not only to the co-spon- sors but, I think, to many coun- tries and peoples around the world.” Jordan responded immedi- ately Friday that it would come to Washington. At the ceremonial opening of a peace conference in Madrid RICK McKAY / Washington Bureat President Bush talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in the White House Oval Office on Friday. last month, the sides quickly sank into dispute over where to reconvene bilateral talks. Israel wanted discussions to alternate between Israel and the Arab nations, which would grant the Jewish state a legitimacy never yet recognized by the Arab negotiating partners. The Arabs, with the exception of Egypt, do not have diplomatic or trade re- lations with Israel, and they re- fused the proposal. U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III gave the Arabs and Israelis two weeks to find a solu- tion, then waited three weeks without results. “It is important to give the parties the chance to work this out, but it is even more important to resume the direct talks,” Ms. Tutwiler said. Although Mr. Shamir called his morning meeting with Presi- dent Bush “very friendly,” he said “discussion will go on” con- cerning the proposal to resume negotiations in Washington. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said most of the meeting focused on the venue for talks, but that Mr. Shamir had not formally responded. “He will be discussing tz with other members of his gov- ernment and they'll give us @<P-, sponse as soon as they can,”’-Mr.. Fitzwater said. As he left the White Jewish settlements in the Israeli- occupied Arab lands will be en the negotiating agenda because .they ave am Katngral port of the Sapte. rial issue.

Elaine Carey © STAFF CORRESPONDENTS _ Kiev, U.S.S.R, — In military garri- son towns dotted throughout the Ukraine, an estimated 4,000 nuclear weapons-are marooned in a political struggle between Moscow and a republic on the verge of becoming an independent nation. The Union of Ukrainian Officers, a dissident group of 17,000 Soviet military Officers stationed in the Ukraine, said it ‘has at least twice prevented the Soviet Defense Ministry from removing the tac- tical nuclear weapons from bases in.the Ukraine. an “Several times we have received in- formation about Moscow's intention: to: redeploy those weapons,” said Col.

Outside a Soviet nuclear bomber base in the Ukraine, former schoolteacher Victor Labazov said he had a good idea ‘where the nuclear bombs are stored. He said he would block the road if the Soviet Convoys tried to carry nuclear weapons to the neighboring republic of Russia: ~ “We will not allow them to do this,” said Mr. Labazov, 32, head of the local branch of Rukh, the leading civilian Ukrainian pro-independence movement. “We will block the railroads,” said Mr. Labazov, who lives in Priluki, a town 75 miles east of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. “We will block the roa ‘ Kharkov # *Polfava THE UKRAINE Black Sea n like these are ding alarm bells in Wash- ington, where lawmakers and arms experts are warning that the disj tion of the Soviet Union ‘gould quickly lead to the country’s nuclear weapons fall- ing into the wrong hands. A-rep ort a week ago by Har- vard’s Center for Science and In- ternational Affairs concluded: “Even if one-hundredth of 1 per- cent_of the nuclear weapons in the Soviet stockpile falls into the wrong hands, destruction great- er than the world has seen since Hiroshima and Nagasaki could result.” For the moment, the nuclear ' weapons are under the control of the central government in Mos- cow. Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin said Friday that the Sovi- et Union’s nuclear weapons will remain under central command despite the country’s rapid trans- formation, German television re- | ported. Experts worry that as eco- nomic and political tensions rise, rival republics such as the Ukraine and Russia might wrest the; nuclear weapons from cen- tral control for their own use.

Ethnic Ukrainians, who make up an estimated 72 population, p one Ukraine, are likely to split. The 38 million voters also will decide whether to replace President Leonid Kravchuk with a challenger from the “democratic” movement. Communist offices where Ukrai- nian politicians are getting ready to run a new country, the repub- lic’s leaders insist that the Ukraine has no desire ever to use the nuclear weapons. . The Ukraine “has no preten- sions to obtain a dual key to con- trol the launch of the missiles,” said Ukrainian Defense Minister Konstantin~ Morosov, former commander of the Soviet air force in the Ukraine. ‘‘They are controlled by central authorities in Moscow.” But Ukrainian leaders also insist they won’t allow their an- cient rival, Russia, or any other former Soviet republic to get its hands on the weapons. To keep those weapons from being turned against them, the Ukraine’s leaders say the weap- ons must remain “temporarily” on Ukrainian soil. As soon as the Ukraine has attained full inter- national recognition, they say, the weapons can be dismantled under international supervision. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has said it could take up to seven years before all the weapons are deactivated. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 24, 1991 > \fMissiles: Ukraine has world’s third: largest nuclear arsenal Do missiles ‘deter’ Moscow? Oleksander Yemets, a deputy : ; in the Ukrainian Parliament, said that for now, nuclear weap- ons on Ukrainian soil have a “‘de- terring” effect that will serve to restrain Moscow’s appetite for Ukrainian land. He said the presence of nu- clear weapons in the Ukraine al- ready has caused Mr. Yeltsin to blink. He said it happened three months ago, when Mr. Yeltsin raised Russian-territorial claims to southern and eastern Ukraine, only to drop them after a few days following a Western diplo- matic outcry. .“He withdrew those claims very quickly because he under- stands that it is impossible to use force on the Ukraine, which has nuclear weapons On its territo- ry,” Mr. Yemets said. “Of course, [the] Ukraine doesn’t to- ‘tally control those weapons on its territory now. But this was one of the major factors which provided deterrence.” Mr. Yemets and other leaders of the fledgling Ukrainian Parlia- ment have joined Colonel Mar- tyrosian’s Union of Officers. They say the Soviet Defense Ministry must not be allowed to move a single nuclear warhead to the rival Russian republic. Colonel Martyrosian, who has commanded a Soviet signals reg- iment in the Ukraine for 13 years, said the union has the alle- giance of 17,000 of the 250,000 active-duty Soviet officers now in the Ukraine. Until the Ukraine can find a way to finance the cre- ation of its proposed army, the Officer’s union is the closest thing it has to a military force. In an interview, Colonel Mar- tyrosian said the union’s ranks include 11 generals, four of them from the KGB. He said his membership also includes middle-level officers in charge of arsenals where some tactical nuclear warheads are stored, as well as officers in Stra- tegic Rocket Forces, the elite So- viet unit that manages the Soviet SS-19 and SS-24 intercontinental nuclear-tipped rockets aimed at the United States. Colonel Martyrosian said on “several” occasions in the last three months, union members at nuclear sites got advance word that commanders in Moscow were preparing to ship some nu- clear warheads out to Russia. “When we heard about this intention, we put [out] an ultima- JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Staff Victor Labazov, head of the Rukh pro-independence movement in Priluki, vows to block roads if Soviet convoys try to move nuclear weapons from the Ukrainian republic. tum that we would prevent it by any means, and after that they canceled their decision,” he said. Colonel Martyrosian said he wants the future Ukrainian army to retain some tactical nuclear warheads indefinitely. But Ukrainian political leaders, in- cluding Mr. Morosov, have as- sured Western journalists and diplomats that all the warheads in the Ukraine will be expedi- tiously destroyed. “We [the Soviet army] have short-range nuclear missiles. now,” Colonel Martyrosian said. “These tactical nuclear missiles and artillery shells must remain in the possession of the Ukraini- . an army, whereas the strategic - missiles and bombers must be controlled by the authorities in Moscow.” Appearance of normality Despite talk of weapons and ultimatums, the Ukraine doesn't have the look of a country in the midst of a nuclear standoff. a4 There are no SWAT teams, no barricades, no crowds waving placards. In cities, small towns and villages, the most striking image is of hundreds of dour- looking people waiting hours in lines for milk and gasoline. Even outside the air base where the Soviet air force has de- ployed its most modern nuclear bomber, a reporter found a scene of normality: ducks feeding, cows grazing, workers bicycling to a hat factory, a Soviet air force, captain standing with his young daughter on the muddy main street. Priluki, the town near the base, is in the center of a black- dirt, sugar beet-growing region. According to a report issued two months ago by the U.S. Defense Department, the Priluki base houses 16 of the newest Soviet in- tercontinental nuclear bombers, called Blackjacks. Each one is thought to carry up to 10 nuclear bombs and missiles, suggesting at least 160 of the warheads are probably stashed nearby. Last week, Mr. Labazov and another Rukh leader offered to: drive a reporter-around Priluki. _ The second stop on the tour was outside-an isolated barbed-wire ‘compound where ‘the two men said they. believed the Soviet air force stores nuclear bombs. in Underground bunkers...

At the same time, the State Department sig- naled that it would keep a strong hand on the peace process, acknowledging that the proposal on when and where to resume talks carried suggestions about what the parties might discuss in order to make progress. mS Lebanon announced Monday that it would at- tend the Dec. 4 resumption of bilateral talks, join- ing Jordanian leaders who responded affirmatively last week. But Israel, Syria and the Palestinians had not responded by the end of the day. All three have indicated that they are seeking some assurances before joining the talks. Israel wants the next meetings to focus on procedural is- sues again, not substance, while Syria has suggest- @fi that it doesn’t want to come unless Israel agrees forehand to accept the idea of giving up some of ie Arab land it occupies in exchange for peace. “ State Department spokeswoman Margaret mutwiler said no one should expect such guar- tees. } She did confirm, however, that the proposal to fesume talks carried suggestions about what issues Americans think might lead to productive talks. urprises Washington The five parties got what Ms. Tutwiler called “suggestions or ideas that could be discussed,” though she maintained that the United States is not mandating an agenda or even offering what have been called “bridging proposals” to span the vast gaps separating the Arabs and Israelis. The fact that the Americans listed ideas on how the substantive talks should proceed is a sign that the State Department will maintain strong involve- ment in the talks rather than let them flicker out under suffocating disagreements. The administration already has shown that it plans to be a vigorous, prodding presence in the peace process, most recently in the decision to go ahead last week and set a date and time to resume the talks. The Arabs and Israelis had been unable to agree on a location after the process was launched at the Madrid peace conference last month. Israeli leaders voiced anger over the weekend that invitations to the Washington talks were sent out Thursday night, before Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had a chance to meet Friday with President Bush to make his case for resuming the talks in the Middle East rather than in a neutral site such as Washington. Some Israelis said the action slighted their leader. Ms. Tutwiler said department officials were “puzzled” by the angry response, partly because they had planned to disseminate the proposal two days earlier — last Tuesday — but held off because Israel’s ambassador asked for a delay until Mr. Shamir could discuss the issue with Secretary of State James A. Baker III. The Associated Press A Palestinian laborer works on a house in the Jewish set- tlement of Efrat.

Mr. Nunn was instrumental in getting a $400 million appro- priation that could be used, at President Bush’s discretion, to help the Soviets destroy, store and dismantle nuclear weapons. The original proposal was for $1 billion to help shut down excess weapons systems and transport emergency humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union, but that was sharply criticized in Congress and withdrawn. Mr. Nunn’s $500 million replacement plan was passed by the Senate, but re- duced by $100 million in a House-Senate conference com- mittee. In an interview this week, Mr. Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his original proposal would have provided exactly the assistance Ukrainian leaders told Cox Newspapers they have sought in order to convert military indus- tries to factories producing civil- ian goods. Officials said they cannot afford to simply shut down weapons factories and eliminate thousands of jobs. But senators supporting the original Nunn plan had to drop significant portions of it to win approval in the increasingly do- mestic-minded political atmos- phere.
