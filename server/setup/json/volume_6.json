DEBATED hAass Drug Raid Becomes a Trend By MARCIA KUNSTEL And TOM BAXTER Somewhere in Georgia, the groundwork quietly is being laid for another massive drug bust like the one last week in whic nearly 150 persons were arrested in Macon. What happened in Macon was a media event, in which reporters watched as scores of lawmen processed a steady flow of young people, most of them from middle and upper-middle class homes, through a make shift headquarters at the local Nationa Guard Armory. But for all its dramatic overtones, the mass arrests were only the latest manifesta tion of an operation under way for months and the Macon operation is but one example of a pattern of law enforcement that ha! emerged nationwide in recent years, Regardless of whether this approac substantially slows the flow of drugs, it ge some suspected sellers off the streets—a least for a while. “The total effort with this kind 9 operation is producing more than 100 a rests a month” in Georgia, says To McGreevy, chief of investigations for th Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). Components of the pattern include: ® Undercover agents, often importe from other places, permeating a designate local area to concentrate on one type 0 criminal activity such as illegal drug tra ficking, gambling or the sale of stolen me chandise. ¢ Use of federal funding under gra programs which often mandate cooperati efforts among different law enforceme agencies on a single project. © Emphasis on making arrests, usual in a highly visible fashion. This approach often takes on mas production dimensions. In Macon last week, those arreste their hands bound behind them with plast strips, were interviewed, photographed ai fingerprinted in a series of stations resembled an assembly line. All of the were handed a mimeographed sheet explai ing arrest and bail procedures. \" Each was assigned a number and warned not to tamper with it if he expected quick processing. While many lawmen praise this ap- proach to crime-fighting, other involved ob- servers complain that it forces an emphasis on quantity rather than quality in collaring Jawbreakers. In fact, that emphasis is clearly spelled out in the provisions of the grant program that finances Georgia Bureau of Investiga- tion (GBI) undercover agents like those who worked the Macon cases. The contract between the GBI and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administra- tion (LEAA) stipulates that state investigators must maintain ongoing opera- tions in at least two of the six major metro- politan areas of Georgia at all times and must make at least 800 drug-sale arrests throughout the state during the one-year contract period. Besides working in metropolitan areas, the 15 undercover agents funded by LEAA and matching local funds also must conduct investigations with at least 140 sheriffs’ de- partments and 200 municipal police depart- ments during the year. The arrest quota system does not differentiate between the sale of one ounce of marijuana and one pound of heroin, Each counts equally when adding up the mini- mum 800 arrests. Most of those apprehended in Macon were described by the officers involved as low-level street dealers. The lawmen are candid about the sort of people they ar- rested; they make no apologies for their ac- tions. They say it stops the spread of drugs locally. GBI drug section chief Phil Peters called it “neutralizing” the area. “The elimination of street dealers cer- tainly does have a good effect, though it might be of a temporary nature, \" said Jack Salter, special agent in charge of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Atlanta. “What it’s doing really is attacking the (drug) traffic at one particular level, as op- posed to attacking the narcotic trafficker at the commercial level,” Salter said. “It is the federal government's mission to attack traf- fic at a high level, in order to impact the availability of drugs.” But Terry Mayfield, a coordinator for the Metropolitan Atlanta Council for Alco- hol and Drug Abuse (MACAD), says he does- n't think the low-level busts make much of a dent in drug traffic in the streets. “You arrest a lot of nickel-dime deal- ‘You arrest a lot of nickel-dime dealers, but. . .in about six to eight months you have just as many as you ever had.’ —Terry Maytield dealers who come around, and in about six to eight months you have just as many as you ever had,” Mayfield said. He suggested some of the money spent on the mass bust might be better spent in drug prevention and treatment programs. Al Horn, an Atlanta attorney who favors the legalization of marijuana, says the mass bust actually may make the trade more lucrative for big-time drug traffickers by putting the pinch on supply and driving up the price of their goods. Another view is offered by GBI Special Agent Jerry Longino, who maintains that any drug sale is a crime, regardless of its size. “TE there is a violation there, we mak a case,” Longino said. “It’s not any law offi cer’s job to judge ... to categorize who is and) who isn’t a ‘dealer.’ “T don’t think you can do that arbi. trarily by the amounts they deal.” Officers also defend the mass arrest of street dealers by saying that they ofte glean information through interviews wi them that leads to the indictment of big: time drug suppliers. ' “Tf you had your druthers, of course you would want to arrest people further up the (supply) line,” says Gene Slade, depu' director of the Metropolitan Atlanta Crime Commission. “How you get to those people is reall difficult. One way you can get them is through the street dealers, if they'll rol over for you and turn informant,” Slade Says SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 197 “Another way is to put somebody undercover and leave them there ... but peo- ple sometimes have to be in that capacity for years before they do much good.” Critics of the mass busts are skeptical of officers’ claims that the busts are very effective insofar as intelligence-gathering is concerned. It is all but impossible to determine accurately who is right, because little sub- stantive evaluation of these kinds of drug programs is done. The State Crime Commission, which ap- proves LEAA grant projects in Georgia and reports their progress back to the federal agency, mostly keeps track of numbers in the drug projects. The success of $574,800 worth of drug. projects being undertaken this fiscal year under LEAA auspices is gauged primarily by the tally of arrests and the breakdown of the types of drugs sold, according to Robert McGill, one of two crime commission pro- gram evaluators. McGill says the commission staff does not count convictions, only arrests. “That’s very difficult to do because of problems with court records,” he says. “We felt it was going a little beyond our respon- sibility, although a lot of projects do moni- tor conviction rates.” Judy Greenberg, the other commission program evaluator, says there is no valida- tion of the statistics supplied by law enforcement agencies that carry out the grant-funded busts. “We only have a two-man unit,” she says, looking forward to the expected addi- tion of five more evaluators next month. There is no assessment of whether the accused drug dealers are persons who occa- sionally sell—when they have more than they can personally consume—or are major suppliers who earn their livings from the drug trade. Ms. Greenberg said such assessments, along with regular monitoring of conviction rates stemming from the arrests, would be good ideas to implement. _ Along with expanding the evaluation unit, Ms. Greenberg says, the commission also is considering the possibility of hiring a private contractor to make an independent assessment of Georgia drug _ control projects. “There certainly is a problem in evalu- ation. You've targeted one of our concerns,” she told a reporter. “We can assess the out- put—the numbers—but not the outcome, and does that rea ssess the pot?” March 13, 1977 \f"

End of Airy ins? | ort Pl f By MARCIA KUNSTEL The city may lose a pocket- | ful of dollars if a labor group ‘wins a dispute over minimum wage stipulations in three air- port construction contracts. Or the city may lose just a few bucks—and a principle or two. ; It all depends on who is asked to assess the impact of the case, which is before the oth U.S. Circuit Court of Ap- peals, It is a complex situation «complicated doubly by the rhetoric flying between city officials and the North Geor- gia Building and Construction Trades Council. City Finance Director Charles Davis said success by the labor group will tack as much as $18 million onto the estimated $35.7 million cost of the three contracts for Hartsfield International Air- port expansion projects. Perhaps more important, certain court action in the labor council’s favor could deal a fatal blow to the entire expansion plan, into which the city ultimately will plough ‘nearly $400 million, Davis Said. But George Caudell, the council’s business manager, ‘maintained Saturday that the maximum cost to the city ‘would be only $1.5 million, if city officials follow his adr vice. A Time is an essential factor. The city has. until midnight Tuesday to award the three contracts in dispute and a . fourth one not being chal- lenged. If the deadline is not met the city faces a rebidding that Davis said may wreck all . expansion plans. Should the appellate court side with the trades council and issue a temporary injunc- tion to stop the city from awarding the three contracts before then, Davis said, the projects “are dead forever.” Central to the issue is the Davis-Bacon Act, which sets minimum wage standards for projects, such as the Harts- field expansion, __ partially funded by federal dollars. Under that act the U.S. Labor Department sets the minimum wage scales for certain categories of building projects, breaking them down into building rates, heavy con- struction rates and highway construction rates. Projects tagged “building” carry the highest wage scales, followed by the “heavy” rates and then the “highway” rates. The Labor Department ini- tially determined one of the now-disputed projects should be ruled by the heavy rates, and the other two by the high- way rates. That determination was based upon descriptions of the projects provided by the city. Caudell said the trades council, contesting the desig- nations, filed further facts and won a new Labor Depart- ment decision placing ail three projects in the higher- paying category of building construction. However, the Labor Depart- ment. notified the city of the new designations in a maila- gram which arrived here nine days before the deadline for contractors to submit bids, violating its rule mandating a 10-day notice. Since the federal bureauc- racy failed to abide by its own bureaucratic rules, the city and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is supplying the federal funds, said they were not bound by the revised wage scale desig- nation. - [t_was then tha council filed suit in U.S. Dis- trict Court here seeking to _ Institute the new designations. The court ruled in favor of . the city and the FAA, but the » council appealed that decision late last week to the 5th Cir- cuit. If the trades council wins » its case, it is uncertain how much additional cost would be tacked onto the construction contracts, Davis maintains it will cost $18 million, since that is the total difference between the wages mandated under build- ing rates and those required under the heavy and the high- way construction rates. Caudell said there exists a good possibility there would be no difference in cost, or at least a relatively small differ- ence, in light of the total price tag on’ the three con- tracts, “It’s flim-flam, it’s loud talk,” Caudell said of Davis’ estimate, pointing out that the Davis-Bacon Act standards are for minimum wages only, He said union contractors negotiate their own wage scales with the unions, and those wages. normally are higher than the amounts set by the Labor Department for even the highest category— the building rate, Caudell said the apparent low bidders on two of the projects are union contrac: tors, so the wage amounts they included in their bids would not be changed, even if the Davis-Bacon designations were upgraded. The low bidder on the third project, he said, is a nonunion contractor. But the second low bid came in at about $1.5 million higher, and it came. from a union contractor, Cau- dell said. He suggested the city easily could live with a ,change in the designations by simply awarding that contract to the second lowest bidder. Then none of the three bids would be affected by the higher wage designatien. \"Scans tannin canna SS Finance Director Davis disagrees, contending the con- tractors indeed would seek more money if a building con- struction rate were attached to the three projects. “I’d say the contractors would ask for that much money (the $18 million more), plus overhead,” Davis said. “I think Mr. Caudell is just full of hot air.” Davis further maintained the city would have to discuss the question\"with all 30 or so contractors who bid on the projects, and could not deal simply with the lowest or the second-lowest bidders by changing the specifications to read “building rates.” Awarding of the contracts by Tuesday midnight is jeop- ardized further by the fact that the city is trying to get the major airlines serving Hartsfield to, sign two sepa- rate agreements before the deadline. One concerns the amounts they will pay to lease facili- ties at the airport, a ital issue. since the revenue from those leases will pay off the bonds to be issued by the city to finance the construction work. The airlines also are being asked to agree to absorb any additional costs which may arise later out of the wage ' dispute under litigation, That situation could develop if the federal appellate court waits until after the contracts are awarded to make its deci- sion, and rules in favor of th trades council. t In the midst of the legal complexities, both sides are tossing vituperative com- ments in the direction of their opponents, Davis claimed the trades council js up to its old tricks of waiting until the last minute to contest Labor De- -partment project designations under the Davis-Bacon Act, thereby raising a legal cloud \" over the awarding of con- tracts. ’ “I think Mr. Caudell is going to lose the golden egg this time,” Davis said, claim- on is imminent and result in the loss of 5,000 construction jobs and 13,000 permanent jobs,\" On the other side, Caudell Said the city misled the trades council when certain officials maintained no federal money would be used on the projects, so the Davis-Bacon Act would not be a question, Caudell said he learned the truth in late December ‘and Shortly afterward took his case to the Labor Depart. ment.

At least once, the men were directed to run a small obsta- cle course immediately after they emerged, “probably to see if we could do it without looking at the explosion,” said Hodorowski.

        "ocr_text": " Smooth-Talking King Hussein Says Little By BILL MONTGOMERY And MARCIA KUNSTEL Jordan’s smooth, English- speaking monarch impressed an Atlanta audience with his articulate command of the language, but several listerers felt he did not say anythng new about Middle East peice prospects. King Hussein said he was hopeful for a speedy resump- tion of the Geneva talks on an Arab-Israeli settlement, said Jean imer, one of 500 who attended a private recep- tion for Hussein. at the Atlanta Historical Society. “And while he felt the Palestinians must have self- )' determination, he indicated the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) did not really represent the Palestinians, in his opinion,” she said. } “That was about the most positive thing he said,” she added. The Jordanian monarch has Yong been at loggerheads with the militant Arab organiza- tion. In 1970 he unleashed the crack Arab Legion (the Jorda- nian army) to drive the PLO from his country. Hussein’s visit to Georgia, ‘his second trip to the states | since he became monarch of | the Arab nation 24 years ago, . is sponsored by the Southern Council on International and Public Affairs in Atlanta. Several who attended the ' council's private session with Hussein at the historical soci- ety’s meeting hall on Andrews Drive felt the king ducked some controversial questions, such as the ultimate control of Jerusalem. Hussein felt Je- tusalem “should be a free and open city. to all religions, but under Arab control,” said one Jewish listener, who asked not to be identified. “He’s very subtle and so- isticated in what he says, but really what he’s talking about is peace on his terms,” that listener said.

Concerning his private talks with President Carter, Hus- sein would cite no specific “The problems are not as easy as they seem,” the king said, calling for “moral cour- .age and determination” by all parties to achieve a perma- rent peace. Later, he cautiously pre- dicted that “some difficulties that seem insurmountable ... may become easier to work out,” if those preparing for resumption of the Geneva talks can set clearly defined committments made by either goals. leader, other than mutual pledges to devote their ener- gies to a Middle East settle- ment. Although he said Carter dis- played “farsightedness” and a “determination to do all possi- ble” to resolve the conflict, Hussein added that there exist “realities which I felt it my duty to point out.” He admitted that one of the serious problems is represen- tation of Palestinians, and further warned that simply reconvening the peace talks does not assure ultimate suc- cess. Several times he said the factions must “further define our thoughts and ideas” or must “define the problems more clearly,” in order to progress with the talks, but he gave no specifics. The governor’s mansion press conference was cut short when Gov. George Bus- bee rose to lightly respond to a question regarding discus- sions between himself and Hussein, who was’ an over- night -guest at the executive’ mansion. : He did not say whether any substantive discussions took place, merely citing common concerns both men have about .the welfare of their people and joking about hobbies the two enjoy. At the historical society reception earlier in the day, Hussein spoke for about a half-hour and fielded ques- tions from the upper crust, invitation-only audience for another 30 minutes. “But I don’t think he really responded to about 60 per cent of the questions,’said Mrs. Robert Evans. No one asked him whether . litely he was willing to accept Is- rael’s existence as a state in the Middle East, according to persons who attended. By all accounts, the ques- tioning was decorous. All po- called him, “Your Majesty.” -One  northsider, tongue firmly in cheek, said of the wealthy, English-edu- cated. Hussein, “He could move into my neighborhood any day. I wouldn't mind him buying my hovse.” Many of Atlanta’s Jewish community apparently turned out to hear a man whose country has fought Israel in three wars. “T was rather surprised at the number of Jews who came to see him,” said an Atlanta policeman stationed outside. “I guess they're curi- ous about him and, in a way, he’s the only friend they have among the Arabs.” Hussein has been regarded as a moderate among Arabs, He is a staunch opponent of ,* many hard liners who talk of “throwing the Jews into the sea.” Hussein aatal on a Jorda- nian government Boeing 727 Friday afternoon at Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta under tight security.

        "ocr_text": "Flamboyant Outlaws Confessed and.Begged to Die, Then Threatened Jurors if They Didn't Comply - Death Is Their Final Wish — EDITOR’S NOTE—This is the first of two newsfeatures about Wayne Eugene Rit- ter and John Lewis Evans, two young men who staged a wanton crime spree across the © Southeast last winter, then did everything in their power to ensure that they would be sentenced to execution in the electric chair. They are on Death Row in Alabama, and they still insist they want to die. By MARCIA KUNSTEL - Journal Staff Writer f ATMORE, Ala.— Armed with guns and high on kicks, the two young men lived for little but the ‘thrills of run-amok crime and violence. The kicks and the guns are gone, but the violence is not, for Wayne Eugene Ritter and John Lewis Evans are dernanding to be put to death in the electric chair. Their demands may be met. They sit on Alabama’s Death Row here, awaiting their executions scheduled for July 25. “TJ may be an animal, but this animal doesn’t live well in captivity,” Ritter said in an interview with The Journal. “I can’t stand to be locked up. So, I choose to die.” And Evans: “I didn’t give any mercy; I don’t expect any.” Their dates with death probably will be put off, but only by virtue of legal complex- ities and the efforts of outsiders, efforts that the condemned men have tried to thwart since before their murder trials last March in Mobile. Both Ritter and Evans profess they will continue the fight for the'; : legal right to be put to death. i “The Associated Press Ritter wy and Bccke Sit in eee > Ritter, 23, from Indianapolis, and Evans, a 27-year-ald from Beaumont, Tex., admit they trampled the legal rights of in- numerable others gn their way to what may be their last, blea}: abode, the Holman Unit of Fountain Correctional Center, a maxi- mum security priggn situated in the desola- tion of south Alabama. They arrived thare by way of a circuitous path, beginning in Indiana where they had been in prison together. They cut through the midsection of the nation, then criss-crossed the Southeast on a 73-day crime spree of armed robbery, kidnapping and extortion. The course, they say, was not plotted. Rather, it was set from the day of their Christmas Eve departure by one’s whim or the other’s fancy. Tu» to Page 12A Column 3 May 26, 1977 \f‘| Didn't Give Mercy. . Don’t Expect Any’ Continued from Page 1A There were laughs and women, a lot of booze and a little dope, motels and bars and pool halls and enough close scrapes with the law to spurt the flow of adrenalin, a “rush” that Evans describes with relish. | And there was one murder. On Jan. 5, Evans and Ritter drove in a rented Oldsmo- bile Cutlass from Biloxi to Mobile, where they later told po- lice they spent much of the day casing businesses to rob. _.._ They settled on The Pawn Shop, owned by Edward Nas- sar Jr. As the robbery was in progress, Nassar crouched on the floor behind the counter, attempting to creep toward his own weapon. Evans shot him in the back, in full view of Nassar’s two small daughters, aged 5 and 7, who were watching television in the same room. ; “When this guy went for his gun, he did it with his two kids in there,” Evans recalled. “T think that’s what bothered me, That’s the only thing about the whole trip that 1 hated. It wasn’t shooting him, be. cause I feel if anybody is stupid enough to go for a gun while you're holding one on him, then they deserve it.” | Later the same day in Mobile, they robbed a Radio Shack, then continued their lawless frolic through the South until the law caught up with them in Little Rock on March 7, » Police ‘say they were nabbed after Evans called an FRY agent in Beaumont, seeking a plea bargain if he surrendered, and the call was traced back to his Arkansas motel room, The lean, dark-haired Texan maintains he phoned a relative at home and the wire was tapped. However it came to pass, Evans and Ritter were found and arrested in Little Rock, and from, that point on, they Jabored to expedite justice. . They confessed to the FBI in Little Rock and to the po. lice in Mobile. At their own instigation, they confessed to the Mobile County grand jury which indicted them. And in a final flash of flamboyance, the outlaws not only confessed to the trial jury from the witness stand, but pleaded for the death penalty and threatened to come back tg plague the jurors if they failed to comply. . They did not want the trial ordered by the judge, did Not want the automatic appeal that is mandatory under Ala. bama’s. capital punishment statute, and waived most, if not all, the legal rights available to them, much to the chagrin of their court-appointed attorneys. “You see, they're closing the doors behind them as they go,” said Reggie Stephens, the attorney for Ritter. “We ad. vised them some 16 times not to say anything, not to Open their mouths. I don’t know of anything that could set this aside.” Stephens said he sees no basis for appeal, and he plans to say so in the brief he submits to the state’s criminal appeals court. Al Pennington, Evans’ lawyer, had not decided what course to pursue when interviewed last week, noting the dilemma posed by defendants who demand their attorneys do nothing to win them their freedom or even their lives, “Ethically, you’re supposed to represent your clients; you're not supposed to represent causes,” Pennington said. “They’re playing a high-risk poker game, the highest-risk game you’d ever want to get into, and the only hole card they’ve got left is to challenge the constitutionality of the (death penalty) statute,” he said. Pennington may raise that challenge, against his client’s- wishes, but if he does not, someone else will. Lawyers with the Southern Poverty Law Center, the non- profit law group in Montgomery that now specializes in death penalty cases, are planning to ask that final action on Evans and Ritter’s cases be postponed until the Supreme Court of the United States rules on another case that questions the constitutionality of the Alabama death law. . Informed observers believe the Alabama Supreme Court will grant the stay if the lower court refuses to do so, and that would place Evans and Ritter in Death Row isolation for many months. The two young men expressed ambivalence about that prospect when interviewed separately at Holman prison in an eight-by-10 cubicle, the barren “press observation room’” with a single large window facing the yellow electric chair not a feet away. Neither seem distressed over the potential lelay. ; In fact, the grace period might give Evans the time to complete his book about their exploits. Ritter also hopes yet to make crime pay. “Yeah, I’m trying to make a little money for the (ex-) wife and kid,” Ritter said. “If they’re gonna fry me, I’ll play it to the max.” . Attorney Stephens may handle negotiations over matters like magazine articles and book or movie rights for both men, and himself expresses intense interest in their story. But Stephens is not as interested in getting money for the defendants’ families as he is in getting cash to help the survivors of Nassar, the slain Mobile pawn shop owner. But then that only makes sense, since he has represented the Nassar family for much longer than he has had ties with the two desperadoes. ' “TI represent the boy’s father, his brother, and I had represented Eddie before he was killed,” Stephens told a re- porter voluntarily. (Ritter said he did not know his defense. attorney had worked for the man he is charged with murdering until he learned it from The Atlanta Journal reporter’ who ‘inter- ° viewed him last week.) One local lawyer said Stephens’ dual role “reeks of con- flict,” and other interested observers were similarly shocked upon learning of his vested and personal interest in the Nas- sar family. : ; Stephens quickly discounts the question of conflict of interests. Stas Se % “No, there’s none whatsoever,” he said. “It would have been a conflict of interest if the guy (Ritter) had pleaded not guilty. I couldn’t have taken (his case).” Stephens said the trial judge was aware of the situation and that he got permission from the Nassar family before embarking on Ritter’s defense. Likewise, Stephens said he would require authorization from the Nassar family before realizing any financial gain from subsequent publicity about Evans’ and Ritter’s exploits, which he believes would be “‘a fantastic story ... a fantastic movie,” “J don’t want to profit from it myself,” Stephens said. “Then I think it would be a conflict of interest with the (Nas- sar) family. If it ever came to someone making a lot of eee it, and his family okayed me getting some money, would.” “I wouldn’t care about the Ritter family,” he Jater. ‘The hell with them.” , m — When told of his lawyer’s connection to the Nassars, Rit- ter flashed an ironic grin, but expressed little interest in the avenues that link might open for appeal. “T don’t really have a death wish,” Ritter explained, “contrary to popular belief. I just see what my options are and I chose the best one.” Both men said they choose to be electrocuted, because the only alternative is spending the remainder of their lives in prison. : Even had they been acquitted of the Mobile murder charge, they still faced warrants from at least seven states on a minimum of 22 robberies and two kidnap-extortions. Attorney Pennington said: “We figured one time they’re looking at three to five thousand years (in prison).” Pennington and others speculate that Evans will be the one to back off his adamant stance, if either man does, Evans scoffs at the suggestion. ‘ S __,. I’m 27 now, so I had no intention whatsoever of putting in that kind of time in the joint,” he said. “I'd rather be dead than in a cage.” ‘ Ritter’s sentiments are similar. “T don’t want to come out a 68-year-old man all wrinkled ae (having) spent almost my entire life in prison,” he said. : “Prison’s a drag. There’s absolutely nothing going o that’s worth a s—- it hece. = ee “You're an animal, you're treated like an animal and that’s the way it is. You’ve got to live like one. And I’m just enough of a human being not to go for that,” Ritter said. “I refuse to be treated that way. And if it means going ahead and taking my own life by making them do it, fine.” NEXT IN THE JOURNAL: Ritter and Evans—who they are. May 26, 1977 (continued) \f"

In fact, Evans and Ritter met in a youth correctional center in Indiana, where they filled idle hours with talk of a real crime fling when they got out. “Everybody else in prison Says they’re going straight when they get out,” said Evans, a Texan. “Not me. I’ve been an armed robber since I was 16. I had no intentions of straightening out.” Despite his hindsight assess- ment, Evans did say that when he got out of prison in Indiana last fall, he sought a drafting job, something he had trained for in prison. He enjoyed drafting and specu-’ lated that such a job might have kept him out of trouble —at least for a while. “When I got out,” Evans said, “nobody would hire me, \"cause here I am—I’m a con.” “T¥ finally got a job building houses,” he added. “It was really. for the birds. I’m not much for hard work.

Ritter reportedly attempted a reconciliation with his ex- wife, but that didn’t work.

Evans and Ritter reached their dead end abruptly when the FBI descended upon them March 7 in Little Rock, and the pair realized an accounting for their 73-day spree of murder, armed robbery, kidnapping and extortion finally was due. “If they wouldn’t have got us on that (the: Mobile murder), they had us on the kid- napings and extortion,” said Ritter, who comes from Indianapolis. “I knew I’d get life on the kidnaping.. There was no way I could get out of that | one. So I went ahead and decided to go for the chair.” Both men, interviewed separately by The Atlanta Journal in a barren, red-bricked , cubicle near their death row cells at the Holman: Unit of Fountain Correctional Cen- ter, had done prison time before. / Neither has the stomach to do more. Turn to Page 7A, Column 1 Evans did—in Ohio, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina, Ten- nessee and Arkansas. They hit in some-states-seve i me ‘following no apparent pattern, twice interspersing their rob- beries with kidnap-extortion gigs and once with murder. Why? : . “A: lot. of people won’t understand,” Evans predicted. “J decided when I _ got busted (in Indiana) that when I get out, I’m gonna really live. I’m gonna get enough ex- citement in my life in a short period of time just to be worth it.” : Evans said he had tried a ‘lot of other kicks—scuba’ div- ing, sky diving, flying an air- plane—but the biggest charge came from being a hard-run- ning fugitive and almost getting nailed. “[Tve had 120-mile-an-hour car chases with the cops, been Shot, shot at people, just the whole bit,’”’ he explained, rel- ishing the recollections. “That’s the excitement of it. You talk about adrenalin flowing . . . . I guess maybe in a way it’s kind of like being in combat.” - Crime Ritter also spoke of the ex- citement and kicks he got from running and robbing but more often talked of the power. “Robbery’s an ego trip,” he said. “It’s like you’re God for a few seconds. You have the power of life and death,” he said. d “Robbery is nice, because I have total control. I’m the man with the gun. I know it, and they (the victims) know it.” Both Evans and Ritter de- lighted in telling how they outwitted cops time and again, and they saw them- selves as being rather nice fellows to be robbed by. Yet both candidly admitted the “nice” sometimes turned to “nasty,” as when the Mo- bile pawnbroker made a move to resist and instantly clicked on their survival instincts. Those inner clicks were fol- lowed by the roar of a gun- shot. May 27, 1977 \fhe two men are reasona- bly bright, young, high school graduates who. came from families of at least moderate! _. : income. Asked how they came to be drawn, irresistibly, to the craziness of a crime spree, they talked of becoming bored with routine lifestyles, even in adolescent years, and of need-| - ing cash to supplement the neighborhood softball games with headier forms of enter- tainment. ‘Somehow, working for money wasn’t their style. Both started out stripping autos. They progressed to stealing cars and from there to more lucrative and more dangerdus crimes. Usually their families were unaware of these youthful ex- ploits; but their family rela- tions were far from intimate, both recalled, Evans, from Beaumont, Tex., said his family always had plenty of money—since his father was in the construc- tion business~but not a lot of time. “We never played golf or anything together. Maybe we'd go hunting once a year, | That was it,” he said, “Me and my mother never did get along. I don't know why. Then when my dad died, I blamed my mother.” Ritter’s recounting of home life was no more attractive, It included a succession of stepfathers and a mother he couldn't relate to, “T never really talked {o'| smy mother,” he said, “She || that’s dumb.” UJ WUeCU d E O I stepfathers and a mother couldn't relate to. “I never really talked think and all that stuff.” Lawyers ‘said the neglec perceived by Evans and Ri making outrageous statemen and threats, shocking a fasc nated public.

Here are some of the thoughts he expressed in the interview: Does he believe in the deat penalty? believing that the penalty isn’t necessary.” Would a ple? it really shock peo death . . . Why is it wrong that I killed somebody, and they can turn right around and kill me? Boy, “To an extent, | suppose. I t was bored a lot of the time. The ladies were nice. Getting high was lots of fun; the rob- beries were fun. But none of it was worth it, It just didn’t mean anything tome... .

What is he fighting? “Just the injustice of it all I suppose, Life itself. I’ve laid up there (in my cell) a lot of times and thought, ‘Hey, wish my name was Hearst 0 her boyfriend up: got 30 days in jail. What kind of a deal i that I blew this guy up and T'm gonna sit in the chair? And I wasn’t even the one I gotta sit in the chair any way.

It wasn't even Sunday service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, It was Saturday afternoon, many parishioners had ar rived in vintage ’50s garb, and the heavy figure behind the pulpit wasn’t “Daddy” King, The churchgoers had come for a different kind of inspis rational experience, They had assembled to help writer-director Abby Mann translate into reality the idea spawned in his head more than a decade ago — afilm tribute to the person he calls “the greatest man this country ever produced,” It is a movie about the life's work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., from the time he began his civil rights crusade in r . “A0s till his assassination outside a Memphis motel 1968, On Saturday afternoon the congregation's members had turned actors for the day, assisting in the filming of the only two scenes to be shot in Atlanta, The remainder of the NBC» TV movie is being filmed in Macon, and itis to be broadcast in two segments early next year. Director Mann, Oscar-winning script writer for “Judg ment at Nuremburg” and creator of the television series “Kojak,” has been dedicated to this project since he first dis. cussed it with Dr. King about 18 months before the activist was cut down by an assassin's bullets, (the sei wl as the Kennedy era or the Johnson era, ht the King era,” Mann said, In a brief interview prior to filming sessions, Mann com pared the Rev, King to the Indian pacifist Ghandi, pointing out that the American black leader used the Bible to advance some of the most revolutionary concepts ofthe period Mann said King had agreed to the work, and that he was dramatizing inthe film the things that King wanted shown, “Some of the main issues are racism in America and how it hurts whites as well as blacks , . how Dr. King's Vietnam stand lasted as rat an asa ona publ fi ure a8 has ever been unleashed,” Mann said He also will emphasize the antagonistic actions the FBI and his family, Mann sald, which have ae aetin life,” Mann said, “7 think “Working on my life, ; it can change others’ too,” The director admitted that the movie is ram, not docu mentary, and that it was necessary to “combine” events at times to fit the facts into a five-hour film, For example, one soene has Andrew Young, the United Nations ead who was one of King's closest aides vine h 4 bomb tossed at is mentor’s feet and tossing a, harmn’s way, Young was not present when a similar incident occurred in Montgomery, Ala, and the item actually thrown at King was a tear-gas vessel, not a bomb, “You have to be faithful to the sprit of the times,” Mann said, “not the letter.” Bae wee ay a 1053 sermon by “Daddy” King, played by actor Ossie Davis, and a poignant given 1 yeas later behid the same pulpit by Dr, rtin Luther King Jr, played by Paul Winfield The latter scene is King's gripping self-examination of bi lv eye lel al deh weal be in vain if he has lived to make life better for his people, Mann called it an epitaph on the life of Martin Luther King Jr, June 26, 1977 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Probe of Legion Disease High-Priority, Not Frantic By MARCIA KUNSTEL One year, 35 deaths and 201 apparent cases of “Legionnaires’ Disease’ later, medical scientists are still trying to find out exactly how it all happened. The investigation is rocking along at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) here, though certainly not at the same frantic pace as before, after persons who had at- tended an American Legion convention in Philadelphia last July began dropping off like battle victims across Pennsylvania. “It is a high-priority activity,” Dr. David Fraser, CDC epidemiologist, said of the continuing probe. “We're doing the studies we can think of that might give us the answers.” Some key findings have been produced by the teams of doctors and scientists who investigated the “new” disease, diminishing in some measure the initial urgency of solv- ing the Philadelphia mystery. For example, they learned that the dis- ease is not spread by human contact. And they discovered the microscopic cause of the epidemic was a bacterium. But they still do not know where the bug lives or for certain how it is spread. The biggest problem in determining where the organism lives, Dr. Fraser said, is that it hardly can be grown for laboratory cultures. “It gets overcome by other bacteria,” he said. “Now we're trying to find a way to selectively grow it, while inhibiting the growth of other bacteria and fungi.” If that is done, the technicians have a chance of discovering what substance plays host to the death-dealing organism. The scientific sleuths also are inter- viewing victims of the new, sporadic cases of “Legionnaires’ Disease” which have pop- up occasionally around the country—19 cases that killed six persons in 11 states since the Philadelphia outbreak. : .The survivors are asked where they've been, what they’ve touched and a list of other questions concerning activities prior to being afflicted, in hopes that some clue might be uncovered. Fraser said signs do indicate that the air may be the carrier. The disease has been linked to at least three other mysterious epidemics which occurred in the last decade or so, and Fraser said carriers such as food or water have been ruled out in all of them. The similar outbreaks were in a Wash- ington, D.C., hospital in 1965, in Pontiac, Mich., in 1968, and possibly in 1974 in the same Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadel- phia where the legionnaires were quartered last year for the July 21-24 convention. Subsequent loss of business forced the hotel to close. Because the outbreaks were so isolated in time and geography, Fraser said the conditions required for a concentrated spread of the disease must be unusual. As an example of the combination of events which might lead to an epidemic, he cited the strange cause of a Q-fever out- break in California several years ago. The fever is attributed to a parasitic microor- ganism carried by sheep. In this case, a ewe with an infected placenta was processed through a rendering plant. The bug she was carrying was discharged into the air, and people downwind from the plant became in- ected. July 10, 1977 \f"

        "ocr_text": "outh Has Stake in Labor Scrap By MARCIA KUNSTEL Business calls it a “power grab” by organized labor, While unions say it would afford them only “equal treatment under the law.” On both sides of the traditional labor/management schism, the forces are marshaling for a pending congres- sional clash over the proposed labor reform act, which could have a significant impact on the South, Because Southern labor is less organized than in other sectors of the nation, helping to spur industry's exodus to the sunny climes, both management and labor here feel they have a special stake in the legislation officially presented by President Carter to the Congress on Monday, Both sides agree the proposal to alter the National Labor Relations Act would speed the labor organizing process and subsequent contract bargaining, It also would increase the penalties charged against illegally recalcitrant employers, But the opposing forces part company when further ex- plaining what that would mean, “t's bound to have an effect on pushing workers into a union before they have a chance to hear both sides,” said John E, Branch, an Atlanta management attorney active in both state and national chamber of commerce groups, “To the extent that unions introduce all types of work rules and featherbedding that run up the cost of operations, to that extent it would make Georgia less attractive to indus. try,” Branch said, “They (industrialists) want a work force that won't insert a lot of artificial rules that run up costs,” National surveys have reported that a largely unorgan- ized work force is one major incentive for industry to locate in the South, Herb Mabry, president of the Georgia AFL-CIO, said the South especially would feel the effects of reform, because more textile industries and other ‘major labor law violators” are located here, “It becomes cheaper for them to violate the law and keep going (Without a union contract) for three or four years,” Mabry said, “It’s cheaper to violate the law and pay a small fine than for them to bargain.” Branch said the administration plan would not be “as harmful” to business as the original reform bill introduced at the start of the congressional session, but charged that it is still has a pro-union bias, The increase in penalties for management violations of the labor law are not as great as under the initial proposal, but Branch said they still would intimidate management from legally presenting its side to workers under pressure to unionize, Homer Deakins Jr,, another Atlanta management attor- ney, who believes the bill is aimed directly at the South, said the proposed time limits between the signing of interest cards and the date of the election would add to the confusion of workers. The legislation calls for an election within 15 days if a majority of workers sign cards, within 45 days if $0 per cent sign, and within 75 days if the NLRB finds “difficult” ques- tions in the case, such as defining the bargaining unit, “The electorate should have time to be informed, That's in everybody's best interest,” Deakins said. Union spokesmen, on the other hand, say the delays now are too many and t00 long, The only limit at present is that the election must be held $0 days from the time the NLRB calls it The agency's action can come months after interest cards are signed, or even longer, “The mechanism of the current labor relations act is so ponderous and so capable of being delayed that the anti-labor employer, even if there is very large interest on the part of workers, is able to work them over and to.convince them to vole no,” said ET, Kehrer, head of the AFL¢CIO civil rights division here, Kehrer, formerly an organizer for the Ladies Garment Workers Union, said in his 10 years of organizing he had some 100,000 authorization cards signed, but only won con- tracts covering perhaps 15,000 workers, And Herb Green, president of the United Auto Workers he cited the case of Monroe Auto Equipment Co. in we The UAW initially organized the plant in 1966, but didn’t begin bargaining until December 1973, due to various appeals ae lodged by the company with the NLRB and the co No contract ever resulted from negotiations, and in January 1976, an independent union filed for the right to represent the workers and another election was set. Although a majority of workers at the plant voted against both the independent union and the UAW, the NLRB this month decided the company had used unfair labor prac- tices in regard to the election, so the UAW was reinstated as the bargaining agent, ‘The company has been ordered to begin negotiating again, more than 11 years after the UAW won the right of a “How can you keep people together for that long?” Green ae P people tog f _ Green said the UAW leadership of the southern district Will meet next month and discuss strategies for gaining pas» sage of the labor reform legislation, — He said he expects to work hand-in-hand with the AFL- C10, which nationally has budgeted $800,000 for lobbying and promoting the bill.

In State s Big Agribusiness Though largely ignored by everyone but the farmers who employ him, the migrant worker has made himself an important asset to Georgia's thriving agribusiness. Today begins a three-part series exploring the migrant’s life here and the lot of the person he has replaced, the local field hand, The series will continue Monday in The Atlanta Journal, By MARCIA KUNSTEL No one knows how many migrant work- ers pass through Georgia in the course of a year, but they number in the thousands now, and there probably will be more in years to come, ~ They are Georgia’s hidden labor force. You may find them living in the shade of tree groves at the end of a nameless dirt road carved deep into a South Georgia corn field. Others, whole families with mothers and children, tough out the blistering sum- mer heat in clusters of run-down trailers or small frame houses that dot the countryside, Some are an even more fleeting pres- ence, pausing only for afew days at declin- ing motels, staying just long enough to clear a field of melons before moving north. Interviews with migrants, local field hands, farmers and government and labor officials produced some basic conclusions: _ © The migrants’ story is not the one of anguished serfdom that initially filtered out of the fields of Florida and California, then finally burst upon Americans’ consciousness in media exposes over the past decade or so. Although there is considerable skepticism among some people in labor relations about the government's enforcement of regula- tions on working and living conditions, Georgia farmers who hire migrants are fearful of doing anything to get Uncle Sam's watchdogs on their necks. The migrant camps visited are not the hell-holes described in earlier days; the conditions are no worse than those under which many rural poor live throughout the South, * The migrants who spend as much as three months working Georgia food crops are now a vital component of the state's agricultural industry, big business that so far has been unable to completely replace the calloused human hand with precision machinery, The trailer camps, barracks and shacks, brimming at picking time with field hands and their families, have become fix- tures on some South and southwestern Geor- gia farms as much as the spacious equip- ment barns, ‘The farmers say they had little choice, Turn to Page 18A, Column 1 Stall PholomJane Abrams MIGRANT WORKERS LIVE IN THESE DWELLINGS NEAR TIFTON, GA.

The farmers oned 5 quest agreed that their Florida or Texas hands, often of Mexican heritage, do superior work, especially when compared to the temporary laborers avail- able locally. “I used to use local help in 1973,” said the farmer near Americus. “They just wouldn’t do it. “It goes back to the work ethic.

Mrs. Heyerdahl, a teacher with the grant Education Program in Tift County, said that of the farmers’ problem is that more, better- Paying jobs have been opening up for blacks in industries that have expanded into rural Georgia.

Officials of that program both in Atlanta and in Wash- ington readily admit the emphasis is heavier on train- ing locals than true migrants, because the resident seasonal worker is easier to find and has a greater inclination to get out of the fields. There is, after all, little opportunity for advancement there The more successful the im, however, the fewer workers available to farmers. State labor officials forecast that farmworkers Ni until mech- anization completely takes over field work, farmers will continue to need seasonal workers. “We're going to need, whether we like it or not, a “We can at make the conditions a better for them.” But those compassionate sentiments are not held by everyone in the state, says E.T. Kehrer, head of the civil rights division of the AFL- CIO’s regional office in Atlanta. Commenting on the lack of data on the size of the mi- grant work force and their living and working conditions im the state, Kehrer said ttle ‘I used to use local help in 1973.

Certain vested interests wouldn’t like that.” Ennis State Employment Service repre- sentative, says he has tried to get funds for an accurate count of migrant workers in the state, but has been unsuc- cessful so far. Monthly estimates showed almost 2,000 migrants work- ing in the state in May of last year, but state officials admit that is only a guess. The estimate for all mi- grants in the state for the fol- lowing month was 6,260, which includes about 2,400 nonworking family members. Moreover, only 940 of the workers were eee to be rene migrants. The rest ly were resi- nate who travel the state in search of farm work. Discussing the absence of migrant census and of any state laws regulating working conditions for all field hands, Quinn said, “There is a lack of organization on the farm workers’ part,” which means they also suffer “a lack of having political significance.” —Americus-Area Farmer suggested for wanting to keep themselves and their workers in low profile. expressed fears that publicity would estigators bring federal inv bureaucrats responsible for enforcing migrant working and living conditions the migrant presence in Geor- It was in 1963 that Con- gress first passed the law de- signed to reduce the widespread abuses heaped on ers and to further control working and living conditions.

In fact, you hear very little complaining among migrants. For them, just like so many of the people who live in rural Georgia year-round, hard times are a way of life. Wilbur Turner, safety Supervisor for the OSHA Macon office, said his office will try to make 10 inspec- tions of central southwest Georgia’ camps in the latter half of this calendar year —if they can find that many.

The program already has made a hit with both migrant children and their parents. . 3 At another camp, this one a cluster of trailers on another dirt yard down the road, a group of dark-haired ur- chins was waiting outside for the van, waving and clapping when it wheeled into the drive. Their first-day jitters had vanished earlier in the week, and now they ‘were anxious for more books and puzzles and games to fill a languid summer morning. One young mother accompanied her big-eyed tots up the steps of the traveling school, her curiosity piqued by their ex- citement. os “They got me up early and said they had to-have a bath and clean clothes before the school got here,” she said. The teachers were visibly pleased by the warm recep- tion; by the kids’ interest in the play-work of the program and by the confidences occasionally exchanged by older chil- dren. Some of them were old friends, since the migrant program also operates in the public schools during the regu- Jar school year. One girl spoke of the problems of a friend whose parents were dead, who was living with a sister, and who probably would drop out of school at the insistence of relatives. The girl also looked ahead to similar problems of her own, since teen-aged migrant girls often are yanked out of ig to earn cash in the fields or to care for younger chil- ren. The teacher urged the girl not to lose her will to finish high school, not to succumb as so many do, choosing to Marry in their teen-aged years to escape the confines of the traditional Mexican family where the father is the iron- handed patriarch. , The teaching is not limited to books, and the involve- ment of the staff is not limited to teaching. “We try to do things with the children like improve their self-concept,” said Diane James, a consultant in Georgia’s Program. “Going to three or four schools a year can be ging sonal farm work is a reputable occupation,” Ms. James said| “We don’t try to get families to stop moving if they don’ want to.

        "ocr_text": "EORGIA POWER EXPERIMENT uts Power Bill to about 74 degrees. But the dishwasher By MARCIA KUNSTEL REYNOLDS, Ga.—The signs are small and easily missed, but they mark a changed way for living for many families in this sleepy, southwest Georgia town. The shades are drawn on an uncommon number of homes, though there is no sick- ness or mourning inside. At precisely 10 p.m. dishwashers and washing machines in the homes begin to gurgle and churn. Outsized pots of beans and extra cas- seroles bubble on kitchen stoves throughout the weekend, even if company isn’t coming. They are next week’s dinners. The changes stem from something else ‘that is new for nearly 130 Reynolds house- holds. On the outside of the dwellings sit two round glass meters, like bulbous eyes watching the slightly askew routine inside. They are the eyes of Georgia Power Co., and they record not only how much electricity the families use, but when they use it. The families are guinea pigs in a Geor- gia Power experiment aimed at reducing customers’ use of power in peakload hours. The way they are living now may be the way a lot more will be living in the near fu- ture. The concept, which Georgia Power would like to implement statewide, is called “time of day” billing, through which cus- tomers pay premium prices for power used when most people use it—between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays. Between 10 p.m. and 10 a.m. and all weekend long, each kilowatt hour costs less. That is what has the people of Reynolds doing things like cutting back their air conditioning in the heat of the day. “Tt’s a matter of us changing our living habits to save money,” said J.N. Kirksey, manager of the Georgia Power Reynolds of- fice, who participates in the “time of day” experiment. While customers can save money through the billing procedure—the averag : savings in the first nine months was 10 per cent—the longer range aim is to cut down on the power company’s huge construction costs. The utility’s main problem is having the capacity to generate all the power required when demand is the greatest. When demand is lower, the capacity isn’t needed, but the plants to generate it still sit there. The theory is that changing citizens” Time of Usage ARTHUR HOGAN J.N. KIRKSEY consumption habits will spread out the de- mand, rather than piling it on top of the present summertime, late afternoon peak demand, thereby reducing the need to build more power plants. Some people’s habits in Reynolds have indeed changed. Mrs. Jean Slaton usually cooks the meat for dinner before she leaves home for her job as deputy city clerk. She also washes dishes and washes and dries clothes during the “off-peak” hours between 10 p.m. and 10 a.m. “We run the air conditioner real cold at night, till 10 a.m. or so ... then turn it up to 78 or 80 during the day,” she said. “But we do live it up on weekends,” she admitted. Mrs. Slaton said her family doesn’t find the changes a hardship, but prefers to view the experiment as “a common sense ap- proach” to energy conservation. And, she said, the family light bill has been reduced about 15 per cent. William M. Parker, a retired extension service agent who lives with his wife and teen-ager in a sprawling brick home, said his family has made only modest shifts in style, but stills saved a little cash on elec- tric bills. The Parkers’ main meal still is cooked at noon, and the air conditioner hums along at a pace sufficient to keep the house cooled doesn’t come on till the Parkers retire, and laundry usually is done during the off-peak “This shows there is something you can do about it (high utility bills),” Parker said. “All of us like to think we can control things a little bit, whether we can or not.” Parker admitted he prefers to save money in other ways. As Parker, Arthur Hogan likes to think he is not totally at the mercy of the power company, that there is something he can do to stall the steady upward creep of his elec- tric bills. “I am not pro-Georgia Power,” said Hogan, a modish and bearded educational consultant, who coordinates federal pro- grams for the Taylor County school system. e en ‘ee a bit 7 ed hostile side thern Company nt firm) and Georgia Power,” Nes said. a a “However, this damn thing is a good ea.” The Hogans’ summer bill that seldom broke under $100 a month was held to about half that until the heat wave blistered Geor- gia last month, because Hogan and his wife have made a serious effort to shift and re- duce the daytime flow of power in their four-bedroom, brick home.. In addition to the usual power-cutting tactics, Hogan said he usually turns off the hot water heater during the peak period, and has found that using an micro-wave oven and small appliances like a toaster- oven increase savings. “IT might do crepes in quantity over the weekend, or casseroles—things of that na- ture,” he said. The food is frozen, then pop- ped into the micro-wave for weeknight din- ners during premium power time. Hogan, Parker, Mrs. Slaton and others interviewed all said they know of no one on the “time of day” experiment who doesn’t like it by now, although there were some initial mutterings of discontent. “Some of the people I’ve talked to have been a little bit miffed that they're not on it,” Hogan said. All said they would continue on the bill- ing scheme, if given the option, when the current three-year experiment ends. John Carson, Georgia Power manager of rates and research in Atlanta, said data from the first year of the program still is being analyzed, but that “a significant shift” to off-peak usage in the summer appears to be shaping up in Reynolds.

Though the conflict between labor and management may be as old as the work- lace itself, the struggle has not been static. Pe The tenor drifts with the conditions of ‘the moment, the issues are refined with the ae changing economics of a nation and a world, and even’ the locale shifts as industry ex- - plores for sites more amenable to its pure 9908 mg poses, The move now is to the South. “T view this as really one of the key areas of the country, as far as organization is concerned,” said Bruce Thrasher, director yy of the United Steelworkers of America, Dis- #, trict 36, headquartered in Atlanta. There's no question that we, along With other international unions, have signifi- Ti cantly stepped Up organizing activities In ;4 the Southeast.” The collective voice of workers in union # rang out long ago in mid-South coal mines ae and the fiery steel mills of Birmingham, But {an industrialization lagged in the South, and | Jabor organization was even further behind.

P. Stevens Plant at publin September 4, 1977 \fUnion Orgamzers Zero In o While individual unions tar- get specific companies for organizing, two efforts of possibly larger import are under way: * A move to revise the Na- tional Labor Relations Act to speed the organizing process and to stiffen penalties against employers found vio- lating the labor law. Success would affect union activities nationally, but the proposal takes particular aim at the South, as was evidenced by the special congressional hearings held last month in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., the home of seven textile plants owned by J.P. Stevens & Co. © A long-range, expensive push to organize the 85 plants of the Steyens company, the second largest textile manu- facturer in the nation, em- ploying some 45,000 people. The campaign is not new, but it broadened early last year, when the full AFL-CIO com- mitted money, people and its considerable moral support to the then-newly merged Amal- gamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU). While achieving the labor law reform might reverberate more widely in the South than in other areas—if only be- cause of the untapped poten- tial for unionization here—it is the J.P. Stevens campaign that is especially tailored to Southern mores, economics and social conditions, to the circumstances that have com- bined to thwart widespread union drives. It is not a simple plant organizing action, but, as de- scribed in conversations with several ACTWU and AFL-CIO principles, is an attack on multiple fronts, including: ' © Boycotting Stevens prod- ucts nationally to force the firm to capitulate to unioniza- tion out of economic neces- ‘particularly ® Involving prominen church people, _ politician (such as Atlanta Mayor Ma nard Jackson), and civic leac ers to pressure the compan and businesses that us Stevens products (and to shov workers and others that the effort has support in hig places). e Extending organizing ac tivities into unusual socia service areas to convince Stevens employes and loca residents that the union is no an alien force disinterested i the over-all lifestyle an needs of workers. ® Attempting to form a liances with existing grou civil right organizations, to take advan tage of any influence an trust they might command. It is “communit consciousness-raising,” an at tempt to build a new image o trade unions in a region tha has had little use for the and considerable fear o: them. The massive resource ploughed into the campaign boycott offices operate in 2 major cities— are designed produce more than merel bargaining contracts in J. Stevens plants. Harold McIver, Southeas ern director of the AFL-CIO’ Industrial Union Department the federation’s branch spe cializing in  organizatio: drives, predicts a domino pa tern if the Stevens campaigi succeeds, “Once we organize the we feel the rest of the textil industry will follow,” Mclve said. “Any time experienc pache le that things ca be better, there will be people getting together and working’ as a'team.” Simply organizing textiles would put a big dent in the nonunion work force of the Southeast. The industry em- ployes 19 per cent of the manufacturing workers in the region and 25 per cent in Georgia. It is the largest em- ployer of production workers both in the state and the re- gion, followed by the closely nonunion— apparel industry. But Melver and others envi- sion a spill-over washing into other industries as well. It has happened in the past, they say, citing as proof alleged business efforts to keep union plants out of nonunion towns. The subjects of the cam- paign—the industrialists and their legal advisers on labo relations—disagree. “Unions don’t management Lovie Brooks, an Atlanta law yer whose firm deals almos exclusively in extrlCating companies from labeman agement entanglements.

Short he said, 71 of them w@ fired. It took from 1963 until 148 either to get the workers re# stated or to win them back pay under provisions of the labor act that prohibits firings for union activity. “We decided it would be a good time to advance on J.P. Stevens again (in 1967), be- cause people wouldn’t be as afraid,” McIver said. “They'd know the law was behind “<e id) them.” But the company continued to resist repeated efforts to organize in Georgia and the Carolinas, and the union con- tinued to file charges of un- fair labor practices against Stevens. At one point, after an organizing push in Statesboro, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the courts found that Stevens had created such a climate of feay and intimidation and had vio lated the law to such an ex tent that holding a fair elec tion would be impossible. The union was certified as bargaining agent, despite the fact that workers had voted not to unionize. In only one instance did the union win an election outright: in the seven Roanoke Rapids plants in 1974. A contract still has not been negotiated, and the union is charging bad faith bargaining. In numerous cases J.P. Stevens has been exonerated of charges leveled against it. But over its 14 years of mostly frustrated organizing efforts, the union has been able to chalk up a string of n Southeas victories ranging from job reinstatements to contempt of ‘court citations, issued by judges declaring Stevens has refused to obey their orders, (The most recent was handed down last Wednesday by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Qnd Circuit. It held Stevens in contempt for “massive viola- tions of its employes’ rights” at six plants in North and South Carolina.)

He fears widespread unionism may throw an expanding southern economy into a tailspin. The validity of the two views — and of more moderate assessments of the potential impact of unionization — may be put to the test if Congress passes the pending Labor Reform Act of 1977. lf they a; about little else in the act, both labor and management factions believe the proposal would indeed spur union ac- tivity and enhance its chance of success in the South. The AFL-CIO is mounting a campaign on behalf of the act at the same time it is conducting a drive to organize the massive southern textile industry. The federation is concentrating that drive now on J.P.

The increase would be tied to the average percentage in- yerease won in collective bargaining nationally during the period in question. _ At present the NLRB has no enforcement authority, but can only negotiate a settlement—such as rehiring and reim- bursing an illegally discharged worker—or must resort to the federal courts to force a reluctant company or union to com-- _ ply with its findings. “It’s cheaper for J.P. Stevens to break the law than abide by it,” said Harold McIver, the AFL-CIO’s chief south- ern organizer, referring to more than 200 illegal employe dis- ‘charges Stevens has been found to have made. ‘ Hight out of 11 elections that unions have lost ai plants have been thrown out by the NLRB, Mclver s: be- -cause the company broke the labor law during the course of the organizing campaign. _ .

The chairman and the ranking Republi- can member of that committee said Monday that Lance should resign rather than go through with the public hearings this week. Meanwhile, on the other side of Capitol Hill, a House banking subcommittee was to open hearings — brought on by the Lance affair — on the need for tighter federal regulation of banks.

The validity of the two views — and of more moderate assessments of the potential impact of unionization — may be put to the test if Congress passes the pending Labor Reform Act of 1977. lf they a; about little else in the act, both labor and management factions believe the proposal would indeed spur union ac- tivity and enhance its chance of success in the South.

        "ocr_text": "It Wasn't Mayor Jackson's Day By MARCIA KUNSTEL Three of Mayor Maynard Jackson's opponents forced him into a defensive stance Saturday, attacking his accept- ance of certain campaign contribu- tions and his handling of an alleged police exam cheating scandal. Jackson was at a disadvantage from the start. He arrived more than an hour after the scheduled opening of the political forum sponsored by the Northside Atlanta Jaycees at, Phipps Plaza. His absence gave Emma Darnell, Milton Farris and Harold Dye ample opportunity to home in on what they called Jackson’s “insensitivity” or “arrogance” or “disregard of the pub- lic” as an incumbent enjoying heavy odds to succeed himself. All three applied the term “im- perial” to Jackson or to his adminis- tration during their brief opening comments before questioning by a panel of citizens and news media representatives. Nor did the fusillade subside once Jackson arrived to scattered applause from some of about 50 onlookers, most of whom were campaign work- ers for the various candidates, The three opponents were treated to another chance for a concerted attack when a panelist questioned the moral- ity of donations the mayor's campaign reportedly received from persons whose businesses have city contracts. Jackson said state law governs con- tributions and that he has abided by that law. “J have personally turned back con- tributions from people doing business with the city or who I thought would like to do business with the city,” the mayor said, though he did not deny having accepted some such donations, which are legal. He later refused to name persons whose offers of cash were refused. “There is no way in the year 1977, after Watergate, that any candidate can accept contributions from compa- nies doing business with the city,” said Ms. Darnell, the city’s former admin- istrative services director who quit after a long feud with Jackson, She further charged that the mayor has accepted money from businesses, with bad records in the field of equal employment opportunity. Farris, a Fulton County commis- sioner, questioned whether city funds funnelled into contracts might be find- ing their way into Jackson's campaign coffers via the personal contributions, . Jackson's treatment of charges that Public Safety Commissioner Reginald Eaves helped favored officers cheat on police exams also was a target for opponents’ jabs. “We have enough evidence, enough hard‘evidence, to show the police and fire departments are being run by a yan who is inept, who is very detri- mental to the city,” said businessman Dye, who suggested that the facts that have surfaced so far in the scandal “point to the fact that we should get rid of Reginald Eaves immediately,” Jackson's comment that he hopes — but cannot promise — to take some action on the issue before the Oct. 4 election did not dilute the criticism, September 25, 1977 \f"

        "ocr_text": "COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA Bitter Feud Tearing Apart Union in South By MARCIA KUNSTEL A bitter leadership struggle in a Communication Work- ers of America (CWA) southern district could dim the union’s image as one of the nation’s most progressive and scandal. free labor organizations, & The contest itself is for the vice presidency—the top position—of CWA’s District 3, which includes mostly AT&T and Bell System workers in Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina, But the fight between the aspirants and their respective followers already has agitated the ranks of some 55,000 members for three years. And it has been so riddled with acrimonious charges that the upcoming special election may not clear either the heavy air of combat or the reputations that have been called into question. A crossfire of financial mismanagement charges, accusa- tions of despotic union leadership and an unprecedented re- quest by the union for U.S. Labor Department intervention in the election all figure in the controversy. “The issue is whether this union is going to be run by the members or by a few individuals with cigars and high-top shoes,” said Allen Willis, the incumbent who shocked the CWA three years ago by narrowly defeating a sitting vice president with an essentially anti-establishment campaign. “The issue is experience and leadership against none,” said Ben Porch, the man Willis toppled from office in 1973, who now is attempting a comeback. “We have nothing (under the Willis administration) but total chaos, disunity, and no re- spect from the rest of the labor movement ... or the companies we deal with.” 3-Year Battle Continued From Page 2B dent. Willis won by only 340 votes out of some 55,000, but the election didn’t stand. It was close, and there were assertions that some dele- gates were improperly selected and shouldn't have voted. Widespread confusion prevailed, and the convention itself called for U.S. Labor Department intervention. The unprecedented request spawned a federal investiga- tion that uncovered numerous abuses of the Landrum-Griffin Act, which regulates such matters as union elections. With little urging from the Labor Department, which could have filed suit to force a new election, CWA President Watts signed a consent agreement scheduling another elec- tion. The department now is watchdogging the delegate selec- tion process taking place across the four states in prepara- tion for the special mini-convention and balloting in January. The need for a rerun has been accepted with relative equanimity both within and outside District 3. CWA officials and members questioned about the viola- tions blithely stated that the Landrum-Griffin Act is honored more in the breach than the observance by most labor unions and characterized the abuses as technicalities. The “technicalities” the department found included: © Eight locals didn’t send delegates to the convention. Instead they assigned their proxy votes to other locals, with- out authorization of their members. © Six locals did not properly notify members of meet- ings where proxy decisions were to be made, and their elec- tions on the assignment of proxy votes were not held by secret ballot. ® One union sent delegates to the convention “without the benefit of an election.” Willis is one of the few people who says he is concerned that the union has been found unable to conduct its own busi- ness fairly and legally. high-top shoes. ‘The issue is whether this union is going to be run by the members or by a few individuals with cigars and —District 3 Vice President Allen Willis Those are among the kinder things the two sides say about each other, perhaps because the animosities have be- come so entrenched over the years the battle has raged. In large part, the feud has continued to run because Porch has kept a visible profile in union affairs. CWA Presi- dent Glenn Watts named him to a staff position as north Georgia director after Porch narrowly lost the district vice presidency to Willis at the 1973 CWA convention. - Willis and Porch settled into a tense and hostile coexist- ence, in offices just two floors apart in the same downtown Atlanta office building. The job enabled Porch to maintain a base of operations and contacts with his phalanx of supporters throughout the Willis reign, while Willis worked at running the four-state district and shoring up his own bare majority following. The Porch people did remain loyal, even in the face of a potentially damaging federal indictment last year on charges of embezzling $7,000 in union funds while vice president in 1971, In a plea bargaining arrangement, Porch pleaded guilty toa misdemeanor, receiving an illegal loan, and the U.S, Jus tice Department dropped the tougher charge, * (It is illegal for a union official to borrow more than $2,000 of union money. Porch maintains he did no wrong— neither embezzled the funds nor took out a loan—but says he did not have the financing to undertake a protracted legal battle and thus pleaded guilty to the lesser offense.) He was fined $1,500, given a one-year suspended sen- tence and placed on two year’s probation. The Justice Department lawyer who handled the case has refused to release details of the plea bargain—whether it resulted from lack of evidence, from an agreement by Porch to give something in return, or from any of the multitude of oa reasons which often prompt prosecutors to strike a al. Porch says the money was an “advance,” obtained by him and handed over to a local union official in Kentucky (which then was part of the district), That official was Hardens Union Division Ben Porch charges the Willis camp has taken advantage of his brush with the law by sending out copies of his embezzlement indictment without an explanation of what followed. “What kind of great democratic institution is this (union), that the Labor Department must tell us to make spe- cial provisions for people who work night shifts (and can’t at- tend the delegate selection meetings) or live more than 40 miles from the meeting hall?” Willis asked. He would like to'see direct mail ballot elections for the selection of all the union’s leaders, rather than the delegate process, which he says allows more opportunity for abuse and for political maneuverings. His request that the CWA executive board order a mail ballot for the rerun election had not received a formal re- sponse by last week. Those who support the delegate procedure, including Porch, say there exists no authorization in the CWA constitu- tion for a direct membership vote, either in a normal elec- tion or an unusual circumstance such as the pending rerun. Willis’s rambling talk often is punctuated with calls for greater honesty and integrity and more democratic involve- ment in sundry aspects of union affairs, but his administration has been charged with violating those princi- ples, Billy Powell, president of Atlanta local 3204, filed a complaint with the Labor Department and the union alleging _ that Willis illegally used union funds for campaign purposes. Powell, a Porch ally, said he is satisfied for now with the promise of an investigation and audit of the District 3 books after the rerun election but does not intend to drop the allegations, Willis responds: “T think they had to come up with some- thing to cast a reflection on this administration to make up for the dishonesty of the past administration.” He denies any misuse of money or of his position as an incumbent, There are other bitter charges exchanged by the two fac- tions. : Both Willis and Porch have been accused of meddling in the affairs of locals, of ignoring the prerogatives of local leadership and of refusing to cooperate with union members who are in the opposition camp. Regardless of the merit of the charges, the membership of CWA District 3 is steadfastly divided on the question of the vice presidency and each faction perceives it has been mistreated at the hands of one man or the other. CWA officers outside the district said they don’t view the feud too seriously, calling it a regional political squabble re- volving around personalities, not substantive issues, But other labor sources expressed fears that the fight could have broader implications for the labor movement, which has seen setbacks both in membership figures and in its political clout recently. Their main concerns are that the CWA is expending valuable time and energy on political infighting, rather than on rejuvenating the sagging spirits and image of trade unio-. nism, and that such a family feud will repel the new blood unionists are hoping to attract. : caught more than $6,000 short of funds when the local’s books were audited upon her retirement, Although he admits the money was used to cover up a long-term embezzlement in the Kentucky local, Porch says it was justified to save both the union’s reputation and the record of a long-time CWA member who put in some 30 years of service, The woman became too ill to “repay” the advance through service in special organizing projects, as Porch said he and top CWA officials in Washington had planned. He added that he personally “retired” the advance taken out in his name. The federal court transcript of Porch’s sentencing quotes him as affirming the judge's comment that the money “was ultimately paid back, not by you, but by the union through some sort of jockeying of the books of the union.” But now Porch refuses to discuss the subject of repayment, other than to say it was made, “The auditor's reports ... reflect it was paid back,” Porch said in a recent interview. Porch charges the Willis camp has taken unfair advan- tage of his brush with the law such things as sending copies of the embezzlement indictment to local presidents without a full explanation of what followed.

        "ocr_text": " Staff Pholo—Minia Linn LANE KIRKLAND AT AFL-CIO MEETING Man Most Likely to Succeed George Meany TRADE UNIONISTS Radical Remnant Elects Caretaker By MARCIA KUNSTEL Jacob Clayman is a slight, gentle man, who speaks in measured tones that impart a sense of the experience, knowl- edge and acceptance of the inevitable, gained during the more than seven decades of his life. Clayman, 72, was elected last week to head the remnant of perhaps the most radical organization ever to appear on oon American socio-political scene and to attract a strong fol- lowing. He was named president of the Industrial Union Depart- ment of the AFL-CIO. The department is all that remains of the firebrand collection of trade unionists, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The department was created to retain a semblance of identity for the congress when the merger with the American Federation of Labor took place. Now the department is the primary organizing arm of the AFL-CIO, tending as well to the special concerns of industrial unions. The labor movement has come a long way since the days of CIO militancy. And it still is moving. Clayman’s ascendancy is one sym- bol of the transition phase that organized labor is struggling through as it attempts to reverse recent setbacks in strength, image and political pull. Delegates to last week’s convention here generally characterized Clayman as a “caretaker” chosen because the group’s leaders could not decide what else to do. He replaces I.W. Abel, who retired this summer as the longtime head of the United Steelworkers of America, and whose decision to likewise step down from the department's presidency at one time was thought to portend a giant step toward a changing of the guard. The department was not quite ready to stride into that change, although it did limit the grace period to two years. The convention resolved that when this term of office is com- pleted, officers will be bound by a mandatory retirement age of 65, which limits Clayman to a single two-year term. Most delegates interviewed seemed satisfied with that resolution to the leadership question, expressing respect and affection for Clayman, as well as a willingness to enter a brief holding pattern of sorts However, most also denied critics’ contentions that labor is beset by a complex of problems — both internal and from without — which are sapping its vitality and threaten its fu- ture if they aren’t addressed soon. The delegates especially discounted an apparent increase in internal dissension as being an issue of serious concern. Clayman, a lawyer who has spent most of his labor ca- reer in administrative councils rather than in blue collar jobs, himself seems to view the trade union movement as a democratic family in which occasional discord is inevitable. “Of course we have dissidents. You're bound to have dif- ferences of views,” he said in an interview. “Like any other institution with a broad base, it reflects the society at the time.” Lane Kirkland, the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO and the man most likely to succeed the aging President George Meany — whenever Meany finally does decide to relinquish his intractable grip on the reins of power — said the periodic insurgencies within various unions are the excep- tions to a general rule of harmony. The deep-seated troubles in the United Mine Workers, the bitter fight over the steelworkers presidency, the occa- sional wildcat strikes, all are “aberrations,” he said. “I'm not saying you shouldn’t pay attention to it, but you can’t tend to that and simply ignore (such larger issues as) the 10 million unemployed,” Kirkland said. He admitted that labor does not rank high in the public opinion polls. “But I’m not sure one can deduce from that that (labor's image) is any poorer than it’s ever been,” he added. Kirkland and others complained that trade unionists are held to a higher standard of accountability or ethics than are other groups, that an occasional slip by one individual brands all of labor as corrupt. Most agreed that labor’s image before the general public is not rosy, but seemed at a loss when asked to suggest how to change it. The image, they said, very simply is inaccurate. The idea that labor is attempting to grasp inordinate power is wrong, they said, pointing to lobbying efforts in Washington directed at legislation in the human interest, not just in labor's interest. There is, for example, the support of a higher minimum wage, which hardly affects union members who already earn substantially more than the minimum. Asked to explain the overwhelming predominance of white male delegates, to the convention, they countered that it is difficult to convince women and blacks to run for union office. And, they said, the organized work force only recently has been fleshed out with the addition of women and blacks in significant numbers. It takes time to climb up the ladder of power in any organization, and those who have succeeded said they are not willing to step aside merely for the sake of change. William Winpisinger,president of the International As- sociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, is one of those who is impatient with present conditions. He is one of the few labor leaders who has made a pub- lic cali for Meany to step down, and he similarly was not leased with the turn to the elderly Clayman as its president asi week. “It was disenchanting to me, to say the least,’ he said, “And I say that with no malice,” Winpisinger believes that an influx of younger leaders would go far toward diluting the image of trade unionists as selfish power brokers. He does not quarrel with the goals of labor or its general direction, but believes that Meany has amassed so much power that he has left no room for new ideas or approaches to the changing demands of the last quarter of the 20th Cen- tury. Some of those demands include attracting the increas- ingly younger members of the work force, who are not neces- sarily enamored with labor's stands on issues such as the Vietnam War or the 1972 presidential election, when the AFL-CIO “was neutral in favor of Nixon,” Winpisinger said. Other changing circumstances, as listed by Albert Shan- ker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, partly stem from labor's record of success in satisfying workers’ basic needs Yor a living wage or pension plan.

        "ocr_text": "‘As Feminists and Foes Seek Attention, Some Fear Extremism From Left and Right Women *Arming’ By MARCIA KUNSTEL Like opposing armies, groups of women with vastly different philosophies will converge on Houston, Texas, next weekend to compete for the right to speak for that elusive and possibly non-existent creature, the average American woman: a What’s drawing them to Houston is the Na- tional Women’s Conference, a meeting that seems certain to go down in the history books, mo matter how it turns out. E On one side are the feminists, mostly women, who are responsible for creating the concept of the convention and getting it sanc- tioned by Congress. They envision it as a forum to define the barriers that block American ‘women from true equality with men and to recommend legal actions to eliminate those barriers. a. “ They will be in the majority at the officizs conference proceedings at the Albert Thomas Convention Center. The opposing force, anti-feminists often led by men, will stage a counter-convention several miles away at the Astro Arena in the Astrodome complex. They call their meeting the National ‘amily Rally, a title which bespeaks their «irra belief that some of the changes contem- “ plated by the other side would destroy the a Family unit and perhaps the American way of e. lif The anti-feminists scheduled their rally when it became evident they would make up no more than 20-25 percent of the delegates at the official conference. Both sides contend they represent the aver- age American woman. Both say the other speaks for extremists. “The opposition force right now is using bla- * tant fear tactics, trying to scare the less articu- late, less informed women,’ said Connie < Plunkett of Carrollton, a member of the Na- tional Commission on the Observance of . International Women’s Year (IWY), the group * that is staging the conference. She said the IWY conference opponents are \" led by ‘extreme conservative groups’’ who mis- ~ represent the proposals that will corne before * the delegates, such as endorsement of the Equal * Rights Amendment. : “They say it (the ERA) will take you (as a * woman) away from the family, out of the home, - that it will force you to do things you don’t want : to do,” Mrs. Plunkett said. \" She also charged that the anti-ferninist fac- . tion has concentrated on the most emotion- * charged issues that will be addressed by the con- : ference, such as abortion rights and the support TRUDI ESE sar teeee - of removing legal discrimination based on sex-~ + ual preference, while ignoring bedrock issues in | which women indisputably have a stake. f These include concerns such as_ protecting >} women and children from physical abuse in the * home, developing more educational opportunities for rural women and setting up training and counseling programs for homemakers who sud- .denly find themselves without breadwinners. the issues that will be debated at the conference are listed in a proposed national plan of action. It was drawn up by the IWY Commis- sion on the basis of the commission’s own recommendations and those that “came out of public conventions in each state. Those conven- ‘tions also elected more than 1,400 of the nearly 2,000 delegates. The job of the delegates is to adopt a Na- ‘tional Plan of Action that suggests remedies for the problems faced by American women. COPE ER eee eee Mrs. Plunkett emphasized that the delegates are by no means bound to endorse the proposed plan, and they certainly are not expected to give it quick, rubber-stamp approval. As mandated by Congress, whatever they do recommend must be presented to President Carter within 120 days, and he must send his subsequent recommendations to the lawmakers within the next 120 days. Since the anti-feminists managed to elect‘ only a minority of delegates at the state meet- ings, they believe the plan of action most defi- nitely will not be to their liking. “Basically I want to go to get the viewpoint of the average American woman across,” said Mrs. Lee Wysong, an Atlanta delegate who has been involved in the stop-ERA movement. “The whole conference is slanted so strik- ingly against us,’’ she said, complaining that her side often was prevented from full participation in the state conventions, so the proposed plan contains endorsements of things like abortion, the ERA and lesbianism. ““You can look at the members of the (IWY) commission and realize they are not the average American women,’ Mrs. Wysong added. She pointed specifically to one commis- sioner who is allied with a national gay group and to feminist Gloria Steinem, reciting some of Ms. Steinem’s more socialist-oriented pronounce- ments as evidence of the extremist attitudes represented on the national body. That is important, Mrs. Wysong added, be- cause the IWY Commission itself selected about 400 delegates. The response to this particular charge is that the commission appointed the 400 delegates to satisfy congressional requirements that women of all economic, ethnic, religious, racial and age groups be represented. However, Mrs. Plunkett noted that other for commissioners come from organizations as di- verse as the Girl Scouts of America, the League of Women Voters, the National Council of Cath- olic Women and the National Federation of Busi- ness and Professional Women’s Clubs. Finally, Mrs. Plunkett said she believes that the majority of the commissioners and dele- gates, many of whom have never been involved in the feminist movement, are representative of mainstream American women. To Mrs. Plunkett and other feminists, the stop-ERA advocates are well-known adversaries, and they emphasize that a conservative voice has a place in the conference. What has them more worried is the role that will be played by more extremist foes. “In Mississippi, one-third of the delegates are white, male Klan members,” she explained. Published accounts of some state conven- tions, where anyone who attended could vote, de- scribed virtual take-overs by male-dominated factions, including members of the Ku Klux Klan and the Mormon church. Massive numbers of people were bused to the state conventions in some cases, and leaders directed their charges to cast anti-feminist votes on each issue, according to various newspaper and magazine accounts. : In Utah, where Mormons attended by the thousands, a resolution calling for an end to women’s right to vote actually reached the floor. it was not adopted. Some conference planners fear that the anti-feminist forces, both inside and outside the meeting, will ignite disruptive demonstrations in or near the meeting hall. Robert Shelton, head of the United Klans of ‘America, said he probably will be in Houston to advise his followers on the issues and to “coordi- nate some of the activities,” but he denied any intention of causing trouble.

        "ocr_text": "RULING AGAINST J.P.STEVENS Textile Union Gets Present By MARCIA KUNSTEL The J.P. Stevens & Co. has received its third successive blow in an ongoing battle with a textile workers union, and the development is sending union leaders into the new year with broad smiles. Organizers for the Amalga- mated Clothing and Textile Workers Union waited anx- iously for months for the deci- sion finally announced last week by Administrative Law Judge Bernard Ries, who found the textile giant guilty of bad faith bargaining at its _seven plants in Roanoke Rapids, N.C. The company has said it plans to appeal Ries’ decision — and his broad recommen- dations for remedies — to the full National Labor Relations so union spokesmen have been somewhat guarded in assessing the potential im- pact of Ries’ action. What the judge ruled is that Stevens, the nation’s second- largest textile manufacturer, “bargained in bad faith and without any intention of con- cluding a collective bargain- ing agreement” during negoti- ating sessions after a 1974 election in which Roanoke Rapids workers voted for the union. Among the remedies he recommended was that the company send to all of its 43,- 000 employees letters detail- ing the decision and promis- ing to coy with labor laws in the future. He also recommended that Stevens compensate the union, the government and the work- ers for their financial losses arising from the labor law violations. ‘The recommendations would take effect within 20 working days if they are not appealed, but the NLRB could modify them on appeal. For months ACTWU organ- izers have spoken with great coer or rt the pros- of getting just such a decision Perhaps More important than the recommended finan- cial compensation is the mo- rale boost that organizers have said they expect would accompany such an order. The fact that Roanoke Rapids workers voted for the union three years ago but still have not won a contract did not ease efforts to organize the more than 80 Stevens plants, union leaders say. Under those circumstances, organizers say, some workers at other plants question the utility of bringing in the union. “The biggest thing is that this (order) adds to the cred- ibility of the union,” one labor leader said late last week. “We've told the workers else- where that they have certain rights ... but that the company has been bargaining in bad faith.” Ries’ order backs up that contention, he said, and the judge was not timid in an- nouncing it. Ries said that Stevens’ record of labor law violations indicates the company “ap- proached these negotiations with all the tractability and open-mindedness of Sherman at the outskirts of Atlanta.” He also suggested that the company’s recalcitrance in ting was intended to “chill the ardor” of Stevens workers * ing to organ- ize at other plants, as union leaders had complained. One A spokesman said initial reports from the field—most Stevens organiz- re ee are under way in’ South—indicate that edt workers “fare now much more optimistic about the future” as a result of the judge’s ruling. “It is impossible for us and any reasonable observer to think of this as an isolated in- stance,” he added. “It’s a pat- tern in which all of the company’s past illegal acts are catching up to them.” He refe to a decision several months ago by the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that found Stevens in con- tempt of court for its labor law viola S and branded the company as one of the na- tion’s law trans; He _ also dneutscned an NLRB’s_ action in early December authorizing its chief counsel to seek a nation- wide injunction prohibiting Stevens from further labor law violations if the company fails to settle a half-dozen complaints lodged against it by ACTWU. One remedy that Ries recommended is tied to the court ruling and would have a concrete effect on organizing techniques. He suggested that the 2nd Circuit’s contempt citation remedies, applied to North Carolina and South Carolina plants, be extended to all Stevens operations nation- wide. Those include requirements that the company give the union lists of all employees’ most ego labor- names, addresses and classi- fications and give organizers access to company property to communicate with workers | during non-working time. That would include access | both inside and outside the | plants during shift changes | and breaks. Stevens’ official response so | far has been that it is review- ing Ries’ order, but that it ap- pears that “he has completely | misunderstood the facts in- volved in the Roanoke Rapids negotiations. “It also appears that he has recommended a fumber of | unusual remedies which have } been repeatedly rejected by | the courts,” the company said in a statement, adding that it | intends to appeal the decision.

An overnight winter blast had wrapped Eastern Kentucky in tranquil beauty by Monday morning. Sounds were muffled in the new layer of snow, and most movement ‘was slow motion over the pervasive sheet of ice, leaving the countryside in a surrealistic calm. | : Many people in this town of 5,000, sit- ‘ting in the aching heart of coal mining coun- try, said nature’s whimsical turn probably ‘was a good thing. It meant that only several hundred peo- ple overflowed the tiny Tom’s Creek Free Will Baptist Church to pay their last re- spects to slain coal miner Mack Lewis. Even fewer followed the funeral procession to the hillside graveyard a mile or sO away, to ‘huddle against blustering winds as six miners in white hardhats set Lewis’ casket in its final resting place, and the preacher chanted his wailing prayer, a sing-song plea that God grant peace and * Jove and unity, In the preceeding church service he had- repeated time and again: “Man that is born or woman is of few days and is full of trou- le” Several thousand striking members of the United Mine Workers of America re- portedly had planned to thread their way through the hills and hollows for the occa- sion, and people here were guessing that they would have proved the preacher's words true. The treacherous weather kept them away from here and from two other rallies’ planned in West Virginia and Southern Ohio. Mack Lewis was the first casualty of the month-long miners’ strike. Lewis, a 65-year-old retired miner, had ‘stopped last Friday morning just to visit with seven picketers stationed at the Low- _ Water Bridge across the creek from the e trance to the non-union Diamond Coal Co. near Ivel, according to police and eye wit- ness accounts. His family said he was making his daily trek to the nearby post office, an exercise prescribed by the doctors who implanted his second pacemaker six months ago. He often, paused to talk with his friends on the picket line. Ralph Anderson, a 50-year-old Diamond security guard, also was there on the wide shoulder of U.S. 23, although his duty shift had ended an hour and a half earlier at 7:30 a.m, : Turn to Page 6A, Column f ; oes Geinied from Page 1A * For reasons known only. to Mack Lewis, he asked what a don-union, “yellow dog” guard was doing -there, then esca- Tated his taunts by running his Hand down the younger man’s Spine, saying there was a “yellow streak” there, accord- ‘Ing. to eyewitness Ben .

Walter Sims, commanding officer of ‘the Kentucky State Police ‘post here. “Our investigation,” he ‘elaimed, “at this time does not link this shooting to the dabor strike.” | 2 Sims would not say wha is investigators believe moti- vated the shooting, refusing to release information he said ill come out. in the court- January 10, 1978 \f , Miners believe the police will attribute the shooting to some earlier, personal quarrel between the two men, hoping to defuse the increasingly volatile labor situation in this area. = : Lewis’ family members said they know of no such prior conflict. Regardless of what is re- vealed in the courtroom about the tragedy, it is doubtful any- thing short of a sudden con- tract settlement: will suppress the anger of striking miners. | By Kentucky miners’ stand- ards, this has relatively peaceful strike, per- haps because the the Dec. 6 , walkout came just before the. holiday season. - State police say there have been shooting incidents, the bombing of machinery at one mine and sporadic fires, simi- lar to incidents that have occurred in other states. F Miners say a few of their men have been beaten by state troopers. But it wasn’t until last weekend that the situation turned into what UMW Dis- trict 30 President Robert er described as “qa pow- er keg with ‘the f i both ends.”’ - me - The trouble, here and throughout the Mining area of been a. nation, stems from strikers’ efforts to shut down non-union operators still producing coal. “‘As long as there’s coal going to these power plants ‘and things, there’s no way we can get a contract,’ Vanover said. “If they’d close, we’d have a contract in three them down another.’” one way or accounts, produce only about half the nation’s coal. The im- mediate effectiveness of their strike also has been hampered by the fact that most major. coal users, as usual, saw the work stoppage coming and stockpiled reserves to last three or four months. The union believes the Bi- tuminous Coal Operators As- sociation, the management bargaining arm, will feel lit- tle pressure to settle a con- tract from politicians, users and the general public unless supplies begin to dwindle. : In many cases the 160,000 strikers have succeeeded in shutting down non-union mines, with convoys of as many as 300 to 400 strikers criss-crossing state lines to promote their cause. That tactic, of course, has been deplored by public offi- the right of non-union opera- tors to work and of non-union miners to work for their pay- checks. The union response is that unaffiliated miners have been getting a free ride for decades at the UMW’s expense, be- cause companies pay higher wages and in some cases ex- tend more generous benefits to keep the union out. One district official said top union scale now is $63 a day, - which would be $16,880 for an uninterrupted work year. A publication of the Coal group of predominantly non- union owners headquartered here, said the average inde- pendent miner makes $25,000 to $30,000 a year. ', “When the UMW gets a Wage increase, these fellows will get one, too,” the publica- tion said. it also said the independ- ents get incentive pay for production increases, and quoted one non-union miner as mine down every time some hothead says, ‘Boys, let’s go home.’ ” The UMW’s abundantly dis- played proclivity for wildcat , Strikes also has raised the . level of animosity during the ~The UMW miners, by. some Saying: “We don’t shut the weeks.

That was when trustees of the Welfare Fund — one one union and one impartial — cut back | the buying power of health | cent. Although some union lead- misman- agement figured in the dollar shortage that provoked the cutback, they also admit that | the -wildcat strikes were re- | sponsible. Company payments into the fund are based on a formula involying both ton- nage of coal produced and | manhours worked by miners. 4 A primary barrier to con- tract settlement now is the BCOA/’s insistence on a provi- Sion that miners on unauthor- ized strikes be forced to pay into the pension and welfare fund 30 percent of the full amount of wages they would have received for the pay period when work was missed. : If miners were out for three days, for example, they would pay 30 percent of the normal paycheck coyering a two-week pay. period, as well as being docked for the days missed. 3 . Miners like George Hop- kins, a District 30 executive board member,: charged the companies are being intransi- gent in bargaining because they hope to break the union, once and for all. Union organizing has not kept pace with the opening of new mines, particularly in the West, meaning a smaller per- centage of coal now is union- mined. That combination of less power over coal produc- tion, plus the internal strife provert on Nad wildcat strikes — heiplessiy op d by the UMW’s national § tenders make this a ripe time for a union-busting effort. j “There’s no doubt about it. We're fighting for the life of the UMW this time,” Hopkins said. He and others in this area where wildcat strikes proliferated last year refused to assess the job done by UMW President Arnold Miller. But all those ques- tioned said they now are 100. percent behind Miller and the negotiators, because unity is their only hope. Seated Monday morning m the Martin, Ky., funeral home near the room where the body of Mack Lewis. lay before the funeral, Hopkins explained the sentiments that may be rece- menting the splinterea UMW, the sentiments toward “scabs” that walk across their picket lines to keep the pre- cious -black gold feeding an energy hungry country. ~ “They don’t understand our } feeling toward the UMW.

        "ocr_text": " Turbulence, Faith ‘Mark UMW Fight For Recognition By MARCIA KUNSTEL <'— Journal-Constitution Staft Writer « . PIKEVILLE, Ky. — Like the raging springtime creek waters, bands of union men have surged up the hollows and over the hills of the rugged Appalachian chain, fighting, they <believe, for the survival of the United Mine Workers that is «their tradition and their faith. Like the turbulent floodtides, the striking union miners shave left destruction in their wake as they clash with adver- *saries who would thwart their goal of keeping coal out of the voracious furnaces of the nation, . . That violence, too, is a tradition here, both of the UMW rand the people of the hills, whether they live for or against ‘the union. This particular county, Pike, is the home of the bellicose Hatfields and McCoys, the inspiration for the hillbilly home of Lil’ Abner, his voluptuous Daisy Mae and his shotgun-tot- ing, pipe-smoking Mammy. Pike County and others of its kind, sprawled across a mountain range mostly usable only for digging coal, are the places where the UMW was nurtured and grew. Other unions strike, but not so often with the same radi- cal tactics that typify so many UMW walkouts. ' Other unions were not spawned from the same back- woods mountain heritage or have not faced the same staunch resistance that has continued to greet the UMW. That combi- nation is the union miner’s history, whether he lives in Kentucky or West Virginia or Ohio or Tennessee. * * * George Lewis is 76 years old and proud of the fact that he holds the same union card he got when he joined the UMW in 1923, He started out as a teacher, an educated man, but could- n't make a decent living. So Lewis walked out of the daylight, down into the coal pits that became his second home. He remembers the 25-month strike that never was set- tled, but broke the UMW in 1927, when he said miners re- - “If | live to be 150 years old, I'll be just as strong a union man as | am today.’ —George Lewis turned to the shafts without a contract and without a union. During that non-union period, Lewis said, he worked 23 con- secutive shifts, breaking only for dinner and a brief collapse on the bed. He says he earned $1 a day. “We couldn't buy the kids a pair of shoes,” said his wife of 54 years. “That's the reason I'm a union man,” Lewis said in an interview last week. “If I live to be 150 years old, I'll be just as strong a union man as I am today.” Lewis’ body is shriveled from illness, his eyes: distorted behind thick-lensed glasses. The outlook for his immediate fu- ture is not good. : A series of wildcat strikes and what both sides say is mismanagement of the welfare and pension funds brought a reduction in UMW medical benefits last summer. Union lead- ers charge that the internal dissension also has prompted Management to take a hard bargaining stance, in hopes of shaping the weakened UMW into a more docile union. The medical lifeline was cut off when the strike hegan, and Lewis said he received a letter Tuesday saying he and others who retired prior to 1976 probably had received their last pension check for the duration of the strike. “It’s the old men who are in trouble,” he said, wondering how long he and his wife can make it without the $220. monthly pension. “We're the ones who built this union up. I think the young ones got to stand up for us now.” One retired miner who won't worry about pensions is Lewis’ first cousin, Mack, He was shot to death during an argument at a roadside picket line at the entrance to a non- union mine on Jan, 6. A mine security guard was charged with murder. * * * In the hush of the funeral parlor, Ben Vanover was ex- plaining in a shaking voice what happened to Mack Lewis that day. Vanover, a sturdy man with a haircut approaching a brushtop, was a UMW picketer and a witness. As a small group gathered close to listen, he abruptly halted his tense narrative and walked away. In the privacy of the undertaker’s office, he later ex- plained: “There were a bunch of scabs out there. I just look at them and get mad.” Mack Lewis’ sister, who has escaped the mountain isola- tion for a northern home, intervened: “I feel pity for the man who did this thing. You have to pray for him. It’s happened “now, and we have to go on living.” Vanover shook his head. It wasn’t just what happened to Mack Lewis. The scabs are trying to break the UMW, he said. “Tf the union goes, we'll be back to $2.65 (an hour) and no benefits.” * * * From inside the church, a woman’s wailing cry pierced the cold air. Most of the mourners already had passed the open cas- ket, flanked by flags of the U.S. and the UMW. Men in rough work clothes dominated the crowd milling around the snowy ground outside, quietly talking as they awaited the funeral procession. “This weather has got us up against a wall,” one said. He was asked if the killing would bring more trouble, once the cold'snap breaks and the roads are more easily traveled. “You work with a fella in the mines and you get real close. Real close,” he said. “You feel it when they bring in a hired gun. Does that answer your question?” * * * On the office wall of Robert Carter, UMW District 30 president, hangs a quotation attributed to author Jack Lon- don. “After God created the rattlesnake, the toad and the vampire, he had some awful substance left with which he made a scab. The scab is a two-legged animal with a cork- screw soul, a waterlogged brain, a combination backbone of jelly and glue. “Where others have hearts, he carries a tumor of rotten principles . . . No man has a right to scab so long as there is a pool of water to drown his carcass in or a rope long enough to hang his body with.” That is hardly the official UMW policy in this strike that began Dee, 6, but it does indicate some miners’ sentiments. Picketing non-union mines is legal, the bombings and shootings and attacks on coal-laden trucks are not. January 15, 1978 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Miners, Bosses in Alabama Feel Federal Bayonets Wouldn't Bring Out Coal By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal-Constitution Staff Writer , JASPER, Ala. — Miners and their bosses here are fearful that a government order to reopen the idle coal mines will be useless and probably bloody. From the Domino Club in Brilliant, a traditional mining town some 40 miles north of here, to the Green Top Cafe, the closest beer joint to this dry county seat, people connected with mining expressed only pessi- mism that a government dictum to halt the record strike would do much good. Most discussion here late last week re- volved around the prospects of a strike-stop- ping injunction imposed under the Taft- Hartley Act. But those who broached the possibility of more drastic federal actions also questioned whether anything short of a contract settlement would get coal moving again to the utilities and indust that verge on a crisis shortage. “As John L. Lewis said,” one mine operator recalled, “You can’t mine coal with bayonets.” Where it doesn’t spur violent confronta- tions, others said, an order to halt the strike only would bring warm bodies back into the mines. It wouldn’t necessarily bring much coal back out again. “Tf they go back to work without a con- tract), I doubt they’d be very productive,” said Charles R. Grantland, vice president and general manager of Coalite Inc., a sub- sidiary of Brilliant Coal Co. here. ’ “There’s working and there’s looking busy,” he said. “It’s something you can’t prove, but there’d be a definite decline in production.” AH Predictions Grim * Miner Richard Headrick, a bearded 27- year-old who spent seven years in the deep mines, agreed with that assessment. ~ “The company I work for isn’t going to make any money,” Headrick said. “I'd go back to work, but I wouldn’t do anything.” | Other miners interviewed, both strident -young men in this area, reputedly holding the most militant unionists, and the more easy-going miners located further north, gravely predicted that an injunction would bring destruction, injury and possibly death. President Carter has been reluctant to trigger the Taft-Hartley mechanism or to use other force to stop the strike, preferring to: pressure the United Mine Workers of America and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association into virtually around-the-clock negotiating. - His move was welcomed by both sides in ‘the dispute here, and reports from Wash- ington this weekend said the high-pressured White House intervention did bring some progress. —Concessions Offered A new industry offer includes conces- sions on two key provisions that have ineensed mine workers here and throughout mining territory. ‘= “From what I’ve read in the paper, it (the earlier proposal) is totally unaccept- able,” said Ned Strickland Jr., a surface miner swilling Budweiser at the Green Top, a place local mine operators characterized as a hotbed of union militancy. « “We never would accept that $20 a day (pénalty).... To me, it’s less than we had be- fore,” Strickland added, pointing particu- larly to the lack of a cost-of-living mech- anism to keep miners up with inflation. Such an automatic salary boost has been in- cluded in virtually all recent national union contracts. The retired and former miners lining up dominoes at the club in Brilliant likewise said the UMW men thereabouts never would approve a contract with those provisions. » Larkin “Buck” Flippo, who won’t get his pension back till the UMW returns to the pits, said he wouldn’t want them to. And in Rock City, a crossroads town be- tween here and Brilliant that the operators described as the abode of “the reasonable, family men” of the UMW, the story was the same. “The $20 a day is too much,” said miner Fred Baccus, who also is a licensed minister at the Rock City Church of God. “I couldn't pay it, and it wouldn’t be my fault,” he said, explaining that miners in his area don’t instigate wildcat strikes, but are bound by tradition and intimidation to walk out when union men at other mines call a work stoppage. Those two provisions, over which the BCOA was adamant until the White House intervened with high-pressure tactics last week, certainly aren’t the miners’ only tar- gets of criticism. —Wildcats a Tool There is the industry’s refusal to adopt a “limited strike” policy, which ideally would at least contain wildcat strikes to a single company. The operators don’t want to recognize any legal right to strike — except at con- tract time — but the union men say the wildcats are an inevitable, if regrettable tool. What the miners want to do, they say, is stop the traditional spread of wildcats to places where there are no grievances. “You don’t gain that much from a strike, especially a wildcat strike,” said Strickland. “But men get impatient, and they strike. If they’d hold the strike to one mine, that’d be OK.” What a wildcat strike does accomplish, he said, is quick action from mine operators who know they’re in violation of the con- tract, perhaps for discharging a worker or for failing to meet strict safety standards. Strickland and his friend Headrick, whose dad owns the Green Top Cafe, said the contract-sanctioned abitration process is too slow. They also questioned the impar- tiality of arbitrators. “Most of the arbitrated cases are done by young lawyers,” Headrick said. “If you were a lawyer just starting out, whose side would you take? The side where your money’s going to come from in the future. “We don’t feel we've gotten a fair shake,” he said. Strickland added another criticism of the arbitrators: “Most of them’s never seen a coal mine. That’s a disadvantage to both sides.” A non-miner friend, who asked to re- main anonymous, further explained the miners’ stand. “They don’t trust the system,” he said. “I don’t think they want to start a revolu- tion or anything ... but the judges and the company guys, they go to the same country anise —Stable Force Needed The mine operators say the wildcat strike has been the strongest and deepest root of the contract dispute. “We cannot live with wildcat strikes,” said E.A. “Larry” Drummond, the executive vice president of Drummond Coal Co. here, which lost about 30 days of production to unauthorized strikes during the past fiscal year. “The coal industry can’t remain com- petitive with an unstable work force,” he said. The wildcats are more expensive than a contract strike, because the operator must remain primed for a sudden return to work, rather than dismantle over all operations as he settles in for a protracted work stoppage, Drummond said. Drummond, whose family’s Drummond Co. now controls operations employing about 3,500 UMW members in Alabama, said he would like to see the $20-a-day fine for wildcat strikes, but wasn't wedded to it as the only solution. Staff Pholo—Louie Favorite FRED [BACCUS (LEFT) MEETS WITH FELLOW MINERS IN STORE AT ROCK CITY, ALA., HOME OF UMW’S ‘FAMILY MEN’ $20-a-Day Penalty Is Too Much,’ Says Baccus, Who Is Also Minister of Rock City Church of God. ‘I Couldn’t Pay It’ He would be satisfied with a definitive right to discharge the instigators of unauthorized strikes, Drummond said. “With the expense and loss the coal industry incurred in 1977,” he said, “that maintenance of a stable work force is something that’s going at the jugular.” There also has been consistent argument over the industry’s proposal for a seven-day work week — now certain mining procedures cannot be undertaken on Sunday — and the mine owners’ efforts to take over administration of the union’s health and pension fund. Whether the industry’s two major conces- sions will be sufficient to win over a strident union membership, if the UMW bargaining coun- cil does submit the package to a vote, remains questionable. At least the move by the BCOA must be seen as a point of progress over the last contract proposal that UMW President Arnold Miller wanted to submit. February 19, 1978 \f"

Officials said the fire was apparently the work of an arsonist. By MARCIA KUNSTEL Two more North Georgia churches, within three miles of each other, were burned early Saturday, apparently the work of an arsonist. Both red brick structures on winding rural roads, one housing the Free Baptist Church in north Cobb County and the other the New Hope Church in southeast Bartow County, were hit by vandals who spray- painted obscenities on the walls about a month or so ago, according to parishioners. Charred remains outside the shell of the Free Baptist Church — only the bottom third of the structure remained standing Saturday — carried a heavy odor of what seemed to be kerosene. “Tt looks like it was deliberately set,” said the Rev. Stephen Kimmons, pastor of Free Baptist, tightly grasping his young wife’s hand. Authorities said arson is suspected in both fires, which were reported within about an hour of each other at 5 and 6 a.m. Both churches. have white congrega- tions, as did the three rural, Baptist churches set ablaze last July in White and Hall counties. Another small Baptist church near Woodstock in Cherokee County went up in smoke last August, also apparently set by Fires Continued From Page 1-A At the smaller Free Baptist Church, spirits were more de- jected, as members _§ sifted through the ashes for Bibles and mementoes, with tears streaking down the faces of some. Kimmons, a 27-year-old who sang with a Gospel quar- tet before taking over the pas- torate of his old home church two years ago, said things had been going well lately, except for the vandalism and occa- sional incidents of cars speeding up the drive and skidding their tires. “Things just seemed to blossom out and grow and grow and grow.” Kimmons said. “It’s been wonderful.” A fund-raising campaign was about to begin, to pay off the remaining $4,000 owed on the church and also to pave the parking lot an arsonist’s torch. Obscene words had also been scrawled on three of these churches, but apparently just before the blazes were set. , Four small eastern Georgia churches with black congregations were destroyed by. fire in December. Three white youths were charged with arson in the eastern Georgia blazes. F At the New Hope Baptist Church,’ actual fire damage was contained to the basement Sunday school rooms and the pas- tor’s study, which had been remodeled in the last six months in an $8,000-$10,000 im- provement program, according to Deacon Horace Haney. “But the fire department did a good job,” Haney said. “They did a wonderful job.” The building won't be usable for a while, but the Rev. Stanley Wilkins said services for the 250-member church will continue uninterrupted. “If we stopped now, that couldn’t suit the devil more,” he said. “We might have our services right here in the yard,” said Millard Meadows, another deacon. “We want to try to keep all of our people together.” See FIRES, Page 19-A “He (the arsonist) might have slowed us down, but we'll still get our parking lot. And when we're done rebuild- ing. we'll have an even prettier church,” he said. “The people are heartbro- ken and sad, but they still have a lot of faith,”” Kimmons said. “They know we're going to make it. All of them have said we're going to come back better and bigger.”’ Services still will continue every Sunday and Wednesday night, Kimmons said, although he didn’t know where. Two teen-aged brothers, Sifting through the wet, sooty remains in the basement, agreed that the congregation would stick together through adversity. “We went to other <hurches, but we always come back here, because it felt like home,”” said Oscar Blalack, 15. ‘‘We feel the spirit and the love here.” His brother Danny, 19, ex- pressed their determination to continue: “‘We built it one _ time, we can build it again.” \f"

A: Oh, I don’t know. I think it's less of a factor now than it was in 1976. I don’t think he’s as strong as he was per- ceived to be in 1976... . The polls, whether Gallup polls or Harris polls or CBS polls, show that President Carter is having his problems around the country. It would cer- tainly include the South. I'm not suggesting he couldn’t bounce back. But I think there’s a general feeling right now—and I underscore right now, because things can change—that there's a general lack of competence, of understanding, of not being able to do the things that seemed so easy as a candi- date. And not really being able to work with fellow Democrats in Congress. If some of these Carter pro- grams were so red hot, I as- sume the Democrats would pass them, Q: Are there specific things you think the president has done wrong? A: The Panama Canal, energy. I don’t say these are mistakes. Maybe they should have been dealt with, but they whole host of things—tax re- form, government reorganiza- tion—all those things that were promised in the cam- paign for the most part still are promises. . .

This was a big issue and even when we voted on it, I think the American were still about two to one against it. It'll be more an issue in 1978 in the Senate races than in the Senate races of 1980, but it will be an issue in six months that they don't want to wait 23 years (to take over the Canal). ...

        "ocr_text": "Bakke a Mystery, | Despite the Publicity By MARCIA KUNSTEL In Norwegian, the name Bakke means “hill.” It seems fitting for the man who struggled all the way up to the United States Supreme Court to through a monkey wrench into one of the nation’s most contro- versial mechanisms for attaining racial equality. The five-year climb was surrounded in its latter Stages by extensive publicity, fiery public debate and emotional demonstrations of both support and opposi- tion. “But Allan Paul Bakke, 38, kept his battle essen- tially a private one, letting little of the man intrude upon the issue. Thwarting publicity at every turn, Bakke refused to let the world see his face and his feelings, ada- mantly pursuing his goal — admittance to the Medical School of the University of California at Davis — under 2 self-drawn curtain of privacy. 10 had the courage — or € minority quota system ‘as that system, he con- tended, that kept him out of the Davis school by allow- ‘ing admittance of minority students less qualified than he. _““My judgment is that Allen Bakke is cursed with a logical mind, partially due to his engineering back- ground,” Said Reynold Colvin, Bakke’s attorney. What really happened was that he was turned down by the Davis Medical School, that he had always | believed that he could not be kept out of school by rea- son of his race or ethnic identity, and that, when it was explained to him by the authorities at Davis that this rat the case, it just seemed illogical to him,” Colvin Said. “And he’s been pursuing it ever since.” Colvin apparently is one of the few people with whom Bakke would discuss the case. A co-worker at the Ames Research Center, a labo- ratory of the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis- tration near Palo Alto, said abruptly that Bakke didn’t much talk about the case. A relative in Coral Gables, Fla., where Bakke at- tended public school after moving from his native state of Minnesota, said the same thing. “T’ve asked him things about it, and he just says, ‘Well, we'll talk about that some other time,’ ” she said. _ The relative, who refused to identify herself fur- ther, would not relate any personal information about Bakke, saying she was bound to honor his wish for privacy. “I know how he feels about it. . .I mean, he doesn’t want to make a personal issue out of it,” she said. Would she give any description of the man’s character? “He’s a very straightforward and honest person. What’s right is right, and that’s all.” Bakke was born Feb. 4, 1940, in Minneapolis. After his high school graduation in Florida, he attended the University of Minnesota as a student in the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. He was graduated with a me- chanical engineering degree in 1963. He went on active duty and served four. years in the U.S. Marine Corps, including seven months in Vietnam as com- mander of a combat antiair- craft missile unit. He returned to the United He completed work for a masters degree in engineering at Stanford in 1970 and con- tinued to work at Ames, where NASA’s _ research Bakke became serious about going into medicine. He began taking premedical courses, worked as a volunteer in the emergency room of a local hospital and reportedly was interested in the design of medical equipment, He applied to 11 medical schools in 1972, He was invited to UC Davis for an interview on the basis of his Bakke first believed some- thing was not right in the spring of 1973, when he learned two things from a Davis Medical School admis- sions counselor: © He had come very close 2 being admitted to the fall class. © The school maintained a policy through which appli- | cation was revie cants from “economically and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds” received special consideration, Of the 100 slots in the class, 16 were reserved. for the disadvantaged, even if their test scores and other quali- fications were less than those Of non-disadvantaged appli- cants.

He was old to be a beginning medical student, But he had decided that prac. ticing medicine was his great. est ambition, so Bakke fo}. lowed the counsel0’s advice and applied again through an early admissions program for the next year’s class. \"I know my motivation is as strong and honest toward a career in medicine 4S that of any applicant, more than of anyone else in the World” Bakke said in his S¢COnd plea for admission.

He does not make public ap- pearances, He does not give interviews to the press. He does not appear on television. He does not appear on radio. He does not like to have his picture taken. “He talks with his lawyers.

Justice Department attorney who wants to reactivate an investigation into suspected mobster influence and crime in local labor organizations. Officials of the Atlanta Labor Coun- iJ and several unions have written to the Justice Department and to some Georgia congressmen seeking to dis- credit William L. McCulley, a lawyer assigned to the Atlanta office of the de- partment’s Organized Crime Strike Force. The letters seeking his ouster or a reprimand came after McCulley testi- fied he needs manpower to resume an © Serious vandalism and destruction of building equip- ment in the mid-1970s, includ- ing the dynamiting of Georgia Power transmission lines, was traced to union-related prob- lems. Authorities could not connect the destruction with organized crime, but it fit the pattern of violence seen in other cities where mobsters have grabbed control of unions, © An Atlanta union official was suspected of using his position for personal profit, other union rank-and-file were asked to buy insurance plans ‘‘at exorbitant prices for the profit of union leaders and their associates,” and dissidents of another union were threatened after they protested against their leader- ° ship. ka. According to presegt and former law enforcement offi- investigation that has heen dormant now for more than two years. That probe had produced two successful labor-related prosecutions, had uncov- ered union links with organized crime here and had provided clues to other labor law violations. How serious the situation js today, McCulley said during Senate hearings on labor-management racketeering, cannot be determined until he gets help from other federal agencies, especially the Department of Labor, “He testified along with other Strike Force attorneys at hearings galled by the Senate Permanent Subeommittee on Investigations to look into com cials familiar with the effort, the Strike Force was unable to pursue those leads for two reasons. First, shortly after taking office in 1974, then-Public Safety Commissioner A. Regi- nald Eaves stripped three Atlanta police intelligence officers from the Strike Force team over a period of several months. Those officers had become the first local police in the nation working with a federal Strike Force on a permanent basis when Eaves’ predeces- sor, John Inman, assigned them there. Then in the spring of 1976, the Strike Force was further diluted by the loss of a U.S. Labor Department investiga- tor with expertise in probing union corruption. Since then, McCulley told the subcommittee, his office plaints that union corruption is not being vigorously prosecuted. ELL. Abercrombie, head of Laundry Workers Union Local 218 in Atlanta, wrote the subcommittee that McCulley is trying to “perpetuate his ‘witch hunt’ which has been conducted in the Atlanta area for nearly four years without disclosing a single instance of connection between Atlanta unions and organized crime.” He asked that McCulley be “publicly rebuked” for his stance, charging the lawyer’s union investigations have been a waste of taxpayers’ money. And in interviews here local labor figures claimed there is no mobster influence for McCulley to investigate, has been in the dark about union activity in Atlanta. (The Strike Force has contin- ued other organized crime investigations, including a re- cent probe of alleged corrup- tion in the Atlanta nightclub . business,) McCulley told the subcom- mittee that based on previous intelligence, “there is. . . at least some indication that organized crime has ties with ‘union activities in Atlanta, though just how deep that tie is, or just how deeply organ- ized crime has penetrated union activity in this area is unknown at this time.” McCulley said assistance from the Labor Department is especially vital because “we need to audit books of unions to see where they are investing funds, how and to whom they are making dis- bursements and whether, as suggesting he is merely trying to make a name for himself. Although other Strike Force lawyers gave tougher testimony — with some even alleging direct syndicate control of unions in several major cities — none was subjected to the ringing con- demnation that was directed at McCul- ley by Atlanta labor leaders, according to subcommittee staff members. Like the other attorneys who called for a renewed commitment to fighting labor-management racketeering, McCulley was able to base his appeal for help on a record of success. While the Atlanta investigation was running full steam, the Strike Force won convictions several years ago of John “Rocky” Lynch, an Atlanta leader has happened in other areas, union officials are submitting multiple billings to different union entities to unjustly en- rich themselves for expenses, entertainment, travel and so forth.” He added that union pen- sion and benefit funds need special attention from investi- gators, because they have been vulnerable to abuse. McCulley refused to elabo- rate on his testimony before the subcommittee or to dis- cuss what he will do if he is given the manpower he re- quested. He did, however, respond to the criticism hurled at him by union officials here, say- ing, “It merely reminds me of the old expression, ‘It’s the hit dog that barks.’ “T just fon’t understand people whi react that way when they’ve not been ac- of the International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Tron Workers, on a gun charge and of Hotel, Motel and Restaurant Employ- ees union organizer Herbert “Pinky’ Schiffman on a corruption charge.

Atlanta Labor President Douglas Brooks called McCulley “a local yokel” and a liar who should be sacked from his Justice Department job. Another labor: leader here, who asked not to be identi- fied, said McCulley “should either put up or, shut up,” adding that as far as he knew, Atlanta unions are free of corruption. : Other, less angry labor fig- ures said some illegal activi- ties may take place in unions, but complained that McCulley used too broad a brush in painting his view. of possible corruption» unfairly indicting a entire labor movement ere.

        "ocr_text": "ACCUSED AT MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON Anguished Chaplain Awaiting Call By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Statf Writer MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga. — The wait has seemed interminable for C. Wayman Alston and his wife Bernice, who have spent most of the last month inside their Modest, stucco home, listening for the phone call that will bring ruin or absolu- on. They are not alone in waiting out each hot, oppressive day since Aug. 4. That is when Dr. Alston, a man of the cloth hold- ing a doctorate in psychology and a posi- tion of irust in the black community. making “sexual advances” toward a con- victed murderess and a young chap- laincy intern at the Georgia Women’s Correctional Institution. Others are waiting, too, for the results of the internal investigation of the accu- sations. A quiet line of sentinels stretches from the white power structure at City Hall to the international headquarters of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in New York City. Such disparate forces have heeded the burly black leader for several years, but sion, when he shook this sleepy Southern town out of the summer doldrums. et + A few advance tremors: preceded the big boom, as Alston became embroiled in political infighting for the first time since the white powers embraced him. His real acceptance had come after 1974, when Alston endorsed the guber- natorial bid of then-Lt. Gov. Lester Mad- dox and still managed to retain his own power base in the black community. Small-scale agitation erupted into full antagonism on July 8, when Alston made was suspended from his $20,000-a-year job as a prison chaplain, on charges of a string of charges in the City Council chambers, inferior own treatment in being hired and days later fired as part- time city chaplain. The stinger in his state- ent came at its end, when The mayor, he said, se- retly taped conversations in is office. Alston took his charges to he district attorney and the local Georgia Bureau’ of oring of union organizers attempting to unionize the vork force of the local J.P. Stevens plant, including elec- ronic surveillance of the organizers’ motel rooms. On July. 31 Alston submit- ed a written affidavit with is charges to both the dis- lrict attorney and the GBI agent. 7 On Aug. 4 he was informed of the charges against him _ id was suspended, with pay. =e Bob Rice is a_ kindly-look- ng, white-haired man who joesn’t like to talk on the the record about the recent un- Pleasantness in his town. “The allegations made by him (Alston) are ridiculous,” the mayor said in giving his formal stand on the matter. Mayor Rice said Alston’s charges had been found with- out merit by GBI Agent J.T. “Sonny” King. King did, indeed, find that. The accusation of taping with one-party consent—the mayor’s taping of conversa- tions in his own office—does- n’t involve any -illegality, King said. He did not further address the issue of whether the mayor actually did any taping. Unwarranted electronic surveillance is a different story, King said, adding in a news release that he “found no evidence that this has occurred.’””” . - How far he looked for evi- dence is another question. King admitted he didn't eheck the motel rooms for “bugs” or try to talk to the union organizers about Al- ston’s charges before closing his investigation. “They (union organizers) left about six months ago,” King said in a recent tele- phone interview. ‘‘I have no knowledge of them still being here.” _ If he had checked around, King would have bumped into an organizer or two. -“E really couldn’t believe the investigation was over without any of us being talked to,” said Mel Tate, area director for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. ““‘We know damned well there’s been some illegal surveillance.” Tate, who refused to elabe- rate on that assertion, has spent the last 18 months or so in and out of Milledgeville, re me union maintains rr. cently checked out of there on Tuesday morning, according to a desk clerk. A union spokesman in New York admitted ACTWU is interested in developments in Milledgeville, but he said the union’s attorneys haven’t de- cided exactly what tack to take. They were thwarted just days ago, said spokesman Bert Beck, when a Milledge- ville textile company sud- denly settled a federal labor relations case on unexpect- edly generous terms, immedi- ately after the union subpoe- naed all tapes, transcripts or other data held by the mayor interest in Dr. dramatically shortly before his susp< - Alston intensifi:d or police and related to con- versations between the company’s employees and the union’s representatives. Be- cause the company has set- tled, the case will be closed and the subpoenas never an- swered. we OO “The white politicans here never forgive a man for being black, and they surely never forgive him for being black and smart,’’ said a white man in Milledgeville who travels ‘im political circles and asked not to be identified. The problem with Alston, the man said, is that he can’t be controlled by the white power structure. “They're out to ax this man. They want his head,” the man said. ‘‘He’s black, and he’s an independent man.” The Milledgeville man, a respected local citizen, said Mayor Rice has told him about taping conversations in the mayor’s office and about Placing police officers in rooms next to those of the union organizers to conduct surveillance. Rice even offered to play the tapes for him, the man said. Several sources have de seribed Alston as being rela- tively anti-union, refusing to use his considerable influence to convince the high percent- age of black J.P. Stevens workers to support the union organizing campaign. ~ Some speculate he could change his mind if he is suffi- ciently angered by the powers-that-be in Milledge- ville. Or perhaps if he loses his job. 3 =-_s The internal investigation -into charges against Alston still is being conducted by the state Department of Offender Rehabilitation, according to spokesman Sara Passmore. She said Wednesday there has been no estimate of when it-will be completed. Since the allegations against Alston surfaced a few weeks ago, it has been re- ported that the charges came from 2 summer intern at the prison and from inmate Rebecca Machete, who was convicted of murder in con- nection with the i deaths i u d, Ronny Aikens, and his new bride, Juanita. - Sources close to the prison system said Mrs chete made similar cha against See CHAPLAIN, Page 8-f a law enforcement officer while she was on trial in Macon. Her allegations were found to be without merit. The intern was a young woman from Texas studying to be a clinical chaplain. She reportedly had worked closely with Mrs. Machete as a counselor. She apparently made the accusations about the same time Mrs. Machete leveled her charges, just be- fore leaving town at the end of her internship. Alston will say little for the record about his current Situation, mostly repeating earlier staterments he made when word of his suspension was leaked to the local media a couple of weeks ago. “If the good name, reputa- tion and credibility of a pas- tor is destroyed, especially an institutional chaplain, he is i as dead as if he were shot with a gun,” Alston said at that time. He aiso ques- tioned the “coincidental” tim- ing of the charges against him, since they followed di- rectly on the heels of his charges against the mayor and police. In an interview this week he spoke a bit of the ‘mental anguish” of waiting by the phone for nearly a month to investigation, seldom leaving! home, and never during day- there to stand the vigil. He has taken seriousiy the admonition from prison Warden Leland Linahan, who said he must know where to contact the suspended chap- lain from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday until the matter is settled. . The wait may not be such a constant companion for other interested parties, but others clearly do have a stake in what happens to Dr. Alston, or perhaps more precisely, in a Dr. Alston does after it appens.

To get the spelunkers out of the cavern Bean and fellow diver Ian Hamilton had to give each person an airhose and then help guide them submerged through the passage to the outside, “Whenever I went back (to rescue another per- son) I had to more or less claw my way. across the bottom,” He fought the current going in but each time he brought out another person the current was on his side and carried them thr matter of seconds. ough to safety in a Dennis Hudgins, 24, of Fairburn said from his- hospital bed that he was ready to go caving again but he didn’t like the way he had to leave the cave, © “It (caving) was like falling off a horse, You've: got to go back again,” he said, He said the scariest part of the ordeal was the long-awaited trip back © out, through the 50-foot flooded corridor. “The only point we were really scared was fe cold’ Beck said, when we had to go under with the (scuba) regulator S°BUt it was a real good experience. An unreal experi- ence,” he said. Over a period of a half hour the cavers emerged one by one into the night scene of confu- ‘sion and high emotion. In fact, one set of parents didn’t even know their son was out of the cave until he had his clothes cut off and was sitting on the edge of the ravine wraped shivering in a blanket fo 10 minutes, “We're living!” exclaimed Warren Moore, 22 “of Colquitt, as he emerged. Warren was already stripped of his clothes and sitting in a blanket before a reporter pointed out to his parents that he had come out. His parents, Hill and Grace Moore, stood less than 20 feet away from Warren but had somehow ‘missed him. The elder Moore said later, “It’s our first time in this area and it would suit me if its the last.” Earlier, Mrs. Moore said through her constant anxious gaze at the swirling waters below that War ren had never been spelunking before and that, yes she was a little frightened before he made the trip. “He’s a little daredevil anyway,” she said, “a real outdoors person.” “We were 40 feet above water. Nobody pan icked. There was no doubt we'd get out,” said War ren, who added it had been his first — but certainly not his last — caving experience. He said the party was preparing another es cape attempt she Toth 38, arrived after making his way through a water-filled passageway.

        "ocr_text": "tn Kevin Duignan Cries After Evans Spared lrish,Priest ‘Adopts Death Row’s Evans As No. By MARCIA KUNSTEL 4ournal Statf# Writer ATMORE, Ala. — The Rev. Kevin Duignan has turned over a part of his life to a man he didn’t know four months ago. Most of the Irish priest’s waking hours for weeks have been consumed in _ talking, thinking and praying about a young outlaw who murdered at least one person in a life of crime stemming back to boy- hood schooldays. The object of Duignan’s concentrated attentions is John Louis Evans III, 29, who was spared from the electric chair last Thursday six hours before he ‘was scheduled to die. The U.S. Supreme Court action that stayed his execu- tion may keep Evans alive for only a month, perhaps longer, depending on whether Evans decides to join the fight on his behalf. Duignan had spent hours everyday in Evans’ cell, trying to convince him to join in the legal appeals to have his sentenced overturned. He was preparing to begin the task anew this weekend. If Duignan cannot saye Evans’ life, the priest at least I Mission when the network requested a filming at the prison later that day. “I look like hell any- way. It doesn’t matter a hill of beans to me.” But when CBS proposed something that would cut into his scheduled afterneon visit with Evans, the denial was emphatic. “Wait a minute. That would limit my visit with Johnny. He comes first in my life, you know.” The work with Evans, which began with a pleading letter from his mother to the only Catholic priest listed in Atmore, has been essentially sanctioned by the members of the 90-family Parish, one par- ishioner said. There has been little, if any resentment over Duignan’s new committment, although mot all the church members agree wholeheartedly with his stand against the death penalty, said the parishioner, who preferred to remain uni- dentified. The Catholics in Atmore, he said, have been more con- cerned over the strain on their pastor, especially as it cemes in the midst of prepa- rations for Holy Week. But has tried to ease his last days, they are thankful their priest nis sentenced overturned. hie was preparing to begin the task anew this weekend. Tf Duignan cannot save Evans’ life, the priest at least has tried to ease his last days, bring him inner peace and perhaps help him save his soul. ‘ “I wonder if God brought me out from Ireland 5,000 | miles away from my people, and had me cross paths with Johnny to help him,” Duignan said in a recent interview. “And if that’s what he has done, perhaps ke’ll tell me in the next world that it was worthwhile. Perhaps. Maybe this justifies my priesthood.” As events last week built to and finally passed the im- mediate crisis, Duignan re- tained his sense of optimism, his Irish wit and endearing charm, even when exhaustion from sleepless nights, death - row visits and never-ending telephone calls threatened to physically break him apart. His spare, red-brick home was the center of activity last week for death penalty oppo nents who share Duignan’s revulsion for killing by, the state. The phone was almost mever silent over those days, tying the activist enclave to lawyers in Montgomery, New Orleans and Washington as. the appeals progressed, to the governor’s office, to Evans’ mother in Beaumont, Texas, ~ to friends, reporters and con- cerned people who felt com- pelled to know the latest development in the case of John Evans. It was not finished for Duignan when the high court issued a temporary stay at about 6:30 p.m. Thursday. When several reporters ar- Yived at the priest’s Main Street rectory Friday morn- ing, Duignan slowly opened: his door on the second ring of the bell, raised his graying brows over reproachful eyes and finally signaled a wel- come with the smile that issues from every wrinkle on © his 56-year-old face. . Between his nearly chain- Smoking of Viceroys, drags on a bottle of Robitusson, hack- ing coughs and repeated tele- one calls — NBC, CBS, the ew York Post and a stranger from upstate New .

As usual, he would tell little without specific” ques- tions, but invited their asking. As usual, he took the time for those who demand it from him, but made it clear the priority still is Jobn Evans. “I don't care who takes my e On Fl Cts seaitua, om: SOs ree e Moree cerned ove the strain on their pastor, especially as it comes in the midst of prepa- rations for Holy Week.

A new offensive against capital punishment will begin in Atlanta next month, just as executions are expected to resume, _ . Atlanta was selected as the site for the May 12 National ‘March Against Death because Georgia has executed more prisoners than any other state and because death rows in the South hold the vast majority of inmates awaiting the death penalty, according to march organizers, who outlined their plans here Wednesday. “e - Spokesmen for several: anti-death penalty organizations did not detail other plans for public action after the march from the Martin Luther King Community Center to a rally at the Georgia Capitol. But they said this would start an educa- ‘tional campaign and stepped up movement to sway public opin- ion, which polls show heavily favors capital punishment, += Nor would they predict a turnout, although several said “organizers are working in other sections of the country. “The timing (of the march) as it is turning out is crucial,” said the Rev. Joe Ingle, director of the Southern Coalition on Jails and Prisons in Nashville. ! The timing is important because the state of Florida is on the verge of performing its first execution in years, Appeals also are running out in other states, and the likeli- hood of a resumption of capital punishment increases weekly, : ant that we get out as many people as we can to show Gov. (George) Busbee, Gov. (Bob) Graham (of Florida) and others that a lot of people don’t want this,” Ingle said, “If they think they can sit back and let executions go on for the next few years without opposition, they've got another think coming, “We're going to raise holy hell from here to Timbuktu.” ~The activists expressed no optimism that they could reach ‘their goal quickly, r\\ “Tt took a long time to pass these laws,” Ingle said, “and ‘we: won't be able to get them off the books overnight, I'm ‘braced for a decade of executions,” | - He predicted that a thousand people could be éxecuted in the next 10 years. ‘Dr. Nancy Leslie from the Atlanta chapter of Amnesty International said it took “many, many years of debate before capital punishment was abolished once and for all” in England in 1965. That happened 13 years after a royal commission analyzed the issue and recommended abolition, She noted that President Jimmy Carter refused a request to set up a similar commission in this country. It was made by ‘Morris Dees, Carter’s chief fund-raiser in 1976 and director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which defends mostly capital cases. | No other Western nations use capital punishment with regularity, she said, and of the major powers, only the United States, Russia and Red China maintain the death penalty ty International has opposed capital punishment ~~ All the death penalty opponents also spoke against exect- tion 5 lethal injection, which has been adopted by several states as a more humane means of executing murderers. Advocacy for that method comes from “commissioners of corrections, governors, the people who are going to i the most directly involved in executions and are trying to ma ef easier on themselves. . . .

Stevens plant there. ; The action names Mayor Bob Rice, Police Chief Charles Osborne, Detective James Josey and J.C. Green, innkeeper at the local Holiday Inn where the complaint alleges the surveil- lance took place. , __ The complaint says the public officials abridged the con- Stitutional rights of free speech and free assembly of the union’s organizers and of local Stevens workers, and also vio- lated the National Labor Relations Act. _ In essence, the suit charges that Mayor Rice directed his police chief to spy on the organizers of the Amalgamated Cloth- ing and Textile Workers Union, beginning in 1976, and that his detectives did it from a second-floor room above the rooms where the organizers stayed and held meetings with workers at the Holiday Inn. - The union does not allege that electronic surveillance took place, but that detectives stationed in the upstairs room took down vehicle tag numbers of all those who visited the room and the names of persons they could identify. Police then traced the tags to vehicle owners through a law enforcement computer system, and lists of those believed See UNION, Page mo -Union Continued From Page 1C to:have been at the scene were turned over to Rice, who has a += The union claims the surveillance was improper because it ‘was discriminatorily directed only against union organizers and ecause there was no legitimate law enforcement rationale for it — that is, no reason to believe a.crime was being plotted,or committed by the organizers, or that evidence of criminal ac- tivities would be obtained from the monitoring. =~iChief Osborne has admitted to The Atlanta Journal and ther publications that he did “observe different people coming ‘and-going,” and that Mayor Rice suggested such observation. ~:~. He told The Journal that he did not keep records on the Surveillance, but the union has an affidavit. from a former ledgeville detective who swore he gave Osborne lists of peo- ~ple he observed, as requested by the chief. «|. The fact that Osborne publicly admitted to the surveil- ‘lance, according to the union, had the effect of instilling fear in the organizers, chilling the organizers and workers rights of ‘free speech and assembly, and abridging rights to unionize that ~are conferred by the labor act. In a telephone interview nine months ago, Osborne said rumors circulating at the time that his department did elec- tronic surveillance of the organizers were totally false. “We didn’t have to. They kept the (motel) door wide open most of the time,” he said. Osborne said his concern was over the potential for trou- ble, since disturbances have erupted in other places where union organizing occurred. He said no trouble flared up in Milledgeville. . “I never approached them (the organizers), never had any need to, because nothing ever flared up,” he said. “As far.as people joining unions, I could care less.” Apparently one key point in the suit revolves around whether detailed information from the surveillance — such as the names of persons visiting the organizers — was handed over to industrial representatives. The union is expected to argue that sharing such information with non-law enforcement personnel is illegal. The textile workers have been actively organizing at the Milledgeville plant since June of 1976, as part of a reactivated campaign to unionize J.P. Stevens throughout the South.

It is a total commitment at this point,” Mrs. Stern said Sunday in a telephone interview from the couple's Central Park West. apart- ment in New York. The Sterns began building that commit» ment within two weeks of ‘the tragic night their daughter, an Emory student, was kidnap- ped, raped then shot to death in southwest Atlanta. She was abducted while driving to a restaurant with a visiting friend, who managed to escape in the foggy night. Emory will have its annual memorial service Wednesday for students who died dur- ing the year.

But in the case of handgun control, it would be so simple for legis- lation to be passed,” she said. “It makes so much sense.” The Sterns would like to see handguns outlawed entirely, she said, but have decided that is an unrealistic goal in America today, since guns are so much a part of so many peo- ple’s everyday existence. That is why the couple works with Handgun Control Inc., Which proposes federal control rather than abolition. Mrs. Stern believes the control movement will succeed. “I feel there is a lot of interest being created. It’s going to happen,” she said. “There is Still a lot of work ahead, a lot of hard work. .

The large, spare church brimmed over, too, with more than a thousand friends’ of the family of Margaret Leigh Bell, a 15-year-old, all-American teen-ager slain last week. Soft cries broke into air laden with the sick-sweet smell of an abundance of flowers — roses and carnations and daisies in bouquets with satin ribbons that were the only decoration in the austerely formal church. Their bright colors spilled across the front of the sanctuary and down the side aisles, a remarkable contrast to the ‘white and pale green that otherwise prevailed. A harsher contrast was the anguish covering the faces of young people who filed out of First Baptist after the funeral service. Young mourners whose summer freedom from school cares began with murder. Girls in delicate pastels clutched each others hands, held onto their boy- friends or abandoned themselves to parents’ embracing arms. Boys cried, too. The stream of fresh young faces contorted with sobs was painful to watch.

They entered and left the church in a tight knot, each physically helping the other down the long aisle to seats before a bronze and beige casket. sprayed with yellow roses. “With the death of Leigh Bell part of each of us died, part of us as a community died,” said the Rev. Roy E. DeBrand, First Baptist’s pastor. The community had been a peaceful one, and it will be again, DeBrand said. But it won’t be the same, and it will be troubled again, because society and people are filled with troubles. He prayed for strength, and he prayed for peace, and he prayed for justice. “We pray that You lead to the arrest of the one who did this soon, that we all may rest easier.” As of Sunday evening that arrest remained elu- sive. A special, eight-member task force, composed of investigators from the Sumter Sheriff's Depart- ment, detectives of the Americus Police Depart- ment and agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, had made no arrest. The investigative team was awaiting final state crime laboratory reports, which Sheriff Randy How- ard said should be available early this week. Carlus Gay, an Americus businessman who along with Chamber of Commerce President David Peak is heading the effort to collect reward money said contributions are widespread. The funds are to pay for information leading to the arrest and con- viction of the person who sexually molested and killed Leigh Bell, then dumped her body in the Muckalee Creek off Twin Bridges Road, about five miles southwest of the city. Accounts have been opened at all Americus banks for donations, but Gay said it won't be known until sometime Monday exactly how big the bounty ae grown. At least $10,000 reportedly has been ed. People are worried and shocked and frustrated they can do so little to help in the manhunt, Gay said, ; “We want for whoever’s responsible to be caught and taken away,” Gay said “Everybody wants to do something, but we don’t want to get in the way. I’d shut my business down, if there was anything I could do.” ; Gay, a former state patrolman who owns an auction business now, belongs to the First Baptist Church along with the Bells, and his daughter was a classmate of Leigh Bell, an honor student, cheer- leader and classically active youngster. = Gay has visited with the Bell family since Leigh’s body was found Friday night, two days after, she disappeared, and he described them as “all to ieces.” “There’s not much talking,” he said. ‘You just sit there and cry with them and that’s all you can do.” People of Americus talk a lot now about the need for the death penalty, said Capt. Gordon Battle of the Americus Fire Department. There is fear, he said, but not the pervasive terror that wrapped the city of Columbus during the reign of the “stocking strangler,” who murdered elderly women in their homes. “Tt’s like when you pass an accident on the highway. You drive slow for a week or so,” Battle ’ People, he suggested, may restrict their activi- ties for a while, but they must return to normal lives. ’ A clerk at a local drug store said he hasn’t seen a social withdrawal in Americus, although the town is shocked and its people consumed with the tragedy of Leigh Bell. “They never thought it could happen here,” he said. “They don’t believe it can happen again.” Sunday evening the area around Americus High School — a middle class neighborhood surrounding several ball fields, the football stadium and public tennis courts — showed slight evidence this was the site where Leigh Bell last was seen. ; Leigh had left a church softball game there around 9 or 9:30 p.m., driving up Harrold Avenue where she ran out of gas. A school chum passed on a bicycle and the two girls reportedly pushed Leigh’s car out of the road, then Leigh declined the offer of a bike lift and began walking back to the softball field and her sister. ‘ That’s the last she was seen. It's difficult to imagine anyone being forcibly abducted on Harrold Avenue or the cross-street Glessner Street, the direction she probably was headed. The well-groomed yards are small, and pleasant houses, close together, line the established streets. There also must have been a goodly number of fans at the softball field or participating in other sports at the complex. Sunday, the softball fields were empty, the ten- nis courts were filled and a few joggers ran the track. But no one was walking the streets at 5 p.m. And a station wagon lettered “Georgia Public Safety Department” was parked near the corner of Harrold and Glessner. i 11, 1979 (continued) \f"

She also had the broadening ex- perience of a Fulbright Scholarship and was baptized in the fire of the early lunch-counter sit-ins during her first job as a staff person for the Nat-- ional Student Association. Curry was already committed to the cause. The atmosphere in Jackson and through- out Mississippi was such that Curry usually was introduced as somebody’s roommate or sister or a friend passing through town. She wasn’t often iden- tified as being on the AFSC payroll. “It was all very clandestine,”’ re- called Curry. “Jean Fairfax and | would meet in the Catholic Church in Jackson. She’d tell me what was going on in the black community and I'd tell her about the white side of town. We weren't even trying to hold pub- lic meetings with blacks and whites together. People doing that — like the Mississippi Council for Human Rela- tions — were still considered mavericks. But there were other things respectable white women could do just in the white community.” Curry recalled her introduction to the group of women Derian and Green had brought together. ‘‘The first time | went to Jackson, | remember it was a really fine luncheon at somebody’s house. Everybody was well dressed and very ladylike. All 1 could think of was that this could have been me if 1 had gone the traditional way of Agnes Scott College [where she grad- uated].

They organized an of- ficial group, calling themselves Missis- sippians for Public Education, and began, in the words of Curry, ‘‘giving the impression that we were a strong organization.”’ They put up billboards urging parents to ‘‘send your children to public schools.’’ They contacted ministers, businessmen, editors and other community leaders to help fos- ter a mood of moderation and respect for the law. They published a pamph- let, “A Time to Speak,’ and distrib- uted it all over the state. In the weeks before school opened in Jackson, Green and Curry passed it out door- to-door In the white neighborhoods with children who would be attend- ing integrated schools. They ran full- page newspaper ads basically outlining the choices: there could be either a peaceful opening or a violent closing of the schools in the fall. tt included a coupon to be returned by those wanting more information on how to achieve the former. From the ads and from word of mouth, the women found others willing to preach the need for rational, reasonable action. “In the spring and summer of '64, Connie and |! traveled aljf over the state, finding people. ...

Or har- assing SNCC workers, even killing some summer workers — Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman were the most famous. Occasional negative re- actions were inevitable, such as when the White Citizens’ Council would put Green’s phone number on its ‘‘dial the truth” hot line, a recording that told whom to call if you wanted to talk to one of the troublemakers. There were other personal pressures on Green. ‘‘l went through several stages with my parents. There were periods that I couldn’t go into their house. | expected it.

In Atlanta she worked for the Georgia Council on Human Relations, recruiting black children to integrate schools around the state, then joined the AFSC for a three-month assign- ment finding out what happened to black children (and their families) who desegregated Alabama _ schools. A brief stint with the Southern Re- gional Council followed, but Green shortly landed a permanent spot with the AFSC, and has been there ever since, At the age of 41, she still is trying to make schools comply with the laws, as director of the organization’s Southern Education Project, but now the battle includes other fronts; stop- ping sex discrimination is an important part of Green’s work, Right now she is doing it back in Jackson.0 Marcia Kunstel has been a news- paper reporter in the South for eight years and is currently a general assign- ment writer for the Atlanta Journal.

        "ocr_text": " In Selma, A Bridge Links Fras By Marcia Kunstel SELMA, Ala. — An uncomfortable feeling, something akin to guilt, at- taches to elegant dining in full view of’ the imposing steel presence of the Ed- mund Pettus Bridge. You can dine now on the riverfront porches of a new restaurant in an old warehouse that has long sat on the sloping bank of the Alabama River. It is part of the riverfront restora- tion, the new Selma fora New South. But you cannot escape the bridge and history there, not if you are eating. a crab-stuffed flounder or roast duck- ling on the two-tiered porches. Wrought-iron rails and gossamer ferns no better hide the symbol! of a people’s hatred than whirring ceiling fans dis- pel the heat of August. The river surges below; the bridge looms above, squared black lIetters blaring out its identity on the narrow sign up top. It is the same sign that civil rights marchers passed under 14 years ago, just before troops of state and county police, some mounted on horses and some bearing whips and clubs, viciously turned therm back to the city. Split heads in retreat spilled blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridzge. The restaurant is called The Cross- ing. Its name and it place are uninten- * tional reminders of that day in i965 written and spoken of so vividly that it is a memory for those who were not even there. The restaurant’s opening recently was marked by another crossing. Another group of marchers passed under the same sign, but these “‘civil rights’’ demonstrators, as their leader described them, cried, ‘‘White Power! White Power!’ as they crossed under guard of state and Iacal policemen. They wore white robes with peaked hoods. The Selma police chief, Fohn La- Porte explained the Ku Klux Klan’s in- tentions: *‘They’re trying to trace the route Martin Luther King took, to erase the memory,’’ he said. ‘‘Now, that’s silly.’? Chief LaPorte had asked the Selma City Council to grant the Klan a parade permit, whichit didona 43 vote split down racial lines — whites for, blacks against. He wanted to get the white supremacists in and out of the city quickly and without trouble, without creating a new na- tional memory. He succeeded. As for erasing memories, Bill Wik kinson’s Invisible Empire of the Ku Klux Kian only recalled the visions of 1965 that were ‘‘etched’’ on newsprint and burned into a nation’s conscience. The march ‘‘for white people’s civil rights’ pointed up how much the Klan and the country owed to the pioneers of New York Times op-ed page, August 25, 1979 phts movement. the Imperial Wizard One debt is the mass march itself,a tactic refined, made essentially safe and acceptible by activists of the ‘50s and ’60s. Their toll was bashed skulls, public scorn and threats that some- times turned into action, What have the survivors of Viola Liuzzo paid for the right to march, so that the Klan’s cost would be the nomi- nal fee of sunburmed faces and aching feet? They are safe now to make un- popular demands, secure with hoods as symbols instead of shields. What of the untald legal battles that defined modern civil liberties, setting precedents that the Klan is now trying to shape to its purposes? They must have howled when Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., then of the United States District Court, decreed that the state could not arbitrarily halt the 1965 march for voting rights. Now, the’ First the civil rights march of ’65, then the Klan’s in 779 name of that very judge, who did more to crack segregation than any other white person in Alabama, is invoked by the Klan. His decision, Kiansmen said on route to their peaceful confron- tation with the police, meant that the city of Montgomery could not stop the parody of 1965 for want of a parade permit. Even Doyle Fuller, the lawyer fight- ing for the right to march, working to . vindicate their defiance and expunge their arrests, because he believes that right should not be diminished by being controlled, is inherited from 1965. He would try to slip the Klans- men off the hook because he is a civil libertarian whose beliefs were forged in the social fires of the ’60s, when his parents opéned their home to the first Selma-to-Montgomery marchers. A final charge to the Klan’s account was a spontaneous and innocent ges- ture borrowed by some Klansmen. As such, it stood a plane above the calcu- lated exploitation of a movement, epitomized in the assurance to cross- burning zealots that, yes, they shall overcome. This debt accrued when po- licemen ended the march outside Montgomery and led the Klansmen, who had no parade permit, from the road to buses bound for jaii. Not bowed, they felt the flush of a right- eous exhilaration that rewards arrest for a cause. They silently raised bailed fists in the black-power salute. Erase the memory? No more than cana genteel restaurant in a restored riverfront blot out the steel symbol thatdwarfsacity. Marcia Kunstel ts a reporter for The Atlanta Journal. \f"

Mike Wall of the St. Simons fire rescue squad said some flooding was also reported in low-lying areas there. More island and coastal residents were expected to abandon mobile homes and inse- cure dwellings by Tuesday morning, as recom- mended by the civil defense officials. Traffic was reported bumper-to-bumper Monday along U.S. Highway 80, the beach road to Tybee Island. Labor Day tourists and resi- dents snaked across from unprotected coastal fringes to the safety of Savannah motels and the homes of friends and relatives. The 25-cent bridge toll on the Islands Ex- pressway was eliminated to hasten the traffic. Although the evacuation was voluntary — and many did choose to ride out the storm on islands — civil defense authorities insisted on removing about 200 elderly patients from three nursing homes on Tybee and St. Simons islands. They also arranged for Capt. Sam Stevens to chug one of the three vessels he normally uses for tourist cruises out to Daufuskie Is- land, S.C., to retrieve residents of the mostly poor, mostly black barrier island that has no bridge to the mainland. Only about 15 of the 150 or so residents accepted the offer. They carried satchels and small suitcases off the boat, and one young man with a knapsack held onto a banana and a quart of milk that he sipped on occasionally. “My wife is in Michigan, and she’s preg- nant. I wanted to make sure I get back to them,” said Sabra Slaughter just after The Waving Girl docked at the foot of Bull Street under gray clouds pierced with flashes of a brilliant white-and-pink sunset. Slaughter, who is doing research on the island for the summer, said some Daufuskie residents simply didn’t want to leave their homes and possessions. ‘‘Some of them said a hurricane is the force of God, and you can’t hide from God,” he said. The elderly patients from one nursing home on St. Simons were dispersed to Bruns- wick area nursing homes, and those from two facilities on Tybee Island were taken to safety by their relatives or quartered in makeshift lodgings at the Savannah Civic Center. September 4, 1979 The elderly people, many of them ill and .unable to walk unaided, were being bedded down on mattresses on the floor in the spa- cious, barren civic center meeting rooms around 8:30 p.m. Some groaned and cried. “Any time you have to move them, it’s bad,” said Terry Jackson, nursing director from Savannah Beach Nursing Home. “They get so used to their routine.” But she said the 135 patients evacuated from her institution and from the Oceanside Nursing Home seemed to be bearing up well under the strain, and some were even pleas- antly excited about the bustle. The American Red Cross established the civic center shelter, along with two others at local public schools that opened for islanders Monday night, and the five more that were ex- pected to service mainly residents of fragile mobile homes when the storm reached its worst pitch here Tuesday. Tuesday classes at public and parochial schools here were canceled. Wendell Brinson, civil defense area coor- dinator for 37 counties, estimated that most people left Cumberland, Sapelo and St. Cather- ines islands, that about 70 percent had evacu- ated Jekyll Island and only about 20 percent abandoned St. Simons. He said perhaps 4,000 people sought safer ground. Edward Fogarty, the Chatham County- Savannah civil defense director, said he recommended early evacuation of Tybee and Skidaway islands, mostly out of fear that the bridges would be inundated by the crashing waves and tidal surge that can accompany a Burien: “We especially wanted to get the old peo- ple off,” he said, in explaining the mid-day nursing home evacuation. ‘“‘What would happen if somebody had a heart attack or a spell and couldn’t get off?” With those evacuations squared away, emergency squads mostly played an uneasy waiting game throughout the end-of-summer holiday Monday, listening intently to weather broadcasts that might hint in which direction David would tilt the path of devastation that alreadw has killed at least 800. State, county and city police were on 36- hour standby alert. \f"

The eye of the storm danced over the Savannah area for about four hours Tuesday, and wind gusts of up to 90 miles an hour drove flooding sheets of rain across the city. By 6 am. Wednesday, David’s winds had dropped below hurricane force. The center of the disintegrating storm passed northeast of Columbia, S.C., during the morning. Skies over Savannah cleared slightly Wednesday morning and patches of blue were visible behind large grayish clouds hanging over the: city. Most of the city streets were passable, but some were still blocked with up to three feet of water. Residents leaving refugee centers ¥ found large ay limbs and smaller de-’ ; re 8 scattered around the city. By ly Wednesday, only half a dozen people remained of the 450 who had crowded into Shuman Junior High School for refuge. Gov.

At the island’s City Hall, assistant accountant Barbara Pelli said the electrici restored shortly after 8 a.m.,. other parts of the island were still without power. } “T think I would have been better to stay at home,” said Mrs. Pelli, who left the island about 3:30 p.m. Tuesday See SAVANNAH, 184 September 5, 1979 \f Savannah’s famed riverfront deserted, except for one hardy soul, Savannah Shotinued from 1A to weather the brunt of the storm with friends. “I was prepared.

I'm giad now I did.” Although residents in Savannah found damage widespread throughout the city and offshore islands, they were relieved nonetheless. David had left behind 1,000 dead and rmore than $1 billion in property damage in the Caribbean and Florida. In Georgia, injuries were surprisingly scarce, and no deaths directly attributa- ble to the hurricane had been reported by early Wednesday, although two stu- dents from France were swept out to sea when they went swimming near Bruns- wick several hours after the hurricane passed.

Spec. 4 Ralph Berry of New Straits- ville, Ohio, said he was familiar with storms in the Midwest, but he said, ‘‘this is the worst I’ve ever seen.” Jess Kicklighter of the National Weather Service at Savannah’s Travis Field airport said the worst winds lashed Tybee Island at speeds up to 90 mph.

Sixteen looting arrests had been reported during the first 24 hours after the storm. . Besides the thefts from stores with gap- ing holes where windows and roofs and walls used to be, electrical power was a primary concern throughout the coastal area. Jon Ryan, a civil defense coordinator for Alabama Power, Thursday estimated the earliest power resumption to be a day or two off, with other customers not having service for more than a week. \" Virtually all the power was cut off here by falling tree limbs and hurricane-force winds, and Ryan said repairs would be a multimillion-dollar job. Extra workers have been imported from other parts of Alabama, Georgia and other surrounding states. Power was knocked out in an estimated 466,000 homes and businesses along the resort stretch of the Gulf Coast. Alabama had 285,- 000 customers without electricity, Mississippi 131,000 and Florida 50,000. |. Regarding the looting, Prichard Mayor A. Jay Cooper called it “flat out of control” in his predominantly black town, and Mobile City Police Capt. Walter Milne said it was ex. tremely serious in the port city. ‘ Cooper said violent incidents had been re- ported in Prichard, which he described as in a general state of lawlessness since the hurri- cane ripped through town. Cooper said he directed his police to fire two warning shots and then to “shoot to kill.” ~ Milne said looters had fired on policemen and store owners in Mobile, which partly pted the civil defense order for a curfew. hg is concern is “people getting totally out o control and taking things in their own hands.” * “T wouldn't say it is untoward at all,” he estimating thefts would add several mil lion dollars to the hurricane price tag, “ Gov.

Counteroffensives being planned for several months have been intensified, and new initiatives have been taken, since five anti- Klan demonstrators were killed in Greensboro, NC., Nov. 3. eis In telephone and personal interviews this week, anti-Klan activists around the country voiced the following concerns about the rise and potential of radical right-wing activity in the nation: = © Blacks, Jews and other groups who are traditionally the targets of discrimination in- creasingly are becoming scapegoats and sub- jects of physica} attacks by whites disgruntled over troubles such aS worsening economic conditions and the Waning influence of the United States jn world affairs, = * Extremist activities are symptoms of a deeper nation} malaise, but the social condi- tions causing them are not being addressed, . ©The failyre of government officials to ~ speak out forcefully against extremism — a failure from the White House on down — has left a leadership vacuum, as calls to armed actions in the name of white supremacy go virtually unchallenged by those in seats of power. , ¢ There are increasing signs that law en- forcement agencies have been infiltrated by or at least are sympathetic to the right-wing groups. ; ¢ Failure to stop the spread of the “Klan + mentality” and its hostility toward minorities may result in more bloodshed. Many .anti-Klan. strategies are under development. : The widest-ranging counteroffensives ‘spring from a loose network of groups organ- ized around the August meeting of the South. a Christian Leadership Conference in Nor. olk, Va. “A lot of people are beginning to get very - concerned that this is not going to go away said Marilyn Clement, director of the Center - for Constitutional Rights in New Yo ; _ is in the network.

I would say it's just a beginning concern, but it's spreading all over the country,” Atlanta attorney Edward Augustine, who represents clients here who believe they were attacked by Klansmen, was at the Jackson meeting and is promoting the tactic of a suit to force dissolution of the Klan, te ie “The First Amendment doesn't protect spreading ideas about genocide, annihilation of races, things like that,” Augus- ‘ said. “We're talking about Greensboro, That’s speech for them, “Everybody in this country ought to say no to the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis.

Staff Writer TIFTON, Ga. — The country’s most celebrated union campaign faces an unheralded, but important test Thursday, when 700 workers at two J.P. Stevens plants here cast their ballots on union representation. Local attention has fixed more on high school football and bankrolling the holi- days than on the textile plants, one Squatting in the center of downtown, the other almost hidden in the chain of low- slung motels and fast-food emporiums lining the city’s outskirts. Regardless of the average citizen’s interest, the union election next week carries unusual weight. It may fall short of a crossroads, but the vote does repre- sent a significant step along the route labor has chosen for organizing the South. At issue is whether the step will be taken, or time simply marked. The Tifton election will be the third time since October that the Amalga- mated Clothing and Textile Workers Union has taken its Stevens’ campaign to the ballot box in an election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. The three elections are the first the union has called since 1975, although the effort has been active for 16 years to organize Stevens, the nation’s second big- gest textile company. It even has become the rallying-point for organized labor’s drive southward, under the assumption that victory over a tenacious resister like Stevens would crack a breach in southern textiles and even ease organizing in other industries. The union won the first two elections, at High Point, N.C., and Allendale, S.C., the latter by a three-vote margin. Both are being contested by Stevens, but both early victories carry less significance than the Tifton vote, since they were among small work forees with fewer than 120 voters at each place. “The Tifton election I think is an important one,” said Jim Buckley, staff representative for the United Steelwork- ers in Albany, who is especially inter- ested since he, too, organizes in south Georgia. “The mill people are an influen- tial group of people that need to be swayed if we're going to win in the South.” He called Tifton a “substantial test” because of the numbers involved. “Jt?ll be a benchmark as to whether they’re going to succeed in the immedi- ate future or whether it’s going to take a little longer. I have no doubts that they will succeed.” Buckley is familiar with the obstacles to winning union elections in the South, since his latest organizing project at Kelly Manufacturing in Tifton recently ended in a lopsided defeat, 153 to 34. Like the city of two faces — the weathered, downtown core and glittery new periphery — so is the resistance to unions here a combination of the tradi- tional, virulent southern attitude toward unions and the more sophisticated tech- niques lately adopted by management to combat them. “I think unions are terrible. They’re the ruin of our country,” said Mary Con- nell, a 15-year Stevens veteran, who said her opposition stems from early family teachings that unions are wrong, that they’re controlled by mobsters. “J just don’t like the violence, and their coming in and telling the company what to do when it’s the company’s money paying us.” She admitted there has been no vio lence attached to the textile workers union at Tifton, which has been organiz- ing off and on for at least five years. But Mrs. Connell did recall violent days in Tifton when a union went on strike and caused the closing of Armour Co. Actually the Armour strikes came in 1946 and 1948, 10 years before the company shut down, and the violence, a local business leader and history buff said, was limited to a few fistfights. On another level, the company has fought unionization partly by patting its workers on the back. A local newsman said Stevens re- cently has run advertisements praising its workers and announcing employee awards, and the company this summer gave Tifton employees a 10 percent pay increase. That was more than the work- ers got at most Stevens’ plants. The company has refrained from the more obvious anti-union tactics em- ployed in past years — like firing union su — which the labor board and the federal courts repeatedly found in violation of labor law. One judge com- pared the company’s actions to Sher- man’s march through Atlanta. Harold Addis, director of industrial relations for Stevens, was in town last week meeting with workers on all three shifts, he said, to amswer questions and set straight the “distortions” put forth by union sympathizers. “What we’re presenting is the fact of where (Tifton workers) stand compared to the industry ... and the record the union has at J.P. Stevens,” Addis said. The company’s key issue is the situa- tion at Roanoke Rapids, N.C., where Stevens workers gave ACTWU victory in 1973, but still don’t have a contract. This summer the company announced the workers there would get no further raises or benefit improvements until a contract is signed, while in the past those workers got the same compensa- tion changes as others in the company. Addis said the withdrawal of an &.5 percent wage increase offer was not a punitive action against the Roanoke Rapids workers, but was done “to get their attention to quit dragging their feet” on contract bargaining. The company presentation, workers said, includes charts showing exactly bow much Roanoke Rapids employees have lost since July, by not having the Wage increase. They would have gotten that money had it not been for the union, the company officials say. The lesson is clear. ACTWU area director Anthony Her- man calls that tactic “blackmailing” the Roanoke Rapids workers “to chill organ- izing in other places.” Herman said the company has stalled negotiations. During one period, Stevens was found to be bargaining in bad faith, a violation of labor law. While Addis and anti-union workers said the union is promising the moon and the stars to get workers’ votes, the ACTWU proponents and literature present a different story. “It would take organizing at more plants before we can get what we really want,” said Donald Ray Shoup, who has worked at Stevens for nearly 20 years and backed the union from the start. Most union pamphiets declare signifi- cant changes won’t come until the textile industry is as organized as, say, the auto and steel industries. December 16, 1979 \f"
