        "ocr_text": "PLO Can’t Agree on Whether to Form Palestinian State on West Bank, Gaza By Joseph Albright And Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has interrupted critical meetings in Tu- nisia, unable to reach consensus on establishing an independent Pales- tinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, PLO offi- cials said Tuesday. Reached by telephone in Tunis, a spokesman for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said, “It is not clear that we are going to form a provi- sional government or a government- in-exile, or that we will form any- thing.” A new round of consultations was under way between Arafat lieu- tenants and their diplomatic back- ers in Arab capitals, with the aim of announcing by this weekend the PLO’s next moves to capitalize on West Bank unrest. But the likeli- hood of some bold PLO policy re- versal, such as declaring unequivo- cal willingness to recognize Israel, appeared to have receded. At the end of a three-day ses- sion in Tunis of the PLO executive committee, spgkesman Ahmed Abd- ul Rachman said it now is “less ur- gent” for the PLO to reach binding decisions than it was when the ex- ecutive committee last met 10 days ago in Baghdad, Iraq. He confirmed that Mr. Arafat plans to address a meeting of Euro- pean Parliament members Sept. 13 in France. But he added that there would not be time before that speech for a decision by the PLO’s legislature-in-exile, the 450-member Palestine National Council. Any ma- jor changes in the PLO’s policies would require the council’s en- dorsement. A spokesman for PLO leader Yasser Arafat (above) said it is unclear ‘we will form anything.’ Asked what had diminished the urgency of the situation, Mr. Abdul Rachman said, “We need time for consultations, for discussions, for analyzing the whole situation. And don’t forget that there are the American elections and the Israeli elections” in November. The PLO has come under in- creasing pressure to act since July .31, when Jordan’s King Hussein an- nounced he would end Jordan’s le- gal and administrative links to the West Bank and Gaza and follow the PLO’s lead. One American expert on the Middle East, Shireen Hunter of the Center for Strategic and Interna- tional Studies, said Tuesday, “If the PLO doesn’t take up the challenge, the result will be the West Bankers and the Arab countries saying that the PLO cannot do anything, and they will go back to Hussein.” Philip Mattar, director of the In- stitute for Palestine Studies and a leading Palestinian-American schol- ar, said the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza provides an opening that should not be missed. “Most - Palestinians, at least in the West, are very hopeful that the PLO would take the opportunity ... to declare a provisional government and express its willingness for mu- tual recognition with Israel,’ he said. Such a step, he added, might reopen the peace process after the U.S. election. On Tuesday, the underground leadership of the uprising added to the pressure on the PLO, circulat- ing a leaflet urging the Palestine National Council to “adopt a com- prehensive and clear political pro- gram which will gain widespread international support for the na- tional rights of our people,” accord- ing to a report from Jerusalem by United Press International. Most experts were skeptical that the PLO, an umbrella organization embracing Mr. Arafat’s mainstream Palestinians as well as Syrian- backed hard-liners, could take ad- vantage of the moment presented them. Radical factions in Damascus, Syria, already have threatened to move against any Palestinians who approach a compromise with Israel. “The question is whether they [the PLO] consider this an historical opportunity right now, which I think it is,’ said Herbert Kelman of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University. “A government- in-exile has been discussed for a long time, but the PLO has rejected it. It would have meant taking some of the responsibilities of a state, in- cluding recognizing Israel. That continues to be controversial. But they may have to do it now.” Atlanta Constitution - August 24, 1988 \f"

Lift up your Big Mac at yd McDonald's, and right there, on your tray liner, is a voter registration form. Fill it out, mail it in, and — poof! — you're registered. For generations, scholars have argued the merits of simplified registration and whether it would beef up voter rolls. In 1977, the state of Ohio decided to find out. Ohio dramatically eased its registration requirements. It now allows mail-in regis- tration, has liberal policies on volunteer registrars and permits registration at most state offices. Private groups and businesses print registration forms, with state approv- al, and send them out in newsletters or with their bills. Since the law was changed, the registra- tion percentage has shot up in Ohio, as has the voting percentage. ' “Before, you had to make a specific effort to register,” said Kay Stephens, elections director in Dayton. “Now you go to your bank, they hand you a (registration) card.

In 1976, the turnout of voting-age population was about 55 percent, and in 1984 it was 58 percent. The number of voters increased from 4.2 million to almost 4.7 million, and the ranking improved from 28th to 15th. A random, nationwide survey by which polled including respondents in Florida, found that most Americans want a simpler voter-registration system. e Cox voter-registration poll found: ™ Only 17 percent are satisfied with current registration systems.

By far the most popular idea was to allow automatic registration when applying for a new or renewed driver's license. Some 67 percent of those surveyed ~ backed the plan, currently under discussion in Congress. Under the plan, the applicant - would have the option of not * registering to vote, but he would - not have to fill out a separate application if he wanted to regis- ’ ter. Fifty percent of those polled _ liked the idea of automatic regis- . tration at offices where ou sign as food ps. Registration by mail was fa- up for public benefits, suc . stamps vored by 55 percent, while 49 percent approved of registration at the polls on election day. e poll clearly supports the theory that revised registration laws will address the paradox of having millions of citizens in the world’s pre-eminent democracy not bothering to exercise their most fundamental right. But simplified registration is not a universally accepted goal. A number of people support the notion that voting is at least as much a responsibility as a right, and that simplifying the process only cheapens it. “We have made it so easy to vote compared to 25 years ago, and the result is obvious,” said Paul Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Re- search and Education Foundation, referring to the nationwide decline in voter turnout. “Voting used to be very special and a privilege, and it was treated as such.” Weyrich said non-voters feel that the system does not reflect their viewpoints, so getting them registered will not get them into the voting booth. State or federal legal reforms will not relieve the more insidious and most common causes of non-voting — they won’t cure alienation or boredom, for exam- ple — but advocates of legislative change say it can give more Americans a better chance to take part in the system. “The United States had the highest rate of voting before registration laws were enacted,” d Linda Davidoff, director of Human SERVE, a liberal group in New York that promotes simpli- fied registration. “The idea that you deliberately create a system of barriers to voting is just repugnant, and in fact, that’s just what the registra- tion system is.” O OTHER WESTERN indus- trial democracy has a regis- tration process as cumber- some as those that exist in most U.S. states. The voter in rnore than a dozen nations abroad need do nothing more than stay alive until he reaches the legal voting age. The government does the rest. The same Western democracies boast voting turnout rates 20 to 40 Peureee points higher than the nited States rate, which was 53 percent of the voting-age popula- tion in the last presidential elec- tion. In the last mid-term elec- tions, in 1986, Americans scored a lowly 36 percent turnout. What are the legal differences that Americans find to be obsta- cles to becoming — or remaining — voters? In Louisiana, for example, there Miami News - October 2, 1988 >  America's non-voters How to register U.S. citizens who will be at least 18 years old by election day can reg- ister to vote in the Nov. & general election in Flori- da until 5 p.m. Saturday.

For locations and more infor- mation, call 375-4600. The Miami News is one official registrar’s office per parish, or county, and that’s the only place to register to vote. Even in ew Orleans, there’s only one place to register — and it’s open only from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays. Voter-registration drives by volunteer groups are not permitted in Louisiana, nor are routine sign-ups at libraries or other government offices. In Illinois, registrars have to fill out four pieces of paper, one in triplicate, for each citizen applyin to register. That discourages vol- unteer registrars from groups such as the League of Women Voters because they become buried in Paper as they try to sign up_ workers at factory gates or shop- Pers at the mall. The biggest obstruction is the registration deadline, which in most states cuts off registration 28 to 30 days before an election. That eliminates a huge number of potential voters who become in- terested in a race only when it heats up down the stretch. “A lot of people get excited the last days of the election, and they aren’t registered,” said the Rev. Andrew ernandez, resident of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. Another huge group of non-vot- ers comes from the one-third of Americans who move every two years. If they fail to re-register, even if they have just moved across town, they cannot legally vote in the next election. In the Cox poll, 26 reent of the people not registered to vote at their current address said it was because they had recently moved.

When Republican Benjamin Harrison beat Democrat Glover Cleveland in 1888, four out of five eligible Americans voted despite ru- { dimentary communications, a high | school dropout rate of 95 percent, | and a transportation system so primitive that a voter might have to ride 30 miles on horseback to reach a polling site. Now most of us have graduated from high school and more than ever go on to college. We enjoy in- stant communications from around the world, and we can get to our voting booths in minutes. Yet, de- spite the progress, almost half of us do not vote. In the last presidential election, 53.5 percent of the eligible voters did so. The erosion started a century ago, with new laws designed to keep people out of the electorate. Throughout the past decades our voting pattern has been erratic. To- day it is our attitudes, more than our laws, that keep us away from the polls. The structural blockades began rising in the late 19th century, when populism and socialism percolated in the body politic. To the white, prosperous, established middle class, restricting the franchise seemed the best way to cauterize society against radicalism. The mid- dle class loved democracy so much that it decided to keep it for itself. The 15th Amendment had opened the voting booth to blacks in 1870. Yet, throughout the South, John F, Kennedy left) and Richard M. Nixon debate in the presi dential campaign of 1960, with moderator Howard K, Smith in state legislatures repeatedly schemed to discourage blacks and poor whites from voting, all without ostensibly violating the 15th Amend- ment. ‘For example, Georgia already had begun the trend in 1877 by mak-, ing the poll tax mandatory. Missis- sippi devised the literacy test in 1891. By the late 1890s, literacy tests and poll taxes had spread across the old Confederacy. Also by the 1890s, big Northern states had enacted personal regis- tration laws that for the first time required people to sign up to vote before election day. Billed as elec- toral reforms to prevent vote fraud, these complicated registration laws a: More People Can, But Fewer Will the electorate. The number of po- tential voters doubled overnight.

The flavor of politics was chang- ing, too. Political machines had en- gendered party loyalty and deliv- ered the vote. But they spawned corruption along with votes, and people began demanding reform that disabled most of the powerful machines. By 1912, turnout across the na- tion fell below 60 percent for the first time in three-quarters of a cen- tury. In the South, only 28 percent of white and black men voted, In 1920, the suffragist crusade succeeded in pushing through the 19th Amendment, adding women to fect of the 19th Amendment was to drive down the national turnout rate from 62 percent of eligible citi- zens in 1916 to 49 percent in 1920. The great debate over Prohibi- tion brought millions of non-voters back to the polls in 1928, and the Depression brought another surge of voting in the 1930s. The New Deal coalition derived its electoral magic in large part from Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ability to attract working-class voters who formerly had sat out elections. ' Despite restrictive poll taxes and registration laws, Americans voted in relatively large numbers from Prohibition through the Eisen- hower years. By the 1950s, nearly as many women as men voted. In the 1960 election between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, the issue of Mr. Kennedy's Catholicism helped drive the turn- out up to 63.1 percent, the highest in an election in which both men and women voted, Since the Kennedy-Nixon race, we have gone through another peri- od of mass disfranchisement, this one self-induced. Instead of nearly two-thirds of the electorate voting, barely half turned out in 1980 and 1984. The drop continues despite re- laxed laws making it easier to regis- ter and to vote. This year, as the Atlanta Jour- nal-Constitution and Cox Newspa- pers poll indicates, millions of adults have decided for a complex set of reasons that the investment in voting will exceed the return.

Iraq’s undersecretary of foreign affairs, Nizar Hamdoon, said in an interview that final enactment. of a sanctions bill could lead to the “col- lapse” of trade relations between the two countries and an increase in “misunderstandings” on foreign policy issues such as the Arab-Is- raeli question. “If the Americans are looking forward in a future administration to having a role to play in the Mid- dle East peace process, then such things [as the sanctions legislation] are not going to serve their cause,” Mr. Hamdoon said. His remarks coincided with a salvo of anti-sanctions editorials Sunday in newspapers controlled by the Iraqi government. One, in The Revolution, said actions by Con- gress put diplomatic relations be- tween Washington and Baghdad, which were elevated to ambassado- rial level in 1984, ‘on the crossroads.” Iraq is the ninth-largest foreign market for American agricultural products and the second-largest ex- port market for U.S. rice. It has the world’s second-largest proven oil reserves and one of the most potent armies in the Middle East. Mr. Hamdoon, like other Iraqi officials, rejected as untrue and un- proven all American allegations of Iraqi use of chemical weapons to clear dissident Kurdish guerrillas out of mountain hideouts in north- ern Iraq in late August. The United States has not pub- licly documented its allegations, which reportedly are based in part on U.S. intelligence intercepts of conversations between Iraqi pilots concerning the use of gas. The Senate passed a sweeping sanctions bill Sept. 9, only a day af- ter a State Department spokesman said the U.S. “is convinced” Iraq used chemical weapons against the Kurds, a dissident ethnic minority that at various times has accepted arms and aid from the United States, the Soviet Union, Israel, Iran and Syria. The House of Representatives followed suit three days later, pass- ing by 388 to 18 a more narrowly worded bill that would grant the .S. president power to choose ap-,. propriate penalties. With Congress due to adjourn this week, Mr. Hamdoon said he had received word from Washington that the final House-Senate compro- mise language might exclude U.S. farm products from the list of ex- portsesubject to possible cutoff. “It’s a very selfish standpoint, and it has nothing to do with the principles of the bill,’’ said Mr. Hamdoon, a former Iraqi ambassa- dor in Washington. “And Iraq is not going to accept it.” He said that if the United States takes steps to persuade world lend- ing institutions to deny credits to Iraq — as required by the Senate- passed bill — then Iraq would stop buying American farm produce even if the U.S. agricultural credits were to remain available. “We can find alternative com- modities available on the world market and, unfortunately, this whole economic relationship may collapse,” he said. Iraq, which ran up more than $50 billion in international debts in fighting its war with Iran, bought $1.2 billion worth of U.S. farm com- modities last fiscal year under a U.S. export financing program, Mr. Hamdoon said. Diplomats said that because the U.S. program involves guarantees instead of actual loans, Iraq has very little debt outstanding to American institutions. Atlanta Constitution - October 10, 1988 \f"

MARK HEMPHIL) ‘Piaf Artet By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service , CAIRO, Egypt — One of the first decisions awaiting the next n president will be a call Egyptian President Hosni Mu- for another high-priority Middle East peace initiative. “By establishing a new peace process, you will without doubt réinforce the positions of the mod- erates -- in Israel, among the Pal- estinians and throughout the Arab world,” said Boutros Boutros- Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs. “We, the moder- ates, are on the defensive,” The withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Sinai ula in 1982 was the last “victory for nego- tiation” in the Arab-Israeli con- flict, Boutros-Ghali said. Israel had oceupied the Sinai since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. “In recent years,” he said, “the radicals are showing people that their approach is the right one. From Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran to the Moslem Brotherhood, we have radicals saying there can be no coexistence; we have to prepare for a new confrontation.” In many other parts of the world, wars are ending or going into remission — in Angola, Kam- puchea, Afghanistan, and even along the Iran-Iraq and Chad-Libya borders. - But as Boutros-Ghali’s remarks indicate, conflicts remain danger- ously unresolved and ready to ger- minate into new crises for the next American president in the central Middle East triangle between the Nile, the Persian Gulf and the Med- iterranean. Some conflicts that could grow into crises are cropping up already. They include the unexpected resil- ience of the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territories, the collapse of the central government inLebanon, the slow rise of Islamic fubdamentalism in Egypt and else- where, and the acquisition of mod- ern surface-to-surface missiles by Israel, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Throughout this strategic land- scape, Egypt and Israel stand out as Washington's only allies. One measure of the U.S. stake in the two countries is that they share roughly 40 percent of all American foreign aid — $8 billion in the next fiscal year for Israel and $2.3 billion for Egypt. Like two sullen gladiators, Egypt and Israe] remain at peace with each other while arming themselves to the teeth. Each coun- try devotes more than half of its share of US. aid to the military, Palm Beach Post - October 10, 1988 >  Egypt determined and each has arms factories to build weapons the United States doesn’t supply. On both sides of their demilita- rized Sinai border, some believe that the 1979 Camp David peace treaty cannot last forever. Field Marshal Mohammad Abd- el Ghani al Gamassi, once defense minister to the late Egyptian lead- er Anwar Sadat, was quoted in an Opposition newspaper this month as saying that the 1973 war would not be “the last one between Egypt and Israel.” Eventually, Gamassi was quoted as saying, the Palestinian question would have to be “clinched by military means.” For his part, Mubarak appears solidly committed to the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli treaty. Without having to reject the treaty, Mu- barak already has achieved his pri- mary diplomatic objective of end- ing Egypt’s post-Camp David isolation within the Arab world. Only Syria, Lebanon, Libya and Algeria refuse to restore full rela- tions with Egypt. Mubarak’s adherence to the peace treaty could come under ex- treme strain if Israel embarrasses Mubarak by dragging its heels on the boundary dispute over the Red Sea resort of Taba. _An arbitration panel Sept. 29 generally accepted the Egyptian claim to the 250-acre p but left unsettled whether Israel must transfer every inch of Taba back to Egyptian ownership. Mubarak, in an Oct. 5 speech to the nation, expressed “joy” at the impending return of Taba. Without any caveats, he cited the Taba case as proof that “rights could be re- covered by lawful channels under international treaties.” Mubarak gave the public no hint that all of Taba might not be handed back to Egypt within the 21-day implementation period ied in the arbitrators’ deci- sion. Mubarak is preparing to redou- ble his efforts to stimulate another round of talks on the Palestinian issue. For tactical reasons, he has urged the Palestine Liberation Or- ganization to delay any major poli- _ ey decision until after the elections in Israel Nov. 1 and the United ’ States Nov. 8. t is determined to push for a new Middle East peace process even if Israel’s elections produce a hard-line Likud party government pledged to continue Israeli sover- eignty over the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip. to ‘ii An in clue pi. Bou hali remarked that would ulti- mately like to see the Palestinian question resolved along the lines of the economic union of the Benelux countries of Belgium, the Nether- lands and Luxembourg. Retired Egyptian diplomat Tahseen Basheer elaborated on the Benelux idea. “The aim,” as Ba- sheer said, “is to have a Palestinian Luxembourg, with a Jorda- nian Belgium, and the two would be economically coordinated with an Israeli Holland.” Mubarak’s eagerness to broker a new Israel-Palestinian peace pro- derives in part from wide- spread even guilt, over almost daily accounts of Palestin- ians with slingshots standing up to Israeli bullets. In addition, Mubarak needs all the foreign-policy successes he can get to offset Egypt's mounting in- ternal troubles. Like most Middle East nations, Egypt is in a deep recession, pri- marily as a delayed result of the 1986 collapse of oil prices. Last year, after piling up an estimated $40 billion in foreign debts, Egypt was forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for an $8 billion bailout. The IMF agreed to reschedule Egyptian debts, but only after Egypt edged to devalue its and phase out food and other subsidies. For Egypt, renewing the peace process is important whatever the outcome, U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner said. “Egyptians tend to believe that many or most prob- lems don’t have solutions,” Wisner said. “The peace process to them is the art of managing explosive problems.” Palm Beach Post - October 10, 1988 (Continued) \f"

In one house, a middle-aged woman has sewn thousands of sequins into the figure of a ship flying the Palestinian national flag. The oldest daughter is asked: Are you Jordanian? » “No. Not Jordanian. I live in this country in this time only. But I want to go to my country.” Her country is Palestine, says the 18-year-old, and she knows it is wonderful by the words of her mother and grandparents. These are among the people King Hussein recently declared to be not just Jordanians but “an integral part of Jor- dan.” They are among an estimated 1.3 million Palestinians in Jordan, refugees from the 1948 Arab war with Israel and in a second wave from the 1967 war when Jordan lost the West Bank. — bling questions arise as to how they will fit into King Hussein's new drive to redefine Jordan’s role since he aban- doned the front-line struggle to free the Israeli-occupied territories and cut West Bank ties lingering from 1967. Many wealthier, educated Palestin- ians in commercial life have meshed closely into the social fabric of the coun- But some remain as guests only, espe- cially among the 250,000 in refugee camps. There is reason to worry about Jordan: bad economic times, signs of newly restrictive political condi- tions and a population including both Palestinians saddened by dis- engagement and indigenous East Jordanians who applaud the with- drawal from draining West Bank commitments. ‘instability and confusion’ The regime admits to some con- cern. “The bad news is yes, there is instability and confusion,” said Crown Prince Hassan Bin Talal, brother and chief adviser to the king. “The good news is it has given ‘us a chance to sit down and have in- ‘house debate of dimensions which were not possible in the past.” Prince Hassan, an involved monarch-in-waiting, publicly calls for pluralism and dialogue so the . people can help unravel the knot of troubles clenching his country. But this government permits only limited and controlled dia- logue, especially since the unset- tling July 31 disengagement. Not only Palestinians were shocked when the government re- ‘tired the boards of directors of the ‘three privately owned. Arabic-lan- guage newspapers and handpicked their replacements. One pro-government East Jor- danian lamented the move as the nationalization of the press. Stricter security measures Security controls, always strong, are described as even tighter now. One recent visitor to the Baq’a camp was accompanied every- where by two plainclothes security guards, until invited into a refugee home for tea. Of more than a dozen Palestinians interviewed in Am- man, including upper middle class professionals, all but two said they were afraid to have their names published. Political dialogue also was muffled this month by a royal de- cree indefinitely postponing parlia- mentary elections scheduled for later this year — the first general elections since 1967. The government said the elec- tion law must be revised because half the lower house of Parliament has come from the West Bank, which will not be represented after the disengagement.

HEAD OF STATE: King Hussein | BRIEF HISTORY: Jordanian history begins about 2,000 B.C., when Semitic tribes settled around the Jordan River in an area called Canaan. The land was subsequently conquered or invaded by Hittites, Egyptians, Israelites, Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, Arab Moslems, Christian Crusaders, Mameluks, Turks and the British. After World War !, a U.N. mandate awarded the area to Britain. In 1922, the British divided the mandate into Palestine and Transjordan. An independent kingdom was proclaimed in 1946. Jordan joined other Arab states in opposing the creation of Israel and took control of the West Bank and old Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. As a result of the 1967 war with Israel, Jordan lost possession of these territories. Several months ago, King Hussein renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank. Jordan enjoys close ties with the United States, which provides the country with substantial economic and military Kamel Abu Jaber, a professor and former minister of economics, said the king also was waiting for the dust to settle on the American and Israeli elections, on the actions of the PLO and on the progress of the peace process. “I think the Jordanian regime still thinks in terms of possible reconciliation with the PLO,” he said, which ultimately could mean re-linking with the West Bank. Fahed Fanek, a passionate Jor- danian nationalist and an outspo- ken economist, disagrees. He said the break was “final and irrevers- ible” and grew in part from the ood of East Jordanians. fe They were about to look for leadership of their own. They felt the king was not representing them,” said Fanek, Palestinians integrated into the economy will stay in Jordan, he suggested, while the camp dwellers may not. “If there is a state, for sure they will go back.” Some others worry about what will happen in the long term if there is not a Palestinian state. The Jordanian economy is re- verberating from “oil shocks” in the Persian Gulf, with reduced worker remittances and a nar- rowed market for Jordanian goods and services. It suffers, too, from cutbacks of more than half a billion dollars a year in direct aid from other Arab nations. A study this spring by the US. Embassy in Amman reported the official unemployment rate at 8 percent but cited unofficial esti- mates up to 20 percent. Palm Beach Post October 15, 1988 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Arafat, Hussein heal rift Leaders discuss Israeli election | By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL see Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service 5. JERUSALEM — Jordan’s King Hussein and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser ‘Arafat met in Jordan Saturday ina surprise reconciliation gesture that appeared timed to demonstrate Palestinian moderation as the Is- raeli election enters its critical final stage. Joining them at talks in the port city of Aqaba was Egypt’s Presi- dent Hosni Mubarak, who has been using his diplomatic muscle to end a two-year rift between Jordan and the PLO. Their meeting seemed designed to strengthen the electoral chances of Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres’ Labor Party, the less hawk- ish of the two main parties. The Israeli election is Nov. 1. Forty-eight hours earlier, Hus- sein dropped another bomblet into the Israeli campaign by appearing on ABC television’s Nightline and calling Peres’ peace plans ‘‘encour- aging.’’ Hussein said the policies of the Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the Likud Party would be ‘‘abso- lute disaster’’ if carried out. Today, Peres is due to face Shamir in the only televised debate of the Israeli campaign. A senior Egyptian official, ac- knowledging the Arab effort to in- fluence Israeli elections, said, ‘“We want the Israeli voter, whether Arab or Jew, to understand where his specific interest lies.”’ Osama Baz, head of Mubarak’s office for foreign affairs, said: ‘‘Let him know when he casts his vote that there is an Arab partner ready for negotiations. The voter faces the issue of war and peace. If he wants peace, the Arab side is ready.”’ ae No communique was issued on the meeting in Jordan by nightfall Saturday. That led to speculation that Jordan and the PLO had gone beyond a simple symbolic meeting. Jordan Radio simply said the three Arab leaders met to discuss Palestinian problems. Egyptian foreign ministry sources were quoted earlier as say- ing Mubarak, Hussein and Arafat would discuss coordination be- tween Jordan and the PLO follow- ing Jordan’s July 31 decision to cut legal and administrative ties with the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which belonged to Jordan until Is- rael conquered it in the 1967 war. Arafat taking new tack Beyond its impact on the Nov. 1 election, the Hussein-Arafat meet- ing appeared to signal a new tack in Arafat’s search for an opening for the PLO at future peace talks on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In August and September, the PLO’s executive committee leaned toward winning a place at the peace table by announcing willing- ness to recognize Israel and re- nounce terrorism. The PLO’s inner leadership considered declaring a government-in-exile and an inde- pendent Palestinian state. But Arafat and other propo- nents of this strategy failed to win a consensus among PLO factions and Arab states surrounding Israel. As a result, a meeting of the PLO’s parliament-in-exile, the Pal- estine National Congress, had to be delayed a half-dozen times. It is now set to meet in Algiers Nov. 12. But according to the latest an- nouncement by a PLO spokesman in Tunis, plans for dramatic an- nouncements, including an inde- pendent state, have been dropped. Instead, Arafat seems to have taken Egyptian advice to seek in- ternational acceptance by first re- building the PLO’s fractured ties with Jordan. Egyptian diplomats, along with those of the Soviet Union, reported- ly pressed Arafat to work out a confederation between Jordan and an “independent” Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In the Egyptian view, a confedera- tion would be more palatable to the United States and to many in Israel than a totally independent Pales- tinian state. In 1985, Arafat and Hussein reached an accord on a joint Jorda- nian-Palestinian approach to Mid- dle East peace talks, but the deal collapsed amid recriminations in 1986. Saturday’s Hussein-Arafat meeting came less than 48 hours after Hussein told an American television interviewer that he was ready to resume representing the Palestinians, as part of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian peace dele- gation, “if the Palestinians seek it and ask us categorically.” This marked a shift of emphasis by Hussein, who announced July 31 that he was leaving the West Bank and all its problems to be resolved by the PLO. 12 wounded in Israel Meanwhile, in Israel Saturday troops shot and wounded 12 Pales- tinians in scattered clashes in the occupied territories, hospital offi- cials said. The army said a soldier was injured when he was struck in the head by a rock. Also Saturday, Lt. Moti Shtaier died of wourds suffered Wednesday when a suicide car bomb exploded in southern Lebanon, the army said. His death raised the number of Israeli troops killed in the explo- sion to eight. The bombing prompted Israeli air raids over southern Lebanon Friday that killed 21 and injured 34. Palm Beach Post - October 23, 1988 \f"

To the east of the Area of Sepa- ration maintained by a United Na- tions peacekeeping force, Syrians keep surveillance from their high- est point, Alpha position. Atop Tel Abu Nada across the border, Israeli soldiers watch and listen from inside a complex of concrete bunkers sprouting high- tech towers and electronic dishes. Each side suspects the other is preparing to shatter the quiet reigning over the Golan Heights since a disengagement was agreed to in 1974. _ These mutual suspicions feed on each other. They are nourished by troubling domestic conditions and unsettling external relations in both countries, which could lead either into daring, dangerous moves. If the next American president hopes to pursue peace in this re- gion, he first may have to concen- trate on preventing war. “There is much talk of Israel launching an attack because of Is- raeli internal difficulties — her economic troubles, the uprising,” Nasser Qaddour, Syria’s minister of state for foreign affairs, said. “It is the right of Syria to boost her defensive capability, to defend and protect herself.” Palm Beach Post October 27, ahs] sts] On the other side, Israelis have briefed foreign visitors and jour- nalists in recent months on intelli- gence findings they say show threatening new Syrian develop- ments — from offensive military maneuvers to renewed Soviet arms supplies. Moshe Ma’oz, a scholar and ex- pert on Syria at the Hebrew Uni- versity in Jerusalem, recently de- scribed what he called the Israeli military’s “blitzkrieg” theory: Syr- ia mounts a limited attack in the Golan Heights near the Syrian bor- der, counting on international in- tervention to stop the fighting and engage the two sides in negotia- tions which would regain for Syria the Golan territory it lost to Israel in the 1967 war.

In 1920, French forces occup- pied the newly created state of Syria under a League of Nations mandate. A republic was _ pro- claimed in 1941. In 1948, Syria joined other Arab states opposing the creation of Israel. A 1954 coup brought socialist 10.9 million over government tactics to contain the uprising. And the disturbances have com- manded the attention of Israel's regular military troops, which nor- mally would be tending to defense from external threats. But it is Syria that long has been the most unconventional player in Middle East politics under the shrewd guidance of President Ha- fez Assad. Today, as one Western diplomat described it, Assad has been pushed into a corner. Especially troubling to Syria is the prospect that the majority of the Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion is poised to embark on a new, more moderate approach toward Israel to achieve Palestinian state- hood in the West Bank and Gaza. No one but Syria and the few Palestinian radical factions it sup- rts talks much about a compre- ensive ce to regain all the Arab land now held by Israel. No one else is talking about getting the Golan back for Syria. Aid from Iraq To his east, Assad just suffered a setback to his ambitions for re- _ He was blocked largely by Iraq, which Syrian officials say chan- nelled arms and money to Leba- nese ee who then opposed ne n solution. and Arab nationalist elements to power. In 1958, Syria joined with Egypt to create the United Arab Republic, but the union was dis- solved after a 1961 coup. Aftera series of coups, the Arab Socialist Resurrection Party took power in 1963. - The Golan Heights, a militarily strategic territory, was occupied ‘and later annexed by Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. In 1973, Syria joined Egypt in at- tacking Israel and again was de- feated. Syrian and Israeli forces in Lebanon clashed in 1982, but a full-scale war was averted. Syria’s rejection of the Camp David accords, support for inter- national terrorism and close ties with the Soviet Union led the U.S. Congress to prohibit aid to Syria in 1983. With Iraq freed by the gulf war cease-fire to get back at Syria, one foreign analyst speculated Iraq might go beyond its Lebanon gam- bit by supplying a new jolt of aid to ie cpne: Alliance for the Liber- ation of Syria, a Syrian expatriate group in Baghdad which is believed to funnel arms to dissidents inside Syria. Internally, Syria’s economy has suffered several devastating years with inflation ranging toward 100 percent annually, imports more than double exports, and a billion- dollar-a-year black market, ac- cording to the 1988 economic sur- vey by the American Embassy in Damascus. Meeting Israel head-on. Yet Minister of Economics Mo- hammad Imadi was optimistic in an interview that Syria is turning its economy around. The World Bank has agreed to restructure Syria’s debt, on which the country is $130 million in arrears, and: by early next year Syria should be a net exporter of oil, he said. — But, Imadi admitted, the big- gest drain on the budget — defense — still stands at more than: 50 percent of spendin, a “We have to build a defense system able to cope with the Israe- lis in the south,” he said. That build-up is one of the things worrying Israelis, who have watched Syria approach parity with their own mighty arsenal.: Jane’s Defense Weekly has_es- timated Syria holds 650 combat aircraft as well as long-range sur- face-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles. Western sources in the country say they are certain Syria produces chemical weapons. ~ William Quandt, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is,one of several analysts to predict that Israel would pull the trigger first under two conditions: if it were convinced the Syrians ‘were mov- ing toward a serious first-strike capability,” or were behind a ma- ad es incident directed, at ael. } \f"

In mid-September, Iraq's 51-year-old civilian lead- er received 60 designs from Arab architects he dis- patched to study Versailles in France and the Moorish palaces of Spanish Granada. “We believe in symbols,” said Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's undersecretary for foreign affairs. “The leader- ship believes that the state must present itself to the rest of the world in a strong 7 { It was a revealing glimpse intb the mind of one of the most enigmatic and militarily potent leaders the next American president will have to cope with in the Middle East. After leading Iraq through a harrowing war with Iran, Hussein is bent on showing he and Iraq deserve a place in the sun. In pursuing that objective, Hus- sein has steered a daring, unpre- dictable course since his Aug. 20 cease-fire with Iran. Instead of avoiding conflicts while he rebuilds an estimated $30 billion in war damages, Hussein moved boldly to exploit his strength while his ene- mies are off balance. Attack on the Kurds A few days after the cease-fire, he unleashed a military offensive by his elite Republican Guards against the Kurdish guerrillas of northern Iraq, some of whom ac- cepted arms from Iran. The brunt of the attack, which sent up to 80,000 Kurds fleeing 2 OS: p Ti kis \" a n pord conventional military sweep using troops, tanks and helicopters. The United States alleges Iraq used poi- son gas during the offensive, al- though the evidence now suggests chemical weapons were used only in a few isolated areas. In less than three weeks the Kurdish offensive was over. Mean- while, Hussein turned his attention to settling scores with his rival, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, who also sided with Iran. Since 1975, when Hussein at- tacked Assad for “making peace with the Zionist enemy” after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, their per- sonal hostility has led to a series of plots and counterplots between their intelligence services. By 1975 Assad was already president of Syria and Hussein was Iraq’s second-ranking figure. Their attempt to reconcile differences in 1978 degenerated into new enmi- ties, which have lasted after Sad- dam Hussein moved up to president of Iraq in 1979. Backing Lebanese Forces In August, Iraq opened a fresh propaganda offensive, charging that Syria’s attempts to impose order on strife-ridden Lebanon achieved little besides weakening the Palestine Liberation Orgaiza- tion. Syria’s motive, an oficial Iraqi magazine claimed, wa to serve Assad’s “Zionist master:” in Israel. With that prelude, Iraq stepped up its covert military suppor; to Syria’s strongest enemy in Léa- non, the 6,000-man Leba Forces militia headed by Christan warlord Samir Geagea. Buttressed by Iraqi arms nd money, Geagea and his followeriin mid-September thwarted a Syrin plan to install a pro-Syrian Ch - tian candidate as president ofja unified Lebanon. With the Lebanese Parliamet unable to hold the presidential ele- tion, Lebanon was left with t rival governments, one backed Syria and the other by Iraq. From Iraq’s standpoint it w more than a blocking maneuve Ultimately, Iraq intends to ask thi Arab heads of state to revoke th 1976 Arab League decision tha gave Syria an Arab mandate send troops into Lebanon, sai Hamdoon of Iraq’s foreign mini try. “We think the whole remedy to the situation is to have an Arab consensus that will isolate Syria, that will corner Syria,” Hamdoon said. Cease-fire holding Hussein, his boss, also has been playing hardball in dealings with Tran. Their cease-fire is holding, de- spite occasional clashes in spots where the cease-fire line cuts through potential oil fields. But along most of the U.N.- patrolled line, tension has dimin- ished to the point where Iranian snd Iraqi soldiers sometimes sneak sro the barbed wire to drink afternoon tea together, one Iraqi brigadier general said. Even so, Hussein has shown he means to bring about a dramatic change in the status quo without waiting years to reach a final nego- tiated peace settlement with Iran. One way or another, he is deter- mined to reopen Iraq’s vital south- ern outlet to the sea — the 120- mile-long Shatt al Arab watefway that leads southward from the junction of the Tigris and Euphra- tes Rivers in southern Iraq to the head of the Persian Gulf. According to shipping experts, the war has left the Shatt al Arab blocked by silt, shipwrecks, bombs and even some unexploded poison gas shells. The debris is only half the prob- lem. The other half is that the waterway forms part of the imter- nationally accepted boundary be- tween Iran and Iraq. Ever since 1937, the two countries have -dis- puted whether the boundary funs down the middle of the waterway — Iran’s position — or whether the Shatt al Arab is fully under Iraq’s sovereignty. It is the kind of issue that could stall the Iran-Iraq talks. The Iraqis are proposing to dig a new channel that would carry the Shatt al Arab waters about 25 miles to the west, comfortably inside Iraqi territory. If carried out, the plan would end the flow through the ori waterway and leave Iran with no access to the new channel. The Iraqis say they are serious. “The Shatt al Arab waterway is going to stay a part of Iraq whether the Iranians agree to it at the United Nations or not,” said Anwar Said al-Hadithi, governor of Iraq’s southern seaport of Basra. He is a key Hussein appointee. For the time being, more than 70 tankers remain trapped and ng at Basra Palm Beach Post October 28, whey st: \f"

Israeli VotersGive Shamir Key to Powe By Joseph Albright And Michael Widlanski Journal-Constitution Correspondents JERUSALEM — The hawkish Likud Party was poised to try to form a new, hard-line government Wednesday morning, one day after Israeli voters turned toward rightist and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties in national elections. Results with almost 99 percent of the ballot boxes counted gave a clear edge to the Likud bloc, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is pledged to use an “iron fist” to prevent a Palestinian state in Is- raeli-occupied territories. A smiling and confident-looking Mr. Shamir, 78, said early Wednes- day, “So far as I can tell, we can be- gin to proceed to forming a new government. Right now the possibil- ity is emerging for the formation of a Likud-led government with the re- ligious parties.” Radio Israel reported later, however, that Mr, Shamir would meet first with outgoing Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to discuss the prospects of making another na- trast unity government with Mr, Likud Minister Moshe Katzav raised the possibility the new gov- ernment will be a renewed “nation- al unity” coalition in which Labor, Israel's other major party, would play a junior role, Two firebombing attacks on Is- raeli Jews within three days of the election were seen as propelling some “floating” voters to the ex- treme right and ultra-Orthodox par- ties. The latest attack, on election morning, critically injured a 30- year-old Israeli woman driving in east Jerusalem. A Likud-dominated government is likely to complicate the next American president's efforts to find ‘ common ground between Israel and Arab nations. Likud is pledged to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and it rules out joining any interna- tional conference that could result in territorial concessions. The results showed that Likud and its potential rightist and reli- gious party allies had it in their power to surpass the magic number of 61 seats in the 120-member Knes- set, or parliament, needed to form a new government.

Leaders of the religious parties, which gained surprising strength in . the voting, planned to meet within ‘the next 24 hours with Labor and Likud leaders, A Radio Israel com- -mentator said it appears it will be ‘up to the religious parties “to de- cide what kind of a government Is- -rael will have.” ° ‘Religious party leaders said in television interviews that they fa- ‘vored forming a “narrow” coalition on the right. But Likud was said to be reluctant to join in a coalition ‘with the extreme right Moledet (Motherland) party, which advocates “transferring” 1.7 million Arabs out ‘of the occupied territories. Running behing Mr. Shamir’s ‘Likud Party was the secular, Euro- ‘pean-dominated Labor Party of Mr. Peres, which advocates pulling Isra- ‘al's troops back from about 85 per: cent of the occupied West Bank and ‘all the Gaza Strip if a peace settle: ‘ment can be negotiated with a Jor- danian-Palestinian delegation, . The leftist and Arab splinter ‘parties did not contribute enough seats to give Labor its hoped-for “blocking majority” to stop a right: ist coalition, - Aides to Mr. Shamir hinted be- fore the election that he might pre- fer a new “national unity” Cabinet that again would take in the less hawkish Labor Alignment. One rea- son, it was reported, is that Mr. Sha- mir wants to avoid giving the De- fense Ministry to his Likud rival, ultrahawk former Gen. Ariel Shar: on, who has said the nearly 11- month-old Palestinian uprising ‘should be solved through the expul- sion of “thousands of inciters,” .

' Affer an incessant cycle of rocks, underground leaflets, tear ‘gas and bullets that has left at least 300 Palestinians and seven Jews killed, Israeli voters split almost ‘evenly on what to do about it Less than half favored Mr, Per- ‘es's plans to trade land for peace, More than half backed Mr. Shamir’s plans to unshackle the army so it can “deter the rioters,” ~ Political analyst Amnon Barzi- lay said the results showed a clear repudiation of Mr. WPeres's plan to. seek peace through an international conference. Under Israel's proportional de- mocracy, it could take three weeks to three months of intra-party bar- gaining for a new Cabinet to take shape, Depending on the exact turnout, it will require about 19,000 votes to elect each Knesset member. Once the vote count is final, the seats will be divided according to a mathe- matical formula. The final composition of the’ Knesset could switch by a few seats when election officials factor in pre-election “surplus ballot agree- ments” by which ideologically simi- lar parties have paired up to pool any “wasted” votes beyond those needed to win a seat. Likud has agreed to pool its sur- plus votes with Tehiya, which advo- cates annexing the West Bank and Gaza Strip and persuading Arab countries to take 500,000 Palestin- ians in a “voluntary transfer.” Labor will exchange votes with the Citizens Rights Movement, which favors an almost total with- drawal from the occupied territo- Within the next few days, Isra- el's ceremonial president, former U.N. Ambassador Chaim Herzog, will exercise his only political duty: deciding which political leader should get the first crack at forming the new ruling coalition, It is a critical choice, History shows that every Israeli leader who has initiated the bargaining after Is- rael’s 11 previous elections has 4 able to patch together a coali- ion. Israeli law says merely that the president must consult the repre- sentatives of all the parties that have won Knesset seats and then choose a Knesset member he be- lieves is able and willing to form a government, Once the winning party delegations have all trooped to the presidential residence in Jerusa: lem’s Rehavia Quarter, Mr. Herzog will announce — probably later this week — his choice as Israel's next prime minister-designate, Over the next 21 days, the pro- spective leader will wheel and deal with the most compatible splinter parties, trying to negotiate a “‘coali- tion agreement” that will spell out the fundamental policies of the new; Rightward; ars to Lose Leve Meanwhile, the Palestine Liber: ation Organization's parliament-in- exile is due to meet Nov, 12-15 in Algieria to set policy toward Israel. The session is expected to de- clare the birth of an independent Palestinian state, This is sure to provoke new acts of defiance in the territories and announcements of diplomatic recognition for the Pal- estinian state from dozens of Arab and Third World nations and per: haps East European nations as well. If the Israeli prime minister: designate cannot form a coalition in 21 days, a 21-day extension is possi- ble before Mr. Herzog gives the ri- val leader a chance to form the co- |. alition. For any potential leader, one of the most important and time-con- suming elements will be trying to lure the support of the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox religious par: ties, which will press for more aid to schools of Jewish studies, draft exemptions for rabbinical students and bans on showing movies on the, Sabbath. If Likud and Labor get down to discussing a new unity government, Mr, Shamir js certain to press hard for iron guarantees that Mr, Peres will not agree to surrender any of the West Bank and Gaza, which Li- kud views as essengial parts of the . biblical land of Isragl.

ANALYSIS © The Israeli electorate edged just far enough to the right in Tuesday’s voting to shatter the expectations of Jordan, Egypt and the moderate wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for productive Middle East peace talks. ; A Soviet diplomat has expressed unusual alarm, “The situation is critical, and it may explode at any mo- ment unless there is a, regional peace settlement,” the Soviet ambassador to Syria was quoted as saying Thurs- day. “Israel and its guardians are depending on force, which is a big mistake.” It is too early to say whether Prime Minister Yitz- hak Shamir can carry off his initial effort to build a narrow, hard-right alliance among his Likud Party and the religious and ultra-rightist splinter parties. Some in the weakened Labor Party are agitating to dump their dovish leader, Shimon Peres, and try to join Likud in a more hawkish 1988-style unity government. Likud would gain by avoiding unsettling eoncessions to ultra-Orthodox parties. Whatever government uitimate- ly takes shape, it is sure to be domi- nated by one passionate conviction: that the Palestinian uprising can and must be stamped out. Mr. Shamir, who is expected ta be tapped this week by President Chaim Herzog to form the next gov- ernment, has made that plain. Isra- el’s new government will take ener- getic means to suppress the uprising, Mr. Shamir told The Washi m Post after the election. Moshe Arens, Mr. Shamir’s re- preference as defense minis- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 6, ter, has been more explicit. He told an Israeli campaign audience of the need to deny Palestinian residents access to main West Bank thorough- fares in order to prevent gasoline- bomb attacks on Israeli buses. Mr. Arens said the roads could be made safe by seizing houses near roads and uprooting trees, even along stretches of road in major Arab towns in the occupied territories. Radio Israel  venortnd Friday that there is a movement within Li- kud to hand the Defense Ministry to retired Gen. Ariel Sharon, who built his Rambo reputation in part by successfully crushing Palestinian ner in Gaza in the early The landscape in Gaza refugee camps still is delineated by broad “Sharon boulevards,’” which Mr. Sharon bulldozed through houses and shops in the middle of activist- led camps. During the election campaign, Mr. Sharon advocated me Ngee eg the uprising with “thousa of ex- Pulsions and not just 25 or 30.” Mr. Shamir’s potential rightist coalition partner, former Gen. Ra- fael ‘“‘Raful’’ Eitan of the Tzomet Party, would push for draconian forms of collective punishment. : He, like all the partners in a po- tential rightist coalition, believes in an accelerated Israeli settlement program Bank. : Six years ago Mr. Eitan told a Knesset subcommittee, ‘‘We shall create facts, the settlements will be éstablished, and then the Arab stone-throwers will scurry around like cockroaches in a bottle.”’ . In the weeks leading up to the election, officials and intellectuals in Arab countries expressed grave worries about repercussions from such heavy-handed policies. : “The deterioration of the situa- tion on the West Bank will not be limited to the West Bank,” said Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Egypt's min- ister of state for foreign affairs. “It will spread.” In Amman, Jordan, Professor Kamel Abu-Jaber, a specialist in re- gional studies, warned that an Is- raeli listing to the right could en- danger Jordan. “They may forcibly dislodge many Palestinians out of the territo- ries, which would be a debacle for this whole region,” he said. “I think the regime here [fof King Hussein] would fall.” At the same time it attempts to stifle the Arab uprising, the new Is- raeli government is likely to launch a diplomatic offensive. Aides to Mr. Shamir told a news in the occupied West correspondent Friday that Israel would approach Egypt and Jo with a view to restarting talks aimed at “autonomy” for Palestin- ians under the Camp David formula. One hard-line Israeli policy ana- lyst. Dore Gold of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, warned in an article Friday that the new govern- = must have a new peace strate- “formatted and ready for display “El the next [American] secretary of state takes his first swing through the Middle East.” Egypt and Jordan have said in recent months that Palestinian in- dependence, not “autonomy,” is the solution, but Mr. Gold stressed that acceptability by the Arab countries was not vital “Even if in this region it is re- jected out of hand, an Israeli diplo- matic move that contained an ele- ment of fairmess, in the eyes of the American public, would serve the U.S.-Israeli relationship well,” he wrote. Across the invisible Green Line that divides Israel from its occupied territories, Palestinians are saying they can the worst that Mr. Shamir, Mr-Sha and Mr. Ei- tan can throw et them. ““It looks Tike hard times and more confrontation,’ said Hanna Siniora, a Palestinian editor who has emerged as one of the leaders in the territories opposing the Is- raeli occu ion. “The intifada [re- bellion] is the will of the Palestin- ian people to gain their independence and end the occupa- tion. Nothing can stop that.” The question is how long it will be before Palestinians in the occu- pied territories begin to lash back at the Israelis, using firearms, hand grenades and suicide attacks. “What do you think the reaction would be if such things happened in Haifa, in Affula, in Jerusalem?”’ asked Gaza activist and lawyer peg Sourani. “In [the invasion of] Le non, the Israelis paid a serious price — 600 lives. The Israeli soci- ety itself began to feel deeply. Here they have not paid much of a price.” Like the Lyndon B. Johnson ministration approathing Vietnam in the mid-1960s, Israel is at a turn- ing point. If it can crush the Pales- tinian uprising without excessive Jewish casualties and -without bringing on a wider war, Israel will be able to impose peace on the oc-_ cupied territories on its own terms. If the Palestinians can hold out and gain enough international sym-: pathy, the Israeli public may turn’ against a Shamir government as it turned imst the last Likud gov- ernment’s invasion of Lebanon in‘ 1982, and as the American public turned against Mr. Johnson. 1988 \f"

Fascell (D-F la.), chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said he ex- pects to work “closely and cooper- atively” with Mr. Baker, who has been well-received by the commit- tee in the past. in “‘Baker has no trouble with the Democrats,” Mr. Fascell said. “He does not appear to be a knee- jerk right-winger.” Operatives on both the left and right interpreted the quick choice of Mr. Baker — he was named the morning after the elec- tion and remains the only Cabinet choice announced by Mr. Bush — as a positive sign that the new ad- ministration’s foreign policy will not be hamstrung by internal struggles for pre-eminence among a coterie of presidential advisers. At times, such discord stressed operations under Mr. Reagan. In the Lebanon crises of 1983 my: ee \f As chief of staff and then Treasury secretary for Pres- ident Reagan, Mr. Baker has been known foremost as a pragmatist who has been willing to compromise when realities demand it. He is not an ideologue. and 1984, for example, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Robert C. McFarlane, the White House national security adviser, pressed Mr. Reagan to keep a contingent of U.S. Marines on duty in the strife-torn streets of Beirut. Mr. Baker was one of the ad- visers who thought the price was too high after the Beirut Marine headquarters was blown up by a truck bomb. Three months later, Mr. Reagan took the advice of Mr. Bush, Mr. Baker and then-De- fense Secretary Caspar W. Wein- berger and withdrew the Ameri- can troops. Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinber- ger ended up embroiled in virtu- ally a running battle over U.S. policy. : In the new administration, the most important foreign policy voice besides Mr. Baker’s proba- bly will be that of Mr. Bush him- self. The vice president is expect- ed to be much more involved in the formulation and execution of policy than Mr. Reagan has been. Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker are sure to work closely together, af- ter more than two decades of friendship and nearly that long working as political cohorts. : Mr. Baker, 58, a former lawyer from a patrician Texas family, was introduced to politics by Mr. Bush in 1970 when he managed the Houston-area campaign in Mr. Bush’s unsuccessful Senate race. Mr. Baker has called the job “mostly therapy,’ aimed at dis- tracting him after the death of his first wife. Mr. Baker married again in 1973, to Susan Garrett Winston, building a family with his four children, her three and a daugh- ter they had together. By 1975 he was called to Washington to become undersec- retary of commerce. He ran for of- fice himself once, in a failed bid to become Texas attorney general in 1978. . Before joining the Reagan ad- ministration, Mr. Baker managed Mr. Bush’s 1980 presidential cam- Ppaign. While a Bush administration likely will be marked more by continuity than by sharp diver- gence from Mr. Reagan’s policies, it is expected to undertake fewer clearly uphill, ideological battles of the sort Mr. Reagan waged with Congress. That is one message observers believe Mr. Bush sent in choosing Mr. Baker, who as Treasury secre- tary was willing to sacrifice con- servatives’ calls for drastic do- mestic spending cuts and to soften Mr. Reagan’s rock-hard stand against raising taxes last year, in return for successfully negotiating a budget package with congressional leaders. While Mr. Baker’s style is known, his foreign policy experi- ence is limited and his views are unclear. He was said to have been fully cut out of the Iran-contra affair, has not participated in defense legislation, has had no role in Central American issues and has not been outspoken on South Afri- ca. He has not been to the Soviet Union and has visited one country in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia. On subjects such as dealing with the Soviet Union, Mr. Bak- er’s quick decision-making and practical approach will serve him well, said Donald Devine, chair- man of Citizens for America, a conservative lobby. “The importance of a Jim Baker is that he is a guy with po- litical skills,” Mr. Devine said. “That is what we’re going to need over there, someone who can re- act to the direction the Soviets are going in.” Mr. Baker’s pragmatism also may cause him to avoid some is- sues, That, at least, is the view of one Israeli observer, who said the prospect of negotiating with Isra- el’s conservative Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat may be too much for Mr. Baker. “T don’t think he will want to make his mark in the Arab-Israeli conflict,” he said. “He is too prag- matic for that.” Mr. Baker’s personal experi- ence with foreign affairs has been limited to the sphere of econom- ics, a critical field in these times. He has met repeatedly with fi- nance ministers and central bank directors of the major West Euro- pean countries and Japan, per- suading them to work together in 1985 to accelerate the decline of the dollar in an effort to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Mr. Baker also tackled the is- sue of Third World debt, although his plan to stimulate economic growth through massive loans to major debtor nations, in return for free-market economic reforms, was not very successful.

        "ocr_text": " Bush Chooses His Old Boss For Treasury Brady Staying in Cabinet To Serve Longtime Friend By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Eleven years ago, New York financier Nicholas F. Brady telephoned George Bush, then a jobless Republican politi- cian, and offered him a directorship of one of his companies. Mr. Bush, glad for an avenue back into private business after be- ing replaced as CIA director by President Jimmy Carter, served from 1977 to 1979 as a director of Purolator Inc. while the armored car and courier company struggled ministration: how to contain the federal budget deficit. In a slightly heretical vein, Mr. Brady said that even the Defense Department could have its budget cut “without loss of security.” After serving half a year in the Senate, Mr. Brady returned to Wall Street and his old job as chairman of Dillon, Read. He also sat on Reagan adminis- tration blue-ribbon panels on feder- al pay policy, basing the MX missile and Central America. As head of the panel on federal pay, Mr. Brady raised some eye- brows on Wall Street when he wrote a strongly worded essay in 1985 warning of risks to investment mar- kets caused by the spate of corpo- rate takeovers financed by “junk bonds.” Following the October 1987 stock market crash, Mr. Reagan quickly picked Mr. Brady to chair an investigating commission. The Brady report, recommend- ing firm new government regulation on computerized program trading, pleased many banks and medium- sized Wall Street firms but angered a few top firms that had relied on against ever stronger and more nu- merous competitors. Throughout the fight, Mr. Brady, whose family founded Purolator, presided as The Associated Press program trading. * President-elect George Bush publicly confirms Tuesday in Washing- _ The Reagan White House, faced ith a divided Wall Street re- ton that he wants Nicholas F.

Seeing each other in the board- room was the first step in a person- al and political partnership that culminated Tuesday in the. choice of Mr. Brady, 58, as Treasury secre- tary in the new Bush administra- tion. Mr. Brady has held the same position under President Reagan since September. Before 1977, Mr. Bush and Mr. Brady were country club acquaint- ances, members of the East Coast old-school, old-money elite. Both were Yale undergraduates of late- 1940s vintage. But because Mr. Bush was four years ahead of Mr. Brady, they never met until after college. As Mr. Bush was striking it rich in the Texas oil fields in the 1950s, Mr. Brady moved on to Harvard Business School and then to the retary. The two are longtime colleagues in business and politics. blue-chip New York investment banking firm of Dillon, Read & Co., in which his family had held a ma- jor stake for decades. The venerable old company was gradually losing ground to a new breed of Wall Street hotshots who drew away clients by aggressively selling bottom-line “performance.” Mr. Brady made his mark at Dillon, Read as a “rainmaker” who could attract new, deep-pocketed compa- nies and individuals to replace the older clients that had pulled out. “He has a very high-class man- ner of dealing with people,” said Jonathan Bush, the vice president's younger brother, who runs his own New York investment management firm. “He is smooth and he is pol- ished and he has an easy manner in negotiations. He also knows how to fire people.” Mr. Brady developed an itch for Republican politics, running unsuc- cessfully for governor of New Jersey in 1977. When Mr. Bush began cranking up his 1980 presidential campaign in 1978, Mr, Brady be- came: one of his half-dozen closest advisers as well as a major fund- raiser. In 1982, Mr. Brady's loyalty to the New Jersey Republican Party won him appointment to the U.S. Senate to serve out an unexpired term. He devoted his maiden Senate speech to what will now occupy much of his time in the Bush ad- on hold. Yet when Mr. Reagan had to fill a short-term vacancy for Treasury secretary in August, he chose Mr. Brady. His son, Nicholas F. Brady Jr., was married last year to Leigh Top- ping of Atlanta, the stepdaughter of Atlanta Falcons owner Rankin Smith. Atlanta Journal- Constitution November 13, ah Tey. | \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bush Will Keep Education Chief, — Attorney General C Tower Reported Pick for Defense Post; Darman Selected as Budget Director By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — President- elect George Bush on Monday named Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh, a pragmatist with a solid reputation among civil liber- tarians, to continue as head of the Justice Department. Mr. Bush also named Richard G. Darman as his budget director and Lauro F. Cavazos to remain as chief of the Education Department. Mr. Darman has longstanding ties to leading figures in the moderate wing of the Republican Party, and Mr. Cavazos has voted Democratic in past elections. Aides to Mr. Bush told The New York Times, meanwhile, that the president-elect plans to appoint for- mer Sen. John G. Tower (R-Texas) as defense secretary, on the condi- tion that Mr. Tower accept a strong manager from outside the Pentagon as his deputy. The aides said Mr. Tower had agreed to those terms. But Mr. Tower said Monday night, “I have not been offered the job; therefore, there have been no conditions attached. The story in The New York Times is, therefore, inaccurate. I have had discussions with the vice president, as you know. The job has not been offered to anyone, as far as I know.” A leading Republican conserva- tive, who was elated last week when Mr. Bush chose New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu as his chief of staff, reacted sourly to the three ap- pointments announced Monday. “I am not happy” about the choice of Mr. Thornburgh, said Richard A. Viguerie, a columnist and fund-raiser. Mr. Viguerie derid- ed the attorney general as an “East- ern Establishment Republican” who is insufficiently loyal to conserva- tive causes such as opposition to abortion. Mr. Viguerie was lukewarm toward Mr. Darman. And he called | the choice of Mr. Cavazos “a disas- | . ter,” saying that anyone who has_ been praised by liberal teachers’ | unions and by Sen. Edward M. Ken- nedy (D-Mass.) “has to be wrong for a Republican administration.” r. Thornburgh, besides serving as the nation’s chief law enforce- ment officer, will have one of the most critical responsibilities of the Bush administration: preparing ini- tial recommendations for new fed- eral judgeships. Three of the nine_ U.S. Supreme Court justices — Wil- liam J. Brennan Jr., Harry A. Black- mun and Thurgood Marshall — are over 80. Professor Alan Dershowitz, a constitutional law expert at Har- vard Law School, predicted “a struggle” between Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Sununu on the ideological leanings of future judgeship appointees. Mr. Dershowitz, generally viewed as a liberal, praised the choice of Mr. Thornburgh, saying, “We desperately needed to depoliti- cize the office of attorney general. The idea of picking a man who is On Monday in Washington, President-elect George Bush drapes his arm around Richard | G. Darman, whom he announced as his choice not a close political associate of the president is ex- actly what was needed. He comes from a tradition and background that respect civil liberties,” Former Attorney General Griffin B, Bell, a Demi: erat, also praised the decision. “I think that he is a very good man, and the Justice Department is in safe hands,” said Mr. Bell, a partner in the Atlanta law firm of King & Spalding. Mr, Thornburgh, 56, headed the Justice Depart: ment's Criminal Division under President Gerald R. Ford and later won two terms as governor of Penn- sylvania. He was serving as head of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government this summer when President Reagan asked him to replace the beleaguered Edwin Meese III as attorney general, In choosing Mr, Darman, 45, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Bush settled on an experienced Washington infighter who has served in six Cabinet agencies and on the White House staff, most recently as a protege of James A. Baker III, Mr, Bush's designated secretary of state, Mr. Bush described the budget director's post as “perhaps the most difficult” of the three slots he filled Monday, “Because he understands both the government and the economy so well, Dick will help make sure that the Bush administration hits the ground run- The Associated Pi for budget director, as Attorney General Rich- ard L. Thornburgh (right) looks on. Mr. Bush also said he wants Mr. Thornburgh to stay on. Both Mr, Bush and Mr. Darman went out of their way to emphasize that the new administration has no intention of raising taxes, despite recent reports by a succession of advisory panels that the gap be- tween government revenue and expenditures is bound to widen without new revenue sources, Mr, Darman said, “If there was one absolutely clear issue in the election, it was the vice presi- dent's ‘Read my lips: No new taxes’ statement. And the American people made a very clear judgment — 426 electoral votes. It seems to me that’s unambiguous.” The selection of Mr. Cavazos, 61, a sixth-genera- tion Texan of Mexican descent, fulfills a Bush cam- paign promise to appoint a Hispanic to his Cabinet. The vice president said he was choosing Mr. Ca- vazos, a former president of Texas Tech University and former dean of Tufts University Medical School, as part of his commitment to become “the education president.” He said Mr. Cavazos, who became education sec- retary in September, would help him create “great- er rewards” for excellent teachers, make higher education more accessible to low: and moderate-in- oe ntl and establish magnet and merit schools. A Bush aide said Mr, Thornburgh and Mr, Cava- 20S, aS well as Nicholas F. Brady, who will continue as Treasury secretary, will not have to undergo Sen- ate confirmation hearings, The president-elect said that “in all likelihood” he would select no more Reagan holdovers for Cabi- net positions, “but I reserve the right to retain flexi- bility there.” Atlanta Constitution - November 22, 1988 \f"

But Darman’s nimble, penetrating mind and tenacious will to succeed are respected grudg- ingly, even by those who find him too abrasive or who suspect that he harbors liberal leanings. Darman, 45, was one of three appointments announced Monday. The other two, as expected, were to retain Attorney General Dick Thorn- burgh and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos. In Darman’s case, his capabilities persuaded Bush to overcome what was described as a cool relationship and to appoint him to manage the nation’s budget and tame the deficit. “Washington loves people who can take a job and get it done,” Bill Diefenderfer, a senior aide Busn’s Latest Picks George Bush Monday selected: m@ DICK THORNBURGH to continue leading the Justice Department as attorney general. @ RICHARD DARMAN to be head of the Office of Management and Bud- get. @ LAURO CAVAZOS to continue as secretary of education. STORY, 8A to then-Senate Finance Committee chairman Bob Packwood, R-Oregon, said when Darman, as deputy treasury secretary, shepherded tax reform through the legislative process. “He (Darman) is aggressive. He wouldn't accept defeat. He wouldn’t accept a ‘no,’” Diefenderfer said. “OMB is a natural for him.” But throughout the 16-month push for tax reform, Darman’s relentless pressures strained his relations with key players in the House. That could give him trouble in his new job of building — budget and getting it through Congress. “T didn’t like him, and most of the members r “didn't like him. He’s ‘abrasive as hell,” said one _=congressional aide, who complained that Dar- “man accused the House Ways and Means Com- = -mittee of “playing politics” with the tax pack- ~-age simply because it didn’t immediately ~ ‘swallow the Senate’s changes. — _ Critics nonetheless say Darman is a capable --manager, and they are reserving final judgment - until Darman shows how he operates as head of ~ his own shop.

It also was Baker who invited Darman to be - “an economic adviser to the Bush campaign, and --Baker must have been instrumental in seeing . Darman fill a pivotal administration post that will complement Baker’s new job as secretary of state. Even as an underling, Darman carved a unique niche that allowed him to accrue excep- tional power. That was especially so as a deputy in the White House, where he gained control of the paper flowing in and out of the Oval Office. Conservatives who felt Reagan let them down in his first term blame aides like Darman for shielding the president from controversies that could affect his chances for re-election, in essence for diluting the views that won him election in the first place. “(Darman) is a guy who had an agenda that was different from the one Ronald Reagan had and that most of the people who voted for Ronald Reagan were interested in,” said Henry Walther, president of the conservative United States Defense Committee. He accused Darman of promoting higher taxes, downplaying Contra aid and taking a soft line on high-tech transfers to the Soviets. Darman received a bachelor’s degree cum laude from Harvard University in 1964, finished Harvard Business School in 1967, and by 1969 teamed up with Elliot Richardson at the De- partment of Health, Education and Welfare. Palm Beach Post - November 22, Richardson, a fixture in GOP politics from Massachusetts, epitomized the party’s liberal Eastern Establishment wing. He led Darman through a succession of jobs, from HEW to Defense, Justice, Commerce and State. When Richardson resigned as President Richard Nixon’s attorney general rather than fire the Watergate special prosecutor in the 1973 “Saturday Night Massacre,” Darman re- signed too. Between government jobs, Darman was a Woodrow Wilson fellow, helped run a public policy consulting firm and was a lecturer at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Govern- ment. After leaving the Reagan administration in 1987, Darman worked as a managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton. Besides being known for his intellect, Dar- mai. is identified by his ego and arrogance. An article in The Washingtonian in 1983 took note of the bright young bureaucrat in the White House. It said one unidentified source likened Darman to Daddy Warbucks in the musical Annie, particularly when the character said, ‘You don’t have to be nice to people on your way up if you don’t ever plan to come down.” ah fst: \f"

        "ocr_text": "Limit Death Row Appeals, Georgia Urges High Court State Aiming to Speed Up Execution of Murderers By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON — Georgia on Tuesday asked the Supreme Court to short-circuit the lengthy legal maneuvering used by death row in- mates to avoid execution, The Georgia appeal, if granted, generally would limit convicted murderers to a single review of their cases by the federal court sys- tem in addition to whatever appeals they can win in state courts. The state did not give the Supreme Court an estimate of how much that would speed up the pace of execu- tions. Under current practice, the 2,100 death row inmates across the country, including the 105 in Geor- gia, often can extend their lives an extra three or more years after they have run out of appeals in state courts and after their first federal appeal is exhausted. They gain the extra time by opening a second or third federal appeal. Susan V. Boleyn, a Georgia as- sistant attorney general, told the joa Catan Wohingn ves court in oral arguments that de- fense lawyers should be required to include all foreseeable challenges to the trial and sentencing in a sin- gle post-trial federal appeal called a writ of habeas corpus. She asked the justices to deny all convicts’ lawyers the right to ob- tain a second writ of habeas corpus simply by showing that the Supreme Court or Congress subsequently has extended new trial protections after their initial federal appeals were filed. Only drastic and unforesee- able changes in the law should jus- oe second federal appeals, she said, The state's arguments for limit: ing the writ of habeas corpus drew skeptical questions from half a doz- en justices, including several con- servatives who often vote to down criminal defendants’ legal stratagems, Justices Antonin Scalia and By-. ron R. White pressed Ms, Boleyn. several times to define the extent to which defense lawyers reasonably could be expected to anticipate fu- ture Supreme Court findings when ret file their initial federal ap- The argument grew out of claims by Georgia convict William N. Moore that his 1974 death sen- tence by a Jefferson County, Ga., judge was based on an erroneous pre-sentencing report by a local probation officer, J. Clark Rachels. Moore, then a 22-year-old sol- dier at Fort Gordon, had pleaded guilty to shooting Fredger Staple- ton, 77, who lived near the base, during a robbery attempt, Since 1974, the case has been reviewed 18 times by state and federal courts, and Moore came within seven hours of execution in 1984, His latest lawyer, John Charles Boger, told the justices that under a 1981 Supreme Court ruling, Moore pare had a right to be informed of his __ Tights to remain silent and to have a lawyer during his talks with the probation officer. That ruling came after-his first writ of habeas corpus was filed. Mr. Boger said the probation of ficer’s report falsely informed the Georgia sentencing judge that Moore had 10 previous convictions, when in fact he had only four juve- nile offenses. In other action Tuesday, the court ruled 6-3 that the rights of criminal defendants are not violat- ed when police unintentionally fail to preserve potentially vital evi- dence, The decision reversed an Arizo- na appeals ‘court, which had ruled that the rights of a man convicted of kidnapping and sodomizing a 10- year-old boy were violated because police failed to preserve and prop- erly analyze samples from the child's body and clothing. Such evi- dence theoretically could have ex-. onerated the defendant. The court also said the Consti- tution does not require police to conduct state-of-the-art tests in ex- amining evidence. In addition, ruling 8-1 in an Ohio case, the court reinforced the right of the poor to have a lawyer's help in appealing convictions, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 30, 1988 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Minorities, Women Skeptical of Promise By Bush to Put Them in Top U.S. Posts WASHINGTON — To fulfill his pledge of increasing black repre- sentation at the top levels of the federal government, President-elect George Bush would have to include one black in nearly every 20 people he nominates for policy-making He could increase the ratio of women by giving them one out of nearly every six such jobs. Some civil rights and women’s: rights activists, however, said last week that Mr. Bush’s record as vice president and as president-elect does not inspire confidence that he will break the pattern set by Presi- dent Reagan. As of June, 4.7 percent of the top executive branch officials appointed by Mr. Reagan and con- firmed by the Senate were black, while 15.9 percent were women, ac- cording to federal statistics. “What is unfortunate is that Bush certainly has an opportunity to make a statement about the fu- ture direction of his administration by what initial appointments are made,” said Sonia Jarvis, a lawyer with the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation. “Right now, from the perspective of a civil rights lawyer, I haven't been unduly impressed.” So far, Mr. Bush has made eight major appointments. The group is all male, and the only member of a minority group is a Hispanic, Dr. Lauro F. Cavazos, who was asked to continue as education secretary. Capitol Hill sources said Saturday, however, that Mr. Bush planned to appoint Elizabeth H. Dole as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on Monday. On Mr. Bush’s vice presidential staff, according to the 1988 Congres- sional Staff Directory, two of his 14 op aides were women. But Kristin Taylor, a staff mer ber who identified herself in a tel phone interview as a black woma said, “There are lots of women | high-level positions on the vic president's staff. Women are vel well represented.” She said the vice presidenti: staff of more than 100 people has ‘ handful of Hispanics, between for and eight” and “probably not ¢ many blacks as Hispanics.” She said no breakdown of wor en and minorities was available an said the office would not release staff roster. Some representatives of won en’s groups said they were encou aged that Mr. Bush had place women in high positions on hi campaign staff this year. “The met presence of more women in hi campaign than in ’80 or ’84 was clear indication that there will b room for more women in this ac ministration,” said Irene Nativida national chair of the National Won en’s Political Caucus. On the latest staff created b “Mr, Bush, to coordinate the pres: dential transition, nearly half th names on the roster appear to b those of women, although wome: apparently fill only three of the 1 division director slots. Mr. Bush said recently that h wants to reach out to groups “tha have been historically underrepre sented at high levels of the federa government.” Last week, he name to his transition team three co-di rectors for a new office of outreac! Betty Heitman, who is seeking women as prospective officehold- ers, already had been advising a co- alition of 88 women’s groups that expects to submit 30 to 35 names to the transition team for senior poli- cy-making positions, No black or Hispanic groups seem to be putting together such an organized effort to get people into administration jobs. But Constance Newman, the Bush outreach official for blacks, said applications began flowing into her office as soon as she was | named. She emphasized that she is looking for blacks to fill the spec- trum of jobs, not just positions in social agencies, “It's Energy, it’s Commerce, it’s Defense, it’s across the board,” Ms. Newman said. “The vice president is very interested in getting minor- ities in non-traditional jobs.” If he succeeds, he would re- verse the trend of the Reagan ad- ministration, Statistics from the Office of Per- sonnel Management show that in 1980, the last year of President Jim- my Carter’s administration, there were 44 blacks in top executive branch jobs filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirma: tion. In 1981, Mr. Reagan’s first year, the figure dropped to 21. It fell to 15 by 1983 and then rose to 21 this year. The total number of such appointive positions varied from around 400 to 540. Another set of political appoint ments covers about 700 of the 7,000 jobs in the Senior Executive Ser- vice, the managers and supervisors who are the cream of the bureau- cracy. In Mr, Carter's last year, blacks held 59 of those jobs; under Mr. Reagan in 1981, they held on 22. The number rose as high as in 1983, then was back down to 21 earlier this year. Women, who make up 51.2 per- cent of the population, got less than one-fourth of the plum jobs under both Presidents Carter and Reagan. Some black Republicans who complained about lack of access to the Reagan administration are more comfortable that they will have a line open to Mr. Bush. Jewel LaFontant, a Chicago law- yer, said she was among a group of blacks who met regularly with Mr Bush at his Washington residence while he was vice president and that she found him committed to principles important to minorities, “We certainly did not have many blacks in prominent roles” under Mr. Reagan, she said. “The difference is that ... [Mr. Bush] has had a group of knowledgeable blacks meeting with him, advising him of the problems, so he is more knowledgeable than Ronald Reagan was.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 4, 1988 \f"

West Bank residents learn to cope as anniversary of uprising nears By Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service AZA CITY — _ Trouble churned across the occupied Gaza Strip on a_ recent morning after Israeli authorities announced their troops had killed a 7-year-old Palestinian boy during disturbances the previous night. The report turned out to be mis- taken, but angry Palestinians did not know that. Barricades of stones and burning tires littered the roads, and soldiers were stopping passers-by to make them clean up the debris. On the outskirts of Khan Younis, a town in the southern half of the strip, an army truck sudden- ly ed across the road, blocking half the street. A half-dozen sol- diers jumped out and lined up be- side the truck to form a loose barrier across the other side of the road, rifles at the ready. Within minutes, the threat appeared. A primary school 50 yards down the road was letting out its several hundred blue-uniformed Palestin- ian children, who looked to be in first- to third-grades. As the children spilled out of school and saw the soldiers, some angled off the road to go around them. Dozens, however, boys and gis, walked or even ran straight ahead at the armed soldiers, weaving through the gaps in their line, not hesitating an instant out of fear. They were ready for a second year of the uprising. eee One year of bloody protest against Israeli occupation has drawn the eyes of the world to the Palestinian fight for independence while etching deep changes in Pal- estinian society. What Palestinians call the inti- fada, or uprising, began last Dec. 9 and has cracked the stalemate of the Middle East peace process. It forced the Palestine Libera- tion Organization to moderate its stand and take an initiative. It sent a long wave of angst through an Is- Austin American-Statesman - December 4, 1988 > Uprisimg .....: raeli population still divided on how to handle the convulsive pro- test against its military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It also compelled the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories to look inward and draw on their own strengths. The second year of the intifada — whether it withers or continues, whether it turns more violent or more diplomatic — will help shape the future of the entire Middle East, not just the future of the oc- cupied lands. So far, the cost has been a stain of death, injury and arrest on every Palestinian city. om the smallest villages and all the refugee camps spread over the occupied territories. The price in numbers: © At least 316 Palestinians and 11 Israelis dead. *= More than 10,000 Palestin- ianms shot, clubbed, tear-gassed at close range or otherwise injured enough to seek medical help in the Gaza Strip alone, by U.N. esti- mates.

Dec. 9 approaches again, and Predictions continue that the up- rising i soon be quieted. Palestinian ople, however, they are ready to pay more. ““The intifada depends on the people’s energy. and the people Ihave infinite energy.” said Yasser Ibr. itt, a 32-year-old farmer on the est Bank. “‘‘“Ewen if we feel sometimes that we might not be able to continue, there is no other way but to continue.” Some Palestinians talk about moving the uprising imto a new Phase of more deadly confronta- tion, of employing more Molotov cocktails than stones. Many more, however, are concentrating on building from within, on fashioning a mew skeleton for a new Palestin- ian state. The say Here are some other glimpses of the first year of the uprising: On a sunny October morning in the West Bank town of Jericho, three doctors, a dental surgeon and a handful of medical aides turned an abandoned two-room hovel into a clinic for a day. 'The place offered no electricity, no water, no furni- ture, just a steady lHne of patients needing help. Quilted pads on cement floors created two examining rooms. Light came from the sun through a window. The covered patio outside became a processing center where murse’s aides took blood pressures, ——— and temperatures, exam- ine eyes and pricked fingers to test for diabetes and anemia. Dr. Musa Bajali, a dentist who has worked with the Union of Pal- estinian Medical Relief Commit- tees since the uprising began, Placed a small, quiet girl on a stone bench outside and relieved her of an abscessed tooth. “Our people can build for our- selves,”” he said, a philosophy that has drawn hundreds of doctors and 80,000 patients to the union this year. The group existed long before the first rock of the uprising was hurled, but it has grown into a new role im response to multiplied, pressing needs. Besides holding clinics twice a week, medical teams give emergen- cy help to overloaded hospitals. The medical teams are dispatched to scenes of unrest throughout the territories. ‘This year, the union packed and distribu more 14,000 first- aid kits, which include a burn oint- ment that one doctor said is especially soothing to wounds from rubber bullets. Crisis spawned another service Feb. 8, when Mokassed Hospital in Arab East Jerusalem had 31 shoot- ing victims on its hands, no blood for transfusions and no blood bank to call.

Worse yet, they believed giving blood was a danger to be risked only for closest kin. Dr. Mustapha Barghouti said the union set out to persuade Pal- “What we are doing is building an infrastructure, like the Israelis did in 1948,” Barghouti said, refer- ring to the days of the British Man supplied services from defense to education to health care, so the Jews in Palestine were ready to launch themselves into statehood when the time was ripe. “We have learned a them,” Barghouti said. what they don’t like.” In August, the Jerusalem Post, an Israeli English-language dail mewspaper, reported that Israeli authorities closed down Palestin- iam professional associations o the grounds they had been take over by elements of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who were preparing the groups to replace in stitutions set up by the civil admin- istration in the territories.

Some also organized retri- bution against Palestinians be- lieved to be collaborators and enforced calls for boycotts and strikes. A publication of the Israeli press office said the popular committees were targeted because they pro- moted violence and forced people to comply with the demands of fli- ers and radio broadcasts put out by underground leaders. The Post said the banning indi- cated what security authorities see as the primary threat of the upris- ing: the creation of Palestinian in- stitutions and services as an alternative to the military-civil government. Yasser and Khaled Ibragitt are brothers who are trying to build an imsurance policy for the farming families in their West Bank town of Beit Ummar, about a 10-minute drive south of Bethlehem. Because of disturbances, includ- ing a Molotov cocktail that wound- ed two Israeli soldiers, the Israelis prohibited villagers from market- ing their plums last summer. They denied farmers licenses to sell and put checkpoints around the village to make sure nobody smuggled out fruit. As plums rotted under the trees, the Ibragitt family kissed goodbye more than $6,000 of this year’s in- come, and the village as a whole lost an estimated $90,000, said Khaled Ibragitt, 29. The policy was not lmited to Beit Ummar. ““We will not accept a situation in which villages or areas riot. . . and then be able to act as though noth- ing had happened,” said aj- Gen. Amram Mitzna, head of the Israeli Army Central Command. ‘‘This was the policy during the plum har- vest and during the grape harvest. It will also be in effect during the olive harvest.” After Beit Ummar’s farmers had problems selling grapes — Israelis Gelayed marketing lHhcenses more than a month — the brothers be- gan thinking this fall about how to protect their crops from marketing problems.

Austin American-Statesman - December 4, 1988 (Continued) “For example, if we can’t market all the fruits, we can make, them into grape juice or jam,” said Yasser Ibragitt. “‘People should know that Palestinian farmers have a wide point of view about the future.” “Every family has someone like this. Every family has been affect- ed,”’ said one woman, Yusra, speak- ing of the arrest of her son three months earlier. He was in adminis- trative detention, which means he had not been formally charged with a crime. He was held at Ansar 3, the Israeli-run desert prison camp where family visits are not permitted. Yusra and her husband, Mah- moud, say they know of hardly a family at the Kalandia refugee camp that has not had a son or hus- band arrested or beaten. They strongly believe the Palestinian faght for independence is just, but this couple has grown weary of the uprising. “It’s better when we have cur- fews,”” said Mahmoud. ‘““That way, everyone is inside and nobody gets hurt.”’ Even Yusra, who a few months earlier said the curfews drove her to distraction by keeping all the men and boys inside for ys, said mow she tries to hold her sons in the house. ‘‘I keep them in here all the time,” she said.

A traditional woman who dress- es in the ankle-length, ana gown that Palestinian have worn for generations, Sabha has been a part of some untradi- tional activities. Unlike Yusra, who tries to keep a low profile, Sabha has joined wom- en’s demonstrations to protest the treatment of their families. As a teen-age village girl, before she be- came a refugee in 1948, Sabha said she never dreamed she would be a protester. She was among the bus loads of mothers who traveled for an hour to demonstrate against conditions at the Dahriyeh prison this summer. “That was the farthest away from home that I ever demonstrat- ed,” said Sabha, still somewhat awed that she should be so bold. \f"

Responding to the non-governmental appeal, American Red Cross officials quickly began contacting American drug and pharmaceutical companies that have donated bulk quantities of re- lief supplies in past emergencies, a Red Cross official said. “We, the American Red Cross, are looking for antibiotics, disposable sy- ringes, and blood collection kits,” said Red Cross staffer Myrna Peralta. “They have the donors willing to give blood, but they need more supplies in which to collect the blood.” The Red Cross effort got under way even as Armenian-American organiza- tions began collecting relief funds for Soviet Armenia and as the U.S. govern- ment made elaborate contingency plans to send relief supplies if Moscow ac- cepts President Reagan's offer of help. “They didn’t give us specific num- bers,” said Peralta. “They are just say- ing, ‘Get us everything you can get us.’...

The move came just hours after Yasser Arafat met longstanding American conditions for establishing contacts. The swift American response was made known to objecting Is- raeli diplomats less than an hour before Secretary of State George ¥ Local reaction and a look at how decision was made 164A Shultz announced the initiative. Earlier Wednesday, PLO leader Arafat held a news conference in Geneva to “highlight my views” offered in a speech the day before to the U.N. General Assembly. The U.S. State Department had rejected the speech as too vague to allow for the opening of a dialogue between U.S. officials and PLO leaders. Shultz said statements made Wednesday by Arafat met three key conditions set in 1975: Recognition of Israel's right to exist, renunciation of terrorism and acceptance of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which guarantee se- cure borders for all states in the Middle East and call on Israel to withdraw from the occupied terri- tories, Arafat, speaking in the United Nations’ Palace of Nations, read a prepared statement in English. His U.N, speech had been in Arabic. Arafat said he had referred to U.N. Resolution 181, which called Palm Beach Post - December 15, 1988 > \fShultz says Arafat met conditions for the formation of separate Arab and Jewish states, ‘and also made reference to our acceptance of Res- olution 242 and 338 as the basis for negotiations with Israel within the framework of the international conference.” He repeated a standard diplo- matic formula, saying he had re- ferred to “the right of all parties concerned in the Middle East con- flict to exist in peace and security, and, as I have mentioned, including the state of Palestine, Israel and other neighbors, according to the Resolutions 242 and 338.” On the third condition, he said, ‘T repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including indi- vidual, group and state terrorism.” He said that made the PLO position on the issue “crystal clear.” “We want to live in our Pales- tinian state — and let live,” he said. Arafat confirmed that the news conference followed an exchange of messages between the United States and the PLO delivered by the government of Sweden. State Department officials have confirmed that Sweden also had delivered messages on the con- tent of Arafat’s U.N. speech Tues- day before he delivered it. PLO officials expressed surprise when the State Department subsequently said the U.N. address did not meet the U.S. conditions for a dialogue. But Washington made a dra- matic reversal Wednesday. “The United States is prepared for a substantive dialogue with PLO representatives,” Shultz said. “The objective of the United States remains, as always, a comprehen- sive peace in the Middle East,” he said. “I view this development as one more step toward direct nego- tiations between the parties, which alone can lead to such a peace.” The secretary of siate said U:S. officials “have been in touch with states,” and had been making noti- fication calls for the hour previous to his news conference. “The United States’ commit- ment to the security of Israel re- mains unflinching,” Shultz said. Shultz said the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau Jr., will be the only authorized channel for the talks. The PLO headquar- ters is in Tunis, the Tunisian capi- lal. Shultz emphasized the action Wednesday night in no way implied the American government is recog- nizing the Palestinian state de- clared by the PLO last month at a meeting of the Palestine National Council, the PLO’s parliament in exile. He said the United States main- tains its position that the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the territories occupied by Israel since it captured them in the 1967 war, can be determined only through negotiations, not by unilateral ac- tions such as the PLO declaration of independence. Shultz indicated aay discussions begun under the Reagan adminis- tration will be part of a “transition phase,” and that it will be up to the new government of President-elect George Bush to guide the substance and direction of the talks. He said both Vice President Bush and President Reagan had been consulted on the decision. “They both agree that under these circumstances, the conditions for a substantive dialogue . .. have been met,” he said. The extraordinary pace of events, culminating in a major change in U.S. foreign policy, was possible largely because the State Department had been expecting Arafat to meet the three conditions a day earlier when he spoke to the United Nations at a special session 4 PnevVa A third party, widely identified as Swedish diplomats, had solicited an exact reading of the conditions from the State Department, and in return had led American diplomats to believe Arafat was prepared to meet the demands in the U.N. speech. But American officials judged that Arafat’s address, in Arabic, fell short of the mark, with its unclear phraseology and apparent conditional statements. On his next try, at a news conference in Geneva Wednesday afternoon, Arafat got it right, and in English. His comments set off a fairly quick chain of discussions and eval- uations among Shultz and his staff, National Security Adviser Colin Powell, Reagan and Bush, which resulted in the decision to begin contacts with the PLO. The final release by Reagan was reported to have been made at around 5 p.m. In Geneva, Arafat refused to comment on a brief, hard-hitting speech to the General Assembly Wednesday morning by Ambassa- dor Vernon Walters, the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations. Walters bluntly outlined a method of achieving peace in the Middle East, saying, “For Israel, the choice is clear, albeit difficult. “In order to achieve the securi- ty it deserves and requires, Israel must face up to the need for with- drawal from occupied territories and to the need to accommodate legitimate Palestinian political rights.” Walters told the Palestinians, “In order to achieve the political rights they deserve and require, Palestinian demands will have to accommodate the reality of Isra- el’s existence and security needs, and they will have to commit them- selves to negotiations with Israel.” How DECISION Was MADE @ 9:30 A.M. — National security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, briefs Presi- dent Reagan and dis- cusses PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat’s news con- ference and the possibility that the ‘right language’ might be used. @ 1:30 P.M. — Secre- tary of State George Shultz meets with Rea- gan, chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein, Powell and Duberstein’s deputy, M.B. Oglesby. Reagan is told that Arafat is expected to make a statement.

They ask Reagan for his final decision, and Reagan decides to authorize the dialogue. SOURCE: THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Palm Beach Post - December 15, 1988 (Continued) \f"

Resolutions 242 and 338, which guaran- tee secure borders for Middle East nations. “The words must be matched by performance,’ Mr. Reagan told reporters at a White House photo session Thursday. “And if they're not, why, we're back where we started.” If the PLO does not live up to its pledges, Mr. Rea- gan said, the United States will “certainly break off communications.” The first effort to open those communications was made Thursday in Tunisia by U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., who called the director general of the PLO's political section in the capital city of Tunis Morris B. Abram said American Jews ‘accept’ the U.S. decision. to set up the first talks, U.S. officials said. PLO officials said later the first talks could come as early as today.

So much was ae into international phone calls and hur- ried corridor chats in Geneva that there exists no neat diplomatic rec- ord for historians to ponder in sort: ing out what led to the peace talks that began Friday in Tunis, Tunisia. But the skeleton of the story is beginning to nt as participants begin to talk publicly and privately about what ieveaal It is a tale of two eat men finding a way to incline toward each other's position without acknowledging that either had flinched. The story started, according to an Arab source in Washington, when Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar’ bin Sultan, called on Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Nov. 28 to protest He Prince Bandar consid- By that morning, the State De- partment’s decision to deny Mr. Arafat a visa to address a U.N. ses- sion in New York was only a day and a half old. The morning papers were reporting that President Rea- gan, from his California ranch, had declared that he agreed ‘very much” with the denial of the visa, saying Americans cannot be “pat- sies” to terrorism. President-elect George Bush was described as not having been consulted. Messages of disapproval were beginning to flood in from Washing- ton’s close allies in Europe. And Arab diplomats were making moves to shift the U.N. debate over Pales- tine to the Geneva headquarters of the United Nations. But Washing- ton’s spokesmen were hanging: tough: Elements of the PLO had en- gaged in terrorism against Ameri- cans and others. Against this backdrop, Prince Bandar, a nephew of King Fahd and a former Saudi air force pilot, told Mr. Shultz that he and his country felt they had been “misled” in the weekend events preceding the visa denial. A source said Prince Bandar conplained that he had been as- sured by Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy that the decision would not be announced unless Prince Bandar had an hour to telephone the bad news to King Fahd in Saudi Arabia. Instead, he heard it on the radio. It was the kind of diplomatic hurt feelings that secretaries of state get accustomed to smoothing and forgetting. But this episode changed overnight from a flap into ‘ long-distance Middle East negotia- tion. Atlanta Journal-Constitution December 18, The next day, Arab sources said, Prince Bandar delivered a tough letter to the State Department. On behalf of King Fahd, he asked the United States either to reconsider its decision banning Mr. Arafat or to give some other “positive” sign to strengthen the position of moderate Arab leaders in the Middle East. King Fahd, who traditionally has preferred to support the Pales- tinian cause from a safe distance, this time stepped forward as the first of three crucial intermediaries: who worked from across the globe to bring the United States and the PLO together. During that week, the peripatet- ic Mr. Arafat touched down in Saudi Arabia. King Fahd, whose oil reve- nues are a major financial pillar of the PLO, is said to have counseled Mr. Arafat in unmistakable terms that the time had come to demon- strate the PLO’s flexibility. At the same time, the king be- gan pressing Washington to spell out precisely what Mr. Arafat would have to say to get the United States to lift its 13-year-old ban on talks with the PLO. “The king was telephoning. Prince Bandar in Washington two or three times a day,” the Arab source in Washington said. At the White House, officials were disposed to listen, especially as Mr. Arafat's speech in Geneva approached and the United States had no backers in the world except Israel. yOver the next 40 days, Prince Bandar is said to have spoken three times with White House national se- curity adviser Colin L. Powell and at least six times with Mr. Murphy, the State Department’s point man on Middle East diplomacy. “There were very specific discussions about what Arafat would have to do,” the Arab source said. The whirl of Saudi contacts were concentrated before Mr. Ara- fat’s statement Dec. 7 in Stockholm, Sweden, in which the PLO chair. man “accepted the existence of Is- rael as a state in the region” along- side a Palestinian state. Mr. Shultz responded that Mr. Arafat's state- ment had clarified the PLO’s posi- tion, but not enough to meet the US. conditions. . What the United States was pressing the PLO for was a “renun- ciation” of terrorism, an unequivo- cal recognition of Israel’s “right to exist” and acceptance that peace negotiations with Israel would be based on a pair of U.N. resolutions passed in 1967 and 1973 that gave international endorsement to ‘“‘se- cure borders” for Israel and its neighbors. King Fahd, convinced that Mr. Arafat had gone far enough, com- plained again to Washington, the Arab source said. But his center- Stage role as the main intermediary with Washington was finished. Now the challenge of picking up the pieces fell to the Swedish for- eign minister, Sten Andersson, who began to send messages back and forth between Washington and the traveling: PLO entourage. ahs t: eed \fSaudis Play Sz Big Role Prince Bandar bin Sultan Ceft) | and King Fahd pushed U:S. to act. One crucial factor that kept the indirect talks going at this point was the lack of a strong lobbying ef- fort in Washington by Israeli diplo- mats and the American Jewish com- munity on behalf of the Israeli government’s anti-PLO position. If the White House was waiting for a storm of pre-emptive protests, it did not materialize. In assessing why the Israelis were not more active, some pro-Is- raeli sources cited the preoccupa- tion in Israel over who will form the next Cabinet after the inconclusive. national election Nov. 1. “There is no question that the debates in Israel [on the shape of the new government] weaken our ability to deal with external fac- tors,” said Baruch Binah, an official of the Israeli consulate general in, New York. Another factor loomed impor- an indirect U.S..PLO exchange of texts of Mr. Arafat's impending statement. For different reasons, the Syrians also were relatively re- strained, even though they often had sabotaged Mr. Arafat’s peace moves by stirring up anti-Arafat ele- 's in the PLO tant in extending what had become ' fat. All Washington did, these An Arab source in Washington credited King Fahd with having leaned on Syrian President Hafez Assad to allow the PLO to complete its peace bid. According to this source, Mr. Assad got this message when he made a sudden visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, the day before Mr. Arafat's much-awaited U.N. speech in Geneva, Meanwhile, through the Swed- ish channel, Mr. Arafat was passing to Washington a series of para- graph that he proposed to include n his speech. Back to the Swedes came messages laying out Washing: ton's specifications. Now that it is all over, Washing: ton sources maintain that the Rea- gan administration never tried to write specific language for Mr. Ara- sources insisted, was send to the Swedish foreign minister highlight- ed passages of public U.S. state- ments, including a Reagan press conference and a Shultz speech that repeated the demands for a “renun- ciation” of terrorism and recogni- tion of Israel's right to exist. In any event, on the eve of Mr. Arafat's Geneva speech, the White ' House and the State Department ' thought they had an assurance through Mr, Andersson that Mr. Arafat would say these magic layed the message from Washington. words, Then, on Tuesday, Mr, Arafat . pulled another stunner: He stood , before the United Nations in Gene- va and didn’t speak the paragraphs the Swedes had said he would. He said almost the same words, but not quite. The State Department spokesman quickly said Mr, Arafat had not said enough to justify talks, ' _ and so did Mr. Bush. As the Arab source in Washing- ton put it, “Arafat was trying to probe. He didn’t want to mouth the United States’s text. He was trying to get as close as he could to it and still fudge.” At about 8:15 am. Wednesday, the third major intermediary weighed in, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak telephoned Wash- ington and asked to speak with Mr. Shultz. When Mr, Shultz got on the line, Mr, Mubarak reportedly began by insisting that the Americans had misheard the speech, that Mr. Ara- fat had said all the right things af- ter all. By the end of the conversa- tion, Mr. Shultz was spelling out to Mr. Mubarak precisely what had heen ambiguous, Arab diplomats in Washington said Mr. Mubarak, who was in Egypt, placed a call to Geneva to re- lay the news to his foreign minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid. “Everything was easier because Arafat was already in Geneva,” said the Arab diplomat, Mr. Meguid found Mr. Arafat in Geneva and re-, This time, Mr. Arafat decided it was time to grab the Americans’ in- direct offer to talk before it evapo- rated. He held a press conference and gave the expected’ assurances, in exactly the words that the Ameri- + cans had anticipated. Even then, the Arabs were not sure this would be enough to bend Mr. Reagan, At3 p.m,, the Saudi ambassador rushed to the State Department to deliver two more written messages from King Fahd. According to the Arab source in Washington, this is what they said: You have gotten all you can out of Mr, Arafat, the man has gone as far as he can, this is the end of the road. An hour later, Mr. Shultz is said to have told the White House that Mr, Arafat had at last fulfilled the American conditions, Reportedly, Mr, Bush was then briefed, and at about 5 p.m. the president-elect is said to have oe Mr. Reagan to say he joined in the decision, If nothing else, some partici- pants said later, Mr, Reagan's deci- sion spared Mr, Bush from bearing the burden of a controversial deci- Ste early in the new administra: On, As Egyptian Ambassador Abdel Raouf Reedy put it, “Realistically, President Reagan fas helped the next adiminstratioh in removing an UUSLE Atlanta Journal-Constitution December 18, 1988 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bomb blew jet from sky. officials say By Joseph Albright and Jim Stewart COX NEWS SERVICE WASHINGTON — The bomb that blasted Pan Am Flight 103 out of the Scottish skies was made of a “highly capable” ex- plosive which might be of a type manufactured in the Soviet bloc, FBI officials said Wednesday. After being briefed on prelim- inary analysis of debris by FBI and British bomb experts, FBI Director William Sessions told a news conference that the explo- sive “might be of the type of Semtex.” One of his top explo- sives experts, James Ronay, told reporters later that Semtex is a plastic explosive made for mili- tary use in Czechoslovakia and at a number of other sites in So- viet Bloc countries. One private expert, retired Marine Lt. Col. John Buchanan, said Semtex is thought to be about 18 times as powerful as TNT. Some experts maintain it would take a suitcase-load to bring down a jumbo jet. But Buchanan, an analyst at the Washington-based Center for Defense Information, said: “You could have a Sony Walk- man filled with plastic explosive and an igniter the size of a pencil stuck into it with an electric charge the size of a watch bat- tery and there’s your bomb.” The preliminary identification of the bomb material provided FBI investigators their first im- portant lead, even as the State Department and the White House were pledging that the United States will do “every- thing possible” to catch the sab- oteurs who downed the jumbo jet on Dec. 21. The U.S. govern- ment has offered a reward of up to $500,000 for information leading to the prosecution of anyone who caused the crash. The bomb evidence was found Dayton Daily News December 29, ah: Tt 3) ' In two parts of a “luggage pallet” — the metal rack where baggage is Stored, said Michael Charles, head of Britian’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch. “The explosive's residues recovered from the debris have been positively identified, and are consistent with the use of a high performance plastic ex- plosive,” Charles said. In wake of the bomb revelations, the British government ordered all U.S. air- lines using British airports to tighten security immediately Wednesday night, especially in handling baggage stored in the luggage compartments of aircraft. The Department of Transport said the directive was made after consulta- tion with the U.S. Federal Aviation Ad- ministration, which it said was “also considering further security require- ments for U.S. airlines worldwide.” * Meanwhile in Washington, Sessions expressed guarded optimism that the FBI's investigative techniques will make it possible to narrow the search toa limited number of terrorist or crim- inal groups based on the type of explo- sive that was employed. | * “There is an ability,” he said, “to take specific types of explosives and to: track them, certainly within a category of groups or certain groups that might use that particular type of explosive.” - Ronay said Semtex is a mixture of two main explosive components, one called RDX and the other PETN. He said Semtex can sometimes be identi- fied after a blast by examination of un- exploded traces of the explosive. « Ronay said Semtex has blasting properties similar to the American mili- tary's C-4 plastic explosive, but has a different mix of ingredients. If Semtex is positively identified as the blasting agent, an inquiry into its supply channels would inevitably lead agents into the political labyrinth of the Middle East, where the Soviet Union has supplied a full line of military sup- lies to several close allies including ' Yet supplies of Semtex have also somehow reached terrorists in Britain. In a thus far unexplained coincidence, Scotland Yard announced on the day of the Pan Am explosion that it had cap- tured a “substantial” quantity of Sem- tex in a raid on suspected Irish terror- ists in South London, not far from Heathrow Airport, where the doomed Pan Am flight took off. ~ Reuters News Agency, in reporting on the discovery of that IRA bomb fac- tory and arms cache, said the find high- lighted fears that the IRA might be pre: paring to launch a bombing campaign as part of its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, one private Middle East expert, Judith Kipper of the Brookings Institution, said, “So much depends on where they (the plane’s bombers) got it. Did they get it through a govern- ment? Did they buy it legitimately? Are they buying it on the black market? Wasit stolen?” Kipper said that if the episode is traced to a Middle East group, the Unit- ed States and its European allies must apply tougher diplomatic pressure on Middle East governments in order to “start making those people accountable for their crazies.” A group with ties to Iran, the Guard- ians of the Islamic Revolution, claimed responsibility for the bombing within hours after it occurred, but no further evidence has surfaced to confirm the claim. The State Department said U.S. au- thorities had also received two other claims of responsibility, but a spokes: man declined to provide details, Both the FBI and the State Depart- ment said that the United States has concluded that a telephoned warning of a bomb on a Pan Am flight, received by the U.S. embassy in Finland on Dec. 5, was a hoax. - The two agencies were quick to say that the inquiry has produced no sus- pects so far, \f"

Pressure from an odd coalition of consumer and industry groups already has stimulated proposals for more rigorous laws, federal studies to find out how safe seafood is, and the mapping of a new sur- veillance system from the boat to the market. But a revamping will take at least two to three years and possibly longer. have come from anywhere on the Gulf Coast. “Private enterprise seldom has ‘begged the federal government to regulate it. But in 1906, after muckraking reports of revolting onditions in meat-packing houses appalled American meat-eaters and foreign purchasers, the meat industry lobbied for a meat inspec- tion law. Protect the market The seafood situation today has parallels. Though conditions are not nearly so extreme as those in the slaughterhouses 83 years ago, consumer doubts about polluted waters, sanitary handling of sea- food and deceptive trade practices have aroused the industry and con- sumer activists to action. “We want to protect the accep- tance of our products,” said Lee Weddig, executive vice president of the National Fisheries Institute, a trade association leading the charge for stronger regulation. “In the last two years there’s been such attention to this issue, primarily fomented by pollution The current fragmented, incon- sistent monitoring program has produced a profusion of fish stories pointing up the danger and decep- tion that will continue in the mean- time: @ A Kroger supermarket exec- utive in Ohio tells of a company buyer who was visiting a Florida fish supplier and was dismayed to see the lot of grouper destined for Kroger stores. The fish looked bad and smelled worse, and the buyer said not to bother sending them. By the time the buyer had wandered through the plant and back to the loading dock, the suspect fish had scares of last summer. And the fact is that there’s no connection be- tween these concerns and safety of the product.” Connection or not, U.S. con- sumption of seafood fell 3 percent last year after years of growth, a remarkable drop considering Americans’ second thoughts about the dangers of red meat as a high- fat, high-cholesterol food. Fish is neither, which helps explain why per capita consumption of seafood incieased from 10.6 pounds of fish and shellfish a year in 1967 to 15.4 pounds in 1987, before the drop last ear, Much of the seafood industry considers inspection a form of pro- tection against further erosion in sales _ “The consumer wants to geta wholesome product,” said Don Haynie, the president of Farm Fresh Catfish in Hollandale, Miss. “With government inspection, the consumer believes he is getting a wholesome product.” The consumer group Public Voice, which is heading a coalition of 35 public interest groups i not been tossed out but had been relabeled and readied for shipment to another retailer. @ A pregnant woman in Balti- more stopped by the fish market on the way home from work and pur- chased a fish she had never seen but was told was a delicious Great Lakes species from New York state. Having second thoughts, the woman kept the fish on ice until she could check it out with New York authorities the next day. After a series of frustrating telephone calls, she finally learned the fish port of better federal inspection, began warning about seafood quali- ty long before medical syringes and brown tide mingled with seashells last summer along miles of shore- line. Consumer advocates and envi- ronmentalists say the hazards of eating seafood have grown under increasing demand, increasing pol- lution and sparse monitoring. They are worried not only about the easy fixes, such as sanitation at process- ing plants, but about complicated unknowns, including the long-term effects of pesticides and chemical compounds that drain or are dumped into the waterways. “We're not supplying a means of assuring a good, safe seafood product. At the same time we're encouraging people to eat more of it,” said Elizabeth Hedlund, gov- ernment affairs director for Public Voice. “Chances of your getting safe seafood are pretty much hit or miss.” was listed on a state pollution advi- sory warning high risk groups such as pregnant women not to eat the fish. The warning didn’t reach con- sumers outside New York. @ At least 61 people, mostly from Florida, Georgia and Ala- bama, came down with Hepatitis A in July and August 1988 after they até raw oysters in Panama City. ‘The marine patrol arrested a local harvester found “bootlegging” oys- - ters from closed beds — a bayou ‘where broken sewer pipes had ‘dumped 200,000 gallons of raw sewage — but patrollers say the enforcement system is so full of holes that the bad oysters could Seafood generally safe Officials of the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsi- ble for assuring that most of the nation’s food, including fish, wholesome, safe and properly la belled, say they could improve the FDA program if they had more personnel to inspect and sample and do research. But essentiall they defend their system. “T think seafood in this countr. is generally safe, and people should enjoy it without hesitation,” said James Benson, deputy FDA com- missioner. “One area that we're concerned with is raw shellfish. The risk is much higher than in eating other kinds of seafood.” Only incomplete figures exist to compare the relative safety of beef and poultry, which are subjected to carcass-by-careass inspection by the U.S. Department of Agricul- ture, with seafood, which gets a fraction of such scrutiny under the FDA. Doctors are required to report to the government only a few food- borne maneeses, inclining salmo- Palm Beach Post - August 28, 1989 > safer seafood ILLNESS FROM EATING MEATS IRR \\lInesses reported per billion pounds consumed SOURCE: The Food and Drug Administration HEIDI KUER / Staff Arist fections related to eating raw shellfish, so information is limited. Worse than poultry The figures that do exist show relatively more illness has been reported from seafood than from poultry or red meat. The FDA re- cently computed that from 1973 to 1987, there were 171 cases of ill- ness reported per billion pounds of seafood consumed, compared with 101.8 cases of illness per billion pounds of poultry and only 56.55 cases per billion pounds of beef. When cases of illness related to the more hazardous raw shellfish are subtracted, the number of cases from fish drops to 75 per billion pounds consumed — fewer than the stomach-aches attributed to poultry, but still more than beef. Legislation introduced in Con- gress and generally backed by in- dustry and consumer groups would have the USDA take over fish in- spections. It would not imitate the system of carcass-by-carcass sur- veys used on meat and poultry, which would be impossible to copy in an industry that includes un- countable numbers of shrimp, oys- ters, clams, crabs, mussels and scores of species of fin fish, which arrive on nearly 200,000 commer- cial fishing boats and in more than 3 million tons of fresh, frozen or canned imports a year. The group Public Voice is one proponent of switching to USDA, criticizing FDA surveillance as _ “woefully scanty.” Benson of the FDA says the agency must target its inspection and sampling, and has enough ex- perience to know where to look for trouble. “We try to do smart sampling. We don’t look for problems in areas where we don’t think we'll find them,” said Benson, who nonethe- less said FDA would like to double or triple its sampling if it had the funds. State governments may help fill in the gaps, but they often don’t have the resources for monitoring, even when they have the legal responsibility. In Texas, for example, the Food and Drug Division of the Depart- ment of Health has only 17 inspec- tors to keep tabs on more than 22,000 enterprises, ranging from methadone distributors and carrot sheds to shrimp processing iac- tories, according to Rex Sherry, the division’s director of training. Hitting the high spots “Usually we hit the high spots,” Sherry said. Though seafood is con- sidered hazardous and a priority for attention, he said, that still does not guarantee that every site is inspected even once a year. Texas and other states with a piece of the vulnerable shellfish industry all have agencies run by federal standards and devoted to monitoring the water where shell- fish are harvested and firms where they are processed. Charles Boardman of the MILT PUTNAM/Staff Photographer Florida Department of Agriculture checks seafood at the Offshore Seafood Market in Stuart. The problem is keeping har- vesters from sneaking into closed, polluted waters and simply saying they got the oysters or clams else- where. Every bag or box of oysters is supposed to carry a tag showing they came from approved waters, but Maj. Ed Thomas of the Florida Marine Patrol said workers have been known to steal hundreds of tags from reputable bosses and go into business tagging bad oysters with good tags. Or they make coun- terfeit tags. Sometimes restaurants and markets will buy untagged oysters and knowingly sell such ‘“boot- legged”’ products to unsuspecting customers, he said. Industry officials acknowledge their business is riddled with de- ceptive practices, most of which are not so dangerous as selling oysters from dirty water. “The main problem I see is that when you buy steak you don’t ex- pect to get pork chops, so why should you buy grouper and get sea bass?” said Dr. Donna Blythe, a Miami specialist in fish toxins whose family includes fishermen. “They sell red snapper on every menu, and there just isn’t that much red snapper out there.” Other common problems: scal- are chunks of shark, frozen shrimp overwhelmed with breading, cheap Canadian cod masquerading as expensive New Zealand orange roughy, fish al- leged to be “fresh” that is weeks old or even previously frozen. To honest merchants in the sea- food industry, such deception just contributes to a swell of distrust giving fish a bad name. It is one reason much of the industry is lobbying for better inspection. Some segments of the food in- dustry are not willing to wait for the federal government to strengthen its surveillance and boost public confidence in seafood. “If the consumer buys one thing and finds out its something else, or gets fish from tainted waters, it affects the whole business,” said Jack Partridge, vice president for public affairs of The Kroger Co. “We have become a little impa- tient.” Kroger is beginning a new re- quirement that all its seafood sup- pliers participate in a voluntary fish inspection program run by the Commerce Department’s National Marine Fisheries Service. Suppli- ers will have to pay for the inspec- tion service if they want to contin- ue selling to Kroger, Partridge said, at least until a new surveil- lance system is in place.

        "ocr_text": "Farm pesticide used tn Florida may be banned, restricted by EPA By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Envi- ronmental Protection Agency is nearing a multibillion dollar deci- sion on how to restrict one of the country’s most widely used farm pesticides after receiving studies suggesting that high doses of Man- cozeb can cause cancer in laborato- ry animals. “- + The restriction ‘“‘could apply to some crop: or it could apply to all crops,” EPA official Rick Tins- worth said Monday. “‘We haven’t made a final decision.”’ For nearly three decades, farm- ers in Florida and around the world have sprayed thousands of tons of Mancozeb and related substances such as Maneb to produce shiny apples, disease-free potatoes, spot- less tomatoes and about 70 other -farm products. Rohm and Haas Co. and Du- Pont, the -major manufacturers, continue«c’ to insist their product is safe. They said it is used throughout the country to treat $12 billion worth of crops in the United States miles amathane GOR hillinan the country to treat $12 billion worth of crops in the United States annually, plus another $85 billion worth overseas. Mancozeb is a relatively inex- pensive chemical used by farmers and home gardeners to kill a broad range of funguses, from leaf spot on tomatoes to downy mildew and purple blotch on onions. It is applied widely — either from sprayexs or from aerial crop- dusters — in Florida where plant funguses thrive. “In Florida, virtually al) rnajor commercially grown vegetables are protected by fungicides be- cause there are few alternatives suited to Florida’s climate and soil types, ” DuPont said in a statement released Monday. The EPA opened a special re- view of Mancozeb and related com- pounds two years ago because pre- liminary studies showed that experimental animals contracted thyroid cancer after eating large doses of the chemical. This sum- mer, the EPA received two new studies that confirmed and strengthened the earlier findings, officials said Monday. EPA data sketchy One study, submitted by Du- Pont three weeks ago, found that 34 out of 61 male rats developed tu- mors when fed high doses of Man- cozeb for one to two years. Of these, 14 of the tumors were found by the DuPont study to be malig- nant. Another, unpublished study y North Carolina confirmed that one of the chemical impurities in Man- cozeb also was a cancer-causer in laboratory animals. Despite two years of study, however, the EPA still has only sketchy data on how much residue of Mancozeb spraying remains on typical grapes, apples, tomatoes and other produce that appears on supermarket shelves. The U.S. De- partment of Agriculture has sent EPA a stack of computer printouts which it said demonstrates that Mancozeb residues “are either non- detectable or are present at mini- mal levels” in food samples rou- tinely collected by the states. “It’s a real tough decision,” said Tinsworth, head of the EPA’s pesti- cide review division. “They (Man- cozeb and related fungicides) are in a risk category that we consider serious and obviously some action has to be taken. “We are concerned about the risk, but on the other hand, we believe the actual level of residue on fruits and vegetables by the time they reach the grocery stores will be a lot less than what we have had to assume based on the maxi- mum quantities of the chemical which are currently approved for use. Tinsworth and his staff are in the last stages of preparing a pro- posed list of crops on which Manco- zeb use would be restricted — either immediately or after further study. According to an early draft of the decision prepared several months ago, the EPA would pro- pose the elimination of Mancozeb and related compounds on 20 crops, including: onions, tomatoes, mus- tard greens, collards, beans, pota- toes, oranges, celery, carrots, peaches, broccoli, grapes and ap- ples. Number of crops uncertain Tinsworth declined to say how many crops would be named in the EPA order, adding only, “It will be much more than one.” The overall effect of the order, he said, will be to restrict the use of the fungicide sufficiently to make sure a person eating a variety of fruits and vege- tables will not incur more than a minimal risk of cancer. Under the early draft, the EPA would issue a proposed ban ‘later this year but not actually prevent farmers from using the fungicide until after an 18-month study aimed at determining the actual pesticide residues on food reaching consumers. However Tinsworth said Monday the EPA may order the immediate suspension of Man- cozeb on some crops. EPA officials said the decision is likely to be announced in late September, after a last round of reviews involving EPA administra- tor William Reilly. Because it is such a widely used, effective chemical, the prospect of curbing Mancozeb use has present- ed the Bush administration with one of its thorniest environmental decisions so far. Among the compli- cations is that none of the potential alternative chemicals has been shown to be free of risks. The early EPA draft decision, first reported by the newsletter Pesticide and Toxic Chemical News, said: “Alternatives . . . exist for all food crops with the excep- tion of processed sweet corn, mush- rooms, lettuce and spinach. The major alternatives are captan and chlorothanil.” One government pesticide ex- pert, Charles Benbrook of the Na- tional Academy of Sciences, said that, in his opinion, Mancozeb and related pesticides may pose a caer public health risk than Alar.

        "ocr_text": " S. African critics say sanctions likely BY MARCIA KUNSTEL . Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Anti-apart- heid forces in Congress are prom- ising to fire up a new campaign of economic punishment against South Africa if the government to be elected there Wednesday fails ‘to move quickly toward ending white rule. For the first time in eight years, congressional supporters of sanc- tions are encouraged that the White House might join their cause, or at least not try to thwart it entirely, if South Africa refuses to embrace democratic policies in coming months. There is less optimism that the new South African government will give a share of power to the coun- try’s black majority, who now have no voice on the national level and will not vote Wednesday in parlia- mentary elections, _ The man expected to become president is Frederik W. de Klerk, who as acting president since Aug. 15 repeatedly has ordered the sti- 6 6 I hope that Mr. de Klerk will move in a direction that is quite different from his own political history. 5 5 — Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich. fling of dissent, from mass arrests to the halting of peaceful rallies and marches protesting the elec- tion. “l frankly think there has been no hard evidence that the election in South Africa will yield any funda- mental change in policy,” said U.S. Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), chairman of the subcommittee on Africa of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “T hope that Mr. de Klerk will move in a direction that is quite different from his own political history, but in his whole history, he has not been associated with a single reformist initiative and in many aspects was more conserva- tive than (former President P.W.) Botha. If nothing happens by early next year, we in Congress will move very quickly to enact sanc- tions legislation.” One proposal drawing support is by Walter Fauntroy, Democrat from Washington, D.C., who wants to prohibit U.S. banks from rene- gotiating about $2.6 billion in loans to South Africa which come due in June. He would equate reschedul- ing with new loans, which are not permitted under the 1986 sanc- tions law. The measure might be a sepa- rate bill pushed on a fast track or become part of an omnibus sanc- tions bill that Fauntroy said is being prepared by a South Africa working group in the House of Representatives. Wolpe, who has been trying to fashion an approach to sanctions acceptable to congressional moder- ates and to the Bush administra- tion, said three quick moves in Pretoria are necessary to retard the drive for sanctions here: end- ing the state of emergency that is in its fourth year, releasing all of what he called “political prisoners” and removing restrictions that cur- tail or prohibit activities of political groups. A senior administration official cited the same three conditions, but in an interview, he would not specify either a time frame for action or the response the White House would make if the condi- tions are not met. South Africa’s ruling National Party this week faces one of its most serious challenges since it came to power in 1948. Its support is believed to be eroding on both the right — to the Conservative Party — and on the left — to a new Democratic Party that is a coalition of three moderately liber- al parties.

        "ocr_text": "Growers lose top — fungicides Halt affects 60 crops, including many in state By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Under pres- sure from the Environmental Pro- tection Agency, manufacturers an- nounced Wednesday they will discontinue sales of two fungicides widely used in Florida on up to 60 crops ranging from lettuce to cel- ery to strawberries. The three manufacturers said they still consider Mancozeb and Maneb safe, and they will continue to market the chemicals for use on 13 other major crops, including tomatoes, wheat and onions. The decision came as the EPA neared a decision on whether to ban the use of the two chemicals entire- ly after tests showed large doses can cause cancer in laboratory ani- mals. The fungicide withdrawals cre- ate a serious problem for Florida growers, said George Agrios, chair- man of the plant pathology depart- ment at the University of Florida in Gainesville. With its subtropical climate conducive to fungus growth, Flori- da depends on fungicides more than any other state. Maneb and Manco- zeb are used widely on vegetables but not on sugar cane or citrus fruits, the state’s leading crops. Maneb and Mancozeb are the only two types of a fungicide class called ethylene bis dithiocarbon- ate, or EBDC, still on the market in Florida. “We frankly don’t have answers to all problems created by the fungicide withdrawals,’ Agrios said. Florida growers also are at a disadvantage because their land accounts for a small percentage of agricultural land nationwide. They fear chemical companies will be less willing to develop products mainly needed only in Florida. “It costs $80 million to develop a new fungicide and bring it regis- tration. ... Minor crops will suf- fer,” said Richard Raid, plant pa- thologist at the Everglades Research Center in Belle Glade. Florida grower: ‘There is no substitute’ “We're one of the largest celery producers but only use 15,000 acres. That’s minuscule compared to other crops like corn.” Celery is one of the crops that wiil be affected by the chemicals’ withdrawal. ‘ans group “praised the three manufacturers for taking ‘an unprecedented and <fesponsible step” and at the same tithe called on the EPA to restrict ~eyen further the use of Mancozeb sand Maneb, which are used to pre- «Vent crop loss from fungi. 2 EPA spokesman John Kasper <said withdrawing the chemicals for “use on certain crops is “a good first ‘2. “But we have to review the >proposal,”’ he said, “and it is entire- sly, possible that we could ask them -t@ eliminate even more uses to “¥@duce the risk even further.” - . {Kasper said consumers have no cause for concern, but they can ~minimize the risk of eating pesti- cide residues by thoroughly wash- -ing and, if possible, peeling fruits -and vegetables. ~ ~~ Mancozeb and Maneb have been used since 1963 to protect crops from wilt, blight and other fungi. _The chemicals are popular among -farmers because they are cheap -and protect many crops from a ‘broad range of plant diseases. -..Some Florida growers depend on Maneb and Mancozeb for their -livelihood. “It’s going to be very difficult,” said pepper grower Ted Winsbert of Boynton Beach. “There is no good substitute for Maneb, which has EPA clearance.* Maneb is the only approved fun- gicide for endive, escarole and pep- pers. It also has been one of the mainstays to fight downy mildew on lettuce. Downy mildew is a white powdery lesion that can dev- astate lettuce crops. “It could be deterimental to our business. We couldn’t control bac- terial leaf spot without Maneb,” said pepper grower Billy DuBois Jr. of Boynton Beach. The fungicides’ partial removal from the market is likely to raise the cost of vegetables and fruits as farmers are forced to use more costly pesticides. Some specialists predicted consumers will find more oranges and apples reaching the supermarkets with surface blemishes. Some leafy vegetables, such as spinach and collard greens, may become harder to find in the markets, especially in off-seasons. The three manufacturers — Du Pont, Pennwalt and Rohm and Haas — said they were taking the action voluntarily, in hopes that further research would dispel fears that the chemicals’ residues might cause cancer in humans. They say little, if any, of the pesticide actual- ly remains on fruits and vegetables in supermarkets because of wash- ing and processing. “By acting now to suspend cer- tain uses, we hope to maintain public confidence in these prod- ucts,” the companies said in a joint statement. Company officials said they will curtail the use of Mancozeb and Maneb by issuing new labels for all packages of the chemical now in the hands of distributors and for new packages yet to be shipped. The new labels will be applied between now and the end of the year, the officials said. Rohm and Haas spokesman George Bochanski said that once the new labels are applied, farmers would be violating the federal pes- ticide law if they spray the chemi- cals on one of the 60 crops for which they are no longer approved. But farmers who have the pesti- cides on hand will not be barred from using them on this fall’s crops, he said. Company officials have said Mancozeb and Maneb are used to protect some $10 billion worth of crops annually in the United States and another $85 billion worth of crops abroad. A Rohm and Haas spokesman said Wednesday’s action does not affect the company’s overseas sales of the chemical. But he said the company would notify regula- tory authorities in foreign coun- tries of the new curbs in the United States. Staff writer Jane Victoria Smith contributed to this report.

        "ocr_text": "Rabin visits U.S., snubs Egyptian peace plan By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service PHILADELPHIA — Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, visiting to smooth ruffled relations with the United States, Sunday dismissed as “not rele- vant” an Egyptian proposal eyed with some favor in Washington and contend- ed the Bush administration will endan- ger the peace process if it grants PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat a visa to enter the country. - Although Rabin said he returns home with a message that his country Y 6 Palestinians killed 7A “is in good shape” with the American government, his comments regarding a 10-point Egyptian peace initiative put him at odds with reported U.S. hopes that the plan might reinvigorate the practically dormant peace process. Rabin, who spoke at an Israel Bonds convention and a brief news conference, said the initiative put forth by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak “is not rele- vant because we don’t have to negotiate with Egypt.” Rabin’s position also conflicts with the sentiment of his own party leader, Israeli Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who Sunday welcomed the Egyptian initiative, according to reports from Jerusalem. “The key issue is how to start (the peace process), not where to go,” said Rabin, referring to the refusal of Pales- tinians living in the Israeli-occupied territories to negotiate under Israel’s conditions. The Egyptian plan seeks to set conditions more acceptable to Pal- estinians, including an Israeli commit- ment to the principle of exchanging occupied territory for a peace agree- ment. Rabin, who met Friday with top administration officials, refused to say whether he had asked them to deny a visa to Arafat. But he said Arafat's faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Fa- tah, recently sent “negative signals” by calling for an escalation of violence in the occupied territories. It would “look like a setback to the hope of peace if this guy will appear before the United Nations General Assembly,” Rabin said. Arafat is not known to have requested a visa, but this past weekend, a newspaper in Saudi Arabia fed speculation by report- ing that he plans to come with a delegation from non-al‘gned na- tions to the U.N. session that opens Sept. 25. The U.S. government refused to grant Arafat a visa last fall. How- ever, a denial would be more com- plicated this year, because the State Department opened a dia- logue with the PLO after Arafat modified his stance on Israel and on terrorism. Rabin also said that his talks in the White House — with national security advise Brent Scowcroft — were intended “‘to clarify some is- sues that it might be were not understood well by both sides about a certain recent event.” He appar- ently was referring to Israel’s kid- napping of a Lebanese Moslem cleric, Sheikh Abdel Karem Obeid, Rabin: ‘The key issue is how to start, not where to go.’ which sparked an international cri- sis and was criticized by President Bush. Peres will be in the United States next week for an economic conference, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens is to come for the U.N. opening, and Prime Minister Palm Beach Post - September 11, 1989 this year. The meeting Rabin attended Sunday in Philadelphia is an impor- tant gathering of Americans in- volved in selling Israel Bonds, a source of billion of dollars of in- come for Israel. The bonds are essentially long- term loans to Israel, for which the investor receives interest pegged to the amount of investment. Most individual investors get a 4 percent return on smaller investments, while institutional investors can earn as much as the prime rate minus one-half percent. Despite the controversies sur- rounding Israel, officials of the fund-raising drive said bond sales are 7 percent higher than they were at this time last year, and that they hope to sell a record $700 million of bonds this year. After Rabin’s public appear- ances, he said he planned to meet with the family of Rita Levine, a 39-year-old American attorney who died several days after a July 6 incident in which a Palestinian grabbed the wheel of a Jerusalem- bound bus and drove it into a ra- vine. \f"

Like many Missourians, she was confused -Ybout the Supreme Court's July 3 abortion ruling, Be- Supreme Court decision was based on ¢ Mis- cause souri law, the decision affected the state immediately. ~ Gina, a high school graduate who asked that her | name be withheld to protect her privacy, at first “feared that the court voted to make abortion illegal in “Missouri, She considered driving to a clinic in Illinois _ Then-a friend told her that private clinics still are | eo to perform abortions, even though abortions Missouri publie hospitals are banned, Afler a positive pregnancy test, Gina went to an ‘abortion clinie Tuesday and spoke to a staff counselor ‘about her options: keeping the baby, adoption or abor- ‘ion, After the session, she chose abortion, As she waited her tum in the “procedure room,\" «she said, “I can afford to raise one by myself, but how pan | aor two!” Ten weeks after the court handed down its complex ruling on abortion, the consequences are becoming ‘Clearer in the state that passed — and had upheld — the most extensive curbs on abortion in the nation, \"What has happened in Missouri is an indication of ‘what may happen next year in other states as legisla: ture after legislature takes up restrictions similar to the Missouri law, _.. Inlerviews with Missouri officials and activists on _ Various sides of the abortion controversy produced this ‘snapshot; ®Private clinics, which perform the vast majority of Missouri abortions, have continued conducting them without interference, This will not change unless the slate Legislature passes new anti-abortion laws, which seems unlikely for at least a year, WObtaining an abortion in a hospital has become more difficult, even for women with medical complica- tions. The big teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Missouri have stopped tions, in keeping with the court's finding that i stale had the right to ban abortions in public buildings, BEven though abortion remains legal at private clinies, the number of abortions by the state's {wo largest abortion clinics in July fell by about 20 per: cent from last year’s levels. The clinies speculated that the downturn probably reflected temporary confusion over whether the Supreme Court had banned all abor: tions. In August, the second month after the court deci- sion, abortions at the (wo clinics approached or equaled their August 1968 totals. 8 Few if any abortions are being performed in any Missouri facility beyond the 20th week of pregnancy, That is the point at which the Supreme Court said Mis- souri authorities could require physicians to perform tests to determine whether the fetus could survive out: side the womb, This “viability” provision has had little practical meaning in Missouri, because private clinics were nol conducting abortions beyond the 19th week of pregnancy. The court ruling at least has scrambled temporarily the polities of abortion in Missouri, where Catholies and Christian fundamentalists traditionally have pushed “pro-life” bills through the Legislature with only token opposition from “pro-choice” liberals, In the last two months, abortion rights groups have sprung up across a wide ideological band, And as “pro- choice” forces grow, Missouri's always potent “pro-life” movement has been going through anguished internal debates, “It's been a tough lime to decide what to do,” said Samuel Lee, the chief anti-abortion lobbyist, Some activists want to push a ban on all abortions except those necessary to save the life of the mother, Others favor more limited bills, such as a requirement that all women contemplating abortion first receive counseling from a government agency, “The Supreme Court has told the pro-life move: ment, ‘OK, we've opened the cookie jar, you can take as manly cookies as you Want. However, we may slap your hand at some point and you may lose all those, But we are not going to tell you when,’ Mr, Lee said, A statewide poll by the Missourinet organization in mid-August found that 48 percent of those surveyed wanted the Legislature to pass more restrictions on abortion, while 47 percent opposed further restrictions, Faced by a divided and angry public, legislators abor — who have passed previous “pro-life” bills by -to-1 mars gins have shown little inclination to act again soon, Most lawmakers want to “let the dust settle” until the “ issue clarifications, House Speaker Bob Griffin sa One reason, Mr, Griffin said, is that Missouri courts have yet to sort out legal issues that have surfaced since the Supreme Court left standing the bulk of the 1986 Missouri abortion law, Many of these grew out of the Supreme Court's decision not to strike down the law's preamble, which states that “the life of each hu: man being begins at conception,” Several suils have been filed that aim to take ad- vantage of that declaration. Legal actions include: BA federal suit claiming that the fetus being car ried by a female inmate at a Missouri state prison is be- ing wrongfully imprisoned, State Attorney General Wil- liam L. Webster, who defended the abortion law before the Supreme Court and reportedly intends to run for governor in 1902, has yet to respond, WA suit by a 20-year-old man convicted of drunken driving who contends that since life begins at concep- ton, he is 21, That would allow him to reclaim his driv: er’s license, which had been canceled under a law that deprives minors of their licenses when convicted of drunken driving uThe state attorney general’s office being asked for a legal opinion on whether a pregnant woman can claim a tax exemption for the fetus, on grounds that the fetus is a dependent, Despite the state's strong antiabortion sentiment, statistics indicate that for every four live births last year, there was one abortion, Figures compiled by the state health department showed that 17,382 legal abortions were performed in 1088 — an 11 percent decline since the abortion law passed the Legislature in 1986, The figures do not aceu- rately reflect how many Missouri women traveled out of stale to obtain abortions, but clinic operators said the number is considerable, Forty-nine percent of last year’s Missouri abortions were performed at Reproductive Health Services, the big, modern abortion clinic in St. Louis where Gina ended her pregnancy, Most of the others were carried out at two Planned Parenthood clinics, one in Kansas City and the other in Columbia, Last year, only 90 abortions were conducted in pub- lic facilities directly covered by the Supreme Court rul- ing, the state health department said. These were per- formed mainly at the teaching hospitals associated with the University of Missouri medical school, Fewer than 1 percent of Missouri abortions were in the teaching hospitals, and those cases in volved either women with deformed fetuses or with no money to pay even the $250 fee normally charged by a private abortion clinic for a first trimester abortion, In a case six weeks ago, a 24-year-old woman could not obtain an abortion at the university-affiliated hospi- tal in Kansas City after her 19-week-old fetus was found to have its heart outside the chest wall and abdominal organs outside the abdominal cavity, Doctors referred her to Comprehensive Health fo Women, a private abortion clinic in Kansas, where the procedure was performed, The clinic's executive direc tor said last week that her clinic recently had pe formed abortions on two other Missouri women with verely deformed fetuses who had been turned down b hospitals in their home state, Atlanta Journal-Constitution September 17, 1989 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bush Plans $1 Billion Sale of Tanks to Saudis He'll Woo Labor in Fight for Approval By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent WASHINGTON — The Bush ad- ministration, in its first venture into Middle East arms sales, has decid- ed to approve the sale of $1 billion worth of Abrams battle tanks to Saudi Arabia, congressional and diplomatic sources said Tuesday. The impending arms deal is said to involve 315 Abrams M-1Al main battle tanks, which are to be manufactured by General Dynamics in Lima, Ohio, and Warren, Mich. By law, Congress will have 50 days to consider the package once the administration sends up a pre- liminary written notification, If Congress does not veto the sale, it will go through automatically, As of late Tuesday, the written notifica- tion had not been delivered, but one congressional backer of Israel, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Calif) said, “A tank sale will be sent up.” The deal seems likely to cause political difficulties for a variety of pro-Israel congressmen and sena- tors who have often banded togeth- er to defeat previous arms pac destined for the Arab world, This time, according to informed sources, the administration has laid elaborate plans to solicit the United. Auto Workers and other labor un- ions in a lobbying effort aimed at emphasizing the number of jobs that will be created. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who prides himself as be- ing both pro-Israel and pro-labor, said through a spokesman Tuesday that he has “some reservations” about the proposed tank’sale and is asking “for more information.” As one sweetener for pro-Israel congressmen, the administration has reportedly decided not to equi the Abrams tanks with its most ad- vanced armor plating, This ad- vanced armor, made of layers of steel and depleted uranium, was in- troduced last ye as an upgrade designed to deflect projectiles from the latest Soviet-made tanks. The Saudi army has asked to buy Abrams tanks as replacements for older U.S.-made M-60s, which are now said to be deployed in the southern region of Saudi Arabia, close to the border of South Yemen. Saudi Arabia has traditionally bought most of its military planes, armored vehicles and other hard- ware from the United States. How- ever, the Saudis stunned Washing- ton in July 1988 by awarding a $12 billion arms package to Britain af: ter pro-Israel congressmen had held up a series of arms purchases, including a Saudi request for more F-15 fighters, At the time, a Saudi official was quoted as saying, “We would prefer to buy weapons from the United States. American technology is gen- erally superior, But we are not go- ing to pay billions of dollars to insulted. We are not masochists.” Pro-Israel congressmen are ex- pected to use the proposed Saudi arms sale as a lever to pry as many specific commitments as possible from the administration on its fu- ture policy toward the Middle East, One subject sure to be raised is the reported desire by the Saudis to acquire front-line Navy F-18 jets to replace the Saudi air force’s aging force of F-5 fighters, Israel's back- ers in Congress would like to block that sale entirely since the F-18s have sufficient range to strike Isra- el, according to informed sources. Another topic congressmen are expected to raise is whether the Bush administration plans to grant a visa to Palestine Liberation Or- ganization Chairman Yasser Arafat this fall so Mr, Arafat can address: the United Nations during its annu- al debate on Palestine, On Tuesday, even before the arms package arrived on the Hill, a group of 68 senators and 44 con- gressmen released a letter to Secre- tary of State James A. Baker III urg- ing denial of a visa to Mr. Arafat, Atlanta Constitution- September 27, 1989 \f"

I don't see any other alternatives in the near future,” Peres said of the proposal made by Egyptian Presi- dent Hosni Mubarak, who wants to hold a meeting in Cairo of Palestinians and Israeli leaders. Peres spoke as a flurry of diplomatic meetings on the peace process were taking place or being sched- uled in New York among American, Israeli and Egyptian officials. Peres did not directly threaten to end Israel's wrangling coalition government that includes his mod- erate Labor Party and the right-leaning Likud, But at a Brookings Institution meeting he emphasized that action is the cement that will hold Israel’s government together. “If somebody wants to keep the government intact, Palm Beach Post - September 28, 1989 the best way is to make a decision,” Peres said. “It is usually indecision which risks the existence of a government, and decisions, as painful as they may be, keep the government together.” Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, a leader of the Likud, met Wednesday afternoon in New York with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker to discuss the peace options and to lay the groundwork for a meeting today that is to include Arens, Baker and the Egyptian foreign minister. An Israeli spokesman reported that upon leaving the session with Baker, Arens said the United States should not push the Israelis to move too quickly to produce an answer to the Egyptian proposal. suggested a response may come Wednesday froiti the Israeli Cabinet, which will have had time to be bri by both Peres and Arens on their talks in the Unit States, marl Arens said he cannot make any final commiginént on behalf of his government. He also said Baker expressed full support for the Israeli elections plan and did not press for acceptance of the Mubarak conditions. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Capital gains tax fight turns to Senate By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Although the House supported a two-year cut Thursday in capital gains taxes by a large margin, the vote may still turn out to be only a fluke. Attention now turns to the Sen- ate, where the majority Democrats are publicly rock-solid against vot- ing any capital gains tax cut. How- ever, sources said the size of the House vote — 239-190 — stunned moderate and conservative Senate Democrats and will cause an- guished rethinking of the party’s capital adamant opposition’ to gains cuts. Late Thursday, the first crack appeared in the wall of Democratic opposition in the Senate when one conservative, Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., was described by his spokesman as “leaning in favor of a capital gains cut.’’ At least two others, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., and Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., were privately described as open to support a gains tax cut. The plan that won House en- dorsement had been introduced by ALLEN EYESTONE/Staff Photographe Accountant Richard Rampell: ‘It’s a victory for consumers.’ Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., and cheered on by President Bush as a means of stimulating business and jobs. The cuts would mainly benefit upper-bracket investors who want to minimize their taxes when they sell stocks and bonds. While keeping tax rates on wages and other earned income constant, the Jenkins bill would drop the tax rates from 33 percent to 19.6 percent on capital assets sold between September 1989 and ‘ December 1991. Part of the theory behind the bill is that investors will rush to cash in their long-term gains, thus bringing a windfall of tax revenue to the Treasury that would narrow the federal budget deficit for the next two years. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, opens hearings today on a Democratic alternative plan that would sprinkle smaller tax breaks of up to $330 to a broad middle-class constituency. Trea- Secretary Nicholas Brady, a former Wall Street investment ~abanker who is one of the architects “Gf lhe capital gains cut package, “<will be the first witness. »™ So far, the outlook in the Senate ‘remains that after several more “months of high-decibel oratory and “back-room arm twisting, the heavi- “ty Democratic Senate will probably brush aside capital gains cuts. Ac- Seording to this scenario, senators “Would opt instead for Bentsen’s -Super-IRA” plan to expand deduc- “tions for individual retirement ac- counts. Then, a few dozen senior sena- tors and House members will meet in a conference committee to write the final tax plan, which would then have to be put before both houses. One factor weakening chances for eventual approval of a capital gains cut is that most of the House Democrats who will be on the con- ference committee fought Tuesday to defeat the capital gains plan. They will be led by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IIl., who attacked the temporary capital gains cut as “a temporary feel-good revenue gimmick.” Under seniority precedents, Rostenkowski will almost certainly not give a place on the conference committee to Jenkins, the small- town North Georgia lawyer who spearheaded the block of 64 Demo- crats that won the day for the capital gains tax cuts. The defection of 64 House Dem- ocrats was a stinging blow to the new House leadership, and espe- cially to Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who had person- ally helped craft the Democratic alternative to the capital gains cut. The Democratic alternative includ- ed expanded IRA benefits for the middle class, a deficit reduction trust fund and an increase from 28 to 33 percent in the income taxes paid by those with incomes of more than $150 000 Democrats split 175-64 against the gains tax cut, while Republi- cans lined up 189-1 in favor. In the final hours of debate, Gephardt and his liberal allies sounded increasingly desperate. “Give the wealthiest people a $25,000 tax cut?” thundered Rep. Marty Russo, D-Ill. “This trickle- down theory never works, folks. This is outright, disgusting greed, and don’t paint it any other way.” Rep. Charles Hayes, D-IIlinois, a black congressman from inner- city Chicago, asked, “Where is our compassion? Our feeling for the homeless and those who need health care, who have no insur- ance? Don’t we think about them? I am getting sick and tired of this business of helping the poor by letting it trickle down from the rich.” Local Reps. Harry Johnston and Tom Lewis split over the issue. Lewis, a FPepublican from North Palm Beach, joined GOP lawmakers in supporting the capi- tal gains reduction. Johnston, a Democrat from West Palm Beach, sided with his party’s leadership in opposing it. “It will cause an expansion of capital money which will help cre- ate jobs and move the economy at a good clip,” Lewis said. Johnston, who said he agonized over the decision, concluded that the reduction’s “fiscal impact over the out-years was devastating, par- ticularly in the fourth and fifth year.” Over 10 years, the govern- ment would lose $21 billion, he said.

        "ocr_text": "Israel seeks $400 million loan backing U.S.: Soviet Jews’ homes cannot be in territories By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Israel has asked the U.S. government to guar- antee $400 million in loans to house an expected influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants but has raised sharp congressional questions by refusing to keep new emigré settlements out of the occupied territories. Israeli Finance Minister Shi- mon Peres outlined the proposal in a closed meeting with congressmen this week. He was asked to pledge that-Israel not direct the new Sovi- et immigrants to homes in the West Bank or Gaza Strip, whether or not thdse homes were financed by U.S.- guaranteed loans. -American policy prohibits the usé~in the territories of the $3 billion in U.S. aid that Israel re- ceives annually. “Some congressmen were de- scribed as uneasy with Peres’ re- fusal to make such a promise, as well as with the large amount of the request. “This is a very targeted loan program. We have to know more about the character of the (Israeli) prog ‘am — where will the housing bukit, who will get it, will they meet the income guidelines,” a con- gressional staff member said Fri- day. | “tne said it is very unlikely that Israel will get the full $400 million guarantee it requested and virtual- ly impossible that it will come all at one time. He suggested an initial installment of $40 million to $50 million is more realistic, followed by later guarantees as the Israeli program proceeds over several years. The housing loan guarantee program falls under the U.S. Agen- cy for International Development, which is authorized by Congress to guarantee a worldwide total of only $100 million in loans for fiscal year 1990, according to USAID spokesman John Metelsky. The housing is supposed to be built in developing countries for low-in- come residents, usually in urban areas, Peres admitted before leaving Washington Thursday that he had been unable to promise the con- gressmen that all the housing for Soviet emigrés will be built within the “green line,” the boundary which separates Israel from the Arab territories it occupied after the 1967 war. Yet he seemed confident that the deal would go through. “Mr. Peres left here with great opti- mism, saying he believes the ad- ministration will agree,” said Ruth Yaron, press counselor at the Israe- li Embassy. Yaron explained that the loans are only one part of a $3 billion Israeli program to absorb an ex- pected 100,000 Soviet Jewish emi- grés during the next three years. Palm Beach Post - September 30, 1989 The American-backed loans would not finance housing in the territo- ries, she said, but other sources of money might be used to build homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. She said $2 billion for immi- grant needs is to be supplied direct- ly from the Israeli budget. The other $1 billion is to come from $600 million in contributions worldwide and the $400 million in loans made under U.S. government guarantee. Yaron emphasized, as she said Peres did throughout his trip, that the loan guarantees are not an additional grant of money to Israel that would be taken from the U.S. budget. Matelsky of USAID said that with a U.S. government guarantee, private American lenders make loans “at rates that reflect the guarantee,” which are lower rates than normally available, \f"

        "ocr_text": "Forecast for Abortion Laws: Still Cloudy This Court Session 3 Pivotal Cases” May Be Months From a Hearing By Joseph Albright , Journal-Constitution Washingtes Bureaa WASHINGTON — Leaders of the national anti-abortion, move- ment, after issuing jubHant state- ments after the Supreme Court par- rowed a woman's abortion rere in July, have had second thoughts and are attacking the court for ere: Wwe legal “ehaos.” “The Court did net fu duty to say what the law js in i- fying its decision,” the National Right to Life Committee declares in a 29-page brief filed with the Su: preme Court.

The Right to Life document is one of more than a score of abor- tion briefs that have flo Into the court's computerized docket room in recent weeks. From all sides of the abortion issue, the legal papers call for the court to resolve the abortion issue clearly — their way. However, as the nine justices assemble Monday for their first closed conference of the fall term, there —_ a =e that the court is about to grant anyone’s wish for total clarity on sbovtian The court has put three aber- tion cases on its docket for the’ up- coming session. However, ed te tices appear to be in no m hurry. They have scheduled oral ar- guments on dozens of other’ cases in October and November, but the abortion cases have not been as- signed a date. Court observers said oral argu- ments on abortion will take’place in. ——— at = hapiages with, nay Conservative Justice Anthony M. oe ag may tip the balance in rulings on abortion rights. likely before spring or summer. By then, dozens of state legislatures will have met, and some may have ‘passed more stringent abortion laws than anything now facing the court's review. While any one of the three pending cases could result in fur- ther narrowing of abortion rights, particularly for teenagers, none of the three appears to corner the jus- tices and force them to decide whether to overrule the Roe v. Wade decision. That was the 1973 case that held that a woman’s privacy right allows her to decide to have an abortion without state interference during the first three months of pregnancy. As the Supreme Court’s makeup has become more conservative, five of the nine sitting justices have ex- pressed dissatisfaction with the “trimester” approach outlined in Roe. But the five have not found a ease in which they felt it was appro- priate to overrule Roe. In the Webster case decided July 3, the court upheld Missouri's right to ban abortions in public fa- cilities when abortion is not neces- sary to save a woman's life. The court also upheld a Missouri provi- sion requiring doctors to determine that a fetus is not “viable” before performing an abortion beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy. _ () ne nree the one that has scared abortion ' rights activists the most is an at- ! tempt by Illinois to impose stringent and expensive health regulations on abortion clinics. On Aug. 31, the Illinois attorney | general lessened those fears by de- - claring the state is “not asking this court to reconsider or overturn its decision in Roe v. Wade.” All the state is asking, the attor- ney general said, is that Illinois be allowed to regulate outpatient abor- tion clinics “to the same extent that it regulates all other outpatient sur- gical clinics.” Despite the state's disclaimer, attorneys for Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are gearing up for an all-out attack on the Illinois regulations. Abortion rights advocates fear that if the court upholds Illinois, other states will pass more and more restrictive health codes that could be used to harass abortion clinics. The Right to Life brief calls on the court to use the Illinois case as the vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Illinois case grew out of a decision by Illinois health officials to tighten their oversight of abor- tion clinics, in part because of a ange Sun-Times series in 1978 that found unscrupulous and mar- ginally qualified abortionists prac- ticing in Chicago clinics. About a dozen unreported deaths were dis- covered. The crackdown by Illinois was challenged successfully in 1985 by Dr. Richard Ragsdale, a physician who ran an abortion clinic in Rock- ford, Ill. The two other pending abortion cases turn on whether women younger than 18 have a right to ob- tain abortions without telling their parents. The Supreme Court has wres- tled repeatedly with state “parent notification” laws and deadlocked 4-4 on the issue when it last came up in December 1987. Since then, Anthony M. Kennedy, a conserva- tive, has joined the court. Justice Kennedy’s vote to restrict abortion rights in the Webster case may be a clue that he may tip the balance to a 5-4 majority in favor of approving state parental notification laws. An Ohio law requires a preg- nant minor to notify at least one a or guardian peters eet Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 1, 1989 physicians cannot perform abor ten notification. A Minnesota la requires that both parents be noti- fied, even if the parents are di- voreed and the minor does no know both parents’ addresses. Un der Minnesota law, the abortio cannot be performed until 48 hours after both parents have been noti fied. Ohio and Minnesota have in cluded a “judicial bypass” proce dure, as mandated by an earlier Su- preme Court decision. It allows pregnant minors to skip notifying a parent or parents if they go to court and convince a judge they are ma- ture enough to make the decision on their own. Cases Test States’ Right to Regulate WASHINGTON — Here is a summary of the abortion cases the Supreme Court will consider this year: Turnock v. Ragsdale Dr. Richard Ragsdale, an Illinois gyne- cologist, has convinced lower courts that II- linois health authorities unjustly interfered with his right to perform abortions by re- quiring him to install costly, unnecessary surgical equipment in his abortion clinic. Now the chief Illinois public health official, Bernard Turnock, is asking the Supreme Court to overrule the lower courts, main- taining that health authorities must have a right to regulate health conditions. Ohio v. Akron Center For Health In 1986, “pro-choice” forces, led by an Akron abortion clinic, obtained a federal court injunction that has blocked the imple- mentation of a 1985 Ohio parental consent statute. That law would have required a physician to give a minor's parent or guard- ian 24 hours notice before performing an abortion, unless the minor obtained a judge’s permission. The lower courts found that Ohio's “judicial bypass” did not guaran- tee a pregnant minor's anonymity. Ohio is asking the high court to declare the state law proper, contending there is no constitu- tional need for a “judicial bypass,” Hodgson v. State of Minnesota In 1983, Dr. Janet Hodgson and other abortion rights plaintiffs filed suit challeng- ing a 1981 Minnesota law that requires a mi- nor to notify both of her parents before hav- ing an abortion — even in cases when the pregnant minor doesn't know both of her parents’ whereabouts. The only exception is a “judicial bypass” procedure, by which a pregnant minor could ask a judge to ap- prove her abortion. After conflicting deci- sions by lower courts, the Minnesota law is in abeyance pending a Supreme Court re- view. — Joseph All ight \f"

        "ocr_text": "Americans ambivalent about Israeli struggle @ Second of three parts By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Ameri- can public doesn’t quite know what to think about Israel. A Cox Newspapers poll finds that a plurality of Americans con- tinue to sympathize with the Jew- ish state in its struggle with the Palestinians. Yet the sympathy seems to be tinged with mistrust. Only 29 per- cent of respondents agreed that “the U.S. can trust Israel to keep @ By 71 percent to 6 percent, those polled agreed that ‘‘Palestin- ian refugees who lived in Israel before the 1948 Arab-Israeli war should be allowed by Israel to re- turn to their homes.” Despite the much-publicized Is- raeli “peace initiative” launched in April by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the poll found that Shamir has a long way to go to establish himself in American eyes as a peacemaker. Diplomatic talks with PLO The poll asked Americans “Who do you think is making a greater contribution to peace in the Middle East — Yitzhak Shamir or Yasser Arafat?” The result was 19 percent Shamir and 11 percent Arafat. An- other 22 percent of the American public said “neither.” Questions about the PLO elicit- ed a muddle of apparently conflict- ing opinions. * Mi By 65 percent to 14 percent, Americans favored continuation of the U.S. diplomatic talks with the PLO that were begun in Tunisia last year over Israel’s objections. @ Yet by 46 percent to 28 per- cent, the same respondents agreed that “the PLO is a worldwide ter- rorist group that should not be given any official recognition by the United States.”’ @ Even so, the public agreed by 64 percent to 12 percent that Israel “should agree to negotiate directly with the PLO for a peace settle- ment.” No clear consensus emerged on whether Israel has done a good job in policing disturbances on the West Bank and Gaza. Thirty-two TROUBLE IN THE PROMISED LAND America’s interests in mind when Israel carries out its own foreign operations.” A larger group — 45 percent — disagreed, while the rest didn’t give an answer. Overall, the poll portrays an America that is confused and sometimes not well-informed about Israel. This was the picture nad been “too harsh,” while 7 per- cent said ‘‘too lenient” and 30 per- cent said ‘‘about right.” In Israel, there is a widespread conviction that the views of Ameri- cans are being tainted by news reports slanted in favor of Pales- tinian protesters. However, most Americans don't share that perception. When asked to describe the coverage of events in the Middle East on televi- sion and in the newspapers, 53 percent said the coverage is “equally fair to both sides,” while 16 percent said it was “biased in favor of Israel,” and 5 percent said it was “biased in favor of the Pales- tinians.” Fighting didn’t dim support The public’s tendency to favor _ Israel against the Palestinians has apparently not changed during the past six months, despite bloodshed in the occupied territories, the an- nouncement of an American hos- tage’s execution in Lebanon follow- ing Israel’s kidnapping of a Lebanese Moslem sheik and the disclosure that several Israeli ex- soldiers had helped train the mili- tia of a Colombian drug exporter. The poll asked people whether their opinion toward Israel had changed as a result of ‘Israel’s handling of the Palestinian protests on the West Bank.” Fifty-seven percent said their opinion was “about the same.” Another 18 per- cent said “less favorable,” while 5 percent said ‘‘more favorable.” In April, a Roper Poll spon- sored by the American Jewish Committee asked Americans whether they sympathized more with the Israelis or with the Pales- tinians. The Roper survey found 34 percent of the public siding with that emerged from telephone inter- views with 1,611 randomly chosen people throughout every state be- tween Sept. 24 and Oct. 1. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. The predominant U.S. opinion remains that Israel is “very impor- tant” to American defense inter- ests. Thus even during Washing- ton’s perennial budget squeeze, 52 percent of the public said this coun- try should either maintain or in- crease its annual $1.8 billion in military aid to Israel.

For him, one evidence is that local Jewish communities are col- lecting more in charitable dona- tions today but allocating less for Israel. The Jewish Agency, which uses such contributions to run so- cial and education programs in Israel, will have a regular budget of $360 million for fiscal 1989-90, a $28 million drop from the previous year. “We’re in the middle of a change in the generations,” Allen said. ‘Increasingly the (American Jewish) leadership grew up as con- scious human beings always having Israel, not having been through World War II or the creation of the state. Any movement, any ideolo- gy, has difficulty maintaining pas- sion over time.” Palm Beach Post - October 25, 1989 (Note: Lou Salome wrote Part 1) \f"

Anderson, the hostage held longest in Lebanon, have asked fellow Americans to com- memorate his fifth successive birthday in captivity today by ringing school bells, wearing yellow ribbons and flickering their car headlights. Mr. Anderson, the chief Mid- dle East correspondent of The Associated Press, was forced into a Mercedes on a Beirut street after a tennis game March 16, 1985. Since then, he has spent 1,686 days in the hands of his Islamic fundamen- talist captors — almost four times as long as the Americans who were held hostage in Iran during the Carter administration. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 27, 1989 Seven other Americans also are captives in Lebanon, along with two West Germans, two Swiss, four Britons, one Irish- man and one Italian. According to accounts of a French hostage released last year, Mr. Anderson on a typical day spends nearly all his hours chained to a wall, with a few short breaks to exercise and to use the toilet. To mark Mr. Anderson’s 42nd birthday, relatives of pre- sent and former hostages plan to gather this morning for a Catholic “Mass of Hope” at Georgetown University in Wash- ington. They will be joined by journalists, members of Con- gress and activists in No Great- er Love, a non-profit organiza- tion that serves as a support group for hostage families. a ee US. journalist Terry A. Ander- son’s kidnappers released this photo of him Oct. 22, 1988. Mr. Anderson’s sister, Peggy Say, who is scheduled to speak at the Mass, said in an interview Thursday, “I think it is tragic for all of us that we have to mark his fifth birthday as a hos- tage. And we have no assur- ances that we won’t someday be marking his 10th.” - Congress has passed a joint: resolution designating today ds National Hostage Awareness Day. \f"

Some of the hostages were kept in isolation and some were tortured. They were released Jan. 20, 1981. An American Nightmare That Lasted 444 Days By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — It was a typical morn- ing at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. A mob of Iranians was milling about and shouting, “Give us the Shah! Death to the Shah!” Suddenly on that rainy Nov. 4, 1979, one of the young militants produced bolt cutters and clipped the heavy chain, and a surge of bodies broke through the gates. Others scaled the wall. The embassy takeover had begun, set- Hine off an episode that would end 444 days ater. The young Iranian radicals who routine- ly burned U.S. flags and screamed slogans around the “nest of spies” had gotten ram- bunctious before, when they, broke into the embassy the previous February. At that time, a remnant of the old Irani- an government was trying to maintain order. Pressure on the attackers to retreat came even from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader who had returned from exile when growing turmoil prompted the hated Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, friend of America, to flee. By November, the circumstances were different. The Iranian military had fallen apart; the ayatollah’s people had gained de- cisive power; and, most importantly, the Carter administration had agreed to let the terminally ill Shah enter the United States for medical treatment at a New York hospital. This time nobody tried to stop the mili- tants from taking and keeping control of the eapanty, nicknamed Fort Apache by its staff. The Marine guards on duty — there were fewer than a score in Tehran, even with reinforcements sent in previous days — had been ordered not to fire anything but tear gas at the invaders. A few American staffers and visitors managed to escape out a back door, but more than 60 would remain captives of the Iranians. The Iranians released 13 blacks and women about two weeks after the takeover, but only one other hostage was released, for health reasons, before the remaining 52 fi- nally flew out on Jan. 20, 1981, in a deal the Carter administration finally struck after months of false hopes, one abortive rescue mission and more than a year in which many Americans thought their country was held hostage, not just their fellow citizens.

        "ocr_text": "10 Years Later, Former Hostages Trying to Catch Up By Marcia Kunstel And Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — A few steep in bitterness, and some still have nightmares. Others claim no ill effects. But by and large, the 52 Americans taken hostage by Ira- nian militants a decade ago are forging ahead with lives remark- ably well-repaired after 444 days of terror. One trend to emerge from in- terviews with 43 of the former hostages is that none of the top Foreign Service and military offi- cers at the embassy has reached the pinnacle of their professions. One is deputy chief of mission in Thailand, and two others are consuls general in Tel Aviv, Isra- el, and Dubai, United Arab Emir- ates. But none of the career dip- lomats taken captive Nov. 4, 1979, has become an ambassador. And none of the military men has made general or holds an impor- tant military command. Most of the former captives describe themselves as having grown personally from their or: deals. None seems too emotional: ly or psychologically debilitated to get back into some rhythm of normal living, though several complained they were viewed for too long as something between a celebrity and a freak. A half-dozen of the former hostages — considered by most Americans to be heroes for suf: fering an array of deprivations, humiliation and sometimes tor- ture — believe their captivity in Iran hindered their careers. “It hurt my career in many ways,” said Donald R. Hohman, remembered as the Army medic who made heroic efforts to get treatment for the captives. “Now there’s still a sneaking suspicion when I ask for a resi- dency or something that I’m ask- ing for a favor because I was a hostage. I think they're more cau- tious about giving me anything than they are about others,” said Chief Warrant Officer Hohman, now a physician’s assistant at Fort Knox, Ky. “Probably statistically you could make it stick that Foreign Service officers who went through the Iran experience didn’t do well career-wise, for reasons I can’t quite tell you,” State p said John E. Graves, 62, counselor for public affairs at the U.S. Em- bassy in Morocco. Mr. Graves said he is being forced to retire for having failed to win promotion for five successive years. Victor L. Tomseth, 48, who has advanced as far in the Foreign Service as any of the ex-hostages, said from Bangkok, Thailand, that the State Department put many careers on temporary hold by placing the newly released hos: tages in “training positions” for the first year. The motive was not “maliciousness” but a genuine concern for the hostages and their families, said Mr. Tomseth, deputy chief of mission in Thailand. “The initial reaction of the State Department was to view these people as somewhat out of the ordinary, as people who need: ed treatment,” he said. “From my perspective, what I wanted to do was go back to work and be normal.” Opinion is divided among For: eign Service officers as to how the former hostages fared, but a Vita Engle, said, “If someone feels unfairly treated, there is a grievance procedure that may be followed. We're distressed that some of the hostages feel they were treated differently than any- one else,” _ Sixteen former hostages said they are on active duty with the Foreign Service and nine are on active military duty. One of the former hostages, William Francis Keough Jr., died in 1985 of Lou Gehrig's disease. Twenty-three others have left the government, one has dropped out of sight, and one remains a pri- . vate’ businessman, One, former Marine Sgt. Wil- liam Gallegos, is unemployed in Denver even though he has a col- lege degree in criminal justice. At least 10 have had mar: ‘riages break up since their re- turn, Two have developed cancer. Retired Army Col. Leland J. Hol- land said his doctors attribute his ree to the stress of captivity in ran. While most of the former cap- tives interviewed expreseed satis: faction with the course their lives have taken, none has reached the executive suites of corporate Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 29, 1989 > \fFormer Hostages America or distinguished posi- tions in academia. One reason may be that the hostage experi- ence prompted some. to redefine their notion of success. ’ Charles W. Scott, who retired as an Army colonel upon release, went home to suburban Atlanta and started a career as a public speaker and adviser to U.S. com- panies with business in the Mid- dle East. He makes up to $2,000 rspeech, | Mr. Scott has been perhaps the most financially successful of the former hostages, but he liter- ally carries scars from his ordeal as a prisoner. Last year, he had surgery to correct spinal fractures suffered in “a little torture session.” y Retired Air Force Col. Thom- as E. Schaefer likewise traded in his uniform for the sneaking cir- cuit. He lives in Arizona, with his life’s priorities “revamped and revised.” “I do know that I have a great- er appreciation of life and a greater appreciation of family re- lationships,” he said. “I don’t take ‘life too seriously anymore. The little things in life don’t seem to be bothering me as much.” _ Some had trouble making the transition into freedom, and a few had delayed reactions. “About 18 months after my re- lease, the time bomb went off,” said Moorhead C. Kennedy Jr., who still suffers nightmares. “I went through psychotherapy, and I got,a lot out of it.” Mr, Kennedy, an economic and commercial officer in Iran, left the diplomatic service and found a way to address what he believes to be bad U.S. foreign policy. He runs a non-profit pro- gram out of New York that teach- es young people to understand complex foreign events — such as hostage-takings — by staging sim- | - ulations of them. Generally, the men who re- mained in the military described themselves as the least affected. “You don’t get promoted for being a prisoner. I don’t think it hurt either,” said Lt. Col. Paul M. Needham Jr., who served a stint in the Pentagon and now teaches at the Air Command and Staff College in Montgomery, Ala. “People who had troubles be- fore have them now,” he said. “People who were well-adjusted still are.” 7 In the diplomatic service, sev- eral young officers have moved up to senior positions from which they are in line to be considered for ambassadorships. But only the highest-ranking of the former hos- tages, Bruce Laingen, is known to have been seriously considered for an ambassadorship. Mr. Laingen’s name was put forward by the State Department in the early 1980s to be ambassa- dor to one of America’s NATO al- lies, sources said. However, for unknown reasons, the Reagan’ White House did not send Mr. Laingen’s nomination to the Con- gress, the sources said. Mr. Laingen, who was the top official at the embassy in Tehran as charge d'affaires, expressed no « hard feelings. But a former subor- - ' dinate in Iran speculated that the Reagan White House was afraid Mr. Laingen’s nomination would . invite unwanted congressiona questions on Iran. ho ‘| feel now that any type of problem life puts in front of me, | can conquer it because | conquered 444 days in a small room,’ — Rody “Rocky” Slekmann ‘People always say | need a lobotomy, but I main- }] tain that | don’t hold a grudge against Iranians in We general. ...

As envisioned, the library would be about twice as big and almost twice as expensive as the Carter library in Atlanta, which has only four years of records to house. It is not known whether the former president will devote any of his personal funds to complete the library, but he already has been raising funds for the project.

        "ocr_text": "- BERLIN — Less than a day after East German soldier Frank Behnstedt heard that the Berlin Wall was open, he pulled off his c _ for good. private’s uniform, hid in the trunk of his friend's car and sneaked into West Berlin to stay Unhappily for East German leader Egon Krenz, his world- shaking pronouncements in the past week have not yet cut off the ‘flow of bright, frustrated young _ people such as Mr. Behnstedt ~~ who are determined to flee. By twos and threes and in an 1 occasional busload, they came ) Sunday to an out-of-the-way re- ception center known as Marien- felde, near West Berlin’s Tempel- ' hof Airport, the hub of the 1948 8 Berlin Airlift. Marienfelde’s doors were | | locked to journalists, but half a Tab Gran ai i ails Ben was und refuge cnr Head he eal hi mther an sea hie as hee, » 4 dozen former East Berliners in- terviewed as they hung around outside said the center was ac- commodating at least 2,000 men, women and children not planning » to return to the East. “T had only a military ID, not a passport, so they wouldn’t have > let me go through,” explained Mr. © Behnstedt, who deserted from his > truck unit in the East German People’s Army on Friday. “If they had caught me, it would have been 10 years in prison for sure.” Mr. Behnstedt phoned his mother in East Germany to break the news that he had gone AWOL Still Leave for Fresh Start and never would return. “They said they thought it was the best way for me to make something of my life,” he said. Clad in faded denims and run- ning shoes, typical attire of thou- sands of young East German crossovers, Mr. Behnstedt still lacked papers except his East German military ID. But he said he was told West Berlin city authorities soon will give him the equivalent of $210 so he can buy a plane ticket to the main part of West Germany and seek work as a truck driver. In the reception center's lob- by, a flustered West Berlin guard said the center was on property owned by the Allies, referring to France, Britain and the United States, which still technically oc- cupy West Berlin. Although the site is near a U.S. military bar- racks, no Allied officer was on duty. Meanwhile, Karl Hein Kasu- bek, 33, was on the sidewalk wearing a light windbreaker, breathing in the damp, chilly dusk air. A woodworker from the small East German town of Perleberg, he said he could return if he wanted but that he would not dream of it. “The plans Krenz and the oth- ers are making are going to help the big cities like Berlin and Leipzig,” he said. “Until it gets down to the small towns like mine, it would take years,” Mr. Kasubek said he, too, ex- pects to get $210 to help him start anew farther west. In his case, he intends to fly to Bonn to ask the Canadian Embassy for an immi- gration visa. “Canada is looking for 9,000 people, I've heard. I would like to work in woodwork- ing or in any kind of a job.” Connie Scholler, 18, who met Mr. Kasubek at the reception cen- ter over the weekend, was a sales clerk in East Berlin before Mr. Krenz opened the floodgates. She, too, says she is not going back. “I don’t think there will be any more changes over there than there are already,” she said. “Here, I have a good room. | would like to have a nice apart- ment and a nice job. We were never free before, and after all these years, they cannot change their policy.” Thomas Schiller, 21, who abandoned a job as a forklift op- erator, said he has been sur- prised at the extent of the Krenz reform statements. Still, he thinks they do not go far enough. “We are still allowed to travel abroad only 30 days a year,” he said. “Now they say we can have a passport, but it is still the government who will tell us whether we can or not. So it is ac- tually the same as it was before.” Now he expects to move to West Germany and seek a me- chanic’s job at a Volkswagen factory. It said something about the firmness of their resolve that none of eight new refugees inter- viewed outside the reception cen- ter requested anonymity.

By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent BERLIN — In the last four days, East Berlin factory worker Gabriella Naumann has crossed into the West three times, each time casually carrying another bundle of possessions for her new life beyond the Wall.

After she Maleuda parked one of her bikes and then the other with a friend in West Berlin, she returned one last time to East Berlin on Sun- day to carry over the rest of her family’s warmest winter clothes. On that last trip across the Wall, she managed to pack along a teddy bear for one of her three children who is also joining her in the West. “I was scared the whole time, but they didn’t even control the border at all,” she marveled Monday. : - After com- ' pleting her three-stage getaway, Mrs. Naumann joined an East German exo- dus that ap- pears to be far from over. She was one of an estimated Modrow . 1,500 other fresh refugees who registered on Monday in a West Berlin refugee center. “My boss won’t find out until Wednesday,” said Mrs. Nau- mann, 33, who worked as a buy- er in an East Berlin cookie fac- tory. “I told him I was taking sick leave. He will be totally fli out.” East Germany’s gamble of lifting travel restrictions five days ago, both East and West German authorities have seemed intent on playing down the continued drain of young East Germans to the glittering West. On Monday, West German of- ficials in Bonn made a point of | telling reporters that fewer than 1 percent of the estimated 3 mil- lion East Germans who surged & into West Berlin over the week- end had decided to remain in the West. And East Berlin Communist Party chief Guenter Schabowski, a member of the East German Politburo, was quoted by state- jj run East German news agency ADN as saying the move to open the borders shows that the East German leadership “has helped win back trust.” As Monday progressed, East German authorities shifted their fast-moving reform campaign into overdrive. They opened an- other border crossing in East Berlin and abolished restric- tions on entry into East German border areas abutting West Germany. Meanwhile, East Germany’s Parliament heard some peppery critiques of past East German regimes and held its first secret ballot, unexpectedly electing Guenther Maleuda of the Demo- cratic Peasants’ Party to the largely ceremonial post of Par- liament speaker. West German TV described Mr. Maleuda as a hard-liner. On the other hand, Hans Mo-. drow,. 61, a pro-reform Commu- - nist politician who headed the party in Dresden, was nominat- ed by the Politburo to the 'poten- tially much more powerful post of premier.

They waved white, yel- low and blue banners and de- manded free elections and fair- er judicial sentencing. While these more visible de- velopments were being assessed around the world, a seemingly irrepressible rivulet of East Ger- mans continued to flow toward West Berlin and West Germany. A reporter saw at least 2,000 people waiting to ‘be processed Monday at two reception sites near West Berlin’s Tempelhof - Airfield. They were being fed sand-. wiches, coffee and Kool-Aid by U.S. soldiers in camouflage fa- tigues from the Army’s 502d In- fantry Division. The soldiers are part of the U.S. detachment sta- tioned in West Berlin. “I'd guess we must have 5,000 of them here,” said Sgt. Andres Hernandez of El Paso, Texas, who was running the cook tent at one of the reception centers. “I’ve been making soup — chicken soup.with macaroni, all kinds of soup — but I had to stop because we ran out of water,” Sergeant Hernandez said.

Germans By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service EAST BERLIN — For Detlef Maly, a proud and puzzled East Berliner, the worst part of seeing West Berlin again last weekend was waiting in line for a Western handout and being treated as though he was destitute. “I felt ashamed to be standing in the lines waiting for money,” he told American reporters who ap- proached him in East Berlin's Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz subway sta- tion, a mile past the Wall. “People offered us chocolate while we waited. It was humiliating.” Yet like most of the nine East Berlin subway riders and shoppers ™ interviewed at random Tuesday, Maly appeared profoundly stirred | by the communist decision to turn © \"| the deadly efficient Berlin Wall into = 9g} 4 Swiss Cheese Curtain. The sudden freedom to travel - along with the prospect of freer elections — seemed almost too wh “i much for Maly and several of the ' others to contemplate. It was as though they were condemned to stare into the future as if wearing unmatched bifocals, one lens show- ing hope and the other skepticism. “It was very strange to go over and see the other side,” said Maly, 45, who carried a briefcase in his lap as he waited on the spotless subway platform on his way to his job as an East Berlin hotel adminis: trator. The station is named for the fiery German revolutionary who helped found the German Com- munist Party in 1918, “T used to go over before the Wall was built 28 years ago,” Maly said. »“ Now it seems like the 28 years never happened ... 28 years — for what?” Though he didn't find the West an irresistible magnet, he wasn't convinced that the new faces in the East German leadership — Com: munist Party boss Egon Krenz and government leader Hans Modrow — will do much more than talk about freedom. “I really don't have much hope for this government,” said Maly. “Everything has to be made new. It's all got to change, and not be able to be changed back again.” Of the nine East Berliners inter: viewed, five said they had visited West Berlin in the last week and  Openness the other tour sald tney planned to soon. Three said they had already stood in line to pick up the $55 “welcome money” that West Ger- many is doling out to all first-time visitors, All nine said or indicated they meant to stay in the East. “Perhaps I'm making a mistake by staying here,” said Frank, a 25- year-old house painter. “I hope not. But in these days | have a bit more trust in the government and the system than before.” Frank, along with most of those interviewed, declined to supply a full name. But they all appeared to speak freely. “Tam hopeful about the reforms but also skeptical,” said Karin, a 38- year-old economist. The 300 or 400 people in the parliament can't do it alone. We've got to be innovative with the economy. Everyone's got to keep thinking — not just listen- ing to the higher-ups. “We'll probably have some free- market elements, but not like the West — maybe more like Sweden ... but that has its problems too,” Karin said she plans to go with her husband and children to West Rerli C when the ci i O /\\ d is less crowded. Connie, 28, who works at the People's Theater applying makeup and dressing hair, said, “I went over Checkpoint Charlie in the middle of the night. I had a fantas- tic time. I went to visit friends, that was the most important thing.” But more than most of those in- terviewed, Connie sounded more persuaded that the Krenz-Modrow team will improve things. “I don’t plan to move to the West,” she said. “IT have a lot of hope for the new government.” The most enthusiastic of all was Klaus, 56, a railway engineer in a black raincoat who said he was a member of the elite East German Communist Party. “It's 100 percent, the reforms will come, Modrow is very progressive, he will handle it,” Klaus said. Of those interviewed, he was the only one who predicted that the 200,000 East Germans who fled to the West this year will begin re- turning soon. “People will come back,” he said. “They have trust in the system.” When asked their feelings about the East Germans who have moved to the West, most said it was up to each individual to make that de- cision. But not Dorothea, a 51-year-old shopper in a working class district, who said she was visiting East Ber- lin from her hometown near the Polish border. “It's terrible that the young people are leaving,” she said. “The state and we have invested a lot in them. I won't leave — at my age it is too difficult to start over. As it turned out, this unscientific opinion sampling roughly echoed the results of a survey published Tuesday by the East German state news agency ADN. That survey, attributed to the state Institute of Sociology and Social Politics, said 48 percent of those polled were “hopeful” about the new reforms, while 47 percent were “hopeful and skeptical.” According to that survey, whose sampling methods were not dis- closed, 87 percent of respondents said they would “definitely” re- main in East Germany. Fifty-one percent said they had friends or relatives who had left for the West. Across the Wall in West Berlin, meanwhile, Allied officials said Tuesday there had been no, letup in the flow of East Germans appear: ing at West Berlin reception centers to begin a new life in the West.

The line ahead of her shuffled forward occasionally for two blocks — past the statue of Martin Luther, alongside the bomb-dam- aged wreckage of an 18th-century Catholic church, and finally to the official currency exchange in the garish modern Police Praesidium building. . . Approached by visiting Ameri- can reporters, Miss Kretzchmer sounded more hopeful than glum. “With the new freedoms we are getting, the psychological trauma will ebb,” she said Tuesday. Before East Germany loos- ened its border restrictions a week ago, she could see her friends leaving one by one. “I’ve lost most of my friends,” she said. “TI think that people will come back now that there’s more freedom.” Two of the 108 people who- work in her office have gone over to the West, she said. While that may not sound like many, her co- workers “are mostly older peo- ple,” she said. ~ Optimism seemed to be the dominant note Tuesday in Dres- den, a 750-year-old city that still shows occasional rubble and soot from the U.S. and British incendi- ary bombing raid that killed an éstimated 35,000 Dresdeners in he closing months of World War The Dresden bombing of Feb. 13-14, 1945, was the most devas- tating single blow in any war be- fore Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It has been credited by Western his- torians with helping crush Nazi resistance, although a tourist bro- chure issued a decade ago by lo- cal Communist authorities says the raid was “senseless for mili- tary purposes.” Tuesday’s upbeat mood in Dresden stemmed in part from an obviously genuine hometown Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 16, 1989 currency so she - pride in Hans Modrow, the city’s Communist Party leader who has just been elevated to East Ger- man premier because of his repu- tation as a reformer. “Modrow was the first guy who spoke to the people,” as Miss Kreztchmer put it. “With the old overnment, he would have allen.” The new premier, who was in East Berlin trying to form a coali- tion Cabinet, had other admirers in Dresden. “Modrow is the guy to get the reforms going,” said An- dreas, 31, a mechanic drinking coffee in a cafeteria. “We'll see what he can do.” ‘Pressure makes things happen so fast. It seems a bit too fast, actually. The re- unification of may be unrealistic, | don’t know. But the unification of the cul- ture [of East and West Ger- many] is important.’ — Patrizia A Dresden resident Most of those interviewed could see favorable possibilities in the sudden thaw of the frozen borders of Europe. At the same time, some were apprehensive. To Patrizia, 27, a museum lec- turer, the most important goal now is for West Germany to get out of NATO and for East Germa- ny to leave the Warsaw Pact. “World War III should not happen here,” she said. ‘Peace is the most important thing.” Patrizia was walking to give a lecture on how the city fathers were planning to reconstruct Dresden’s largest palace, a monu- ment to 18th-century architectur- al extravagance that remains a stone hulk 44 years after the Dresden firestorm. ; Patrizia approved of the changes rocking East Germany, but not without some qualms. “Pressure makes things hap- pen so fast,” she said, “It seems a bit too fast, actually. The reunifi- cation of Germany may be unreal- , istic, I don’t know. But the unifi- cation of the culture [of East and’ West Germany] is important. We have a common heritage. Culture and art has always united us. It should again.” Except for some fire-searred warehouses and 18th-century ar-) chitecture left in ruins, Dresden appears to have risen again from the war. ___It has become one of the most: industrially advanced centers of technocratic communism, with metallurgical and machine-tool plants, optical instruments fac- tories and shops that make elec- tronic equipment. Situated 130 miles away from West Germany, and only 30 miles from Poland, the city feels much! more East European than its more cosmopolitan big brother, East Berlin. In the central square of Dres- . den, Soviet soldiers drifted into! the main cafeteria for their mid- afternoon coffee. At the tables, Dresdeners. were joined by a sprinkling of Czechs and Bulgarians, but West- erners were so rare that one cus- tomer asked to touch an Ameri- can visitor’s sweater. “Ich bin ein Computer Spe- cialist,” said Toni Dimitrow, 49, a Bulgarian who said he works for the city government’s planning ministry on allocating food sup- plies. He said he got the job be- cause he studied in Dresden a quarter-century ago. Mr. Dimitrow, who is married to an East German woman, said two of the 20 computer operators in his office have departed for West Germany. Mr. Dimitrow said most peo- ple don’t hate the ones who have left. Nor, he said, has their depar- i affected the efficiency of his office. “The people here are disaf- fected, that’s why the pain isn’t so great,” Mr. Dimitrow said. “The people don’t work very hard any- way. There are four men on the night shift, and two or three could do the job. Now maybe we can work better.” _ Special correspondent Christi- na Klein contributed to this article. l \f"

Walesa led Solidarity to a democratic break: through when it won official recognition in Poland earlier in this decade, but a new round of govern: ment repression followed before the union and pro- democracy group finally made a thorough crack in the communist regime this year.

On Friday evening, incoming East German Premier Hans Mo- drow appeared apprehensive about the money his countrymen were getting ready to spend on Western goods as well as the prospect that heavily subsidized East German consumer goods such as baby shoes will be bought out by free-spending West Ger- man bargain hunters shopping in East Germany. In his first meeting with West- ern correspondents, Mr. Modrow declined to say whether the East German currency might have to be devalued. “That is a question we have to discuss together with the West German government,” he explained. The reformist Mr. Modrow, in office less than a week, went on to appeal to East Germans not to trade money in the black market, saying this could lead to “a whole speculative situation more evil than it was in 1961.” That was the year Communist authorities built the Berlin Wall, a move at least partly inspired by pressure on the East German recent 10-1 devaluation imposed by President Mikhail S. Gorba- in the Soviet Union. “All citizens who have money in bank accounts are guaranteed the security of their deposits,” the premier said. He also warned that his new government will take steps against “massive buying of goods. — especially subsidized goods — by certain foreign tourists and speculators.” To provide East Germans a fresh alternative to spending buy money in the West, Mr. Modrow held out the prospect that East Germans will be allowed to buy their own condominiums — which presumably would be larger than Mle HOARY Tene Hits Liat are TOV he rule in th ommunist nation.

        "ocr_text": "Reformers from Baltic states make pitch for support in U.->. By Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service WASHINGTON — The United States has become a far-flung out- post in the increasingly tense battle that reformers in the Soviet Un- ion’s Baltic republics are waging to free themselves from the commu- nist regime. A stream of activist Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians has been winding through Capitol corridors, the State Department, luncheons and receptions here, and flowing out through major cities where concentrations of their former countrymen welcome them with rousing celebration. They are seeking things as sim- ple as copying machines and as complicated as an endorsement by the Bush administration of their ultimate goal — independence from the Soviet Union. “It is very strange to hear people say, ‘Go slow,’” Maryu Lauristin, head of the Estonian Popular Front and a member of the Su- preme Soviet, told the National Press Club. “We are in a great hur- ry because the situation is very troublesome. We are in deep crisis and we have to get out.” The three Baltic republics are pushing the limits of perestroika, the restructuring that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev advocates. They are clamoring to be restored to the free status they held as inde- pendent countries from World War I until the Soviet Union annexed them in 1940. After more than a year of broa- dening political freedom, now top Soviet leaders are demanding that the republics rewrite their new laws that conflict with the Soviet consti- tution. The Justice Ministry un- derscored the friction last week when it released an 11-page list of transgressions by legislators in a handful of republics including the Baltics. The spirit of Baltic reformers has captivated many Americans. But it also has raised concerns that a backlash might lead conservative Soviets to topple Gorbachev in an effort to forestall a breakup of the Soviet empire. “Sometimes we hear in Western countries that the Baltic states movement can take down Mr. Gor- bachev,” acknowledged Zigmas Vaisvila, the chairman of the Lith- uanian Greens Party who visited Washington this month. “It’s a pity. It’s a myth. We want to use democratic processes to get out of this situation. ... The main threat for Gorbachev is unorganized mass movements,” At least eight leaders of different pro-democracy groups in the Baltic states have come through Wash- ington recently. Most expressed hopes that President Bush would press Gorbachev at their meeting next month to continue reforms and would warn him not to choke off the breath of freedom enliven- ing the democracy movements. “Particularly in view of the fact that the Soviet Union requires help SES Cox photo Maryu Lauristin, a member of the Supreme Soviet from Estonla, leads the Estonian Popular Front. from the United States, there is the hope that President Bush should not only restate the United States opposition to annexation of Lithu- ania by the Soviet Union, but also that he should help Lithuania take its proper place among the nations of the world,” said Viktoras Pet- kus, a longtime dissident who spent more than 10 years in Soviet pri- sons and camps. The United States government never has recognized Soviet juris- diction over the three Baltic states, but neither has the Bush adminis- tration endorsed the recently open independence movement. For Baltic Americans, who sometimes were viewed as ultra- conservative anti-communists in their long years as lonely advocates of independence, the activism and new hope springing up on the soil of their family roots is rejuvenat- ing, spurring them to new activity here. One Lithuanian Catholic organi- zation, for example, reports its contributions up by 10 to 25 per- cent every month. Associations of all three nationalities are forward- ing books and paper and communi- cations equipment such as copiers and fax machines to pro-democra- cy groups, and they are financing visits by activists who had not been allowed to leave the Soviet Union for decades. Latvian-American business anc professional groups have bee sending contingents to Latvia to discuss investment or provide sup port and advice on advancing ¢ nascent market economy, said Ojars Kalnins of the American Lat vian Association.

        "ocr_text": "Vacha Back Among the Living After 33 Years With No Visitors First Guests in 38 Years Enter As Electrified Borders Open By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent VACHA, East Germany — For nearly 40 years, the people in this picture post- card 12th-century town called themselves “the living dead.” Under a 1951 Soviet decree, East Ger- man towns such as Vacha that happened to be within three miles of the West Ger- man border were in a closed zone, Admis- sion was verboten not only for foreigners but also for other East Germans who didn’t happen to live there, Closed, that is, until East Germany be- gan unsealing its borders 10 days ago. Over the weekend, East German police cut a crossing through the electrified fence six miles from Vacha. On Monday afternoon, an American reporter drove into the middle of the cobblestoned town square to let off a hitchhiker. Within moments, a dozen young East Germans ran out from the Free German Youth Club to pump hands or shyly ex- change smiles. “You are the first American we've ever seen,” said one. Older faces appeared from behind curtains in second-story windows around the square. Out on the street, the hitchhiker — an elderly church organist — in- sisted on taking a snapshot of the reporter and his rented Ford Escort. “For years, this town was dead,” said Thomas Brocker, 18, an apprentice in an electronics plant. “Now it’s all different.” For two generations, this town of 4,800 has lived in a barbed-wire cocoon. Although they could travel] to other East German towns, no outsider could enter Vacha without a special police permit. ane per- Half a dozen people, inter- viewed separately, said authori- ties routinely denied requests from former Vacha residents liv- ing in the interior to come back to Vacha for the funeral of an aunt or brother. Vacha — the name comes from its thousand-year-old Celt- ic roots — has the misfortune to lie on one of the historic inva- sion routes through Europe. Even now, U.S. and Soviet tanks are deployed against each other less than 30 miles away. Napoleon retreated through Vacha with the Russian Cos- sacks on his heels, according to town lore. And the handwritten log of the town’s Lutheran church tells how U.S. tanks cap- tured Vacha in a battle against Nazi SS troops on Easter 1945. For the 11 years the Rev. Pe- ter Raatz has been the town’s Lutheran pastor, he has looked from the church back yard at the nearest West German town, Philippsthal, which begins 200 yards away. Separating the two towns was the Vacha River, spanned by an ancient bridge, long closed. And on the east side of the river, blocking part of the Rev. Raatz’s view, was the con- crete wall built by East German security forces to prevent escapes. “T never thought in my whole life I would be able to cross over to the other side,” the Rev. Raatz said Monday. “And yet on 14 November, I and about 1,000 other people from Vacha walked over that bridge.” As minister of St. John the Baptist Church, it is the Rev. Raatz’s duty to keep up the log of the town’s history that he and his predecessors have inscribed by hand since 1819. : The Rev. Raatz says he hasn’t yet been able to bring himself to write up the startling development in Vacha since East Serminny lowered its “TI think there have been toc many things,” he said. “I musi think and think what has beer the matter with our town.” The mood was less intro- spective at the town’s youth club, which had the air of a col- lege beer bust, though it was in midafternoon of what was offi- cially a workday. About 40 blue-jeaned men and women in their 20s were drinking tap beer and listening to an East German variant of American country music. Most had jobs in a local plant that makes coaxial cables or in a 2- mile-deep salt mine nearby. In an ear-thumping instant, it was obvious that although Va- cha has been off-limits, outsid- ers’ music has filtered through the barbed wire. Hearing that an American was in town, Ingo Dorsch, a 24- year-old coal shoveler, ran home to bring a dozen of his 26 Elvis Presley albums. “Elvis is a legend here,” said Mr. Dorsch, who also showed off the snapshots he took a week ago when he became the first Vacha resident to visit West Berlin, 175 miles to the northeast. Among the equipment at the youth club was an East German- made computer-controlled tape deck, which someone said was used for copying Johnny Cash, Hank Snow and The Scorpions from West German radio. . But not all the town’s music was self-copied. The jackets on Mr. Dorsch’s Elvis records car- ried the names of record-makers in Bulgaria, East Germany and the United States. Two young men from the youth club then undertook to in- troduce the reporter to the town’s mayor. Next stop was what looked like a four-story hotel in the Swiss mountains, standing just across the town square. Until the town was declared off-limits 38 years ago, the build- ing was a hotel. Around its en- trance hall are century-old mu- rals depicting the town’s medieval history. The hotel went kaput when Vacha was closed to the outside world. It now is the town hall. A bronze bust of Karl Marx stood on a pedestal outside the mayor’s office on the second floor. Clearly Mayor Werner Mader was a good and cautious Communist, but that didn’t mean he defended what has happened to Vacha. “Before the war, we had sev- en petrol [gasoline] stations in Vacha,” he said. “Now we have only one.” Vacha’s station ran out of gas Saturday morning. “We have had many difficul- ties in our town because there was no money for building,” the mayor said. As in other East German cit- ies, Vacha has had regular Mon- day night demonstrations and marches to call for free elec- tions and a free press. One occasional participant, Bodo Fischer, a 24-year-old salt mine engineer, said Vacha’s demonstrations are being sus- pended for a while, in part to see whether new Communist Party Chairman Egon Krenz de- livers promised reforms. “I think we must give him one chance,” Mr. Fischer said. “One chance.” Now, it seems, everyone in the town wants to go somewhere in the West to visit. Mr. Dorsch, the town’s Elvis worshiper, wants to go the farthest. “Someday I just want to go to Graceland,” he said. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 21, 1989 \f"

For decades, the cream of the U.S. Army's tank corps has come and gone from this outpost’s wind-swept watchtower. Day and night, sentinels watched for movement on a 5- mile stretch of unused East Ger- man superhighway that ran paral- lel to the border fence. Since the early 1950s, when the Autobahn was finished and abandoned, the Army’s high-powered binoculars — and lately its thermal-imaging night scopes — detected no move- ment at all. ‘Then at 3 a.m. Nov, 10, an American Army scout at Observa- tion Point Alpha saw vehicles on the move. It was only hours after the news of East Germans cross- ing the Berlin Wall 175 miles to the northeast. Within two days, the Ghost Autobahn was packed with wheezing, smoke-belching East German autos. They were en route to shopping sprees across the West German frontier. After a 40-year military game of cat and mouse, it was as though the mouse had called time out. “You couldn’t help but be happy to see the expressions of the East German civilians cross- ing the border,” said Spec.

        "ocr_text": " Berlin’s fate is discussed by 4 powers Soviets hint at reviving old proposal by Reagan By Joseph Albright WEST BERLIN — With a reunifica- tion tide running high in both East and West Germany, the four powers that won World War IT have agreed to meet here today and confer on the future of Berlin. , The meeting arose suddenly when the Soviet Union notified the United States, Britain and France that it was prepared to hold talks on a largely for- gotten “Berlin initiative’ — one that drew a ho-hum response when it was launched by President Ronald Reagan during his 1987 visit to Berlin. '. The Reagan proposal called for making Berlin a world center for con- _ ferences and youth exchanges. It also held out the prospect of improving the city’s sometimes dicey air traffic control system and of holding the Olympic Games in the city in 2004. Meantime, in a speech to a Commu- nist Party Central Committee meeting published in Moscow on Sunday, Soviet President Mikhail §. Gorbachev warned that any quick move to reunify Germany could destabilize Europe. “We firmly declare that we will see to it that no harm comes to the GDR East Germany],” Mr, Gorbachev said. “It is our strategic ally and a member of the Warsaw Pact. “It is necessary to proceed © from the postwar realities — the existence of the two sovereign German states, members of the United Nations. Departure from this threatens the destabilization of Europe,” he added. Allied sources said Sunday that the four ambassadors will be assembling for the first time since 1972, when they concluded the ac- cords that guaranteed West Ber- lin would not be cut off from West Germany. In return, the Soviet Union in- sisted at the time that East Ger- many must renounce any longings for a united Germany, and West Berlin must not be fully incorpo- rated into West Germany. West German Chancellor Hel- mut Kohl, who irritated the Allies orepeans openly last month about the prospect of eventually joining both the’ Communist East and democratic West into a pan- German confederation, was not invited to the meeting of the World War II victors. An Allied communique said, however,’ that the Allies were “in close conver- sations” with West Ger a ? authorities. Also not invited was East Ger- many’s Gregor Gysi, 41, a reform- minded Communist who was in- stalled over the weekend to lead the shattered and scandal-rocked East German party. The four-power agreements theoretically make the Allies the ultimate decision-makers on even minuscule details of Berlin ad- ministration. But over the past four weeks, since the Wall tum- bled, East and West Berlin may- | ors have met without bothering to seek Allied permission. They have begun fashioning their own rules about border crossings, cur- rency controls and subway routes. The four-power meeting will take place in the old Allied Con- trol Center, a marble-columned landmark in the former American sector of West Berlin. Vernon Walters, who is U.S. ambassador to West Germany and a Russian-speaking veteran diplo- ‘mat, will represent Washington. His counterparts will be the Sovi- et ambassador to East Germany and the British and French am- bassadors to West Germany. Later today, tens of thousands of East German demonstrators are expected to once more take to the streets of Leipzig in what has become a weekly bellwether of virtually leaderless East German state, Sebastian Pflugbeil, a leader of East Germany's biggest opposi- tion group, New Forum, ex- pressed fears Sunday that the weekly Leipzig mass demonstra- tions are taking on a more nation- alistic, pro-reunification tone, The Reuter news agency re him as saying he feared Leipzig demonstrations favor- ing reunification could undercut support for new Communist Party er Gysi, a reform-minded offi- cial with close ties to the New Fo- rum opposition. The four-power meeting is due to begin eight hours before Secretary of State James A. Baker III is due to arrive to give a long- planned speech to a Berlin press club. Mr. Baker is not scheduled to take part in the pg yee Berlin meeting. Decades of four-power protocol during the Cold War es-~ tablished a firm precedent that each of the powers are represent: ed by diplomats of equal rank.

Mr. Kohl told the clapping delegates that Christian Demo- crats look forward to a peaceful order in Europe in which the German people succeed in “win- ning back” their unity in freedom. Mr. Kohl said, “Wir sind ein Volk [We are one people],”’ an evocative slogan that means the German people are indivisible. His party has adopted these four ords as the theme of West Ger- man national elections set for De- cember 1990. In an indication of the primal power of that slogan across Ger- many, the BBC reported that these same words — “Wir sind ein Volk’ — were chanted Mon- day night by many of the 200,000 East German demonstrators who gathered in Leipzig for the latest de’ . protest rally against communism and corruption, Other demonstrators carried a signs saying “No Fourth Reich” and urging East Germans not to let their country become a West German “plantation.” “There are two real movements now,” said a young woman sed to reunifi- a “It’s too bad it’s come to 8.” Throughout the evening, pro- testers on both sides shouted at each other.

U.S. offers help bor E. Germans on path to change Baker packs in icebreaking visit, hints at easing American trade By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent POTSDAM, East Germany — Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Tuesday pledged U.S. diplomatic support and economic aid to Communist East Germany if it continues to make progress toward reform. In the first talks between top American and East German officials to be held in East Germany, Mr. Baker held out the prospect that Washington soon would open the American market to East German products on liberal terms. -During a 65-minute session with Premier Hans Modrow and later in talks with Lutheran ministers in a 19th-century church, Mr. Baker expressed support for the changes sweeping the one-time Stalinist nation and said the Bush administration is prepared to provide the kind of help it is giving Poland and Hunga- ry as they turn toward market economies. Mr. Baker said extension of “most favored nation” trade status to East Germany is a step the United States will consider if East Germa- ny stays on course toward democracy and free avel. . If the trade barriers are lowered, the first change visible to most Americans likely will be the appearance in U.S. stores of high-quality cameras and binoculars made by Zeiss, the leading East German optical manufacturer. Mr. Baker is said to have made clear that future U.S. economic cooperation will be linked to East Germany holding its first multiparty secret elections, ten- tatively set for May 6. His one-hour private talks with Mr. Modrow amounted to the boldest Ameri- can move in Eastern Europe since the Communist dominoes began falling from the Baltic to the Black Sea earlier this year. Short-circuiting months of diplomatic preparations for an icebreaking session with a longtime adversary, Mr. Baker set up the visit to East Germany literally overnight. Aides described the detour from his West Berlin itinerary as designed to ex- tend international legitimacy to Mr. Mo- drow, the former mayor of Dresden who was elected premier by the Communist- dominated national legislature Nov. 13. Despite Mr. Modrow’s fairly high standing with reform-inclined East Ger- mans, he already is coming under pres- sure from some newly formed citizens groups to resign for acting too slowly. Though he has not been tainted by fi- nancial scandals that have driven other longtime Communists from office, Mr. Modrow was a Communist deputy in Par- liament for 32 years before his elevation to premier. “He is an interesting fellow, but I'd hate to be in his shoes,” said one U.S. of- ficial who sat in on the Baker-Modrow session. Mr. Baker said he had come to Pots- dam to tell Mr. Modrow and the East German people that the United States backs the liberalizing trends that have transfixed this country since the Berlin Wall opened Nov. 9. “We also wanted to make it very clear that we support the process of re- form in a peaceful manner, and that we are very anxious to see this process move forward in a stable way,” Mr. Bak- er added. Responding without notes or prepa- rations, Mr. Modrow said East Germany appreciated the American gesture and saw Mr. Baker’s trip as the “beginning of a dialogue.” Mr. Modrow reportedly told Mr. Bak- er the thrust toward democracy in East Germany is “irreversible.” Aides said Mr. Baker gave his go- ahead for the Modrow meeting at a staff meeting in West Berlin only 21 hours earlier, after informing Moscow of his intentions. Because the telephone circuits be- tween East and West Berlin have been chronically overloaded, Berlin-based U.S. diplomats were initially unable to contact Mr. Modrow to extend the invitation. Late Monday, they managed to get word to Mr. Modrow and make the ar- rangements only because Richard Bark- ley, the American ambassador to East Germany, at nearly midnight personally delivered the invitation to one of Mr. Mo- drow’s deputies. As it happened, Mr. Barkley knew where to locate the Modrow deputy — he was dining at Mr. Barkley’s house in East Berlin at a function honoring two visiting American congressmen. For Mr. Baker, it was a day steeped in history that began with breakfast with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and a speech outlining an expanded po- litical role for NATO. - What made the Kohl meeting extraor- dinary was that this apparently was the first time any high U.S. official had agreed to meet a West German chancel- lor in Berlin, which the allies always have treated gingerly as a quasi-interna- tional city that is not fully integrated into the West German state. Then came Mr. Baker’s midafternoon motorcade to Potsdam. It passed from West Berlin to East Germany across the Glienicke Bridge, the ghostly site where KGB master spy Col. Rudolph Abel was swapped for captured CIA pilot Francis Gary Powers in the early 1960s. ; In fact, Mr. Baker was only the third American secretary of state to visit East Germany.

This duel by spray cans was one reflection of a dark underside of ee “people power” revolu- on. After the joy at the bursting of the dam between the two Germa- nys, many moderates are agonizing about whether the resulting torrent of change has irrigated a new crop of anti-ethnic, right-wing German nationalism. Most Germans appear to be- lieve nothing of the sort can happen again. But some are troubled, espe- cially those who saw it before when Naziism grew out of the hyperinfla- tion of the 1920s and the depression of the 1930s.

The inscription reads: ‘Germany my Fatherland.’ Months before the East German Communists gave up the Berlin Wall, a West German neo-right- wing party, the Republikaners, al- ready was scoring unsettling gains in local elections. And now that many East Ger- mans are parading in the streets for German reunification, the strengthened Republikaners are shouting the loudest support of any West German party. With West German national elections due in December 1990, even Chancellor Helmut Kohl is worried about massive defections to the right among working-class West Germans. The Republikaners’ unre- strained calls to regain Germany’s full 1937 territory has pushed the moderate Kohl to campaign on a gut-level slogan “Wir sind ein Volk” (We are one people).

Germans look west Even with reforms, many believe prospects are bleak Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent FRANKFURT-ON-THE- ODER, East Germany — Three blocks from the river that di- vides this country from Poland, Bing Crosby was crooning “White Christmas” on the loud- speaker and East Germans were pee ont their Christmas trees m a private merchant who charged $1.80 for a 6-foot pine. This year, the 85,000 East Germans in this light manufac- turing center had more reason to celebrate than normal. With- out firing a shot, they had driv- en the district office of the Com- munist secret police to its knees. The outcome was plain to see. Pasted on the walls of toy and bratwurst booths at the city’s Christmas fair was a mim- eographed confession from dis- trict employees of State Securi- ty, known as the “Stasi.” “The State Security doesn’t have any more weapons,” the letter said. ‘We, too, need to be _ a part of this democratic revival process. We, too, have been mis- led and lied to on the basis of a false doctrine of security put ‘forward by a criminal clique.” Clearly, not everyone trusted the Stasi’s Dec. 6 capitulation. Of the dozen copies of the let- ter, all but one had been defaced. . A city official, Eberhard Tschetsche, 54, confirmed that a band of 30 townspeople led by a Lutheran pastor had taken over Stasi headquarters. There have been other changes in Frankfurt-on-the- Oder that seem almost unimaginable. Mr. Tschetsche’s handball team, once sponsored by the East German army, is negotiat- ing a sponsorship contract from a West German athletic equip- ment manufacturer. The biggest cement plant is being turned into a joint ven- ture with a West Berlin con- struction company. And there is reliable talk that a West Ger- man enterprise is about to buy a major share in the city’s main brewery. Yet the mood in town seemed strangely drained. “It’s dead here now,” said Michael Erber, 24, a sawmill op- erator. “There are no people in the discos on the weekends any- more. Everyone goes to West Berlin.” Mr. Erber said he plans to immigrate to West Germany when the weather warms in April. He doesn’t expect to wait for the expected May 6 free elections in East Germany. He figures no politician can get East Germany’s economy moving without a lot of infla- tion. Things will be just as bad as in Hungary, he speculates. So why not go West? Since the year began, Frank- furt-on-the-Oder has lost 2 per- cent of its 85,000 inhabitants to West Germany. Everyone ex- pects the drain will continue or accelerate next year. Marjara Haare, 19, studying to be a kindergarten teacher, has decided to stay. ‘“‘There’s so much good to do here in the German Democratic Republic,” she said. “I have my family here. There is no reason to go.” Still, East Germany’s up- heaval has cut her off from her schoolmates. “We had a group of 20 friends, and now there are only four or five left,” she said. Her friend, Beatrice van der Branch, 19, has taken politics seriously, but she feels frustrat- ed about the elections. At first, she was attracted to New Forum, the non-Commu- nist opposition whose demon- strations crumbled the nation’s communist leadership. But no longer. “Now I feel as though they are just saying something to say something,” she said. “I don’t know who I would vote for.” Atlanta Constitution - December 15, 1989 \f"

German political party looks West for classy strategies on winning votes By Joseph Albright EAST BERLIN — After 45 years as lap dogs of the ruling Communists, the leaders of East Germany’s Christian Democrats are getting their counterparts in West Germany to teach them how to chase votes. At an emergency party confer- ence Friday, leaders of East Ger- many’s Christian Democratic Un- ion said they will send more than 100 workers to a “campaign school” to be run by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Chris- . tian Democrats. “We're sending them there so they can be schooled so that we can have a real campaign,” said Dietmar Czok, a longtime East German Christian Democrat. “They will show us how to im- prove our public relations. We’ve never learned that.” They already have asked the help of the West German Chris- tian Democrats in obtaining so- phisticated opinion polls in East: Germany. “We have to know how to react,” Mr. Czok said. “We have to know what the people want.” He said the party would not accept financing or campaign workers from the West because East Germans would resent that. Indeed, some party members evidently thought the East Ger- man party already was too close to Mr. Kohl’s party. “We don’t want to be a little ‘mouse of the Western CDU,” pro- claimed one hand-lettered plac- ard waved at the conference. Mr. Czok’s party is only a shadow of the robust party that put Mr. Kohl in power. The East German party claims 130,000 ad- herents in a country of 17 million. Nobody knows whether they will grow or shrink. Some say they could win up to 20 percent of the votes in elections set for May 6. However, other observers say the party, could slide into oblivion as re- form-minded East Germans gravi- tate to new, untainted parties that are expected to surface soon. Lutheran ministers have been in the vanguard of the country’s peaceful rejection of communism in the past two months. But that doesn’t mean the East German Christian Democrats necessarily will benefit. “The old parties may have to bear a lot of the people’s resent- ment, and we are one of the old parties,” said party activist Eber- hard Wiederman.

        "ocr_text": "Humbled Honecker thanks foes for toppling E. German regime By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau EAST BERLIN — Ousted . Communist Party boss Erich Hon- ecker, in an extraordinary confes- sion of his misuse of power, has credited “church circles” and anti-Communist protesters for bringing East Germany’s tottering ' Communist Party to its senses. “I didn’t totally believe what was actually going on in the coun- try,” said Mr. Honecker, 77, in a letter sent to the party leadership a month ago and released to 2,700 Communist delegates meeting Saturday. “I fooled myself and let myself be fooled by my visits to the countryside.” But he rejected widespread accusations that he was corrupt. The Communist Party changed its name and appealed to reform- minded members to set a new course for the discredited party. At a closed session of an emergency congress, more than 2,700 delegates decided to change the party’s official name from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany-Party of Democratic Socialism. : The congress also was expect- ed to adopt a more democratic platform before it completes its session today. One delegate, former party ideologist Kurt Hager, told re- porters at the conference that Mr. Honecker is “very sick, but it’s another question what is going to happen to him.” In a related development, East Germany for the first time in 40 years is considering establish- ment of diplomatic relations with Israel, Premier Hans Modrow ac- knowledged Saturday. “There is a readiness on our. part,” Mr. Modrow said when asked about rumors about recent unofficial contacts between East German and Israeli Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 17, 1989 representatives. However, Mr. Modrow implied that he would not move to estab- lish relations with Israel without obtaining the assent of the Soviet Union. In his words, the question of ties between East Germany and Israel is a matter for “the world community” as well as for the two countries. At the congress meeting, one speaker after another blamed Mr. Honecker and his ousted follow- ers for bringing the Communist Party to disgrace. Though the par- ty members seemed eager to change their image, they ap- peared by no means ready to give up power to the non-Communist opposition that has captured the public’s confidence. “We defend Marx and Lenin,” said delegate Dieter Klein, a young East Berlin university pro- fessor. “Marxist theory, al it is wonderful for historical anal- ysis, has been misused and abused.” The Communists, after ruling East Germany since its birth, now face the prospect of winning no more than 15 percent to 20 per- cent of the popular votes if next year’s promised election is truly free, according to diplomats. Yet the mood at the Commu- nist emergency meeting was more determination to regain the helm than defeatism. The hall was filled with well- dressed factory managers, green: uniformed army officers and ar- ticulate university professors — people with a stake who know their careers would be ruined if the party is rejected. A succession of speakers laid the blame on Mr. Honecker, who until recently was revered as an anti-fascist hero because he t 10 years in prison under the Nazi reLIME C Une surprise guest speaker was Rudolf Bahro, a former Com- munist Party member expelled to West Germany in the 1970s for criticizing the party’s brand of communism. After returning recently to his home in East Germany, he was admitted to the party meeting, where he told reporters the Com- munists have made only “half- hearted” efforts at reforms. The state-controlled TV net- work gave heavy coverage to the succession of Communist dele- gates. But in a notable departure re- flecting the swirl of near-revolu- tionary changes, the East German evening TV news also broadcast film clips from a founding confer- ence of a leading rival group Meeting in Leipzig, the oppo- sitionists, who call themselves Democratic Awakening, said a confederation of the two Germa- nys “within a European peace or- der” is a central aim of their platform. Democratic Awakening, close to the leadership of the street protests that have humbled the Communists over the past two months, said they blamed the * PPilure of Teninigm not onlv Sta- il Was tneir w. y OF velling po- tential voters that even a re- formed Communist Party will not work. Meanwhile, in continuing rev- elations of corruption among the ousted Communist hierarchy, an official East Berlin newspaper re- ported that 20 million marks ($11 million at official currency rates) had been spent to support 18 — lodges for the Communist elite. Without giving details, the newspaper said in some cases “hobby-hunters” had shot game animals and then sold the meat for profit. \f"

He spoke to two Western jour- nalists a few hours after he led nearly 2,700 Communist delegates to approve a head-to-toe makeover of the East German party’s scan- dal-scarred image. Meeting in a stadium where East German athletes have set nu- merous track and swimming re- cords, the delegates ended a second straight weekend of emergency sessions by voting to approve a laundry list of attention-getting re- forms. At Gysi’s bidding, the party unanimously: @ Instructed the East German army to abandon the stiff-legged ceremonial march style — a sort of goose step — that Gysi told the delegates is reminiscent of ‘the inglorious Prussian past.” @ Decided to redesign East German officers’ uniforms, which have collar decorations that re- mind some of Nazi uniforms.

This was a compromise allowing old-time Communists to use the former name and reformers to call it the “Democratic Socialist” party. To spread the message to the 16 million East Germans that the par- ty has thrown off the “Honecker- gate” scandal, the delegates tenta- tively decided to start an advertising agency to promote the party among the people. At Gysi’s behest, the delegates also agreed to start a party media research institute, apparently to conduct Western-style opinion polls and research on TV viewers’ pref- erences. ‘‘Never again must the media be so distant from the mood of the people,” Gysi said in his keynote speech.

Amid East Germany’s turbu- lent changes, the ‘round table” has taken on some characteristics of a de facto provisional government. But no date has been set for the country’s Communist-controlled Volkskammer (parliament) to con- firm the decision or spell out the ground rules for holding the elec- tion. Warns against unification Some delegates at the Commu- nist meeting said they expected the Volkskammer would not pass an election statute until February. Gysi, 41, a lawyer who has de- fended anti-Communist protesters, made clear in his speech that the y’s prime objective was to head off popular pressure for re- unification of East and West Ger- many. \" transform the German Democratic Republic (East Ger- many) into a poorhouse of the Fed- eral Republic (West Germany) ... would mean saying an undignified farewell to a country which in spite of everything carries the respected name of the German Republic,” Gysi said.

If we can’t, then otherwise a danger- ous political vacuum will come into being which will be filled by the Right.” East, West visits continue While East Germany’s leaders continue to inveigh against Ger- man unification, visits between top-level East and West German officials continued to proliferate.

Mr. Kohl is to arrive from Hungary for talks with East Ger- man Prime Minister Hans Mo- drow. West German newspapers said Mr. Kohl will arrive with a pocketful of proposals for West German investments and offers of. credits worth up to $58 billion over the next decade. On the eve of Mr. Kohl's arriv- al, Dresden was barren of flags and decorations — evidence, per- haps, that the shaky East German Communist regime was trying to avoid making the meeting seem like a step toward German reunification. Seventy miles away in Leipzig, . meanwhile, 150,000 anti-Commu- nist demonstrators ringed Karl Marx Platz with a river of candle flames Monday night. Although most in the crowd abided by Lutheran pastors’ re- quest to refrain from carrying ideological banners, a minority of perhaps 1,000 chanted and car- ried banners calling for East and West Germany to be joined in a “united fatherland.” ‘Among more than a score of East Germans interviewed at ran- dom, most were glad Mr. Kohl will visit. A few expressed con- cern that West German economic aid might serve to prop up the Communist regime. “Kohl’s visit is very good for us,” said a 49-year-old truck driv- er who called himself Beda. mee at the bottom. We need s.” However, a 27-year-old animal handler named Matteus said, “Kohl is hollow.” Quite a few in the Leipzig crowd said they plan to drive the 70 miles to Dresden today to cheer Mr. Kohl’s appearance. Reuter news agency reported that up to 500,000 are expected to turn out for Mr. Kohl’s visit to Dresden, one of pre-war Germa- ny’s most vibrant cities before it was virtually consumed in a U.S.- British firebombing in 1945.

The analysis offered new evidence that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to pare the nation's massive military industry. on Monday summoned leftist stu- dents to an anti-Kohl protest against what was described as a ““takeover’’ of East Germany by Daimler-Benz and other corporations. Even Mr. Modrow, a reform- minded Communist, sometimes has sounded testy about Mr. Kohl’s demands for specifics about East Germany’s upcoming elections. Mr. Modrow was quoted Mon- day as sayi East Germany al- ready has fulfilled Mr. Kohl’s con- ditions for granting aid: fixing a date for elections, permitting both East and West Germans to travel freely across the border, and dropping the country’s consti- tutionally guaranteed primacy for the Communist Party. “IT expect that I have a talking partner who is ready to assume Atlanta Constitution - December 19, 1989 the whole responsibility for dis- cussions between the two German states,” Mr. Modrow said. Mr. Kohl has been trying to reassure other European nations that West German economic aid is not a harbinger of another Ger- man monolith. The Soviet Union, which lost 20 million people fighting Nazi Germany, has shown the most concern at the spreading. popular sentiment in East Germany for union with West Germany. The Soviet ambassador in Bonn was quoted Monday in West German newspapers as saying the Soviet Union “could not accept” a reunified Germany that remained a member of NATO.

        "ocr_text": "Kohl's visit stirs hopes in Dresden for reunification, progress, freedom DRESDEN, East Germany — “Il clapped, I shouted, ‘Bravo, bravo,” said sedate, retired teacher Analise Kircheist after hearing West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s moving tribute to the “sufferings and the dead of this beautiful old German city.” No one had to tell Mrs. Kir- cheist about the two straight nights in February 1945 when waves of American and British bombers showered incendiary bombs on Dresden, creating the worst non-nuclear firestorm the world has ever seen and helping to shock some of Hitler’s faithful into giving up their war. Mrs. Kircheist, 61, was there, a schoolgirl of 16. “I lost my grandparents and my cousin, four people in all. Somehow the rest of us ran to the park. Our house was gone, of course, but I and my parents escaped with our good help.” Four months later, the Red Army marched into Dresden, ex- ecuted any Nazis they could find, and slowly started rebuilding. For the next 40 years, Mrs. Kir- cheist lived under a Communist regime she came to detest. Until the Leipzig demonstra- tions started in October, she nev- er thought she would be free. “I am a new person now,” she said as the last pink rays of sunset fell over the ruins of the 18th- century red stone church where the West German chancellor had laid a wreath to the memory of the dead. Nowhere in East Germany could the towering Mr. Kohl have found a more je aaa back- moe ot his speech, (+ speechwriter could have crafted a more emotional closing line: “God bless our German fatherland.” But Mrs. Kircheist shed no tears. It seemed odd somehow. On the day Mr. Kohl made reuni- fication of the two Germanys sound nearer than ever, the Dresdeners clapped and argued, but they weren’t weeping. The older ones had no tears left. At least that was the case with Willi Handrig, 60, a tool and die maker who has lived all his life in Dresden. “I saw the city burn,” he said. “I was 15. There were hundreds of corpses, like stewed rabbits pressed together. It stank for weeks. Our s stank.” What next for East Germany? “Reunification,” said Mr. Han- drig’s friend. “That doesn’t mean going back to the kaiser or Hit- ler. It means we should be reuni- fied, but not under the same conditions.” Mr. Handrig did not say he was for reunification, a notion Mr. Kohl acknowledged causes “concern and angst” to the rest of the world. He just nodded yes. ‘I cant be blamed for the war. It was the generation of my parents who made war. We've been lied to and betrayed for 40 years.” East German resident Joachim Zindler, 55, also is of the generation that grew up in the last days of Hitler. Now he plays first viola in the Dresden Opera Orchestra. He is getting ready for the biggest concert of his life. On Saturday, Mr. Zindler, along with about 90 musicians from some of the greatest orches- tras in the world — from London, ‘Leningrad, Paris, both halves of Germany and the New York Phil- harmonic — are to gather in Berlin. Leonard Bernstein: is to lead them in Beethoven’s Ninth Sym- phony, with its brooding Third Movement turning into the Fourth Movement’s triumpant chorus of Schiller’s “Ode to Joy.” “We in Dresden are in the Third Movement of these incred- ible events,” Mr. Zindler said. “But we can see the Fourth Movement coming.” Atlanta Constitution - December 20, 1989 Why not an ode to joy yet? He worries sometimes about the ex- tremists — he calls them the “neo-Nazis and neo-Communists” — who have tried to move in on what he believes is East Germa- ny’s genuine popular reform movement. To Mr. Zindler, reunification seems a good goal — but not to be reached right away. For now, his passion is to return his - era’s orchestra to its pre-Wo War II name, the Saxony State Opera. The younger generation has mixed opinions. “We are not laboratory rats,” said Thomas, a school manager who declined to give his last name. “I am 30 now, and time marches on. There, in West Ger- many, they have real money. Up to now, we are second-class Germans.” Thomas, like most in the crowd, want reunification much faster than the politicians are ready to promise. “I can’t be blamed for the war,” he said. “It was the generates of my parents who made war. We've been lied to and betrayed for 40 years.” George Peter Nagel, 32, dis- agreed. He told of the good things the regime has done in pean care and retirement bene- ts. He doesn’t want reunifica- tion. Too many “good things would be sacrificed,” he said. Edgar Schmidt, 55, a teacher, overheard and laughed sardoni- cally. “What good things?’ he asked. His wife, Beta, 43 43, pointed at Mr. Nagel and said, “He must be a man of the Stasi,” the hated state security police. Not everyone opposing reuni- fication is a party member. Silvia Smnesny, 21, an art student, said she fears that West Germany’s influence will add to consumerism. “Whether we stand here soon with a Coca-Cola isn’t the point,” she said. Correspondents .

Atlanta Constitution December 20, 1989 It originally marked the road to the Branden- burg region of old Prussia. World War II damage was repaired by 1957, but the real hurt to the Brandenburg Gate and the spirit it represented to Germans was inflicted when the Berlin Wall was erected just west of it in 1961, transforming it into a gate leading no- where. It became the symbol of divided Germany. Its symbolism was so potent that in 1963 the Communist regime in the east ordered the gate covered with red curtains so President John F. Kennedy could not see it or past it during his trip to West Berlin. Along with Tuesday's decision came letters of intent signed between the two governments for economic joint ventures and other economic co- operation. Aides to the two leaders said events have moved so fast that the two economics minis- ters did not have time to set a price tag or spell out the exact terms of the cooperation. As Mr. Kohl and Mr. Modrow walked off stage, they were asked whether membership in NATO and the Warsaw Pact was discussed. “Yes, it was discussed,” Mr. Modrow said as he left the amphitheater. Neither he nor Mr. Kohl was more precise, though Mr. Kohl may get another chance to answer at a news conference this morning before he leaves for Bonn. After the clamorous news conference, Mr. Kohl spoke to a boisterous crowd of 40,000 East Germans waiting outside in New Market Square, next to the ruins of a church devastated in World War II by the U.S.-British incendiary bombing raid of February 1945. “Reunification! Reunification!” shouted de- monstators carrying West German flags. Opponents of the Communist regime predomi- nated, but there was a sizable minority of Com- munist Party members waving East German flags. A few punkers carried signs mocking Mr. Kohl's name, which in German means cabbage. ane held aloft cabbages spiked atop sharpened poles. In what must have been a painful decision by Mr. Modrow, he chose not to appear in public with Mr. Kohl. There was no explanation, but the sentiments of the crowd made it clear he would have been savagely booed. Mr. Modrow, who became prime minister in November, is the reformist former mayor of Ber- lin. Although he retains considerable personal popularity, he has taken on the stain of being the visible head of the widely hated Communist regime. Mr. Kohl’s speech, delivered in slow and pow- The Associated Press West Berlin residents watch a Christmas tree go up Tuesday in front of the Brandenburg Gate. erful tones, was interrupted about half a dozen times with shouts of “Germany, united father- land” and “Kohl, Kohl.” His speech in Dresden was in its own way as moving as Mr. Modrow’s announcement that the Brandenburg Gate would open. Mr. Kohl talked to the crowd of Dresdeners — many with personal memories of the awful 1945 firestorm — as a man who grew up to hate war. “T have just laid a wreath here in front of the ruins of the Frauenkirche, which commemorates the dead of Dresden,” he said, talking of the rub- ble behind him that once was an 18th-century Ba- roque church. “I wanted to speak to the young people of this city. I was 15 then, a pupil, a kid. I then had the chance to grow up over there [in West Germany] ... and I was part of the young generation who swore after the war, ‘Never war again; never vio- lence again.’ “And I would like here to expand this oath by beseeching you from German ground: Peace must spread in the future; that is our goal.” Mr. Kohl said he knew East Germans would go on “fighting and demonstrating for freedom in the German Democratic Republic, as East Ger- many is officially known. ates of that, we support you,” Mr. Kohl said. He paid tribute to the East Germans who did so much to bring about the collapse of the Berlin Wall, adding, “We've waited 40 years for this.” \f"

Latin nations denounce use of force By Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Latin American nations, jolted by the U.S. invasion of a neighbor, condemned the American actions in Panama yes- terday and appeared reluctant to recognize immediately the new government installed there to re- place Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The Organization of American States, meeting at its headquarters in Washington, decided temporarily to continue to seat Noriega’s repre- sentative instead of the challenger appointed yesterday by the new government. There was no public welcome of President Bush’s violent attempt to rid Panama of its brash dictator, though some analysts suggested the lic stance of disapproval hid eelings of relief that Noriega ap- parently had been dispatched. Nations from Mexico down to Ar- gentina issued critical statements deploring the resort to force and the violation of Panama’s sovereignty. The Brazilian government said it learned of the attack “with surprise and grave worry,” and that it ‘“‘de- plores what has happened in Pan- ama and vehemently exhorts that all parties work to find a peaceful and immediate solution to the cri- sis.” In Mexico, the government said the solution to Panama’s problems can be solved only by the Pan- amanian people and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. The Mexicans noted they had de- cried Noriega’s conduct in the past, but always have encouraged a dip- lomatic solution. ‘The fight against international crime is not sufficient reason to intervene in a sovereign nation,” the government said. In radio announcements and statements all day, most Latin American countries rejected the invasion as “‘interventionist.” Peruvian President Alan Garcia, who most strongly opposed the at- tack, even implied in a radio statement that the mid-February drug conference, which was to be attended by President Bush and Latin American leaders, should be postponed as a result of the U.S. intervention. Secretary of State James Baker said at a news conference that the response of Latin American leaders was about what the White House had expected. , “Some have privately expressed support, but said they’d have to reserve publicly,’ Baker said. “Some have flat out said they dis- agreed. And some have supported.” Uncertainty was the inant mode at the United Nations and the Organization of American States, both of which were asked to hold emergency debates on the invasion. In New York the Security Council met briefly and then adjourned af- ter the Nicaraguan ambassador asked for a resolution condemning the action and calling for immediate withdrawal of troops. At the OAS in Washington, the Nicaraguans made a similar, pro- posal after the Permanent Council reportedly decided in a closed door meeting to continue recognizing the envoy of the Noriega regime. Guillermo Endara Galimany, prevented by Noriega from taking office after he was selected by a majority of Panamanians to be their president last May, sent a telefax to the OAS just after 10 a.m., asking the organization to ac- cept the credentials of his appointee as ambassador.

        "ocr_text": "Germans brace for pandemonium as fabled gateway opens By loseph Albright Journal-Constitution Washington bureau » BERLIN — The Brandenburg | Gate, the splendid old symbol of German grandeur and humilia- tion, is due to reopen to Berliners today amid official fears of chaot- jie stampedes by pre-Christmas merrymakers. Late Thursday, about 50 East German construction troops be- gan tearing two 15-foot-wide holes in the wall on either side of the gale, using steam hammers and ‘construction cranes. Klaus Herzel, a spokesman of the West Berlin city government, said, “There will probably be 100,000 Berliners who rush in from the East and another 100,000 from the West, and they will prob- ably stomp on everything in their way, television cameras and everything.” _ Late Thursday, the mellow de- -meanor of the 500 people waiting in East Berlin and 1,000 more in West Berlin made it seem that Mr. Herzel’s fears might prove exaggerated. Yet East Berlin authorities also were worried about what happens when Berliners can ' stroll for the first time in 28 years through the German equivalent of France’s Are de Triomphe. The ceremony will be mini- _mal: mainly a handshake by West ‘German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ‘and East German Premier Hans Modrow and an appearance by the mayors of East and West Berlin. Then the footpaths are ex- _ pected to open, at least to holders pass beyond the wall and walk of East and West Berlin identity under the gate’s five monumental cards and several battalions of openings. the world’s press. Officials said it still was un- clear whether American and oth- er foreign tourists would be al- lowed to use this checkpoint to pass between the two halves of Berlin. Up to now, tourists have been required by East Berlin authori- ties to pass through Checkpoint Charlie, two miles away. After a day of conflicting statements about tourists’ access to the gate, East German spokes- man Gert Apeltz said toward mid- night that foreigners from the West would at least be allowed to Atlanta Constitution December 22, 1989 To reach East Berlin, they still may have to walk back to the West and make a detour through Checkpoint Charlie, Mr. Apeltz said. However, Berliners will be able to pass with minimal check- ing from one side of the city to the other. ; The Brandenburg Gate, the most notable example of German neo-Classical architecture, has towered over most of the mile- stones in recent German history. The first Brandenburg Gate was built in 1734 as one of 18 gates in the city wall. In 1788, Prussian King Frederick the Great ordered a new gate, and his architects modeled it on the Pro- pylaea, the great entrance hall on the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. Five openings pass through the arches. The middle passage- way, 18% feet wide, long was re- served for Prussian royalty. Napoleon rode through the gate on a white charger after con- quering Prussia in 1806. To rub it in, the French emperor carried off to Paris its crowning statue, the bronze Victory Goddess in a chariot drawn by four horses. In 1814, after defeating Napo- leon in Leipzig, the Prussian army marched through the gate, returning with the missing statue. Prussian soldiers paraded through the gate again in 1871 af- ter they had paid back the French by provoking a war and lopping off a province. Revolutionary crowds surged around the gate in the brief “rev- olution of the intellectuals” in 1848. Leftist radicals did likewise in 1918. When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, his followers car- ried torches in a parade that still gives older Berliners the shivers. They remember the brownshirts yelling, “Germany, awake!” When the Soviet army rum- bled down the Unter den Linden in 1945, they marked their take- over of Berlin by using the Bran- denburg Gate as the backdrop for their victory parade. In 1958, the damaged statue was recast from the original molds by a West Berlin restora- tion expert and turned over to East Berlin authorities to be placed back atop the 215-foot- wide gate, In 1961, the flight of East Ger- mans to the West caused a “youth drain,” impelling the East Ger- man government with Soviet backing to block the gate and put up the wall just a little farther in- side the lines of the Soviet zone set by the Allies in 1945. And it was here, in 1987, that President Ronald Reagan ges- tured to the Berlin Wall and chal- Jenged Soviet President Mikhail §. Gorbachev to tear it down. The official East German news agency reported that the only thing that could complicate plans to open the gate at the an- nounced hour would be “chaotic” scenes like the champagne-pop- ping dances atop the Berlin Wall when the first new crossings were cut on November 9. \f"

By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent BUCHAREST, Romania — On Christmas Eve, chaos continued in Romania several days after a popular but bloody uprising top- pled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Buildings continued to burn. Sniper fire could be heard through the capital. And a fledg- ling new government coalition struggled to break the nation free from a quarter-century of auto- cratic Stalinist rule. And on Christmas Eve, litter bearers continued to rush the wounded into an emergency hos- pital between bursts of rifle fire. It was surgical chief Dr. Ste- fan Kiescu’s job to stay awake one more night to help suture what has become a Romanian catastrophe. “I am so exhausted that | can’t feel it anymore,” Dr. Kiescu said. “We can’t feel it anymore.” And it was up to medical stu- dent Steve Ilicescu to help haul away the bodies that were dead on arrival. “We had eight here today. Because the hospital's make: shift morgue was so overcrowded, he had no choice but to put new bodies on the morgue floor in- stead of on a table, The provisional government, known as the National Salvation Committee, pleaded for peace on Christmas Eve, It called for a cease-fire in an attempt to disarm not only pro-Ceausescu secret po- lice but also vigilante groups that were taking weapons from dead soldiers and seeking revenge on the fallen regime’s supporters. With gunfire still erupting four or five times an hour in the capital's central district, no one Sunday had a fix on how many had been killed in the uprising, But it was clear at nightfall that Mr, Ceausescu, 71, and his wife, Elena, were defeated once and for all. They were reported in custody, and the new government pledged to put them on trial. Although they were driven from power by the army and a na- tionwide blossoming of popular committees, their outnumbered loyalists fought back resourceful: ly and brutally.’ Fifteen minutes before a Christmas Eve nighttime service was set to begin in the downtown Orthodox basilica, another street battle broke out involving ma- chine guns and a few heavy thuds of tank fire. The sounds came from the neighborhood of the ba- silica and lasted 10 minutes, p television station building, head: quarters of the new governing co- alition, and three people were re- ported killed before soldiers subdued the attackers. ! It appeared late Sunday that until the new National Salvation Front of intellectuals, students and army officers can show Mr. Ceausescu dead or alive on tele- vision, his die-hard secret police will not give up. Although there were nothing resembling reliable figures, the British Broadcasting Service said more than 5,000 were reported killed in Bucharest alone. There have been 4,000 deaths reported in the provincial city of Timisoara in western Romania, according to the Reuter news agency, The Bucharest emergency hospital received 504 patients shot or otherwise wounded in the past four days, hospital director Dr. Andrei Firica said Sunday. Of these, 201 were hospital- ized, 83 sent to the morgue, and the rest released after treatment, Dr. Firica said. “It has been a sort of collec- tive folly,” Dr. Firica said. And so it appeared to be on Saturday afternoon. Surgeons, nurses and medical students were working on the edge of exhaus: tion. One aide rushed into the sur- gical department toward nightfall clutching a bundle of perhaps 100 surgical bandages, “There's been more fighting near the Palace Athenee Hotel” in downtown Bucharest, she burst out. “We have to go immediately, but we don't have a car, Who has acar?” One of the young men wearing soiled surgical garb said, “We are only students here, There are no doctors, only assistants,” | The emergency hospital no longer lacked supplies of blood plasma and antibiotics, Dr. Firica said, thanks to French volunteer doctors who flew in adequate supplies, Reporters driving across the Yugoslavian border Sunday found only occasional shooting. But in town after town along the 325-mile route, army units and townspeople were cooperat: ing to staff roadblocks aimed at impeding pro-Ceausescu counter: attacks, In several small cities, the townspeople had sliced the ham- mer and sickle emblem out of the middle of the Romanian flag to create a doughnut-shaped flag with red, blue and yellow stripes.

Ceausescu and wife defiant to the end By Joseph Albright ’ Journal-Constitution correspondent BUCHAREST, Romania — Former President Nicolae Ceausescu was shown on television here early today defiantl challenging his military judges shortly before his death by fir- ing squad. At the end of the trial footage, the cameras cut to a grisly close-up of Ceausescu’s body lying on the ground. He is wearing a red tie, his eyes are open, and the right side of his head is stained with blood. His wife lies near- ee. Metin them is a blood-spattered wall. The graphic footage of the execu- tion, shown during the day Tuesday, of- fered the first proof of reports that Ceausescu was dead. . The broadcast that included the former dictator’s trial, however, was shown after midnight on state televi- sion, hours after it had been promised. The military judges and site of the trial were edited out of the footage. A member of the ruling provisional gov- ernment said there were fears that pro-Ceausescu forces would take re- venge against the judges if they were Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 27, 1989 > David C. Turnley/Detroit Free Press joins a rally demanding that no party members be allowed in the new regime. NEW ROMANIAN LEADERS STRUGGLE FOR STABILITY known. The trial footage showed the dictator, his voice breaking, as he demanded to have the case heard by ‘four great National Assembly.’’ An unseen military prosecutor was heard telling Ceausescu that his rubber-stamp Parliament had been dissolved by the popular forces that overthrew him. His aristocratic-looking wife, Elena, clad in an expensive gray winter coat and wool scarf, tried to brush aside charges that she spirited several hundred million dollars into a Swiss bank account. “All are lies from beginning to end,”? she said. “I consider the question a provocation.”’ As the shooting dies down and Romanians try to begin forming a post-Ceausescu government, they find that Television Free Roma- nia has taken on some of the at- tributes of a provisional government. *“Television is the only institu- tion that makes a connection be- tween the revolution and the peo- Ple,’’ Gratiela Ripeanu, a middle- level TV news editor, said. Mahae Lazar, another editor who helps decide what goes on the air, said, “‘For the first few days it was politics through tele- vision, and now it’s government through television.” Romania on Tuesday was a power vacuum that the outside world treated as a country. STRUGGLE FOR STABILITY There exists, of course, a pro- visional government, the National Salvation Front. It is an honor roll of longtime dissidents and writers, along with some army of- ficers. The provisional govern- ment acted Tuesday to fill the most critical jobs in the formal structure that is supposed to gov- ern until elections, scheduled for April, can be held. By naming Ion Iliescu as pro- visional president, Petre Roman as provisional premier, Dumitru Mazilu as vice president and Gen. Nicolae Militaru as minister of defense, the front did what would be sufficient in most countries to set a new government in motion. But everything in Romania is still vibrating from aftershocks. Some people immediately went into the streets, protesting that the new government con- tained too many Communist Party members. Even the United States, which quickly recognized the new gov- ernment, announced it will give its initial $500,000 in humanitar- ian aid to the International Red Cross Committee in Geneva, Swit- zerland, rather than to the provi- sional government or through its own embassy. Garbage is piling up in Bucha- rest subway stations. Street fight- ing has died down,. but nobody has begun to sweep up the shat- tered windows and bullet casings, let alone worry about the bullet- pocked buildings that demon- strate this was no show-and-tell revolution. The provisional government has remained out of sight except when one of its members goes on a TV talk show. No doubt for fear of getting killed by a sniper, the new leaders have not spoken in public. They let anonymous television announcers read unsigned com- muniques and shape public opin- ion on almost everything that happens. No public figure disclosed the execution of Ceausescu and his wife for alleged genocide and theft of $1 billion. It was a TV an- nouncer who read the news from a communique — and said that so many soldiers wanted to be part of the three-member firing squad that they were selected by lottery. The film of the executions’ af- termath was rough and possibly unedited when it first was shown on television. the trial footage, Ceausescu, who appeared ina makeshift dock made of portable tables, gestured his contempt and showed no remorse. “We are not treasonous to the people. It was the others,’”’ he said. It was unclear what “others” he meant. Never removing his heavy black coat, Ceausescu, Wi1, brushed aside charges that he and his security men massacred civilians during a protest earlier this month in the town of Timi- soara, near the Yugoslav border. “There was an attempted coup d’etat with terrorist and fas- cist units provoking terrorist ac- tions at Timisoara,”” he told the court-martial. Dramatic as the Ceausescu footage is, the revolution has brought no visual pizazz to Roma- nian television. Endless shows feature ‘‘talk- ing heads,’ people speaking into the camera about their thoughts and experiences in the revolu- tion. There are no cuts to crowd scenes and no grabbing graphics. The wonder is that the televi- sion station is broadcasting at all. The corridors still are creased with bullet marks, the remnants of a pitched battle inside the tele- vision complex that was waged between pro- and anti-Ceausescu forces. Yet ever since the people and the army took over the television complex early in the uprising, the die-hard pro-Ceausescu forces could not knock it off the air. Rumors have been so endemic that public figures have taken to broadcasting appeals that people not believe anything unless they hear it on television. Doina Cornea, a renowned dissident who sits on the 100- member council of the National Salvation Front, drew on her prestige as an advocate of free expression to stop the reign of rumors. “We have the right to go out in the street and say anything we want and think,’’ she said on tele- vision, *“‘but we must learn what is going on from the TV and not in the street.”’ With no other symbolic center for the new government, the bul- let-riddled television complex in downtown Bucharest has become a favorite hangout for Romanian revolutionaries and revolutionary groupies. “This is the heart of the na- tion,’” one student said. Army tanks remained in force around the complex. Everyone trying to get off the subway there was giv- en a very thorough pat-down and grilling by volunteer security people.

They also frequently had fresh flowers cut for family members. While the Ceausescus enjoyed lives of opulence, many Romanians lived in poverty. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were both executed Monday for crimes against the state. Their home, the Spring Palace in Bucha- rest, Romania, was invaded and looted at the start of the Roma- nia revolt Dec. 22. Journalists from around the world have been kept out since then. But revelations of the Ceauses- cus’ lavish way of life were report- ed today in the Atlanta Constitu- tion by Joseph Albright, a reporter for Cox News Service. He per- suaded a palace guard to let him tour the palace Wednesday. The handful of guards posted to stave off further looting said they were outraged at the luxury in which the Ceausescus lived while they lorded over the country of 23 million people. “I didn’t think that even a bil- lionaire could have so much,” said Octavio Badea, 23, a classical guitarist who joined the revolution. “T saw gold, gold, everywhere — gold vases, gold chandeliers, even the walls are covered in gold in some places,” Badea said. “I saw a grand piano, many Oriental car- pets, many, many pictures. ” Romanian art historians were still cataloging palace property that survived the looting.
