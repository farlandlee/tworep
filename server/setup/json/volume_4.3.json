        "ocr_text": " Reagan’s Visit Wins Welcome By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer CULLMAN — _ Thumbing his nose at the national Democrats Friday, Gov. George C. Wallace em- braced California's former GOP Gov. Ronald Reagan as a welcome visitor, increas- ing speculation the two may paif on an independent presi- dential ticket in 1976. - Specifically asked the pos- sibility of such a match, af- ter Wallace and Reagan met for a brief chat here prior to a civic meeting, the Ala- bama governor said nothing is ‘‘inconceivable.” , Reagan is visiting this small north Alabama city to address the annual meeting of the Cullman Chamber of Commerce, and Wallace in- troduced him to the cheering crowd. Prior to the official func- tion, Reagan held a mid-af- ternoon press conference at the local city hall, then trav- elled to a nearby motel for the meeting with Wallace When the two emerged from their conversation, Wallace told reporters the ‘hierarchy of the party I be- long to doesn't like me very well,’’ and suggested top Democrats might not appre- ciate his cordiality to the for- mer GOP governor, who has been highly critical of the Democratic Party. Wallace said the Demo- crats can ‘‘speculate all they want to’ about his intentions but held he “is glad to have Gov Reagan in Alabama He made a great governor ” Reagan was more nega- tive about similar press con- ference questions regarding a third party candidacy. Neither man has formally announced he is seeking the presidency in 1976, but both are considered to have serious intentions Reagan, who has been making public appearances across the country, is writ- ing cqnservative news col- umns and broadcasting daily radio shows since his retirement as governor of the nation’s largest state, population wise, repeated earlier comments that he does not seek to build a new third party, but to develop ‘‘a new second party’’—a GOP revised —_ to make it clear what the party stands for. “It is very difficult for me to see how such a _ ticket could come together,’’ Rea- gan said when questioned about a possible Wallace- Reagan ballot, noting he is a dedicated Republican and Wallace is working within March 22, 1975 the Democratic ranks. Asked specifically abcut a third party, Reagan said there's no way to speculate now whether the people ““may abandon the two par- ties for a new one.\" He said Wallace would be ‘‘a formidable foe’’ for any Republican candidate, but questioned whether Ala- bama’s governor could get the Democratic nomination. Reagan held the group of Democrats ‘‘who hijacked the party in 1972\" still are a strong force, and indicated they don’t look favorably on Wallace as a candidate. Expanding on his reasons for stumping the country, Reagan said he hopes to ‘dispel some economic fairy tales’’ and tell people how the system works. Many lack an under- standing of what the free en- terprise system is, he said, and are ignorant about the basics of government. There is ‘‘general dis- illusionment with politics and government in gener- al,’’ he said, with many of the 62 per cent who failed to vote in 1972 saying it didn’t mat- ter which party won anyway. Reagan said he hopes the Republicans will ‘‘broaden the base of the party to take in those who rejected the Democrats in 1972,’’ noting he also was a lifelong Demo- crat until he no longer could agree with what the party stood for. In other comments, Rea- gan said any decision about seeking the GOP presiden- tial nod next year ‘is down the road quite a way,” and added it’s too soon to eval- uate the job President Ger- ald Ford is doing in terms of whether he should be the Re- publicans’ top contender in the next presidential race. In his talk to the Cullman Chamber of Commerce, Reagan appropriately chose one of his favorite top- ics—the fate of the free en- terprise system. The former California gov- ernor said that while most economic problems today are attributed to the profit motive, the public must re- member that ‘‘profit, prop- erty and freedom are in- seperable. And you cannot have the third unless you have the first two.”’ Government interference in business has caused many of the problems Reagan held, saying America is the only country in the world ‘“‘where it takes more brains to figure out your income tax than to earn your income.” If the burgeoning bureau- cracy continues to grow, he charged, Americans will find themselves living in a nation where ‘‘everything that isn’t prohibited is com- pulsory,’’ and where govern- ment employes are equal in number to non-public work- ers. And, it is those govern- ment workers, who are ‘‘ffo- zen into their jobs by the civil service system,’’ who ac- tually set national policy, Reagan said. Reagan called for a media investigation into why the free enterprise system is blamed for most of the na- tion’s ills, falling short of suggesting a conspiracy is involved. ‘‘We cannot have a free press without a free econo- my,’’ Reagan said, adding that public opinion ‘‘has been molded into an anti- captalist mentality.”’ He did not say who is re- sponsible for the molding. If present trends continue, Reagan warned, socialism may be the result. ‘‘We're faced with the choice of a free market, which has blessed us beyond measure, or the deadly dul- Iness of socialism,’’ he said, disputing any claims that there may be a middle ground which would not lead to socialist government. In closing, Reagan recog- nized that ‘‘everybody wants a bigger slice of the pie,’’ and suggested the best way to let that happen is to ‘‘tell gov- ernment to get the hell out of the way and let the free en- terprise system make a big- ger pie.” \f"

        "ocr_text": "Educators Upset With Dr. Brown's Wielding of Power By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The demise of Leroy Brown may be at hand. That's not the Leroy Brown of popular song fame who's described as ‘‘meaner than a junkyard dog,” but — the man who superintends the massive bureaucracy known as the Alabama State Department of Education. Perhaps if Dr. Brown were meaner than a junkyard dog, he would not be in his present predicament. He has been, on the surface, polite, agreeable and willing to do the bidding of his State Board of Education and of the Alabama Legislature. Brown's innocuous public presence, however, appar- ently belies either an inability or a quiet, flat refusal to direct education operations the way the people who hold the pursestrings want them directed. At least since 1973 there have been frequent public criticisms of the superintendent in the legislative cham- bers, criticisms that have accelerated in frequency and intensity over recent months. Lately complaints also have rung loud from the board members who employ the state superintendent. Especially in the realm of budget-writing, board members have protested the law giving the superinten- dent power to propose to the legislature how much mon- ey is needed for and how it should be divided among primary and secondary schools, junior colleges and trade schools. Some board members also complain that they are limited to acting in many areas only on recommenda- tions made by Brown, that they are prohibited from act- ing on their own initiative. These and other complaints were taken to about a doz- en legislators in a closed-door breakfast meeting at a lo- cal motel Thursday. The lawmakers attending are ones with a proven in- terest in state education matters, such as the chairmen and members of the legislative education committees. House Speaker Joe McCorquodale, who has sug- gested perhaps the superintendent should be elected by the people rather than appointed by the board, said he was not invited. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, although asked to join the tete- a-tete, did not come. The legislators who did attend were handed a list of 11 recommendations for statutory changes that purpo- rtedly would give the board tools to wield the power of which it now feels deprived. However the legislators may have reacted at the meeting, most contacted later weren't too taken with the board's plan of action, expressing little sympathy over its plight. The most frequently heard comment was that if a - board can hire and fire its chief administrator, it should be able to keep him in line—whether in the field of budg- ets, new programs or anything else. And, the prevailing sentiment continued, if board members can't control the hired help, they ought to get rid of it. There was at least one legislative dissenter who said he believed the proposals to change the board's legal au- thority would ease the strained situation. It may have been a case of wishful thinking, but those who did pronounce the prevailing sentiment added they felt the board was swinging toward agreement. One legislator said it wasn't stated outright, but was strongly indicated that the board will be looking to re- place the superintendent and some division chiefs by this summer. Others agreed that could be surmised from the com- ments at the breakfast meeting, though they felt an ir- revocable decision had not been made. In any event, six of those legislators: contacted vowed no new powers would be extended to the state board un- til it shows a capacity to use the authority it already has, whether that be getting a new superintendent or grabb- ing a tighter hold of the reins over education. +++ ‘ “In my opinion, the Senate has accomplished more to- day and done more for the state of Alabama than at any- time in its history,” said State Sen. Joe Fine Thursday morning, just before moving that the august body ad- journ until the following Tuesday. ‘ In its 35-minute: meeting Thursday, the senators had recessed to hear three religious songs by a college choir, had recessed to hear a pitch from George ‘Goober’ Lindsey for legislative funding of the Special Olympics for handicapped children, and had recessed to meet the man selected state law enforcement officer of the year. As far as legislative business goes, senators in- troduced 15 bills, most of them local, and adopted sev- eral resolutions of commendation. Prior to the full Senate convening Thursday, two standing committees and one joint study committee met. It is questionable whether a quorum was present for most of the 35-minute meeting. For Thursday's work, each of the 35 senators received $50 in salary and expense money. March 23, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "SC Utility Act Analysis arallels Power Study (Related story, page 9) By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Public Service Commission’s staff as- sessment of the governor’s utility legislation in many ways parallels a similar analysis prepared by an Ala- bama Power Co. attorney. The PSC staff, which prepared the paper for the three commissioners evaluating how Gov, George C. Wal- lace’s eight bills on utility regulation will affect PSC op- erations, made essentially negative comments about the same six bills protested by Alabama Power attorney Jack Bingham. Bingham’s memorandum, written for Alabama Pow- er officials, was made public just after Wallace's legis- lation was unveiled two weeks ago. The PSC staff paper appeared last week. Not only does the staff analysis find objectionable the ,same six bills as does Bingham, it also comments favor- , ably on the same two he considered least negative to the utility. Bingham listed the bills in the order he felt most ob- jectionable to Alabama Power, and the PSC staff memo addressed the bills in that same order. In describing six of the bills, the PSC staff used ex-: actly the same words employed by Bingham. The legislation was not listed in that order in the gov- ernor’s call of the session or in his address to the legisla- ture the day the session began, nor were the bills in- troduced in that order. ‘ : The bill listed as most objectionable to Alabama Pow- er and also heading the PSC staff paper is described in both analyses as the “fuel and tax adjustment freeze: and cancellation.” The bill would prohibit the automatic pass-on to con- sumers of increased fuel costs borne by utilities. Bingham said the bill ‘‘would bring immediate dis- ruption in the operations of Alabama Power Co.,” while the PSC staff said it ‘‘would have an immediate effect on the Public Service Commission” by causing the com- mission to be involved in ‘‘constant utility rate hear- ings.” , The bill next most objectionable to Bingham, and the next bill on the PSC staff list, would require utilities to refund to customers any rates found on court appeal to be, excessive. While Bingham gave several negative effects of the bill, he noted that the courts have stated they are “not ratemaking bodies,” and this legislation would turn them into ratemakers. The PSC staff also noted the bill ‘would place the job of rate making in the hands of the courts on any rate case that was appealed,” and further would make the commission ‘‘tend to believe it did not have the final say so in a rate case.” ° The two bills at the end of both lists are described in both as ‘‘direct appeals to Supreme Court’ and “People’s Utility Counsel Bill.” Bingham was somewhat critical of the bill to elimi- Nate appeals of PSC decisions: to circuit court, sending them instead directly to the Alabama Supreme Court, saying the views of court members and administrators should be considered ‘‘as a matter of prime impor-. tance.” The PSC staff fully endorsed this bill as having “a favorable effect’? on the commission. ‘ The bill to create a new state office that would appear’ on behalf of the consumer in utility cases. “cannot be seriously argued with or opposed,”’ Bingham said, al- though he emphasized the office in question should be “truly independent’ of the governor. The PSC staff said. the bill “‘would not substantially affect” the commis- sion. ; Some members of the staff came under recent attack by PSC member Jim Zeigler, who charged before a leg- islative committee that some’ staffers are biased in fa- vor of Alabama Power and other utilities, that they don’t present objective information to the PSC. The staff later denied the charges before the same: committee. March 25, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Reinstate Death Penalty. Officers Urge Senators By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Law enforcement officers from across the state con- verged on an Alabama Sen- ate committee hearing Wednesday to plead for reinstatement of the death penalty. The only opponents testi- fying were three black legis- lators, who generally pro- tested the death penalty has not been an effective crime deterrent and historically has been meted to blacks, rather than white criminals. The committee also heard testimony on Bay Minette Sen. L.D. ‘‘Dick’’ Owen’s proposal to repeal the judi- cial article to the Alabama Constitution, learning after months of queries that it should cost the state an addi- tional $3.8 million in court- related expenses to imple- ment the article. ' In sometimes emotional testimony, committee mem- bers heard law enforcement officers ranging from Public Safety Director E.C. Doth- ard to Montgomery police of- fice Jim Gamble say the death penalty will deter serious crimes. ‘The criminal element has declared open season on law officers,’’ Col. Dothard said, adding that in the last ten years the homicide rate has doubled, and use of the death penalty has been aban- doned during most of that time. Gamble, a black officer, said ‘‘thugs on the street’’ know they will be out of pris- on in seven to ten years, re- gardless of what type crime they commit, so don’t hesi- tate to kill witnesses to their criminal activity—including policemen. Montgomery Police Chief Ed Wright declared that en- dorsement of the death pen- alty “‘is not an impulsive thing on the part of law en- forcement,’’ but has been supported for years. “Capital punishment is not a panacea,’’ Wright said, “but it is a major deterrent.” Birmingham Sen. U.W. Clemon countered that the deterrent value of the death penalty is ‘‘at best question- able,’’ saying history shows that violent crimes still were committed while criminals were being executed. ‘There are alternatives nobody has addressed,”’ Cle- mon said, suggesting life im- prisonment without a chance for parole might be suf- ficient deterrent. Sen. Wendell Mitchell of Luverne, bill sponsor, said his legislation fits the guide- iines for death penalty laws prescribed by all U.S. Su- preme Court justices in their rulings striking down exist- ing capital punishment pro- visions. Mitchell’s bill defines crimes of first and second degree murder, mandating the death penalty for con- victions of first degree cases. It leaves the jury to decide whether the act fits the first degree definition. First degree murder, un- der his bill, includes crimes such as murdering a peace officer or prosecutor en- gaged in official duties, mur- der for hire, murder of high U.S. officials, or murder dur- ing a rape, robbery or kid- naping. The Senate Judiciary Committee heard only gen- eral testimony on the issue itself, leaving a discussion of bill specifics till a meeting next week. At that time, said Com- mittee Chairman Finis St. John of Cullman, legal- ex- perts and criminologists are expected to address the con- stitutionality of the bill, and offer facts on whether capi- tal punishment has in fact been a crime deterrent and on how it has been used in the criminal justice system. Proponents of the judicial article approved in 1973 but not yet implemented, who appeared to protest Sen, Owen's repeal bill, appar- ently eased some legislative concerns over its cost. -Owen said after the meet- ing that he was pleased to fi- nally get firm dollar figures, noting another legislative committee had been unable to get-any cost projections in earlier attempts. The senator said his main objective in filing the bill to repeal was learning the cost, but indicated he has not com- pletely lost his desire to eliminate the new article. Among other things, the article sets up a new system of district courts to replace local inferior courts below the circuit level. Joe Johnston, chairman of an advisory commission working out specifics of im- plementation, said he hopes the legislature ‘‘won't forget we're talking about a system of justice . . . not just another budgetary item,’’ and as- sured committeemen the legislature has discretion over what to implement and when. Charles Cole, also working with the advisory commis- sion, said implementation will cost the state a min- imum of $3.8 million in new money not already spent on courts. Considering regular increases in present court system expenses, that prob- ably will mean an additional cost of $2 million a year, he said. March 27, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "EFix-Conwviet Relates Drugs, Abuse Storie By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The food is revolting, drugs abound, and weapons can be found in nearly every nook and cranny of Alabama prisons, a former inmate testified before a state legisla- tive committee Wednesday. Prison officials needn't resort to brutality, because other inmates will ‘do the dirty work” for them, and there exist other, more insidious forms of punishment, the young, bearded ex-con told members of the Joint In- terim Committee To Study the Criminal Justice Sys- tem. His mother spoke of another indignity. “The last time I visited Atmore I had to pull down my underclothes and squat over a mirror (before being ad- mitted),”” she said. “This tends to discourage visits.” The two appeared under auspices of the Link Society, a Statewide organization working to help former in- mates and their families, and were asked to give com- mittee members a view from the other side. Corrections “officials and others involved in the crimi- nal justice system already have testified. Earlier Wednesday, Mental Health Commissioner Taylor Hardin proposed creation of a new institution for the criminally insane, relating that Bryce Hospital now has more than 150 such residents housed with the gener- al population. Until recently, he said, many have been afforded grounds and town privileges. The former prisoner, now residing in Mobile, con- firmed impressions committee members have received through visits to corrections facilities, but added new details of conditions, He was transferred from a minimum security road camp assignment, he said, less than 48 hours after sur- reptitiously sending a letter to Prison Commissioner L.B. Sullivan outlining some conditions there. He was transferred to maximum security Atmore Prison, now called Fountain Correctional Center, after violating no prison regulations besides circumventing regular mail procedures, The former inmate, convicted on a charge of mari- juana possession, said there were ‘more drugs inside the prison than there were in Mobile County,” and added “‘it does promote tranquillity if the warden allows barbiturates in the prison.” Some drugs are sold by guards, he said, who also at limes sell back to inmates the homemade weapons they confiscate, Questioned by Mobile Rep. Gary Cooper about re- ports the prisons sell most of the meat raised on their farms, he confirmed that beefsteaks were served once, on Christmas. Pork is the normal meat diet, he said, and it's usually hog heads. Sometimes “you get a plate with eyeballs floating in it,” he added. “It’s terrible.” The ex-convict said food wasn't a big problem for him, since his family and friends provided money to pur- chase cookies and such from the prison store. “It's the ones who don’t have money that have prob- lems,\" he said, and those must resort to stealing, or sell- ing drugs, or paid homosexuality. He told of unsanitary food conditions, too, such as a second floor commode at the work camp that period- ically overflowed into pots and pans in the first floor kitchen, and the transportation of bread in a truck used to cart garbage. The weapons are surprisingly sophisticated for ma- terials available, he said, and are hidden throughout the prison, even in the warden’s office, “You can get arly kind of weapon you want,” he said, The testimony from Hardin centered on problems surrounding those found not guilty by reason of in- sanity, or inmates who develop mental problems in pris- on, who are sent to state mental institutions. “We are not equipped, prepared or conditioned to op- crate custodial institutions,” Hardin said, adding legis- lation is being drafted to create a new facility for such persons, There are 21 in Searcy and 163 in Bryce, he said, and of those at Bryce only 53 are housed in a higher security setting than the general population. Hardin suggested changes are needed in laws that de- tail how to commit criminals, but vague about how to re- turn them to sociely or to prison. The current statutes say they will leave mental in- stitutions when restored ‘‘to sound mind.” March 27, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "House By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace’s proposals to change state utility regulation sailed through the Alabama House with relative ease Tuesday, suffering some changes but no major overhaul. The lower chamber ap- proved all eight bills for which Wallace called this three-week-old special ses- sion, plus a ninth, related measure given adminis- tration. support. The path for approving the entire package was cleared early, when the House adopted a special order ca- lendar written by its Rules Committee. The new calen- dar contained all nine bills, interspersed among unre- lated legislation. on the regu- lar calendar, due to the order they were reported out of committee. Most opposition was to the bill changing the rate base which determines how much utilities can charge custom- ers, and, unexpectedly, to a bill establishing a new con- sumer counsel to appear in utility regulatory proceed- ings on behalf of the con- sumer. The rate base bill, as amended by committee and approved by the House, would have rates calculated on the basis of a utilitv’s in- vestment at the close of the 12-month period prior to the filing for a rate increase. Currently, utilities use the 12-month test period, plus they are allowed to add esti- mated investment expected in the coming year. Birmingham Rep. Dewey White won some support for Oks 9 Utility Bills what he called a ‘‘com- promise amendment” that would set a test period cov- ering the six months prior to and the six months after a rate increase application had been filed with the Pub- lic Service Commission. Rep. Bobby Tom Crowe of Townley, bill sponsor, con- tended . the change would defeat the purpose of the measure, which he said is to remove the speculative na- ture from rate cases. Much discussion through- out the afternoon centered on how the proposals would affect Alabama Power Co., the state’s biggest utility, and supporters of White questioned whether the ad- ministration bill would cur- tail the company’s ability to expand when it cannot meet current needs without pur- chasing power from other electric utilities. Marion Rep. R. Leigh Pegues, member of a special utility study committee, countered that Alabama ‘Power told his committee it already has substantially more generating capacity than is demanded, and is building even more. The amendment was de- feated by a 61-32 vote to table, and the bill was passed’ shortly afterward, 90-9. Mobile Rep. Gary Cooper’ ran into even more opposi-’ tion to his bill that would: create the consumer counsel’ office, with numerous com-' plaints that it would be too’ costly and would add anoth- er layer of bureaucracy to state government. The bill calls for the coun- sel to be appointed by the governor with Senate con- firmation, and would allow hiring of unlimited staff at unspecified expense. Cooper said at the start he expected the new office would cost the state about $150,000 a year, and finally agreed to an amendment by Tallassee Rep. Jack Venable setting an expense ceiling of $75,000 for the remaining six months of this fiscal year. The legislature would ap- prove a budget for the office during the regular session this summer, covering the upcoming two-year budget period, Several other proposed amendments were rejected, and the bill ultimately passed by a vote of 75-23. Only minor debate was sparked by the remaining bills, which, as passed, would do the following: —Prohibit utilities from automatically, charging con- sumers for their additional fuel costs, but require the PSC to act within 30 days on requests to charge more, so utilities wouldn’t be forced to suffer lengthy delays associ- ated with regular rate pro- ceedings. Gas distribution utilities would still have the fuel rider, provided they pur- chase their gas from a com- pany regulated by a federal agency. —Require utilities to re- fund any rates found to be il- legally high by the courts. An amendment adds they must make the refunds with in- terest. —Require utilities to in- form area landowners be- fore they request PSC per- mission to build a new plant, and require the PSC to hold a hearing on that application in the county proposed for the construction project. An amendment would require such notification—and apparently a hearing—when itilities propose to put up transmission and dis- tribution lines. —Allow appeals of PSC de- cisions on the basis they were ‘‘arbitrary, capricious or inconsistent,’’ and prohi- bit courts from remanding cases to the PSC with in- structions to consider new evidence. —Send appeals of PSC de- cisions directly to the Ala- bama Supreme Court, by- passing the circuit court, ind require the high court to give these appeals preferred status over other cases. —Prohibit independent telephone companies from automatically increasing charges when South Central Bell raises its charges to in- dependents on equipment rental. An amendment lim- its this to companies making gross revenue of $5 million a year or more, which means only two companies would be affected. —Require utilities to win PSC approval to construct a new plant prior to con- demning land where the fa- cility is planned to. be lo- cated.

        "ocr_text": " Lawmakers Begin To Feel Twinges Of Budget Headache By MARCIA ‘KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer As the calendar runs out on the current special legis- lative session, Alabama lawmakers are beginning to feel twinges of what should be the biggest headache of the upcoming regular session—budgeting. Just as families across the country are straining to make their finances cover their needs, so will the legis- lature be asked to blanket ever-increasing demands for state services with state resources that are more the size of a beach towel. The regular session begins May 6, and considering the retarded pace of action in this special session, there likely will not even be time for budget hearings between the two. That has caused some concern, particularly on the part of legislators who sit on the two finance committees and are charged with writing the budgets. Several members of the Senate Finance and Taxation Committee, including Chairman L.D. ‘Dick’ Owen of Bay Minette, have expressed hopes that the regular ses- sion can be recessed at least for a short time to allow completion of the hearings. _ Some testimony has been taken, but much of that came during a time of confusion, while lawmakers were in the throes of preliminaries or clean-up operations at- tending the three special sessions called since January. The committee members generally say that what they've heard so far hasn’t been too comforting. While there’s plenty to spend on education—in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion—the general fund revenues that support most other state operations aren’t quite as healthy. Not that revenue is decreasing. It just isn’t growing at the same leaps and bounds as the demiands on it are. State Budget Officer James V. Jordan told legislators on the finance committees that they'll have about $30 million more to spend from the general fund for the next two years than they had for 1973-75, That's about $15 million a year, and it won’t go far when considering new costs just in the areas of mental health, prisons, highways and Medicaid. Then there's salary increases for state employes, too, which lawmakers feel will be virtually a necessity if only because teachers will get raises from the education money. Employes caught in the inflation spiral like everyone else apparently have eased their push for an immediate raise, after the Finance and Taxation Committee put down its collective foot in opposition. While the committeemen ranted about undue pres- sure from the state workers, several commented that was a convenient excuse to delay action till the legisla- ture can get a better overview of state finances this summer, The same committee did vote a longevity raise for state troopers last week—despite some members’ pro- tests that the move was unfair to other state employes who were turned down earlier—but the bill to benefit troopers might not live long enough to get across the ro- tunda. Gov. George C. Wallace, who has been working on the administration's budget proposals to the legislature, re- portedly' is confident the money is there to give at least a moderate boost to employe paychecks. Sources close to Wallace say he is planning a true aus- terity budget, which would leave almost all state de- partments and agencies with the same ledgers used in this budget period. Areas due increases, they say, are the above-men- tioned ones of mental health, prisons, highways and Me- dicaid. : Kven if other departments are placed in a holding pat- tern—and if the budget officer's revenue estimates can be taken as accurate—the general fund still may not be able to support what's needed in those few areas. Which is why, aides close to Wallace say, the governor is again considering what has become known as ‘‘a raid\" on the Special Education Trust Fund. The SETF is where revenue including state income and sales taxes goes, and is reserved for education purposes only. And educators have jealously guarded it. Wallace tried to pry loose some of the money for other than education spending in 1971, but the governor was trounced in a bloody legislative battle, Whether he actually will chance a repeat perform- ance remains in question, with those lawmakers and even some aides privy to Wallace’s thoughts guessing he won't. Wallace reportedly is thinking about giving primary and secondary education just about everything desired, while cutting back in higher education. That is in hopes of drawing less protest from what has become one of the strongest lobbies on the Hill, the Ala- bama Education Association. It was the AEA that mounted ‘he successful attack in 1971, and legislators say they doubt the teachers would sit back to allow the setting of what they feel would be a dangerous precedent. . The universities, too, have been successful in locating legislative pressure points, and they hardly can be ex- pected to welcomé an SETF raid at their expense. Some legislators agree with Wallace's sentiment that educators of all stripes have become too possessive of the trust fund, but they also say the reality is that the SETF is locked up, and they're looking elsewhere for April 13, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Lawmakers Revert To ‘Squeeze Play’ In Utility Session By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Legislature is returning to the norm, proving its actions in the first two special sessions this year were merely a deviation from a time-tested pat- tern. And, once again, Gov. George Wallace will emerge on top of the political heap, regardless of what the lawmak- ers do or fail to do. The current special session, called by Wallace for passage of bills that would tighten the Public Service Commission’s regulatory grasp over utilities, must end in two weeks in deference to the start of the regular ses- sion May 6. While a smattering of legislation has been added to the law books, the real hot items—the utility bills and several others—have been left for last-minute action per usual. It's the old squeeze play technique in common use on both sides of the rotunda for years, although put aside for the two five-day sessions prior to this one. The method behind the delay-now-act-later madness is to force quick approval by the other chamber, since failure to act leaves the finger of blame on the body caught in the squeeze play. For example, if the Alabama Senate hangs on to the governor's utility legislation till the last day, then sends it over to the House in greatly altered form, the lower chamber will be in a bind of agreeing with the Senate changes, or killing Wallace’s bills. There are numerous justifiable reasons for deliber- ative action, especially when considering legislation that would have major impact on the lives of so many Alabamians. The members of the committee that has had the bills, the Committee on Commerce, Transportation and Utili- ties, have expressed a desire to hear extensive testi- mony on the potential effect of the legislation before making their decision on whether to approve it and in what form. That's difficult to argue with. So, the committee not only spent a couple weeks doing just that, but it even waited until the House acted on the bills so members could learn everybody's opinion on any amendments tacked on to the measures in the lower That is a big change from some earlier performances that resulted in lawmakers writing laws and later learn- ing they didn’t do exactly what they were supposed to do, or at least had some rather unexpected con- sequences. The judicial article to the Alabama Constitution is a case in point. The Senate committee, however, after sitting through sometimes tedious hours of hearings on the utility bills, decided simply to approve the legislation with no com- ment, debate or amendment, and send it on out to the full Senate. The action was taken in about a 20-minute session last week. Committee Chairman Ronnie Flippo said the group didn't want to unduly influence any other senators by taking a stand on the merits of the bills. Some other lawmakers quietly wondered whether that perhaps isn't what the committee system is all about—giving a sub-group of the full body the opportun- ity to dig into various proposals and then recommend action to their brethren on the basis of what was found out through committee work. That never has been considered undue influence in the long years this system has been in use, but has been found a rather expedient way of tackling problems. Sort of a division of labor concept. But the bills have been reported out of committee, and will be on the Senate calendar for debate Tuesday. They will, however, be sitting at the bottom of the ca- lendar unless the Senate Rules Committee proposes a special order of business placing them in a more pro- pitious position for action. Red Level Sen. E.C. Crum\" Foshee, chairman of the Rules Committee and one of the very few senators who endorse the governor's package, said late last week he probably will try to do just that, but isn’t sure his com- mittee members will comply. He also admitted seeing some merit in Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley's earlier expression of hopes the Senate will get rid of other pending legislation before attacking the util- ity bills, which are likely to tie up substantial time in de- bate. With a total of four legislative days left—the lawmak- ers decided at the start only to convene on Tuesday and Thursday—that means the bills hotly protested by utili- ty officials wouldn't win Senate passage until the 11th our. The 12th hour would find them back in the House of Representatives for concurrence with amendments, or for the death knell. While all this is transpiring, Gov. Wallace can sit back with the knowledge his political image will be golden, regardless of what the legislature does. It is the law- makers who will be tarnished. Wallace has proposed the bills he said can be a tool—not a panacea—for more closely regulating utili- ties. If they are passed and do in fact help, the governor gets credit. If they are passed and have little effect, it can be said the tools were not used well. And, if they are not passed or are greatly changed, the governor will have tried, but been thwarted by a reluctant legislature. April 20, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Brown’s Merit Not Ca By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Twice last week LeRoy Brown was the wrench “ f i ar y ae ge ‘ or MW Be ) “he i\" thrown into the workings of the Alabama Senate, but Brown himself or the merits of his service as state educa- tion superintendent may have had little to do with the _ disruption. As with most con- troversies that arise in that’ body of 35 politicians, the one tagged LeRoy Brown carries political innuendoes and Shadings that could be and have been interpreted about 35 different ways. The main adversaries in this particular battle were Sen. Joe Fine of Russellville, president pro tem, and Arab Sen. Sid McDonald, chair- man of the Senate Education Committee. On the most superficial level, the argument was over two bills by McDonald, which would raise the max- imum salary for the state su- perintendent from $28,000 to about $40,000 and would au- thorize the superintendent to hire and fire his top six ad- ministrators without adher- ing to restrictions carried in the merit system. Fine said he especially op- posed the hiring-firing bill, although, and this begins reaching down to the next level, measures were part of an ef- fort to get rid of Dr. Brown. McDonald had said the bills could be interpreted as a tool for attracting a new education leader, should Brown bite the dust, since they would offer more mon- ey and the opportunity for a he protested that both ate Catena new superintendent to bring on board his own top aides. That matter was ad- dressed on the Senate floor, with McDonald charging the State department had be- come a ‘‘dull bureaucracy’”’ that could use some bright, new leadership, and Fine holding that Brown does an use of Controversy STF Wigon by i) excellent job, for which the ‘Senate and state should be grateful. Fine also protested that passage of the bills would al- low the State Board of Edu- cation, which decides wheth- er the superintendent stays or goes, to use the legislature aS an excuse to send Brown packing. April 20, 1975 > \f The board, he said, could rationalize that the lawmak- ers, who finance education programs, showed through these bills that they want Brown out. Probably a majority of legislators agree that would be the interpretation, and further, agree that’s an ac- curate assessment of legisla- tive feelings toward Dr. Brown. The board, however, threw its own little wrench into the scenario by remov- ing Brown before the bills even came up for Senate’ vote, taking its own stand on the superintendent before learning the official legisla- tive sentiment. : The third level of the con- troversy was barely touched upon during Senate debate, but was made a public con- nection by the board on the same day it announced Brown would be deposed in September. As Sen. Fine was ex- pressing concern over the fate of education depart- ment administrators who would lose protection of the merit system, McDonald asked which of the officials had prompted Fine’s de- fense of the group. Fine ignored the question, and just kept on filibustering the bills. That was on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the state board not only removed Brown as superintendent, but took to task T.L. Faulk- ner, director of the depart- ment’s Vocational] leges Division. Faulkner, who would be subject to McDonald’s merit system bill, had ordered a new airplane without notify- ing the board, and board members asked for details of the arrangement—including why Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley used the plane so much. An aide to Beasley, who just happened to be at the board meeting, assured questioning members the lieutenant governor never flew in the craft for political Purposes, but only for state business. Beasley has taken no pub- lic part in the Senate con- troversy over McDonald’s bills, and, in fact, absented himself from the presiding officer's chair the first day they were scheduled for de- bate. That left the gavel in the hands of Fine, who owes his job as number two man in the Senate to Beasley, who has been a top advisor to Beasley for several years, and who loaned Beasley $9,000 to help finance the lieutenant governor's Demo- Educa-_— tion and Community Col- cratic primary campaign for re-election. Fine did leave the pre- siding officer’s chair long enough to filibuster McDonald’s bills, but re- turned in time to cut off de- bate on them. Several sena- tors accused him on the floor of using unfair tactics in so- doing. Anticipating a link be- tween the two, Fine declared he acted only for himself, not for Beasley, and that he ac- ted on behalf of his friend Dr. Brown. The day after Brown was removed by the state board, Fine returned to the Senate microphone to ask his col- leagues to pass a motion Say- ing the Senate disapproved of the board’s move, an ef- fort to involve the Senate ina matter that Fine said two- days earlier should not have legislative involvement. Fine also was accused on the Senate floor of attempt- ing to embarrass the man he said earlier he was befriend- ing, an accusation that grew out of the knowledge that most senators had not been terribly pleased with Brown's work, and could not support such a motion on his behalf. And they didn't, killing Fine’s motion by a vote of 20 to 10. The two bills will come up again this week in the Sen- ate, unless a special order calendar without McDonald's bills is adopted. Although LeRoy Brown no longer will be an issue—the state board settled that last week—McDonald and others are betting the dispute has not been laid to rest. April 20, 1975 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "‘Dummy’ Payrolls Hide 132 Education Employes By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Federal and state funds channeled through Montgom- ery’s Patterson State Technical College pay the salaries of 66 non-merit system employes of the Vocational Edu- cation Division of the State Department of Education. T.L. Faulkner, division chief, told The Advertiser Tuesday that another 66 division workers are on the payrolls of Auburn University, the University of Ala- bama, the University of Montevallo and Tuskegee In- stitute, All are paid with state funds, he said, and none are subject to hiring provisions of the merit system. Faulkner was queried on his division's payroll system after State Sen. Sid McDonald asked the Alabama Sen- ate to investigate what he said is similar to “a dummy corporation” at Patterson. McDonald said on the Senate floor that he believes “administrative control is being escaped by using this school for the disbursement of federal funds,” and that the payroll method ‘‘clearly is an attempt to escape the provisions of the merit system,” His resolution to create a joint investigative com- mittee was referred to the Senate Rules Committee for action. Faulkner .said administrative and clerical employes of his division's technical college branch, junior college branch and Alabama Industrial Development (AID) training program are listed on the payroll of Patterson, although they do not work at or for the technical college. Some in the technical branch, including Director H. F. Worthy, have worked for the division on the Patter- son payroll and outside the merit system as long as three years, Persons in that branch and in the junior college branch “are in the process of becoming merit system,” Faulkner said, a process that has been “‘in the planning stages for about a year,” Faulkner said there was no earlier effort to bring them under the system—which requires employes to pass certain tests and meet specific job quali- fications—because the technical branch “was more or less in the experimental stage.” The 30 employes of AID and the two branches are em- ployes of the state education department paid with state funds, which are funneled through the department lo Patterson, then to the employes. Employes of most state departments are paid directly by the department, listed in department budg- ets. Another 36 employes of federally-funded programs also are paid through Patterson, he said, who have noth- ing to do with operations at the technical school. Faulkner said his division has another 66 workers list- ed on the payrolls of the four state universities, who also are paid with state funds and are not subject to merit system regulations, Persons not under the merit system can be hired an and fired at will, and are not forced to meet state job qualifications, Faulkner said there is “nothing new about using state institutions as fiscal agents for special programs,” add- ing the practice has been in use 14 years, in varying de- grees, “The pattern was used long before my time as direc- tor,” he said. “I did not invent it, but it does fill a need for the operation of special programs that could not be operated efficiently through other procedures.” Faulkner said no law is violated by placing outside employes on the payrolls of Patterson or of the univer- silies, that the funds are audited and that no spending controls of the State Board of Education are bypassed. He said the system is especially needed for federal programs, since these often are funded on an annual basis and must be geared up quickly in order to become eligible for federal funding. Employing personnel through the merit system for these programs takes too long, he said, since the State: Personnel Board must establish job descriptions tor each position, give examinations and recrult the people, Worthy, director of the technical division which overs sees Patterson College, echoed Faulkner's comments that ds are channeled through the school “mainly be- cause we have facilities to do it at Patterson.” He mentioned availability of a computer there, but when reminded the state department also has a comput: ef for such uses, Worthy said he doesn’t ‘‘know exactly’ why it's done this way, except being able to handle the ‘ “There has been no wrongdoing,” Worthy said. “The concern is quite a bit blown out of proportion.” When informed of the facts freely given by Faulkner and Worthy, Sen. McDonald said they ‘clearly illus. trate there are proper questions that should be an- swered by the state department.” “Funding the junior college branch through a techni- cal school does not seem administratively correct,” McDonald said, April 23, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Senators Protest Too Loud, Too Long For Others’ Comfort By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Righteous indignation sometimes has a way of swell- ing the air so that when you get too much of it in one room, breathing almost becomes difficult. That is not an individual observance, though it prob- ably doesn’t describe the feelings of every last person who partook of the Alabama Senate episode which prompted it, It does characterize the obvious discomfort shared by some as they watched six senators do what is termed ‘rise to a point of personal privilege,\"’ which is the parlia- mentary tool for gaining recognition to speak when the hopeful speaker wants to talk about something not directly related to the merits of the business at hand. The six rose to declare they are morally upright in their conduct of official duties, i.e., that they are not on the take. They had not, in fact, been charged with nefarious ac- tivities. One senator had made a general charge in public that some legislators are on utilities’ payrolls to influence leg- islation, and a news account reported that these six had financial links of one sort or another to a utility. One of the six protested the news account was flat in- accurate, others said any ties they had to utilities had been broken, and some said the businesses connected with them would not be affected by the utility legislation under consideration. All maintained their votes wouldn't be swayed by out- side business dealings anyway. The fact remains that some did and still do have a role in the utility world, even if they only play a bit part, and that information was made public knowledge mainly because the senators had reported it to the Alabama Ethics Commission. While there was no accusatory finger waving in their faces, all were obviously miffed to one degree or another that these past or present connections would be pointed out to the general public, since merely pointing them out raised some question of propriety. One senator even noted he does “not need the press or anyone else to remind me of my responsibilities.” Perhaps—probably—he does not. But, such comments are a far cry from the staunch stands being taken over the past two years that econom- ic disclosure is the best means to prevent public officials from circumspect activities. That argument has been advanced frequently, as leg- islators and others proclaim there is no need to prohibit any financial transactions between officials and private business or public agencies. That is punitive to the officials, leaving them at a pro- fessional disadvantage compared to the general public, they say, and is unnecessary as long as they relate con- nections that might be considered a conflict of interest. Such disclosure would give the voters ample oppor- tunity to decide whether their elected officials are per- forming up to desired standards, the argument contin-. ues. Jf the voters disapprove, they can make themselves heard at the ballot box. Regardless of the merits of that argument, it would ap- pear that some senators don't buy it as fully as they did once, that they resent disseminating to the general pub- lic the information that is supposed to help the voters judge their governing officials. While no one challenged the right of these six senators to explain their respective situations, to clear any mis- interpretation or taint on their reputations, some ob- servers in the gallery and chamber recalled the adage about protesting too much. +++ By the time this special legislative session is finished, officials of Alabama's major utilities should be candi- dates for a respite in a rest home. Their celebrations of one day revert to long faces and jitters the next, as Gov. George Wallace's legislation to change utility regulation progresses through the legis- lative process with about as much stability as an old wooden cartload of brick being pushed down a rutted road. Especially in the Alabama Senate, sentiment toward Wallace's proposals swings from day to day and even from one moment to the next. As of Sunday, April 27, the final form this legislation will take remains in question, just as it has since the ses- sion began March 18. The waiting will be over this week, however, since the session must be adjourned to allow the regular session to begin the following week. The Senate may never be forced—or be permitted— to take a stand, if threats are made good to continue the filibusters that have prevented much substantive action on the utility bills in recent da April 27, 1975 \f"

Wallace admitted Thursday he had lost. his. legislative battle for tighter control, over utilities, but said he may take the war to a new front—the _ court- room. \"The utilities just won, and they always win,\" Wal- lace told reporters after his package of nine bills gasped its dying breath in the Ala- bama Senate on Thursday afternoon. But he noted the same leg- islation had been prefiled for possible action in the regular legislative session beginning ‘Tuesday, and dropped a new bombshell on Alabama _utili- ties by threatening the law- suit. Wallace said he is consid- ering u suit to test whether the fuel pass-on clause is le- gal. Through the fuel provi- ‘sion utilities may charge consumers the: higher costs utilities inust pay for fuel. ““Phat’s the same thing as u rate increase,” the gover- nor said, which can only be charged after approval of the Public Service Commis- sion. Wallace’s bill to prohibit the fuel pass-on was the most hotly protested by utili- lies—mainly by Alabama Power Co.—and was the measure which prompted a week-long Senate filibuster that closed the special ses- sion Thursday. Wallace claimed utilities have no right to get more money from their custom- ers, unless there first is a hearing on the proposal. The governor showed little bitterness toward the sena- turs who defeated his plan, noting he has ‘‘never seen a governor or a president who didn’t lose legislative figghts.*~ Wallace said he is ‘‘grate- ful\"’ to the Alabama House of Representatives for approv- ing his legislation, but em- phasized again he does not “impugn anybody's mo- tives”\" for refusing action in the Senate. Repgpurding the upcoming regular session, expected to recess for two or three weeks as soon as it begins Tuesday, Wallace said he would pro- pose ua new prison and other solutions to statewide  prob- lems. The governor said he still is considering a special ses- sion for passage of the edu- cation budget, but that he has made no firm decision on that. lic would not specifically suy whether he would ask the lawmakers to remove some revenues now earmarked for the overflowing education trust fund, but did add that if the legislature fails to accept udministration solutions to problems such as prison overcrowding, the body will huve to levy new taxes. --And L'1l veto that,” said. he Also expressing some con-: cern over what will happen in the regular session were I.t. Gov. Jere Beasley and Ilouse Speaker i@Joe McCorquodale. Beasley said he hopes the recess will “let tempers cool down a little,’ ° and ex- pressed tears that the hot utility battle could ‘‘leave some permanent scar tis- suc” among senators. Beasley has publicly sup- ported the governor's pack- upe since the special session began. and said Thursday that any session which re- sulted in their defeat would have to be termed ‘‘unsatis- factory.\"\" The lieutenant governor said feelings shown in the chamber Thursday ‘‘were higher than I've ever seen before,\" and added he hopes both opposing senators and Senate-House relations can be ‘‘reconciled’’ by the regu- lar session. **I don't like the idea of pit- ting one house against the other,\" Beasley said. McCorquodale expressed similar sentiments about the obvious friction between the House—which readily ap- “proved Wallace's bills—and the Senate. : *‘What I hope the Senate and House entire member- ships will remember is that we're all here as elected offi- cials, representing essen- tially the same people. . .and won't let personalities get into it,\"° the speaker said. McCorquodale added he hoped the ‘‘confrontation”’ between the two ‘chambers will be ‘“‘put aside’* by the regular session, although he admitted there is no assur- ance the next session will be any smoother than this was.

The concept of majority rule was shattered for them by the reality that minority—sometimes excrutiatingly small minority—power plays frequently overcome the wishes of the many. The frustrating lesson’ they learned was one apparent- ly accepted long ago by participants and observers of Alabama politics, of the-State Legislature in particular. The young folks directly affected, however, didn’t re- spond quite as graciously to the process as those more experienced souls who either have learned to live with it, or better, how to manipulate it to their advantage. What the young people were pushing was a bill to make 18 the age of majority—to give legal rights and re- sponsiblities to those who in many if not most cases have physically left the protective wings of their families for college or jobs. The bill did win overwhelming support and passage in ‘the House of Representatives, but got trapped and expired in Senate political maneuverings which had nothing to do with the merits of this particular piece of legislation. Joel Odum, official spokesman for the youth contin- gent, said after the special session ended Friday with- out passage of the bill that the Senate “drug its feet and dodged the issue.\"’ “The majority of both the House and Senate wanted passage of this bill, but the machinery of the Senate is set up so that it is difficult for any legislation to get quick approval when a few are opposed,”’ Odum said. His was the official statement, one considerably more moderate than some other comments emanating from the mouths of others as they watched their bill slowly grind through the legislative mill. Shaken heads and looks of dismay were prevalent among those couple dozen who participated or observed various phases of the process. Those few—few in comparison with the multitude who would be affected—weren’t the only ones keeping close tabs on what the legislators did. Student governing bodies and newspapers expressed vocal support for the change, and this newspaper office received near-daily calls from young people wonder- ing what was happening. On several occasions they could be told something had indeed happened. Such as when the House approved the bill or the Senate Judiciary Committee amended both the Senate and House versions to change the age to 19, rather than 18. In most cases they received the non-news that nothing had happened, that the Senate, was tied up first in one filibuster, then another, and then yet another. Many of those callers and observers found it difficult to understand how legislation so important to so many could lie neglected when there was so little actual oppo- sition to it. . . ‘The civics classes never dealt with that problem, Still, they have not given up the fight. Odum promised that young adults from across the state are prepared to return to Montgomery and stay for the entire summer, if necessary, to work for passage of the same bill, which already has been prefiled for the regular session. The youths who lost out in the special session aren't the only ones questioning the logic of Alabama Senate workings. Some of the senators themselves wondered aloud at the floor microphone why their brethren wouldn't take up even the non-controversial legislation that had ma- jority support. In the last days of the session there were innumer- able, mostly unsuccessful, tries to win consideration of bills in that category. Sen. John Baker of Rainsville wanted to do it the democratic way, letting each senator have a go at bring- ing up only those bills to which no other senator had an objection. That's known as Senate “‘baseball,’? when each man has a turn at bat and is allowed three strikes to bring up non-protested bills. Baker and others repeatedly pleaded on behalf of the game, in hopes the legislature could rack up a little bet- ter record of accomplishments than it did, asking why some few of their colleagues wanted to stymie all ac- tion, Just as the young people, they never got much of a re- sponse as to why some senators refused to let bills sail or sink on their own merit, Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley did finally initiate “baseball” by executive decision in the final hour of the final day of the session. : But, even then, rather than face even non-con- troversial bills, the Senate voted to end the session and go home. Many of the general bills that died on the Senate ca- lendar that day, including the 18-year-old adult bill, will come up again this summer in regular session. The legislature, however, faces not only a replay on the utility legislation that caused so much opposition in the regular session, but a plethora of controversial ranging from budgets to the death penalty to the judicial article. With that kind of agenda, plus the Senate's demon- strated tendency to stall an issue rather than vote on it, there's no guarantee the regular session will produce much more than the special, May 4, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "ontroversy Grows Over Job, Duties Of Fiscal Officer By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer What's a legislative fiscal officer, and who cares, any- way? Most people in Alabama probably never heard of any such animal, nor do they likely feel particularly depr- ived by their lack of knowledge. In fact, those who are familiar with the fiscal officer's job must be limited to the relatively small circle of people who frequent the chambers of the Alabama Leg- islature, i.e., lobbyists, some state department offi- cials, members of the news media, and the lawmakers themselves. There would be no reason to further clutter minds with information about the fiscal officer, except that a modest controversy has arisen in the legislature over the office and man who held it until most recently, so some explanation seems in order. First, what is fiscal? Although the word generally relates to financial mat- ters, it more specifically is used in speaking of public fi- nances, such as government taxation, revenues or debt management. Second, what is the role of the fiscal office in this state's legislature, and how did it happen into being? The office was created by resolution in the third spe- cial session of the 1971 legislature, a time when legisla- tive independence was the hue and cry, The lawmakers, especially in the Alabama Senate, were looking for some means of breaking, or at least of minimizing, their dependence upon the executive branch in the area of state finances. ‘ Up until that time the legislature had no professional staff people to give it an objective view of how much money would be available for the two-year budgets it must approve or to suggest how the funds would best be apportioned. All the legislators had to work with was the infor- mation produced by the State Budget Office, an arm of the governor's office which flexed according to the mes- sage delivered by the administration. For years, legislators had complained that adminis- tration revenue estimates were considerably on the con- servative side, which meant any number of spending programs were approved on a conditional basis—to be implemented only if the administration later deter- mined the funds were available. That left substantial funding discretion to the gover- nor, rather than the legislature. The fiscal office was established to provide the kind of independent view of finances that lawmakers had felt lacking, Although it officially was created in 1971, the office was not filled until 1973, just before legislative budget hearings began, prior to the start of the regular session that year. The man chosen to fill it was Dr. Frank Toohey, who left his job as assistant director of the University of Ala- bama's Graduate School of Business to become allied with the legislature. Toohey held the job until about a week ago, during which time he did things like project state revenue, as- sist with writing budgets, and determine how much spe- cific spending proposals would cost the state, such as giving salary increases to state employes or exempting hog callers from the state income tax, The modest controversy arose between the end of the last special session and the beginning of the regular ses- sion last Tuesday, In that special session the legislature passed a new law that re-created the fiscal office by statute (it origi- nally was born by resolution), and placed it under su- pervision of a new, joint legislative committee. Those who pushed for passage of the law in the Senate said they did so because it would expand the office by creating a larger staff and would give it a more per- manent status, a more secure existence. Although the new law abolished the original office, and thus Dr. Toohey's job, active proponents of the bill said there was ‘‘an understanding” with the Senate leadership that Toohey would be the new committee's choice to head the rearranged fiscal office. That apparently was a misunderstanding. When the new committee met Thursday, behind closed doors, reportedly the House members supported Toohey, while the Senate members, all top lieutenants of Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, demanded the group look else- where for a director. Now the talk is that James V. ‘Jake’’ Jordan, presently State Budget Officer, is the most likely candi- date for the new job of legislative fiscal office director. Exactly what has happened to Toohey, and to the un- derstanding with Beasley and his men, probably never will be known, The most often heard speculation as to why some want Toohey ousted is that he isn't political enough. That he works for whichever legislators ask his aid, That he won't bend the facts and figures for some politi- cal whim. That his information is objective and inde- pendent, Although that was the original intent of creating a leg- islative fiscal office, some minds and political fancies apparently have changed since 1971, May 11, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "N-Plant May Draw Foreign Funds By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Foreign sources could sup- ply as much as 60 per cent of the financing for the ura- nium enrichment plant pro- posed for Houston County. They also would take from this country 60 per cent of the plant’s output. The foreign investors would ‘‘take a condominium approach’’ to the deal, said R.E. Langley, deputy direc- tor of Uranium Enrichment Associates (UEA), the in- dustrial group hoping to bring both the enrichment facility and two more nucle-_ ar-powered electric gener-- ating units to southeast Ala- bama. By- condominium ap- proach, Langley meant that a foreign utility, industry or government wishing to pur- chase from UEA essentially would have to buy into the enterprise. The foreign purchaser, he said, would have to provide the same proportion of total financing for the plant as the Proportion of ultimate out- put it wished to purchase. For example, if a foreign government wished to pur- chase 10 per cent of UEA’s . output, it would have to sup- ply 10 per cent of the total. cost of building the facility. ‘‘We anticipate the portion of the output we have identi- fied for potential non-U.S. purchase is a reasonable fig- ure to work with,’’ said Langley, who had just re- turned from a three-week trip in Europe rounding up business. And, he said, that portion will be about 60 per cent. Langley, speaking in a telephone interview from UEA’s San Francisco head- quarters, stressed that doesn’t necessarily mean 60 per cent of this nation’s still. questionable uranium _ sup- ply will be exported. What UEA will do, he said, is supply a service—the en- richment of uranium for use in nuclear generators. Those who purchase that service will have to supply the uranium to be treated through the process of gaseous diffusion. In general, what that pro- cess does is take vaporized uranium and divide, or dif- fuse it, to remove molecules of uranium-238 and to con- centrate molecules of ura- nium-235 (U-235). It is U-235 that is fissio- nable, so the resulting en- riched uranium product has a_ sufficient concentration of U-235 to be used in nuclear power reactors. The process is not quite that simple, however, with some phases of the tech- . nology now in the hands of only the federal government here and few foreign nations. UEA says that untess the government shares its ex- pertise the private enrick- ment plant won't be built. That sharing scheme has raised some eyebrows in Washington in regard to the preponderance of foreign in- terests in UEA which would become privy to the oper- ations. Uranium must be enriched only to a level of 2-3 per cent of U-235 for use in nuclear- powered generating plants, but to a much greater pur- ity—more than 90 per cent—for the manufacture of — bombs. The gaseous diffusion pro-* p cess is used for both. American utilities also are expected to buy the enrich- ment service from UEA, if it does in fact get this project off the ground. Langley said about 16 U.S. utilities have expressed written interest in dealing with UEA. “We anticipate additional letters in the near future and on a continuing basis from other utilities,’ he added. The U.S. purchasers would not face the same financial obligation as foreign buyers in terms of supporting con- struction costs. Now, enriched uranium can be bought for nuclear federal enrichment facil- ities, which have reached ca- pacity and cannot meet growing demands of the nu- clear energy industry unless the government decides to expand its capabilities. An initial decision had been made not to expand, byt to promote the entry of pri- vate industry into the enrich- ment business. UEA is banking on that being the final federal deci- sion and on government will- ingness to substantially aid the fledgling private enter- prise enrichment industry through both technical knowledge and back-up sup- wer plants only at three der. \f"

        "ocr_text": "National Democrats Unknowingly Spark Alabama Reforms By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The National Democratic Party has prompted a re- form movement in Alabama that could strengthen one of the most basic rights of citizens in a democratic society—the right to freely and equally participate in the governing process. National Democrats were not particularly looking for a way to promote the welfare of Alabamians when they wrote the rules for the game of presidential politics in 1976. All they did was mandate certain procedures the state parties must follow to get their delegations seated at the national convention. While ‘those procedures were intended to open the par- ty to other than old line pols—and to close its machinery to less than borderline Democrats—they were not likely envisioned as the spark for a total overhaul of the elec- toral process. That, however, is what they ignited here. As Alabama party leaders glanced down the list of new convention rules, it became apparent that this state could not make the grade with its present election laws. Since the problem was statutory, the party was in somewhat of a quandary over how to meet the national mandate. The Democrats themselves could not make the necessary changes within party councils, but knew they must solicit action from the not always cooperative Alabama Legislature, The actions required would rewrite the elections laws to provide ballot space showing to what presidential hopeful a candidate for convention delegate is com- mitted. Although most delegate candidates here make it widely known who they support, or plan to support, at the nominating convention, the pairing on the ballot in print of the candidate with his or her presidential favor- ite would remove any doubts and fill any knowledge gaps in the voters minds. Also needed to meet the nationa. regulations is a means of assuring that only Democrats participate in the process of sending delegates to the convention. Now, anybody registered to vote in Alabama can help the Democrats decide who becomes delegates, as well as who the party nominates for state and local offices, by stepping into the voting booth primary day and pull- ing the lever. That includes Democrats, Republicans, Con- servatives, Prohibitionists, Whigs, members of the Na- tional Democratic Party of Alabama, and what one prominent Democrat has called ““mugwumps,’’ which apparently is a mixed breed. The best way to weed those others out of the Demo- crats’ decision-making processes, according to State Chairman Robert Vance, is through party registration. : “of the system, all of which serve as the backdrop The ballot change and registration provision both can be accomplished only by legislative fiat, Vance and his fellow Democrats could be in trouble come convention time, were it not for a loophole through which they ‘can travel to the nominating scene regard- less of what the legislature does or fails to do, a loophole provided by the national rules. That says a state's dele- gation will be seated if the party has displayed a good — faith effort to meet all the requirements: A good faith effort can come in all stripes, shades and fashions, but the vehicle Vance chose combines a push to win enactment of the two above changes with a com- plete. revamping of the laws that spell out how elections are run, who gets to participate, and how to keep the candidates clean. _~ Vance could have restricted the party's efforts to _ ‘mere compliance with the national game plan. Instead, he set up a “blue ribbon’ commission of par- ty stalwarts to dig into all facets of the electoral process, facets which in some cases were born of 19th Century ne and have not matured to meet 20th Century While the chairman has stressed at each meeting of the commission and in each pronouncement about it that the two specific changes must be recommended to the legislature, he also has urged just as much attention be paid to'other sections of the law books. Based on the diverse witnesses who called for election law alterations at a commission hearing late last week, there not only is vast room for improvement, but plenty of sentiment for it. The words spoken at that hearing, plus earlier com- ments by Vance, picture a veritable horror show of red tape, errors, malfunctions and deliberate perversions for the process of running what the nation's founders envis- toned as a more perfect union. While the days of outrageous requirements: for voters. to register are over, the commission was told that many Alabamians virtually remain disenfranchised because only three persons in each county have the authority to register them and they don’t do it often. While the law supposedly attempts to regulate the buying of candidates by at least forcing them to teil who donated what, the commission has heard those regu- lations can and are circumvented and sometimes are impossible to enforce. The commission has proved open to proposals from all quarters regarding all phases of the electoral pro- cess, and it has accepted with enthusiasm the charge to accomplish a monumental task in a minimal period of time. It is hard to imagine the national party not accepting this as a good faith effort to abide by its rules. Whether the effort is successful remains in the hands of the legislature, just as the lawmakers will deliver the final verdict on the broader scope of the commission's work. There are so many problem areas in the present electoral process which likely will prompt proposals from the commission, however, that odds favor at least a partial purification of Alabama's system of democra- cy.

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Seeks School Funds Shift Says Other Alternatives Taxes, End to Services By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace launched Tuesday night what many believe will be a futile battle to reallocate education monies for other state programs, telling law- makers in his ‘‘State of the State’’ address that the al- ternatives are new taxes or the end of some vital state services. Before a joint session of the Alabama House and Sen- ate, Wallace proposed re- moving from the Special Education Trust Fund (SETF) 12 per cent of the revenues to be generated in the next two years by the sales and use taxes. Aides said he will ask to spend that estimated $85 mil- lion in revenue on highways, mental health, Medicaid, corrections and a new ship- ping channel at Theodore. ‘‘We have a pocketful of money in this (education) fund, and a good education program,’’ Wallace said, ‘‘and no money in this pock- et.” The second ‘‘pocket’’ Wal- lace referred to was the Gen- eral Fund, which supports most state services other _than education, and contains taxes that haven't grown at the same rate as those that feed the education fund. ‘“*You can decide not to build another prison or to let Medicaid drift,’’ the gover- nor said to legislators, or fail to adequately finance cor- rections and mental health, and then face the possibility of the federal government taking over their adminis- tration. “If you have any alterna- tive plan, you come forward with it,\"’ Wallace said. In other portions of his speech, Wallace leaned heavily on a law and order theme, calling for reinstitu- tion of the deatu penalty, a beefed up state trooper force, and other changes in criminal laws that will be proposed by Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley. “As a result of all this ul- tra-liberal dogma . . . we find crime has increased to the point that at night in the cities people are prisoners in their own homes,’’ Wallace said to loud applause in the packed House chamber. He called for an end to ‘“*‘permissiveness in the courts’’ and the beginning of ‘*swift and sure punish- ment’ for offenders. In backing up his proposed reallocation of education funds, the governor con- tended that government can- not solve problems simply by “throwing gobs of money at them,\"’ and firmly threat- ened to veto any legislative effort to increase ta::es. ° “We must realize that the time has come to do with what we have and quit com-. ing to the working man and gouging him for more: , taxes,\" Wallace said. The governor made a sim- ilar attempt to raid educa- tion funds in 1971 to bolster mental health coffers. His fight in the legislative chambers then was unsuc- cessful, and education forces have promised a fiercer tooth and nail battle this time. And, there has surfaced little. if any, legis'ative sen- timent in support of Wal- lace’s plan, since it first be- gan grinding through the ru- mor mill months ago. Some lawmakers who do favor the idea say they have com- mitted themselves to oppose it. Such commitments likely were made to the Alabama Education Association, ‘which helped a large per- centage of the present law- makers win election and now possibly wields more power on Capitol Hill than any oth- er special interest group. In a press briefing prior to Wallace's 6:30 p.m. talk, fi- nance officials and aides to the governor said his pro- posed education budg- et—even with the diverted funds—would be increased over this year’s budget by 29 per cent in fiscal year 1975-76 and by 35 per cent the follow- ing year. That would include an $800 annual salary increase for . teachers and the addition of 2.000 new teachers to lower the pupil-teacher ratio, pro- vide more for special educa- tion and make possible a statewide public kindergar- ten program. May 28, Admitting they have seen little legislative favor for the plan. the officials said in the briefing that failure to adopt it would prompt a move to keep a $10 million surplus in the SETF,. retain a S40 mil- lion reserve fund to guard against a possible adverse shift in the economy. and a $40 million capital outlay Program in lieu of issuing bonds already authorized for that purpose. If the reallocation is suc- cessful, they said, the ad- ministration would push for only a $20 million reserve fund and the issuance of the: bonds. ‘ Either way. the adminis-j; tration would keep the $85; million beyond the educa-: tors’ grasp for general oper- ating purposes. Wallace proposed a total two-year education budget of $1.5 billion. compared to the current budget of about $1.1 billion. In his speech to the law- makers. the governor also announced he is releasing $12 million of money condi- tionally appropriated for education purposes in 1973. but not yet handed out. Edu- cation officials have been pleading for release of the money for weeks, claiming numerous local school sys- tems would end their year in the red without it. The governor also outlined the following proposals as part of the administration's 19-bill package to. be sub- mitted to the regular ses- sion: —Reduction of interest rates on small loans, as now set out in the Minicode. —State employe across the board salary increases of $500 the first year, and an- other $500 if the money is available in the second. —Essentially the same utility regulation package that failed in the last special session. ~ —Tightening of state regu- lation over insurance com- panies. and legislation to re- solve malpractice’ insurance problems. —A new state prison. 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Financial Squeeze Definitely Not News To State Legislators By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama legislators aren't terribly enamored of Gov. George C. Wallace's plan to resolve state spending woes by dipping into the education fund, but possible alterna- lives have been noticably missing irom their critiques . of the governor's program. The warnings began as early as 1973 that medicaid costs would suck massive amounts irom the general fund in the near future, the federal court first dabbled in what obviously was to become the more expensive ad- ministration of mental health services back in 1972, and broad hints of pending crises in the highway program and prison system have been whispered into legislators’ ears for several years, Inflation and recession have taken somewhat of an unexpected toll on state revenues, but the economy has not suffered near so many abrupt pains here as it has in other states. So the trend for state services—or requested serv- ices—exceeding the state’s financial ability to provide them should not have come as a shock in May, 1975. That George Wallace would attempt to raid the educa- tion fund as a solution also should not have been shock- ing. He did it in 1971, although the effort was an abysmal failure, and his comments since early this year have in- dicated another try could be in the offing. Many of those legislators who sat through budget hearings and watched the tally of money requests stead- ily mount far beyond the capacity to be met are the same ones who simply shook their heads when queried about an administration effort to divert the education money. And, once the governor did announce last week what had been rumored, there still arose no substitute plan of action. Some legislators, particularly those close to Wallace, have suggested the governor's proposal was made to prompt exactly that—a substitute road to travel toward adequate financing. That has been done by Wallace before, they said, the making of a politically unrealistic proposal in hopes of spurring some new thought patterns in legislative minds. The idea being, if they can't buy the adminis- tration’s program, they'll be forced to come up with one of their own, So far, most vague hopes in the area of alternatives seem pinned on changing the medicaid prog It does not sit well with legislators that the 10 per cent of the population which benefits from Medicaid should benefit by virtue of spending nearly one-third of the entire gen- eral fund. There are plans for a special House-Senate com- mittee to investigate how the program is run, where it can be cut back, how participants or their families can be made to bear part of the burden. Even if medicaid costs were cut in half, and it's diffi- cult to imagine that much fat in any state program, the resulting savings would not meet the needs Wallace says should be met with education money. That also would be drastically curtailing one vital service in favor of another: trading the care oi the poor sick for the education of Alabama children. While some would make a case for that, even educa- tors say they don't want to make medicaid the scape goat here, 48 Dr. Paul Hubbert, executive secretary of and chief spokesman for the Alabama Education Association, said late last week that some changes in medicaid may be a partial solution, but not the total answer. AKA will, he pledged, come up with other answers. There are few doubts that education factions will in- deed have a battle plan including alternatives to Wal- lace’s proposed funding diversion, but that is an unusual set of shoulders to bear the burden of shuifling state fi- nances, AEA, the universities and the State Education De- partment have been forced into the position of curing over all state economic ills in order to stop inroads into whatever progress has been made in the area of educ- lion. The educators, along with parents and other suppor- ters, worked long to cover their interests by generating sentiment for creation of a special state fund to finance eduction operations. Now, to save that fund, education must find ways to fi- nance other state operations, ‘The governor, who said he merely is trying to provide leadership to state government, has chosen a path he must have known could not be easily followed by many. That was apparent in 1971 and should be even more ob- vious today by the number of legislators who campaign- ed and were elected on education planks, The legislature, although taxed by demands to be- come expert on a wide variety of complex issues with no professional staff for aid and within the limits of part- time service, still has failed to address budget problems which have been creeping up on them for years. The problems have arrived. Legislators don't want Wallace's plan, but they don't have any others, And so the vacuum of responsibility for governing the affairs of state apparently may be filled by a group not elected by or responsible to the electorate. At least someone is trying to fill it. June 1, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "‘76 Politics Conference Top Issue (Related story, page 15) Se By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer NEW ORLEANS — The National Governors Conter- ence theme of improving state and local relations is tak- ing a back seat to 1976 presidential politics — and Gov. George C. Wallace's role in the sweepstakes. The Democratic governors are dividing on whether they should attempt to wield influence over their party's presidential nominee by entering primaries them- selves, with Minnesota Gov. Wendell Anderson the prime advocate of such. a course. The favorite son strategy has been advanced by some as a means of blocking primary votes for Wallace, who has said he would welcome any such challenges. Kxactly how the governors should make their voices heard appeared the main topic at a closed luncheon meeting of the Democratic Governors Conference held with National Party, Chairman Robert Strauss. Strauss, outgoing caucus president Anderson, and Kthode Island Gov. Philip Noel, the new president of the Democratic governors group, all agreed at a press con- ference after the luncheon that the governors must be- gin action immediately if they are to be a moving force at the 1976 nominating convention. Noel said he will schedule a meeting soon to work out a plan of action for the governors to both be heard in the nominating process and assure the Democrats do elect a president in 1976, . Anderson said his promotion of governors appearing on ‘primary ballots as favorite son candidate is “not a concerted effort to stop anybody. It's a concerted effort to get the governors involved.” Noel echoed the sentiment that no one is trying to steal the nomination from the Alabama governor, saying he doesn't believe the Democrats will attempt “to shut him out or drive him away. “IT welcome him as a member of this party,” Noel said, although he admitted strong disagreement with some of Wallace's views. Anderson was less supportive of Wallace personally, saying he could not back any candidate who failed to ledge support of the party’s ticket. Wallace has re- fused to make any such pledge, commenting here Sun- day that many Democrats won't accept him, so he won't make a blanket endorsement of the Democrats. Strauss said “it isn't helpful to party afiairs’ to have any Democrats casting doubts on their support of the party as a whole. The party chairman also discounted any anti-Wallace movement within Democratic ranks, claiming there is no “orchestrated movement’ although party officials as individuals both support and oppose Wallace. Strauss also said he sees nothing to back up Wallace's claims that the party hierarchy is against him. “Maybe it’s just good politics” for Wallace to say the party leaders are trying to oust him from a top spot on the 1976 ticket, Strauss said. At a later press conference, Mississippi Gov. William Waller repeated his statements of last winter that he does not believe Gov. Wallace can withstand the physic- al rigors of campaigning. “T think he’d carry my state if he were physically fit,” Waller said. ‘He's probably the best vote-getter that’s been mentioned.” Strauss had said earlier in the day that he has no criti- cism for Wallace's efforts to get presidential primaries established in other states. “IT don't see anything wrong with various candidates attempting to influence legislation in the states to ben- efit their candidates,’’ he said. Also on Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp confirmed that he is taking the first step toward his own candidacy for the Democratic nomination by filing nec- essary papers for this campaign committee. Shapp said his effort is ‘‘not at all’ a stop Wallace movement, but his campaign in some major north- eastern states is considered certain to draw from the Wallace momentum. While the furor over Wallace and his candidacy is ily- ing throughout convention meeting rooms, the governor himself is playing an exceptionally low key role. He had not scheduled a meeting with the news media by Monday night, although aides said that it is being considered. One meeting Wallace did have is a private tete-a-tete with New Hampshire’s Republican Gov. Meldrin Thompson, who solidly backs former California Gov. Ronald Reagan as a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 1976. The two met for less than an hour, and while Wallace said they did discuss presidential politics, he added the talk turned up ‘‘nothing all that significant.” Neither Wallace nor his aides would detail the sub- stance of the conversation, which only further fueled speculation that Wallace and Reagan could pair on an independent ticket should: they be rejected by their re- spective parties. , Thompson has said he will run in the Republican primary in New Hampshire against President Gerald Ford, as a standard-bearer for Reagan. Should Reagan - on primary, Thompson has indicated he would rop out. June 10, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Takes Aim at Critics in News Media By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer NEW ORLEANS — Gov. George C. Wallace, the cen- ter of most political attention at the National Governors Conference here, took a few potshots at his national media critics during a local civic club speech Tuesday. Wallace singled out The New York Times and Wash- ington Post. targets of past verbal blows leveled by the governor, as liberal voices tuat don't speak the same language as the ‘‘great, neg- lected middle class’’ he. has every mayor in the country, whether black or white, runs on law and order.” Wallace expressed plea- sure at seeing the end of what he termed sectionalism in national politics, which he said prevented a man from Louisiana or Georgia or Ala- bama from running for high office.

Wallace also criticized the inedia and Democratic Par- ty officials for attempting to dissolve presidential prefer- ence primaries in some stutes. indicating he believes the efforts revolve around his success in the primaries.

        "ocr_text": "q€csovernor’s Mieeting €Cliloses on Discord By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer NEW ORLEANS—The National Governors Confer- ence closed here Wednesday on a discordant note, with the governors clashing on energy policy, environmen- tal controls and a means of heading off future reces- sions. The energy question, which had dominated three days of official business at the 67th annual meeting, was resolved with adoption of a mild policy statement gener- ally endorsing conservation and a moderate easing of federal regulation over natu- ral gas prices. It was in marked contrast to the policy proposed by Louisiana Gov. Edwin Ed- wards and supported by little more than a third of the governors, which called on the government to totally end fuel price controls and environmental regulations relating to the use of coal. Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace was one of the mi- nority group backing Ed- wards, although Wallace merely voted for the propos- al without speaking to it. Another environmental statement, proposed by the conference's Committee on Natural Resources and En- vironmental Management, would have urged the states to Oregon's controversial ‘bottle bill,’’ which prohibits the use of throw-away bever- age bottles and of pop-top cans. Gov. Wallace voted with the majority in killing the policy statement. Also Wednesday, a committee of the Alabama House in Mont- gomery voted down a bill patterned after the Oregon legislation. The governors divided al- most evenly on another is- sue, this time refusing to en- dorse a bill now pending in Congress that would funnel money to the states for jobs programs when the unem- ployment rate reached a cer- tain level. That was characterized by Govs. William Milliken of Michigan and Philip Noel of Rhode Island as a means of heading off recession as the first signs appear. But, Maine Gov. James Longley protested the trig- gering mechanism—the unemployment rate—is too unreliable as an indicator of the economy. He succeeded in tabling the policy, by a 19-17 vote. It was the energy policy which sparked the most heated debate of the final business session, with Gov. Edwards warning that con- tinued federal refusal to end to adopt legislation similar | price and environmental controls and to open all the Outer Continental Shelf to off Shore oil drilling will prevent the nation from ever becom- ing energy self-sufficient. Vermont Gov. Thomas P. Salmon, chairman of the committee which authored the milder policy statement, opposed Edwards’ proposed alteration. He said 12 gover- nors worked on the lengthy document ovef the past year, and contended any changes woudl violate the in- tegrity of the tntire report. “There are a lot of people who don't believe the price of natural gas ‘is artificially low,’ Salmon said. ‘“‘It’s the long-suffering consumer who’s going to pick up the tab.”’ Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel supported Salmon’'s stand, contending one rea- son neither Congress nor the administration nor the gov- ernors can develop a nation- al energy policy is that ‘‘no one knows who to believe’ about the over-all energy supply. ‘‘Somewhere, somebody has got to tell the truth,\"’ Mandel said. Govs. Meldrim Thomsona of. New Hampshire and Dolph Briscoe of Texas both sided with Edwards, -with Briscoe saying the only way to solve the energy problem is ‘‘to get the government out of the picture’’ and let free enter- prise take over. Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp said deregulation of June 12, 1975 gas and oil would result in coal costs also rising, and all would be reflected in ‘con- sumers’ utility bills through the automatic fuel cost pass on allowed in magt states. Shapp contepdéed total deregulation would let prices soar so high that a consumer revolt would re- sult in demands for nation- alization of all energy in- dustries. Edwards, however, adopted a similar theme, ar- guing that higher prices must come sometime in or- der to increase domestic pro- duction. If it doesn't happen through rational reasoning, he said, it will come from ‘“‘angry mobs in the streets’’ who are unable to light their homes or run their cars. Although a majority of governors did support a statement against congres- sional and administration ef- forts to force conservation by raising fuel prices, it was not the two-thirds majority needed to adopt a resolution not submitted in advance of the convention. That sparked angry com- ments from Shapp, who charged the Republican bloc vote—which he said was prompted by administration lobbying—had stymied the majority's will. The governors did manage one unanimous vote before adjourning when they ac- cepted GOP Gov. Robert Ray of Iowa as the confer- ence chairman for next year. \f"

Mathews is to replace present HEW Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who has indicated his resignation is imminent, due to con- troversy over his position. The secretary had not taken any formal action by Thurs- day night. Sources in Washington confirmed that President Ford offered the 38-year-old university president the HEW job Wednesday night, following a meeting in Wa- shington last Friday. Mathews declined comment Thursday. Sources also Said U.S. Rep. Albert H.

Official appointment ' Advertiser refused to con- will follow senate con- firmation. Potential congressional opposition to Mathews ap- peared minimal. Sources close to Mathews at the Tuscaloosa campus said he has agreed to accept the job, that he would leave Alabama within a matter of weeks if the nomination is confirmed, and that he will ask the university's board of trustees for a 14-month leave of absence. That would place Mathews back at the university for the 1977 school year. GOP Congressman Bill Dickinson of Alabama said Thursday the White House had contacted him about the nomination earlier, and that he ‘very highly recommend- ed’’ Mathews for the post. “Tt will be a credit to the state and to Dr. Mathews,” - firm or deny that Mathews - plans to leave the er saving they had not been of cially informed of the pend- ing move. “I think it would be quite an honor,” said Trustee Sam Earl Hobbs of Selma. ‘The presumption~is that we would give it serious con- sideration,’’ Hobbs said of the expected request for a leave of absence, ‘‘probably favorable consideration.\"’ Hobbs said the potential nomination ‘‘has been ru- mored for some time.”’ The trustees will hold a regularly-scheduled meet- ing at the Birmingham campus on Wednesday, when the request for a leave likely will be formally con- sidered. Officials at the university said that if the leave of ab- sence was approved as an- ticipated, Dr. Richard Thig- pen, executive assistant to Dr. Mathews, would assume the schools reins as interim president. Dr. Thigpen is highly re- garded in both academic and ~ administrative circles. June 13, 1975 Nixon Administration and a member of the university board, is out of the country vacationing and could not be reached for comment. For the last six years Mathews has been president of the Tuscaloosa campus, where he received both his A.B. and M.A. degrees. He received a Ph.D. in history of American education from Columbia University in 1965. A native of Grove Hill, Mathews was selected one of the Ten Oustanding Young Men in America by the U.S. Jaycees, who said he is a man ‘‘whose exceptional achievements not only dis- tinguish him as one of the youngest, but also one of the leading chancellors of a ma- jor university in the United States.” ‘The University of Ala- bama has become a model for the Deep South due in no small part to the efforts of David Mathews,’’ the Jay- cees said. ‘‘He has earned re- spect by his cool-headed and rational approach to modern campus life.”’ \f"

        "ocr_text": "Governors Failed — To Solve Problem Of George Wallace By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The nation's governors faced an official roster of tough problems ranging from energy to the economy at their annual conference last week. What seemed most distressing to them, however, was the question of what to do about George Corley Wallace next year. They didn't resolve any of their problems. The reason served up for public consumption as to why the chief execs are so vitally concerned with 1976 politics is that the governors are closer to the people than any other high elected officials, so should speak with a stronger voice than the folks cavorting around Washington. They are the doctors forced to feel the pulse of the electorate every day, the argument goes, so have a bet- ter reading of what ails the patient and how to provide a cure. The governors—those of Democratic stripe, which most of them are—remain miffed over their low-key role in the 1972 nominating process, and express deter- mination to be in the forefront in 1976. That, remember, is to assure their people are adequately represented on the convention floor. Some have forwarded rather unusual ways to bring the party back to the people, or perhaps to collectively drop the people into the midst of the party is a better de- scription of the stated effort. What may be the most unusual proposal is that one by Minriesota Gov. Wendell Anderson, who wants the gov- . ernors to run in presidential primaries or in state con- ventions as candidates themselves. That is the favorite son strategy, which envisions the governors walking away with their home state dele- gates against the intrusion of real candidates—such as George Wallace—and trading off their votes at the con- vention. Get enough governors to do that, and the gentlemen indeed could have a powerful voice in calling the name of the ultimate nominee. . What seems modestly contradictory in that plan is that the people would be urged to give up their direct votes for the candidate of their personal choice. They would instead be handing a proxy to the gover- nors, which appears to remove the people one step fur- ther away from the nominating process, rather than smacking them into the middle of it. Anderson and others deny the idea was developed to keep Wallace out of the convention, but was formed to get them into it. Even if it were a dart aimed at puncturing and drain- ing Wallace's strength, it is questionable whether that would be the result. Alabama's governor confidently says he welcomes that kind of opposition and has invited such tests in all the states, including s:labama. Other plans that conceivably could be oriented to stopping Wallace have similar drawbacks, either in their potential for success or ultimate effect on the democratic process. . For example, Florida Gov. Reuben Askew suggested the possibility of a loyalty oath, through which candi- dates would be required to pledge their support in ad- vance to whomever the Democrats wind up nominating. That is something Wallace has refused to do, warning that should the party pull a replay of 1972, not only would he renege on the ticket, but so would the multitudes. The problem there is that others have similarly ran- ted against a ticket carrying the name of Wallace, oth- ers including some candidates. When all the plans and plots and strategies are laid to rest though, the governors and other party pols come up with a line that cannot be either refuted or accepted as gospel. That is that George Wallace is physically unfit to stand the strain of the presidency. While Wallace could have half a dozen of the most out- standing M.D,’s attest to his present physical stamina, they cannot guarantee that a man in the governor's con- dition will remain capable of even getting out of bed. So, it is a standoff. They say he can’t, he says he can. Unless the governors and others believing Wallace is without doubt the wrong candidate for the Democrats come up with something better than those stop-Wallace plahs advanced so far, they're stuck with the fate of his health as the answer to the Wallace question. +++ Why David Mathews? Briefly put, political expendiency for President Ger- ald Ford is one possible reason. The position of secretary of Health, Education and Welfare may be one of the most difficult jobs to finesse in the federal scheme of government. especially for a Republican President with a Democratic congress. The president of the University of Alabama's Tusca- loosa campus has no reputation as a political animal, but as an administrator who has worked toward some moderate progressive changes at a Deep South school. He has not been a mover and shaker who might be re- pugnant to those Republicans questioning President Ford's liberal bent in actions such as choosing Nelson Rockefeller as his number two. But Mathews has dis- played efforts toward bringing more women and blacks to his stomping grounds and toward helping initiate con- cepts like-the New College for non-traditional students, which should stand him in good stead with more activist congressional Democrats.

        "ocr_text": "Tempers Flare as Senate Remains Filibuster-Tied By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Senate re- mained deadlocked in fili- buster again Thursday over the hours and days it should conduct business, but tem- pers waxed to an unusual pitch as the true issue of con- flict emerged. A chaotic period of recess for private compromise talks and vivid pleas for con- structive action was sand- wiched between the filibus- ter led by Russellville Sen. Joe Fine, which stayed work on the regular calendar for the second legislative day. Fine’s followers returned to the microphone early in the day when it became apparent the group led by Rainsville Sen. John Baker had regained a majority of votes to eliminate rules man- dating the Senate conduct business only on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Those wishing to open up the business hours say the present restrictions allow a small minority—even one senator—to sustain a filibus- ter and thwart majority sen- timent. The limited hours give talkative senators ample opportunity for rest between stretches on the floor, thus reduce incentive for compromise since they can hold off action for an un- limited time. Those in the majority with Baker—22 lined up on one telling vote—say the issue boils down to the power wielded by Fine. Not only can he use the re- strictive hours to block ac- tion by filibustering, they say, but he also has control of the Senate Rules Com- mittee. That committee acts on all resolutions, unless sen- ators unanimously agree to bypass the committee, and it will have an even more im- portant role later in writing special order calendars which list the bills up for ac- tion each day. The only reasons Fine ives for insistence on limit- ing Senate hours are that he wants to be able to schedule his day and that 5 p.m. “is late. enough for anybody to work.\" — After the filibustering be- gan Thursday, a visibly ang- ered Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley exercised the power of his gavel in-ordering a recess and demanding that Fine and Baker forces work out a compromise. If no compromise is reached, he said, ‘‘the chair is not going to entertain any motion but adjourning. You can go home and not come back to Montgomery.” Beasley told reporters he believes the stalemate is due to a personality clash be- tween Fine and Baker. ‘They're trying to see who can run over the other one,”’ Beasley said. Both principals denied any personal conflict is involved, as did members of their re- spective camps. At the close of the recess Cullman Sen. Finis St. John proposed a compromise in which Senate hours would be restricted to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. until the 26th leg- islative day. while the Tues- day-Thursday restriction would be lifted immediately. Although Fine said he was willing to compromise, he refused to give the unani- mous consent needed for im- mediate consideration, so the motion was sent to the Rules Committee. Opelika Yen, C.C. *'Bo™ Torbert then proposed a ‘“s@énse of the’ Senate’’ mo- tion, saying the upper cham- ber wants to vote on its work- _ing days and hours. The vote was. 22 to 8 in fa- vor of addressing the ques- - tion, but a ‘sense of the Sen- ~Advertiser Photo by Jerry Smt! Sens.

Even though a large ma- jority indicated a wish to vote on the question, that was two short of the number needed to invoke cloture June 20, 1975 which is the parliamentary means of stopping a filibus- ter. ss In debate prior to that mo- tion. Jusper Sen. Robert Wil- son said he spoke for the ma- jority in urging an end to the the restrictions on meeting days and hours. Wilson also took u jab at Beasley's ear- lier performance. ‘‘In the spirit of com- promise I think we ought to resolve this within the framework of the rules of the Senate,\"’ Wilson said. ‘'I don't think the chair ought to resolve it.” At one point Fine indicated the only ‘means of stopping his filibuster is through clo- ture, but threatened to work against the legislation of any senator who votes for clo- ture. Most of those who refuse to vote for cloture do so out of fear the procedure will be used against them in the fu- ture, when they are involved in a filibuster. After the “sense of the Sen- ate’’ vote was taken, Fine's allies resumed the filibuster. and the Senate later ad- journed on voice vote at about 4:30 p.m. The body re- convenes Tuesday at 10 a.m. This is how the Alabama Senate voted Thursday on a ‘*sense of the Senate’’ motion asking whether they wanted to stop a filibuster and take up the question of what hours and days Senate business is conducted: Yes, 22—Adams, Baker.

        "ocr_text": "By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer This year is the 100th anniversary of the most basic document of state government, but it isn’t necessarily a cause to celebrate. In fact, the hopes of some are that the 100th birthday of the Alabama Constitution will be its last. ‘ Although the present constitution actually was adopted in 1901—making its official age 74—it was adopted then with only minor changes from its 1875 pre- decessor that was written to guide a government and a people still trying to gear back up from the devastation of war. Since that has been accomplished, a cadre of legisla- tors is hoping to totally overhaul the constitution this summer, pulling it out of the 19th Century and into the social and governmental philosophies of the 20th. As early as 1915 this same constitution was felt out- moded by then Gov. Emmet O'Neal, who told his legis- lature it must carry out constitutional reforms ‘‘neces- sary to meet modern conditions and to secure greater economy and efficiency in the administration of every department of the state government.” It didn’t happen then, and it hasn't happened since. Alabama government still wears the harness of the second longest constitution in the nation, one carrying » more than 95,000 words and more than 300 amendments. The Alabama Constitutional Commission first pro- posed a thoroughly revised document to the 1973 legisla- ture, and, to back up its case for reform, made the fol- lowing comments in its submission. Less than half the amendments were added between 1901 and 1960, with the remainder being approved in the last 15 years. The commission also noted in its 1973 report that 17 amendment elections had been held since 1960, with costs of the last two exceeding $400,000. Figures aren't yet available for the cost of the most recent referendum earlier this month. And, many of the those amendments are totally local in nature, effecting things like a city tax increase or a county switch from a fee system to salaried officials. Less than a third of the amendments have statewide ap- plication. The new product would eliminate the need for so many amendments, mainly by giving more power to lo- _ cal governments and by transforming the constitution ’ into a basic, broad outline of government structure, Although the commission submitted its entire reform package in 1973, it only pushed for action on one part—the judicial article. Legislators supporting the revisions and the commis- sioners generally felt the most difficulty would be en- As State Constitution Observes Centennial countered over that article, which mandates sweeping changes in the judicial system. A joint legislative committee held a public hearing last week on six of the remaining 13 articles, all of which have been introduced in bill form in the current regular session. Although suprisingly few appeared to comment on the proposed changes, there were indications that firm battle lines are being drawn. Huntsville Sen. Bill King, chairman of the joint com- mittee, said he believes the strongest opposition will be lodged against provisions relating to home rule, to alte- rations in the executive branch and to some changes in legislative functioning. Lawmakers who like to hold close reins over their to- cal governments could work against the effort to make the cities and counties less dependent on the legislature for performing some of the most basic functions of a governing unit. More serious protests are expected and already have begun issuing from the Alabama League of Municipal- ities, which has taken a stand against some aspects of the county home rule section. The League mainly wants to make sure the counties don't get authority to start tampering with affairs inside city boundary lines, espe- cially affairs such as taxation. A clamor also has arisen over the proposal to remove the constitutional status of some elected officials—such as the state auditor, treasurer and secretary of state, and the county sheriffs. Removal of that status means the offices ultimately could be made appointive ones by the legislature, rather than elected. In the legislative area, controversy is not unlikely over a provision establishing a new commission to rec- ommend legislative salaries. The recommendations would take effect if the legislature failed to alter them. That was a major bone of contention in the 1972 annual session referendum, and when the question was put to the voters successfully last month, it didn't carry the salary commission. Other changes, such as the authority to grant cost of living salary increases to various state officials in their current term of office and a lifting of the prohibition against suing the state, also could stir killing debate, es- pecially in the Alabama Senate. There were, however, similar types of opposition in 1973, which nearly resulted in the death of the judicial article. But that was compromised into existence and may be further whittled at to satisfy the lingering hes- itancy of some lawmakers about implementing it. It appears that same spirit of compromise may be needed in the 1975 session if the rest of the antique con: stitution is to make way for a new model. June 22, 1975 \f"

She said he is expected back sometime this week- end. When Hammond ran against two-term PSC Presi- dent Eugene ‘‘Bull’’ Conner of Birmingham in 1972, Bax- ley launched an attack on issued about 10 a.m. by the Montgomery County Sher- iff's Department charging the pair with inciting to com- mit a felony—’’the felony being the bribery of Kenneth Hammond.’’ Baxley refused to detail the alleged scheme or to comment whether he be- lieves Hammond actually received any cash, saying only that the case involves an attempt by Price and Hammond to extort $10,000 from John and Rex Moore, the father and son operators of Tops Vending Co., 1936 Cleveland Ave. The money, he said, would have allowed the Moores to place vending machines in a South Central Bell ware- last year granting the state’s largest telephone company a $29 million rate increase, an increase which Price char- acterized at the time as total- ly inadequate to meet the company’s needs. It had re- quested a $60 million in- crease then. As an assistant vice presi- dent of South Central Bell’s Alabama operations, Price has been a primary spokes- man for the company and a main liaison between its Bir- mingham headquarters and the regulatory commission. He is frequently seen at the PSC offices here, as well as around the State Legislature when utility-related bills are being considered. Baxley, who aided Ham- Connor as ‘‘a tool of the utili- ties’’ and virtually endorsed Hammond, who won the race by nearly a 3-1 margi Hammond’s probing gues- tions during rate hearings and often deragotory com- ments about utility oper- ations have built him a repu- tation as an anti-utility com- missioner.

        "ocr_text": "Capitol to Feel ~ Heavy Infighting After Holiday Lull By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer After a lull in the battle between the administration and the education lobby, hand-to-hand combat should erupt again this week. Unless the governor's forces re- vise their strategy or mount a pressure campaign to weaken the enemy, the administration may appear headed down a road of defeat. The battle ground will be the House Ways and Means Committee meeting, and the prize both opponents are seeking is approval of their respective budget propos- als. Since at least a week before the July 4th legislative re- cess, administration leaders have held off action on the budget, freely admitting a committee vole would not add up in their favor. The plan to divert some $40 million from the education fund to other spending purposes was not well received from the moment it was enunciated, nor has it picked up support as the days have rolled along. After the initial unfavorable reaction from lawmak- ers, Gov. George Wallace did attempt some indirect pressure tactics, first by trying to drum up media sup- . port for his plan through meetings with news execu- tives, then by initiating regional sessions where his staff urged long time political supporters to lobby their local lawmakers on his behalf. Neither strategy worked. Then there was what has been described as a no holds barred confrontation between the governor and com- mittee members, where Wallace accused the legisla- ture of turning the state steering wheel over to the Ala- bama Education Association and its leader, Dr. Paul Hubbert. That didn't win administration friends either. During the meeting with Ways and Means members the basics of a new, one-year budget were outlined, a budget that doesn’t directly reallocate education mon- ey, but stipulates the $40 million will be held in reserve for use in other, non-education departments and pro- grams only if it is needed. Administration sources also have freely admitted about $37 million of that would in fact be needed to fund the allocations set out in the proposed general fund budget. There have been a few comments from department chiefs, such as Mental Health Commissioner Taylor Hardin, complaining that the AEA has no business pro- posing a general fund budget and ought to keep out of non-education affairs. Highway Director Ray Bass has asked to meet indi- vidually with legislators to explain his budgetary needs, and Dr. Robert Holzworth with Medicaid has mailed lawmakers a dire prediction of his program's future without a massive infusion of funds. And, a small prison riot has demonstrated the needs of corrections officials. The big attack from these four agencies—the ones Wallace says need the education money—should be launched at Wednesday's Ways and Means Committee meeting. Unless the administration has kept it a very well- guarded secret, there will be no further compromise proposal or any concerted campaign to switch com- mittee votes before that time. One advisor close to Wallace said the department heads will be ‘putting out some horror tales” of what will happen if the legislature adopts the AEA budget. and that hopefully this will convince lawmakers of some “very unpleasant fiscal facts.\" If that does not work, several sources have indicated, Wallace may take his case directly to the public through speaking appearances across the state. pinning his. per- sonal reputation on the effort to pressure a change in legislative sentiment. + So far the AEA and other education interests have kept the upper hand in the battle of the budget. They _ beat Wallace in 1971 when the governor attempted a similar raid on education monies, and say they remain confident of the legislature's and the public's continued committment to education. Education leaders say they have no desire to. “meddle” in the financial affairs of other state depart- ments. but have helped lawmakers develop alterna- tives to the administration plan to preserve the gains made in the past and to prevent deterioration of public education they believe certain to come if funding is slowly siphoned away. That slow siphoning, they pre- dict. will become an outflowing gush if allowed to begin. Those who met with administration budget officials before the initial ‘‘compromise’ was announced said they detailed the lack of legislative support and vir- tually pleaded for the Wallace team to propose an al- ternative general fund budget—one without diversion. The administration refused, so AEA wrote its own budget proposal. The legislative committment in which the AEA has expressed confidence has been amply demonstrated. with administration pressure not only failing to win con- verts, but reportedly failing to keep some original sup- porters. The AEA’s confidence in the public’s sentiment, how- ever, may be put to the test in coming weeks if Gov. Wal: lace does stump the state in an all-out campaign to beat the teachers and win passage of his budget program. July 13, 1975 \f"

Wallace said Friday corrections offi- cials have issued notice they may accept no new prisoners without more state financ- ing, and the highway direc- tor has begun preparations to lay off 3,200 workers should the Alabama Education As- sociation budget win legisla- tive approval. . “We're not bluffing. We're not fooling,’’ Wallace told re- porters gathered for an in- formal press conference in his Governor's Mansion of- fice, referring to predictions of drastic: state service cut- backs under provisions of the AEA budget. The House Ways and Means Committee already has turned down the admin- istration budget in favor of the AEA ledger, and legisla- tive sentiment in general has been against Wallace’s plan to divert $40 million of educa- tion money for funding other State departments. The AEA budget calls for- no diversion, but reduces Wallace's proposed depart- ment budgets by nearly that amount. ‘They're irtviting and put- ting themselves wide open for federal court in- tervention,’’ Wallace said, citing threats of such action should the mental health and corrections departments not be adequately funded by the lawmakers. Those departments are * among the hargest hit by the AEA budget, which is spon- sored by Jasper Rep. Alvis Narramore. Wallace said Highway Di- rector Ray Bass has sched- uled a meeting with person- nel officials to work out the mechanics of laying off the 3,200 employes he has said cannot be paid under terms . of the AEA budget. That budget gives the department some $19 million less than Wallace's. ‘Even my budget would call for laying off 40 or 50 em- ployes,\"’ Wallace said, ‘‘but we felt we could do that by at- trition.”* The governor also ‘said Corrections Commissioner L.B. Sullivan. is notifying lo- cal sheriffs that state prisons soon may be unable to accept any more prisoners, due to potential court action against the system. Sullivan is asking the sheriffs to urge their lawmakers to provide adequate prison funding and turn down the AEA budget. Wallace expressed cautious optimism that the minds of some legislators are being switched to his po- sition, saying the adminis- tration is ‘‘still going to work to get our budget through.” “It's beginning to sink in to the legislators that we'll have proration, we'll have federal court intervention, and we'll have a dismantling. of the highway depart- ment,” he said. Under the AEA budget Wallace said there exists ‘‘a staunch good chance of pro- ration,\"' which occurs when funds are insufficient to meet the budgets. If that happens, each department is cut back by the over all per- centage of money lacking. In other matters, Wallace said he is ‘‘very sorry’ he won't be attending the In- ternational Longshoreman's Association convention in Miami, a speaking engage- ment cancelled after black members of the union pro- tested his appearance and threatened a boycott. Press Secretary Billy Joe Camp said the invitation to speak was not specifically withdrawn, but left vague the details of the cancella- tion. “That's happend before,\" Wallace said of the incident. Ine governor would make little comment on the House action this week refusing to - accept his executive amend- ment to the bill giving adult | rights to 19 year olds. The amendment would have pro- hibited the sale of liquor to those under 21, The House turned down ~ the amendment, then over- rode the resulting guberna- torial veto left on the bill. July 19, 1975 The Senate must vote on the veto this week, but Wal- lace would not urge action in either direction. ‘‘Under those circum- Stances,’’ he said, ‘‘they’ll just have to take what action they see fit.” Commenting on other leg- islation he wants passed, Wallace listed the death pen- alty bill, a measure requir- ing special architectural ac- commodations for the handi- capped. in new buildings, a lowering of interest rates on small loans, improvements -in workmen's and unemploy- ment compensation, and two utility bills. Those two, part of the package defeated in an ear- lier special session, would provide for appeals of Public Service Commission deci- sions directly to the Ala- bama Supreme Court, by- passing the circuit court, and would end the automatic fuel cost pass on.

When Tops Vending won a contract with the state em- ployes association several years ago, some charged — unofficially — that Gerald Wallace used his influence to secure the contract. He denied any involvement. The employes since can- celled the contract, when an association of the blind pointed out a state law giving first preference on vending contracts to the blind. \f"

        "ocr_text": "AEA Gets Backlash Which Other Groups Manage to Escape By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Just like any other change, a shift in the political pow- er structure traumatizes those wallowing in the status quo, bringing dire predictions that the world never will be quite the same good old place it was, Technological progress, the later waves of immi- grants, a Catholic in the White House, a woman string- ing telephone wires—all are the kinds of changes that brought cries of protest from those who simply didn’t want change or who felt their lives or livliehood threat- ened by the new. It isn’t quite as clear-cut a case, but the all too obvious rise to political prominence of the Alabama Education Association during the current legislative session has Sent shudders running through Goat Hill. That: the teachers—more specifically their leader, AEA Executive Secretary Paul Hubbert—should have the arrogance to write and introduce their own state budgets has brought disbelief in some quarters, That the AEA was politically astute enough to plough its dollars into legislative election campaigns of a ma- jority of the present lawmakers, to extract from those candidates committments to support the AEA legisla- tive program, and to cover its tracks in some cases by donating to more than one candidate in a race with ques- tionable outcome has elicited murmurs of unsavory pol- itics. That the AEA should now act to collect on those notes issued during the campaign season has prompted charges of strong-arm tactics. That the AEA should supposedly ignore the crying needs of other state departments in moving to stop a raid on education funds—supposedly to insure the pock- ets of teachers will be fully lined with state reve- nues—has earned it the reputation of a grasping, mer- cenary band, Consider though, just how different are AEA’s actions from those that have been practiced on The Hill for years on end by other special interest groups working to benefit their members,: sometimes at what could be con- sidered the expense of the general public. Look a bit more closely at those statements and the Names of innumerable donors will match those listed on the executive rosters of utilities, banks, mining com- panies, textile firms and other business and industries which frequently have a stake in what grinds through the legislative mill. This virtual buying of votes is not unique to the AEA, but the teachers are depicted as villains for participat- ing in an age-old game. And, the ABA isn’t the only group proposing legisla- tion, Lobbyists of all stripes can be seen in any given legis- lative session wandering the rotunda and the chambers with bills in hand, looking for sponsors and then seeking as many signatures as possible to lend their legislation credibility. The medical association has a bill pending now to take malpractice cases out of the courts—a measure that would affect not only doctors but the judicial system and _ untold numbers of average citizens hoping to have a jury of 12 peers determine whether their complaints against physicians are valid. ; . Bankers and small loan companies have bills that would raise interest rates—measures that not only would aid their businesses but also have a most direct affect on the general public. The protest against the educators has even reached the unprecedented point that a resolution has been in- troduced which would forbid them from voting on the budgets, as a conflict of interest. Perhaps those votes would represent a personal con- flict. The Alabama Ethics Commission has indicated they would, But, the Ethics Commission just as strongly indicated that union members should refram from pulling the lever on the union shop bill, that those lawmakers with certain financial interests in banks should not cast a vote on some interest rate legislation and that anyone else with a possible financial interest in a bill simply should not vote. There has been no groundswell of sentiment in the House or Senate to police the conduct of other legisla~ tors, no similar resolutions exhorting adherence to eth- ical principles, no move to limit the voting rights of union rhen or bankers or anyone else. The merits of the AEA budget are not at issue here. It may be the worst-written, most impracticle ledger in the history of the state, although that is doubtful, The basic premise of the AEA is that education money should not be used for non-education services, and the majority of legislators apparently agree. If they do not, the committments to AEA are not iron-clad contracts from which legislators are incapable of extricating themselves, for the good of the people of Alabama, But to fault the teachers for coming of age in the politi- cal process, for causing a shift in the power structure, appears to side-step the dollars and cents issue in favor of smear tactics that seldom, if ever, are used against the traditional power brokers who have long helped steer the course of state government, July 20, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Senate Overrides Wallace’s Veto; 19 Year Olds Gain Adult Status By MARCIA KUNSTEL — Advertiser Staff Writer ' The Alabama Senate eas- ily overrode Gov. George C. Wallace’s veto of a bill ex- tending full adult rights to youths aged 19 and 20, writ- ing the measure into law im- mediately Tuesday after- noon. The 23-10 vote came after about 45 minutes of debate: centering not only on the con-. troversial liquor issue, but | on Wallace's political mo- tives in attempting to alter the bill. Wallace had Proposed an executive amendment retaining the right to purchase Haupe only for those aged 21 or older, but when the House of Representa- tives turned down that change last week it left the bill with a governor's veto. The House overrode the veto and returned the bill to the Senate for action. Russellville Sen. Joe Fine charged that Wallace knew the legislature would over- come his veto, but acted any- way ‘‘to make a political is- sue of it and demagogue it.”’ Fine said his vote to sus- tain the veto ‘‘may be hypo- critical’’ personally, but is based on the sentiments of his constituents, who ‘‘would have liked to have had some help from the governor’s of- fice when this bill was in committee and when it was debated here.”’ Wallace made no moves to win passage or defeat of the bill as it went through the legislative process; many of his floor leaders supported ‘ it, and the governor earlier told sponsors and others that he, too, favored the mea- sure. ‘Maybe we ought to have a secret agent infiltrate the governor’s office to find out what they want down there,”’ Fine said, adding that Wal- lace has paid more attention _.to the legislatures in Loui- : siana and Tennessee than in Alabama. That was a reference to Wallace’s efforts to defeat bills in other states that would abolish presidential preference primaries. On the merits of the bill it- self, Sens. Robert Ellis of Adamsville and Robert Wil- son of Jasper both urged their colleagues to sustain the veto and spare Alabama youths from their own in- experience. ‘Young people’s wants are going to be greater than their means,’’ Ellis said. “And they'll be able to get the money. If they bankrupt it will be on their record for years.” The law not only lets those over 19 purchase liquor, it also extends them the right to enter contracts, make loans, and take any other ac- tions now authorized to adults under the law. Wilson said only one youth in his home county has solic- ited his vote on the bill, in- dicating ‘‘someone else’ has promoted the change—an apparent reference to the li- quor industry. “You can’t put a man’s head on a boy’s shoulders,” Wilson said. Addressing the young people lining the Senate gal- lery, Wilson said: ‘‘What we're doing is punishing you . .. placing an economic yoke on your neck.” Birmingham Sen. George McMillan, who has handled the bill in the Senate, argued that adulthood should be de- termined by the age at which most people are supporting themselves. And that age has lowered in recent years, he said, an argument which apparently swayed a major- ity of the Senate. The vote to override Wal- lace’s veto came after a morning-long filibuster against Opelika Sen. C.C. ‘*Bu’’ Torbert's bill to let State-chartered banks charge the same rates of in- terest as those with national . charters. Anniston Sen. Donald Stewart started the filibus- ter, then was joined by Fine, who said his action wasn’t aimed at this bill, but at al- .tering the ethics law. That law prohibits him from voting on the banking bill, Fine said, because he owns stock in a bank. State banks can charge a maximum 8 per cent interest on single-payment loans, while federal banks may charge more due to an in- terest ceiling tied to other economic indicators. . July 23, 1975 The bill was carried over for one legislative day short- ly after the vote on the 19-year-old adulthood bill, then the Senate adjourned till Thursday. Earlier in the day, sena- tors gave routine approval to a House resolution involving the past weekend recess. The House had refused to adopt a resolution identical to the one approved by the Senate last week, and, if sen- ators had failed to comply with the House action, both chambers would. have lost at least five legislative days. That results from a stipu- lation that each calendar day of a recess not jointly au- thorized by the two cham- bers. counts as a legislative day, regardless of whether the bodies actually convene. \f"

Wallace directly ap- pealed to the public Thursday night to pressure the Ala: ‘bama Legislature into abandoning an alternative budg- | el he said would undermine state government oper- ations, | In a Statewide televised address, Wallace singled out ‘lhe leadership of the Alabama Education Association, Which helped write the alternative, plan, a8 ‘‘a private, ~ special interest group” trying to run stale government in place of the people's elected representatives, In general anticipated remarks, the governor re- pealed his earlier pledges to veto any new taxes, saying theré is sulficient revenue to cover state needs if the lawmakers will ‘distribute it a little more equally,” Wallace has proposed taking $40 million from the Spee cial Education Trust Fund to finance a new prison, men: lal health programs, highway building and Medicaid, a plan that has been vigilantly fought by teachers and not accepted by the legislature, “The education leadership says ‘that's our money,”” Wallace said of AEA’s actions, charging the move to Slop the education fund diversion will result in a dis- mantling of the Highway Department and in federal court takeover of state mental health and prison pro- prams, “This money doesn't belong to anybody but you,” Wallace told his television audience, urging his listen: ers to “write your legislators and tell them to take what n rebuttal remarks made immediately after Wal- lace’s address and televised locally, AEA Executive Secretary Paul Hubbert said the budget’ supported by his association allows for the normal 10-12 per cent growth in the major state departments, and nearly 50 per cent growth in Medicaid—which he called the major linancing problem. Dr. Hubbert said Alabama's education programs his- lorically have been ranked 60th in the nation, and that lawmakers now believe education is in a position to do some catching up.” “What we're talking about is the futyre of 900,000 Ala- bama young people.” Hubbert said, ‘ppealing to par- ents to “make an honest study of the problems con- fronting education,” then decide whether education money should be diverted to other programs. Wallace also said his budget, even with the $40 million diversion, would give education more money and ex- panded programs than ever before, including teacher salary increases, better pension benefits, additional teachers and a new kindergarten project. “Many states are firing teachers, many are not giving raises,” the governor said, noting that isn't happening here and questioning why the AEA should so hotly pro- test his plan. Citing the inflation-recession squeeze on the average family, Wallace said it “behooves state government to operate with no new revenues,” He said legislators have “‘introduced a raft of new taxes because the education leadership wants them to,” but emphasized he will veto any taxes passed, and pre- dicled the legislature would not be able to override a velo, Bills to increase the gasoline tax were introduced ear- lier in the session, and on Thursday measures to sub- stantially raise liquor and beer taxes were introduced in both chambers by Sen. Robert Wilson of Jasper and Rep. Bobby Tom Crowe of Townley—both adminis- tration floor leaders. Wallace said after his address that he did not discuss the taxes with either man, and would veto them if ap- proved by the legislature. July 25, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Earlier Start Wo ave Helped Budget hrough Many Nights By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer State government again is in a state of seige, with ‘warnings of impending crises buffeting official Ala- bama from all directions. Some officials have even admitted the governing pro- cess here is best described as ‘government by crisis,” but at least in the past the crises have come in a bit more orderly fashion, rather than in the engulfing tidal wave that supposedly is about to roar through the Capitol. The disasters, according to the administration and others, are about to strike the prison system, the mental institutions (again), the highway department and the Medicaid program. Various sources have advanced various solutions, all involving more funding for the endangered species of state service. They range from the governor's plan to siphon out and redirect money from the healthy education fund, to leg- islative proposals for new taxes on gasoline, whisky and lodgings. After mostly minor skirmishes over how to resolve these problems, the battle is about to become hot and bloody. Naturally the need for drawing strategies and the im- mediacy of the situation centers most thoughts on quick, if temporary, solutions—sort of a ‘help me make it through the night’ syndrome. At the end of the night, however, is another day, and another and another, and at the close of each of those days will be just as dark and frightening nights unless some heads start thinking about longer-term answers. It is this band-aid approach, frequently coupled with total neglect of emerging problem areas, that appears responsible for the present barrage of crisis threats. These problems for the most part didn’t suddenly ap- pear as full-grown monsters. They've been hanging around for years, maturing into demons now ready to burst from their cages. Take the prison system. Warnings have been filtering through to the legisla- ture and administration for some time that the slightest spark could ignite a major explosion in overcrowded, underfunded, unsanitary prisons. A small cadre of legislators did take those warnings seriously, especially during the 1973 regular session when a package of remedial legislation was introduced. It didn’t get much further than introduction. Sen, Maston Mims of Uriah, at that time a House member, urgently pleaded with his colleagues to take a close look at the conditions that never were corrected, and two years later have prompted a half dozen law suits against the prison system, bringing threats of total federal takeover, tiov. George C. Wallace may have made mention of prison needs back in 1973, but Mims repeatedly tried in vain to win a serious administration commitment to ac- lion. Prison Commissioner L.B. Sullivan, who resigned last week, reportedly left his job in part due to lack of co- operation by the rest of the administration over recent years. The administration didn't push, and the legislature was locked in its own lethargy, unable or unwilling to address the problem while it still was manageable, Now legislative concern has been raised, and Gov. Wallace has sounded a loud cry for money to keep the criminals off the streets and behind bars—a move that fits snugly into his over all budget strategy, justifying the need to divert education money. A similar story can be told about the mental health de- partment and the Medicaid program. A few voices in the wilderness tried to attract atten- tion to mental institutions before the federal court de Inanded action, but they were ignored while the admin- istration and legislature concentrated on some other hasic state services and some local pork barrelling that maybe got folks reelected but didn't work wonders for mental patients. While much of the court order has been or is being im- plemented, there remain a few gaping holes that Com- inissioner Taylor Hardin says can only be filled with dollars. If the lawmakers fail to supply those dollars and do it quick. they could find a judge’s hand dipping into the state till. Had the few plaintive voices been heeded earlier, the funding could have been more gradual with less impact, ‘The governor's own budget officer warned in 1973 that Medicaid would grow into the money-eating monster it has become, if restrictions weren't placed on the serv- ices. Although a special committee was created to study the Medicaid situation, there were no cutbacks and no serious efforts to learn if some funds possibly were being misspent. Now, as the program serves 10 per cent of the popu- lation with one-third of the general fund budget, a new special committee is delving into the intricacies of Me- dicaid, and being astonished at what it's finding. Had the search begun a little sooner, some of the money might have been rescued to help the state make it through the current dark night. July 27, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Proposes New Plan To Divert Educational Funds Grezes Repeal OFS Special Tax By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A new plan to divert educa- tion funds by juggling taxes wus proposed by Gow. George C. Wallace Tuesday night in hopes of breaking the budget deadlock in the Alabama Legislature. In a 30-minute address to a joint meeting of the legisla- ture, televised statewide. Wallace outlined his new propusal to repeal the 4 per cent utility tax and raise the vasuline tax. The governor originally «asked lawmakers to simply takegsome $40 million of rev- cnues now going into the Spe- cial Education Trust Fund, und use the money to finance other state operations in crit- ical need of revenue. That has won minimal legislative support, The plan revealed Tues- dav would have basically the sume result, since the utility tax Wallace wants repealed now is funnelled into the edu- cation fund. The governor said ‘‘the in- iquitous 4 per cent tax on util- itics”’ is ‘tan unfair tax, espe- cially to the elderly and the unemployed and those on pensions. He said it would save the taxpavers $50 million, which means it would reduce the education fund by that amount. To make up for the lost revenue. Wallace proposed replacing the 7-cents a gal- lon gasoline tax with a per- centage tax that would im- mediately raise the levy to 9 cents per gallon. He did not specify the percent. of the tux. tinder a percentage tax. the fee would rise as gasoline prices increase. Wallace also asked the leg- islature to alter. the business § license schedule. making the minimum license fee $25, with the amount going up in . proportion to the size of the » business. The governor said the pasvline tax change would bring in an additional $38 million, which would help fi- nance the Highway Depart- ment. while the license tax reform would raise about $12 million for the prison sys- tem. In a speech frequently punctuated by.ap- plause—generally . eminat- ing from. long-time suppor- ters and state employes who jammed into the House chamber for the mes- sage—Wallace also chas- tised the Alabama Educa- tion Association and the Ala- huma Senate, and presented several ¢rime-fighting pro- posals. The AEA has fought Wal- ‘lace’s diversion plan ~ since its inception, but the gover- nor called on the associ- ution’s leadership to mar- shall its forces in other direc- tions to improve the quality of education here. He chal- Wallace Demands Stronger Crime Controls longed the AKA to wark to- wurd reopening schools closed down by federal courts in desegregation suits and ta “go to local. govern- inents and get some funds there.” Wallace expressed hopes thal his new plan- would free some legislators from their comimittments to AEA against direct diversion of education monies, The most impassioned portions of the governor's speech came while under- scoring the need for stronger criminal punishment stat- lites, “This legislature gught to puss u hill to provide the re- turn of the electric chgir and they ought to do jt right uway,’’ Wallace cri Ile alse asked lawmakers 1 apprave bills providing for mininun 20-year sentences, without parole, for murder and other vielent crimes.

In ending his specch with requests for legislative ac- tion, Wallace directed sev- eral critical remarks to the Alabunva Senate, which has heen Ineked in repeated fili- busters since the session be- Kin. ‘ “LT respectfully request the hienute of Alabuma get mov- ing.’ he said. ‘But don't (gasoline) tax and not reduce the other, be- cause I still have some friends in the Senate who will do some talking.’ \f"

        "ocr_text": "icials, Beware, Legislators Playing New Ethics Game By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Public officials, beware. The Alabama Legislature has learned a fun new game that boots the loser from his job. The lawmakers wrote the rules, decide when’ to play and can require the participation of just about any of- ficeholder whose job security isn’t written into the con- stitution. Under those circumstances, guess who winds up the loser. It's not, the legislature. The game basically is a revision—some might call it a perversion—of the impeachment process. The main dif- ference is the absence of due process for the official placed on the firing line. The trial run of the new game came last week, when the Alabama Senate wrote a new ethics law and wrote the members of the present Ethics Commission out of office. The action may be unprecedented, but if it isn’t, it ought to be. ' fey Simply abolishing an office to get rid of its occupant may not be as unique as the approach devised by the Senate and readily accepted by the House of Represen- _ latives. In this case, the Alabama Ethics Commission essen- tially was sacked, then re-established under a new stat- ute carrying the provision that none of the present com- missioners be eligible to serve on the new body. A few legislators were appalled at the tactic, but most were blithely willing to turn out of office five men who were appointed by the state’s top five elected officials, who were not charged with any wrongdoing, who have spent long, agonizing hours attempting to perform their duties as awkwardly laid out by the 1973 legislature. There was no concern issued over the reputations or personal feelings of the officials involved. Who are those five commissioners the legislature de- cided are not fit to hold office? Dr. George Bagley of Montgomery is the executive secretary of the Alabama Baptist State Convention, and has served several churches as minister. He was appointed to the commission by Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Howell Heflin. Dr. Leslie Wright is the president of Samford Univer- sity in Birmingham, formerly held Bagley’s job and once was executive secretary to.U.S. Sen. Lister Hill. Gov. George C. Wallace appointed Wright. Donald Comer III is the new president and treasurer of Avondale Mills, was president of the Alabama Textile Manufacturers Association and has been named ‘‘Citi- zen of the Year’ in Eufaula. He is the appointee of for- mer House Speaker G. Sage Lyons. C.L. “Connie” Entrekin, executive vice president of the Alabama Labor Council, is past president of the steclworkers local in Gadsden, and has been active in Democratic Party politics. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley ap- pointed Entrekin. Alto Lee is a well-known criminal lawyer in Dothan , who just stepped down as president of the Alabama State Bar Association and has been active in University of Alabama affairs. He was named to the commission by Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley. All have been involved in too-numeraus-to-list...civi and religious’ activities. cae For the last two years, all of the five also have taken substantial time out from their already demanding ‘schedules to wrestle with what may be the most vague, difficult to interpret act ever scratched on the law books in’ Alabama. : They have been besieged by queries from state and lo- cal officials and employes regarding what conduct is allowed or prohibited under the 1973 act. ‘They have written rules, regulations and guidelines attempting to decipher that act for the persons under its -purview. And, they have been defendants in half a dozen or so law suits filed by those who don’t want to be bound by the act. Although legislators have protested some rulings is- sued by the commission, no lawmakers will be found as plaintiffs in the law suits. Possibly that’s because the legislators knew they could and would rewrite the law to remove the objectionable provisions mandating their ethical conduct, and, just to be on the safe side, to elimi- nate the commissioners who applied the law to them. Perhaps. though, the real problem with the present [thics Commission is that it too scrupulously enforced all provisions of the ethics law, even against legislators, who frequently are used to preferential treatment in business, social, and sometimes legal-judicial dealings. They didn't get it from the Ethics Commission. | So what happens now? , \\ Gov, George Wallace could refuse to accept the legis- lative action and try to win passage of an executive amendment removing the clause against the commis- sioners. It appears the legislature would override that. Which means the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the House would jointly name five new com- missioners. Finding conscientious people to fill the vacancies, inne could be a difficult job, Maybe that's what some legislators were counting on. August 3, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "EFthies Cormraraissiom Simes Swarr Sone By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Ethics Com- mission sang its swan song friday, but indicated it may yet level a parting shot at the legislature that abolished it. Four of the five former commissioners appeared at a press conference where they showed little vindictive- mess toward the lawmakers who weakened the 1973 eth- ics act and reconstituted the commission, prohibiting any sitting commissioners from serving om the new body. The commissioners’ jobs ended when the House and Senate overrode Gov. qGseorge C. Wallace’s veto of the proposal Thursday. Commissioner Alto V. Lee IiIl of Dothan, immediate past president of the Ala- bama State Bar Association, noted the commission’s lat- est activity had been a re- view of lawmakers voting even more stringent than those we have worked with during the past two years,”’ Bagley said. Entrekin said the commis- » _sioners felt some ‘‘dismay | over the method by which we , were removed from office,’’ that they have ‘‘not been ac- cused of malfeasance, mis- feasance or non-feasance,’’ but of ‘‘faithfully carrying out our duties and responsi- bilities.*’ Asked why the legislature removed them, Commis- sioner Donald Comer, a Eu- faula textile executive, said he believes the legislature ‘‘originally wanted an inde- patterns to learn which were violating provisions of the ethics law prohibiting voting on bills that would result in financial benefit to the legis- lators. Lee said the findings will be sent to the governor, leg- islature and attormey gener- al in the agency's final re- port. Although there have been indications violations have occurred, the illegal actions apparently will be moot. In weakening the ethics law, the lawmakers omitted pro- visions regarding voting on bills that will earn them money. ; “*It had been our firm in- tention to take action at our next meeting,’”’ Lee said, adding he does not believe the people of Alabama ‘‘will continue to tolerate open and flagrant violations of con- stitutional and statutory law’ prohibiting such votes. Former Commission pendent ethics commis- sion. “That’s what ‘they got,’” he said. ‘tI wonder if they want- ed a ‘sort of’ com*mnission.*’ Lee responded: ‘We stepped on too many toes. We rapped too many knuck- les.” The fifth commissioner, Dr. Leslie Wright, the presi- dent of Samford University in Birmingham, was unable to attend the press confer- ence.

Lee said he wondered if the commission erred ‘‘in apply- ing the velvet glove of cease and desist when an iron fist might have been more ap- propriate.’’ Commissioner George Bagley, executive secretary of the Alabama Baptist Con- vention in Montgomery, noted the people of Califor- nia overwhelmingly voted in an ethics law similar to Ala- bama’s about a year ago. “*I leave my position .. with the lingering thought that if the people of Alabama were permitted to vote on ethics legislation, the provi- Sions of the law would be E:ntrekin said the files have been sealed and will not be available to the public till the staff learns what action is appropriate.

Repeat: No letter will be printed unless Editor knows who wrote it, Ca Editor, The Advertiser: I appreciate and wish to thank you for the editorial in Sunday's Adverti- ser-Journal, captioned: ‘‘The New Ethics Bill.\"” Also, I would like to thank Marcia Kunstel, staff writer, for her well-written and timely article on the same subject. It is somehow comforting to know that some of Alabama's largest news- papers have strongly supported the Ethics Commission, along with its present membership. Because of the stand taken by your paper, and by oth- ers around the state, many citizens are now able to judge this act by the legis- lature for themselves. — Before the first organizational ses- sion back in January some of the so- called ‘veteran’ legislators had their minds made up that Melvin Cooper and the Ethics Commission would have to go. Speeches were made around the state to ‘‘soften\" the im- pact that was to come later. Arms were twisted and continued to be twisted right through three special sessions, and the twisting didn't stop unti] the ‘Beasley Crowd” got what it wanted. Now, the big question is to what ex- tent will these power-hungry politi- cians exploit their success. Fright- ened taxpayers will be watching each legislative day, anticipating the worst, but somehow hoping for not quite the worst. And. will Governor Wallace be a tool in the Beasley grab for power? Or will he act in the best interest of the “‘aver- age citizen’’ he champions and send this bill back to a legislature gone be- serk? No ethics bill at all would be better than the St. John bill, because this bill makes a mockery of the word “‘eth- ics.’ Rick Manley’s bill was a dis- grace to the Alabama Legislature: but one thing it didn't do was laugh in the face of honesty. Manley’s bill said sim-’ ply: we're going to do as we damn well please. Mr. Voter. like it or lump it. On the other hand. the St. John bill says: we'll do what we want to do. but we'll first get a commission more ‘‘friend- ly\" to our whims and the public need not know the difference. Again, many thanks for keeping an eagle eve on that bunch in Montgom- ery. They need to be watched every minute! C,A. STALLINGS Birmingham, Ala. August 10, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Senate Carries Over By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A filibuster against capital punishment was temporar- ily halted Thursday, as the Alabama Senate set aside the bill to await an Alabama Supreme Court opinion on its constitutionality. The request for a Supreme Court opinion was protested by some senators as merely a Stall tactic to avoid consid- eration of the death penalty legislation, which already has been approved by the House of Representatives, but it did delay a dramatic filibuster the Senate’s two black members threatened to continue indefinitely. One of the pair, Birming- ham Sen. J. Richmond Pear- son, said he would not re- sume the filibuster if the state’s high court says it be- lieves the bill meets con- stitutional requirements spelled out by the U.S. Su- preme Court. Several senators, how- ever, said they believe the state court should not and will not issue an opinion. ‘*I do not conceive of the Supreme Court of Alabama taking a position on this,’’ said Luverne Sen. Wendell Mitchell, Senate sponsor of the bill. ‘‘ ‘‘I frankly feel that what we have here is nothing but a delay.” But, Mitchell said he had told opponents Pearson and Sen. U.W. Clemon that he would not fight the resolution asking for the court action, partially because he had been told the court could re- spond within seven days, which would allow sufficient time for final Senate action. Tuscaloosa Sen. Bert Bank said the move was ‘‘another example of shirking our duty,’’ and added the request would ‘‘embarrass’’ court members. The resolution was passed 20-7, so the death penalty bill remains in limbo, temporar- ily carried over till an in- definite date. It presumably will be resurrected after the Supreme Court responds, though it likely will surface even if the court fails to act and the ‘session draws to- ward a close. When the resolution was proposed, Pearson had fili- bustered an hour and Cle- mon had just relieved his fel- low Birmingham attorney at the microphone. Clemon said he expected the pair would attempt to continue the filibuster until stopped by a cloture vote, a rare parliamentary move that cuts off debate. Should the court refuse to address the issue as requested, the two are expected to resume their filibuster, mounted in part because the senators say they believe the bill does not in fact meet con- stitutional standards and would be used dis- criminatorily against blacks. During his hour of talking, Pearson said pressure for the death penalty is part of ‘‘an emotional outcry’’ re- sulting from rising crime rates. **‘The will of the majority is not justice,’’ he said, referr- ing to polls purporting to show a majority of Alaba- mians wish capital punish- ment restored here. Pearson contended that implementing the judicial article to the Alabama Con- stitution is the proper first step toward combatting crime, since it would assure ‘*swift, exact and color- blind’’ justice. Responding to arguments that the death penalty is a crime deterrent, Pearson said it would not be unless executions were held ‘‘at high noon on a sunny day in the biggest town square in the state,’’ and carried over television. He further contended: ‘‘We are not able to give life, so we should not be able to take one. Capital punish- ment only compounds the crime supposedly com- mitted by the accused.’’ Mitchell, in supporting the bill, said more than 30 states have reinstituted the death penalty since the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court guidelines were handed down. ‘“*‘This bill does not dis- criminate against anyone on the basis of race, creed, reli- gion, sex or economic sta- tion,’’ he said.

        "ocr_text": "Dire Predictions — On Annual Session: Are Becoming Fact By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The dire predictions of opponents to annual legisla- tive sessions are fast on the way to becoming fact. Those who fought yearly meetings of the legislature based their highly verbal protests on the additional cost expected as the lawmakers began gearing up to double their conduct of business, (That mathematics—a doubl- ing—works only if one doesn't consider special ses- sions. ) They foresaw increased secretarial and clerical staffs, added professional aides, more equipment and extra space. At least some of that seems in the offing, as signaled by Alabama Senate approval last week of legislation to increase by nearly 80 the authorized strength of the sec: retarial-clerical corps, At various times between 1973 and the present both chambers also have approved a bond issue for construc: tion of a new legislative building, but the two bodies nev- er have coordinated their moves in the same session, Proponents of the new official lodgings now have annual sessions as an added defense of their position, saying the present cramped quarters are bad enough to con: tend with once every two years and will be intolerable as an annual operating base, The bond issue is up again and could be passed before this session ends in mid-October. In the same vein, the lawmakers expanded their fis- cal office from a staff of one to a three-man show, an ac- tion that came in a special session earlier this year, be- ie the people voted acceptance of annual sessions in une. So the legislative branch is slowly growing a few more shoots, though it has not yet blossomed near as full as those fearing yearly sessions dolefully forecast. They still may be proved accurate, however. In fact, few people familiar with the ways and means of the legislature ever discounted those predictions, in- cluding lawmakers and others who supported annual sessions. Rather they argued that a stronger support structure is vital to knowledgable, rational lawmak- ing—something that hasn’t always been practiced here. That means a stronger legislature, and that, as an- nual sessions proponents such as the League of Women Voters pointed out, would be a legislature less depend- ent upon lobbyists and other special interest spokesmen who now provide much of the information on which leg- islative decisions are based. The legislature obviously is moving toward an ex- pansion of some sort, but the question remains whether it simply will grow a few layers of bureaucratic fat to open jobs for friends and cronies, or will beef up its forces and expand its capacity to deal with increasingly complex affairs of state, After last week's Senate action, that is doubly ques- tionable. Lawmakers have expressed a desire for sturdy pro- fessional staff people to research issues, find out what other states are doing with similar problems, and present reasonable solutions that will do more than merely deplete state resources. Instead of beginning to build committee staffs, the ’ Senate voted to buy more secretaries and clerks and several additional aides to the legislative presiding offi- cers, Senate Secretary MacDowéll Lee and senators who must share secretaries for official correspondence and for the mechanics of preparing bills say the added cleri- cal workers are essential and will be even more vital once annual sessions begin. That may be so, but what ever happened to the dire need for professional staff? Why not combine the hiring of some clerks with the employment of at least a few persons trained in economics or government adminis- tration or social services? It sounds plausible that under emergency situations, such as the end of the session crush of action, secretarial help could be borrowed from other state departments which lawmakers contend are overflowing with bodies anyway. With annual sessions it’s doubtful that as much legis- lation will grind through the mill as does when the two bodies meet only every other year, which should mean processing the bills won't take as much work and as many people, And, in what seems almost a masochistic move, the Senate made itself a standing target for critical blows when it refused to put a ceiling on the salaries of the ad- ministrative and executive assistants to the lieutenant governor and speaker of the House. Some legislators have quietly explained, in none too happy tones of voice, that the aim is allowing the two built-in campaign staffs, paid for by the public and working on public time. None, however, rose to protest in the Senate chamber. August 17, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Baxley Sues and Seeks to End Public School Charges Baxley Charges Fees Unconstitutional By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff A federal judge here refused to halt immediately the collection of public school fees, as requested when Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley filed a class action suit Wednesday seeking to have the fee sys- tem declared unconstitutional. State Education Supt. LeRoy Brown, members of the State Board of Educa- tion and the superintendent and_ school board of Enterprise City Schools are named specific defendants, but all local school boards and superintendents are represented by the Enterprise officials. Asst. Atty. Gen. Frederick Middleton said U.S. Dist. Judge Frank M. Johnson Writer Jr. refused his request for an immediate - temporary restraining order, which would have prohibited collection of all lo- cal school fees as classes resume this week and next. Johnson said the request came too late, considering the impending start of the new school year, according to Mid- dleton. At a press conference announcing the suit, Baxley said he not only hopes to stop what he called the illegal collection of fees, which is allowed under limited circumstances by state law, but wants to have the existing law declared uncon- stitutional as a violation of the due pro cess and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The law allows accredited high schools to charge ‘‘a matriculation fee’’ more subjects than do some other sys- tems, he said. Although the suit is styled a class ac- tion, Baxley expressed some doubts about whether the court will accept it as such. “We'll file suit against every school board in the state if it takes that,'\" he said. Enterprise School Superintendent Jack Rutland later denied any dis- crimination at his school due to fees, and said some school charges ‘‘have been la- beled fees but are not such.*’ He would not explain what those charges are, if not fees. The list provided the attorney gener- al's office by Enterprise officials is headed: ‘‘Fees collected from pupils by Enterprise City Schools.”\" It shows elementary schools charge from $5 to $10 for ‘“‘expendable materials which are used by pupils,”\"\" while the high school has charges including $10 a year for general typing, $4 each for general tuition, band. art and science, and $2 for locks. The high school levies a total of 24 charges. “‘a reasonable fee\" ratory and shop work. “I feel it’s illegal to collect fees from anyone at any time,’’ Baxley said. ‘“‘Edu- cation should be free.”’ Although Baxley admitted there is no constitutional guarantee to a free, public education, he said the collection of man- datory fees works a hardship on indigent families, and fees for elective courses discriminate against children of fami- lies unable to pay for the extras. ‘“*‘Close to 90 per cent of the public schools charge some fees,’’ he said, and in some cases those charges violate the existing law. For example, he said, fees in elementary schools are illegal. Baxley also continued his running battle with the Alabama Legislature, saying it is ‘‘first of all the legislature's responsibility . to pass laws prohibit- ing this’’ and to provide sufficient fund- ing so fees are not needed in the local sys- tems. He added that a bill has been proposed to outlaw fees and replace their revenue with state money, but the lawmakers al- tered that to allow continued existence of fees. Baxley said he did not mean to ‘‘single out’’ officials of the Enterprise school system in south Alabama, since board members there ‘have done nothing the others haven’t.”’ A survey by his office last year did show Enterprise levies more fees in for library, labo- “If the necessary funds were provided for a quality school program,\"’ he the Enterprise school board immediately abolish all said, “‘would charges.”\" The state superintendent and state school board are listed as defendants be- cause they “have the authority and duty to prohibit the local defendants from engaging in the unlawful and uncon- stitutional practice’’ of charging fees, according to the complaint. The suit charges the state officials ‘permit and acquiesce in'' the practices in violation of their oaths of office and of state law. State Supt. Brown agreed with at least some of Baxley’s contentions, saying fees ‘‘are within themselves dis- crimiunatory.”™ ‘‘Many times a child from a poor home is deprived of taking the kinds of educa- tion courses he should have to develop his talents,’’ Brown said. ‘So far as I'm concerned, I would fight to eliminate the fees.\"\" August 28, 1975 \f"

Bill Baxley in a formal opin- ion, Baxley not only said the original five commissioners should remain in of- fice till their regular terms expire, but he also stated no sections of the new law may be implemented or adminis- tered until it is approved by the U.S. at- torney general as mandated by the U.S. Voting Rights Act. The revised law, approved several weeks ago by the legislature over Gov, George C. Wallace's veto, also weak- ens some regulatory provisions of the original 1973 law which created the Ethics Commission, particularly in reference to financial transactions permitted state officials, including legislators, Melvin Cooper, executive director of the Ethics Commission who ‘asked Baxley to interpret the effect of the law, said commissioners he had con- tacted by Thursday afternoon ‘‘are gratified at the wording of the attorney general's opinion, (and think) that it seems at first glance to be very strong judicially.” The commissioners, who disbanded the day following final passage of the new law, now plan to meet Wednesday in Birmingham to review Baxley’s opinion in detail and ‘‘determine their next course of action,” Cooper said, One of Cooper's questions to Baxley was whether the commissioners are entitled to contest the constitutionality of their removal from office by seek- ing a declaratory judgment in court. Cooper indicated Thursday that is the likely next course of action. The commissioners are not the only ones who may seek a court ruling on the ethics law. The law which recreates the com- mission names the governor, lieuten- ant governor and speaker of the Ala- bama House as the authority to ap- point new commissioners. Under the 1973 act, those three plus the attorney general and Alabama Supreme Court chief justice made appointments. House Speaker Joe McCorquodale, who said he had not received news of the opinion until contacted by The Ad- vertiser, said his initial reaction is to consider requesting an opinion from the Alabama Supreme Court. “The lieutenant governor and Gov. Wallace and I should meet and discuss this before either | or either of them take a firm position,’ McCorquodale said. “T was one who did not feel that this prohibition against the existing com- mission should be in there,” he added. Gov. Wallace also responded that the appointing authorities ‘‘should hold up making any decisions (on ap- pointments) until further study is made,” ahd indicated he wishes to meet with McCorquodale and Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley as soon as possible. Beasley was out of town and could not be reached for comment. Another possibility was raised by House Rep. Rick Manley of Demo- polis, who proposed the original ethics law revision which completely abo- lished the commission with no replace- ment and removed all restrictions from the law. It merely called for financial dis- closure by state officials and some em- ployes Senate, but was drastically al- tered in the Manley said re-introduction of his original bill is a possibility, “to clear the constitutional . question.” August 29, 1975 Baxley's opinion said the new law Violates the U.S. Constitution by abr- idging the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and be- cause it constitutes a “bill of attain- der,” which inflicts punishment with- out judicial trial on specific individ. uals or easily ascertainable members of a group. He cited several cases as precedent, including a U.S. Supreme Court deci- sion striking down a congressional act which prohibited specific individuals from further government service. Baxley noted the new ethics act con- tains a severability clause, which means that if any section is found un- constitutional the rest of the law re- mains in effect, and said that once the present commissioners’ terms of of- fice expire, new members should be appointed under provisions of the new law. He said the original commissioners “shall remain in office,” and that the commission staff should continue to operate. Although other portions of the law were not questioned, Baxley said none of the changes may take effect until the act is approved under terms of the Voting Rights Act. That approval is needed because one section of the law pertains to candidates for office, and all laws relating to elections must be reviewed by the U.S. attorney general. \f"

The bill, which already has won passage in the House of Representatives, was sent to the Alabama Supreme Court about three weeks ago with a request that the judges ad- vise whether the measure meets constitutional stan- dards as laid out by the U:S. Supreme Court. Sens. U.W. Clemon and J. Richmond Pearson, both Birmingham attorneys, said they would end verbal oppo- sition to the bill should the state's high court say it does not violate the U.S. stitution. Speculation was that the Con- Alabama court would refuse . to take a stand on the bill, which proved accurate. The response signed by all nine justices state they re- fuse to render an advisory opinion because -the U.S. Su- preme Court is about to con- sider whether the death pe- Mmatly is unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punish- ment, and because the Ala- -bama Supreme Court may be called upon to decide the constitutionality of a Present state penalty provision in the Johnny Har- ris case, now on appeal to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. The judges also said they believe a question of ‘‘life or death’’ importance ‘‘should not be approached in the ab- stract (but) should be re- solved in the context of an adversary setting. with an actual fact situation before us. fully briefed and argued to the court.” Luverne Sen. Wendell Mit- chell. Senate sponsor of the legislation, expressed no Surprise at the court's ac- tion. adding he hopes the Senate leadership ‘‘will see fit to put this back on the spe- cial order calendar at an early date.” Mitchell also repeated his belief that the bill is as close to being constitutional as possible. Pearson also spoke after the judges*® decision was read to the upper chamber, Saying he fails to understand why the Senate is in such a hurry to pass the death pen- alty. since the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule again on the question soon. and the legislature will have another opportunity to deal with the issue next year. Clemon added that the state court displayed ‘‘a well-placed recognition” that any action ‘‘may be a fu- tile gesture’’ considering the pending federal court deci- sion... A Pearson said he will move ‘to postpone action when the bill again reaches the Senate. September 3, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Tax Bill Delay Blow to Groups By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The state’s most powerful special interest groups were dealt at least a temporary blow Wednesday by a Senate committee which postponed action on a proposed ad valo- rem tax reduction. The bill supported by groups including the Ala- bama Farm Bureau and Ala- bama Chamber of Com- merce would require coun- ties to reduce their millage if current property reas- sessment increased local ad valorem tax revenues more than 6 per cent. Sen. Robert ‘Wilson of Jas- per, member of the Finance Committee which carried over the bill, charged thai proponents ‘‘want to defea! the whole purpose’’ of the 1971 property tax classifica. tion system and property re: valuation process resulting from a federal court order tc equalize taxes statewide. Expected to be hardest hit by the changes are large landholders, especially those in rural counties that formerly assessed property at rates as low as 8 per cent of the fair market value. The classification system adopted by the legislature and approved by the court requires an across-the- board 15 per cent rate on ag- ricultural, forest and resi- dential property. Other types of property are assessed at higher rates. “It appears some counties will triple their revenue,’’ said John Dorrill, ney for the Farm Bureau, who admitted the money probably can be used locally, but questioned whether the taxpayers can afford such a ‘“‘windfall tax gain’’ for local government. The rates of assessment and the property values determined under the present revaluation pro- grams would remain the same, but counties would be required by this legislation to reduce their mill rates so evenue would not exceed 6 per cent more than revenue totalled before the changes. Large landowners primar- ily would benefit from the-so- stalled ‘‘lid law.’’ John Watkins, director of the Alabamu League of Mu- nicipalities, opposed the bill and predicted the federal “*‘will not allow this court subterfuge to take place.’* “‘People at the local level Watkins -? are elected, too, said. ‘‘If you don’t think pressure will be put on them to lower the millage, you are mistaken.*\"' Spokesmen for several education groups also op- posed the 6 per cent limit, since portions of local ad valorem tax revenue funnel into public schools. Wilson and others on the committee agreed some lim- it may be needed, but said the lawmakers should wait to learn exactly how much more revenue the counties will receive through the equalization program. September 11, an attor- Although results of reva- ' luation have not yet been an- nounced, Dorrill said pre- liminary findings indicate some counties will double or triple their property tax rev- enue. The bill sponsored by Uriah Sen. Maston Mims was carried over till an_ in- definite time, but an _ identi- cal measure has been ap- proved by committee in the House of Representatvies and may appear on the House special order calen- dar Thursday. The same committee also held a hearing Wednesday on Hainsville Sen. John Bak- er's proposal to replace the present 7 cent a gallon gaso- line tax with a 20 per cent wholesale gasoline levy. No action was taken, after representatives of the petro- leum industry testified the altered tax structure would be almost impossible for dis- tributors and retailers to cal- culate, since the wholesale price of gasoline of all grades changes practically daily. They also said it would be difficult for the state to administer and entorce. Ralph Eagerton of the State Revenue Department said the 20 per cent tax would not increase revenues now, but would bring in more money if the price of gaso- line rises, as is expected. 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Senators Prefer Fine’s Gavel Tactics To Gag of Cloture By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Senate President Pro Tem Joe Fine probably did his fellow senators an immense favor last week when he broke a filibuster, by closing the talker's mouth with the gavel. Fine, sitting in the presiding officer's chair as he usu- ally is when the Senate leadership decides it's time for heavy-handed tactics, didn’t exactly stuff the gavel down the throat of Anniston Sen. Donald Stewart. But his action certainly did gag the senator. Fine simply refused to recognize the existence of Stewart, who had filibustered off and on for more than a week against raising interest rates on small loans. Stewart already had talked three hours in the morn- ing and had just completed the second hour of his eve- ning stint Thursday when Fine took the initiative to stop the filibuster, At 8:45 p.m. Stewart was about to begin another hour ‘on another proposed amendment, but Fine recognized Opelika Sen. C.C. ‘‘Bo’’ Torbert with a substitute amendment instead. Stewart asked repeatedly to speak to the amendment. Fine ignored him, and called for a vote. Stewart then repeatedly called for recognition to pro- pose another amendment. Fine ignored him and de- cided it was time for the final vote on the bill. It passed by a 21-6 vote, but some of the nay votes may have been protests against fine running rough-shod over a senator, and not necessarily a protest of the mer- its of the bill, which unquestionably had ample support in the upper chamber. In tact, not another senator felt strong enough opposi- tion to the measure to join Stewart in filibustering. Al- though several did come to his aid to allow momentary breathers, it was basically a one-man show from the Start. A number of senators obviously were growing restive as Stewart droned on about how the loan sharks were about to take another big bite from the working man. yet not once did a petition appear for a vote on cloture, which is the way filibusters are supposed to be stopped according, to Senate rules. Senators gave themselves a generous pat on the back earlier this year when they adopted rules supposedly making it easier to invoke cloture against a talker. The change allows a cloture vote to be taken upon filing of a © petition with the names of 18 Senate members. For- merly, only the Senate Rules Committee had the power to allow this vote, by approving and reporting out a reso- lution calling tor it. Well, it may be easier to do now, but still nobody's doing it. Torbert, the interest bill proponent who apparently ° had planned the stop-Stewart move with Kine, said later he didn't approve of the tactic. But, added ‘lorbert, who speaks frequently about fair play and respect for the other man there does come a point when foolish talking must stop and a bill must stand or fall on the merits of its provisions. Torbert also 1s not fond of cfoture, and in fact said he preferred Fine's kind of maneuvering to halting a fills buster through cloture, The reason remained unstated, but may have some: - thing to do with the fact that with Fine’s tactic, only one guy 1s the heavy, rather than 18 of them. Individual senators apparently are afraid that if the upper chamber gets into the habit of voting cloture, it might be invoked against them sometime, And it has been obvious over past months that this Alabama Sen- ate is not near ready to give up the luxury of the filibus- ter. It has been used by all but a very few senators, and has cropped up on almost every legislative day. even if only for a short spell. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley says this may be the most filibuster-prone Senate in stale history. Beasley himself has acted at times to at least set aside the filibuster and bring up less objectionable legisla- tion. But Beasley apparently doesn't want to earn the reputation of wielding a heavy gavel, so most of the dir- ly work 1s left to ine. Thursday was not the first occasion of Vine writing his own rules when Beasley conveniently left the presi- dent's gavel in the pro tem's capable hands, If the Senate won't invoke cloture, Fine has demon- strated he will. Such actions do ruffle a few senatorial feathers, but also result in more serious problems, For example, on Thursday the action came so fast—as it usually does in these cases—that Sen. Tor: bert did not have time to utter word number one about What his proposed amendment would do. The idea is to move So quickly that no one has a chance to figure out exactly what's happening, or at least hasn't the oppor- unity to stop it {rom happening. It turned out later that ‘lorbert's amendment was a compilation of four he had previously explained to the Senate, but of course it could have ended any regulation of the small loan industry for all the senators knew. Once again Kine ruled supreme, but this time some Senate members seemed relieved that the mantel of leadership had been assumed, which is part of the rea- son he wears it so often, September 14, 1975 \f"

Wallace said Sunday he hopes to meet with heads of state of England, France and Italy and with otticials of the North Atlantic ‘Treaty Organi- zation on a Kuropean trip tentatively planned for next month. Wallace, speaking with Alabama news- writers at the Southern Governors Conference at nearby Disney World, emphasized that his foray abroad remains tentative, depending much on whether the Alabama Legislature “concludes business in a proper way’’ prior to his hoped for Oct. 11 departure date. The governor said he also hopes to meet “with people who have industries in Ala- bama,\"’ specifically executives in Germany and Belgium. He did not mention the names ot any toreign ofticials he plans to visit, but did express a de- sire to see Gen. Alexander Haig, Supreme Al- lied Commander Europe or head of NATO. Wallace did not specify what matters he wishes to discuss with the European leaders, but the trip generally has been described as a “‘fact-finding’’ mission. “The state won't bear the burden of the trip,\" Wallace said. ‘If I go, it probably will be paid for out of the campaign.” y expected bid for the Democratic presidential homination, “L’m not here as a candidate,’ Wallace said, adding that meeting participants who came trom all over the state did urge him ‘to be involved with the primary here.”’ The supporters were encouraging about his chances for victory, Wallace said, The only other out-of-conterence activity the governor has scheduled is a luncheon Speech to the Orange Juice Club in Orlando, a businessmen’s group related to the local Chamber of Commerce. Press Secretary Billy Joe Camp said, how- ever, that costs of the two-week journey may be split between the state and presidential campaign coffers, with the major portion coming from the campaign. Questioned on his feelings following last week's attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford, the governor called it ‘‘regret- table.” “You always think about it,” Wallace said. “But it's just one of those things. You can’t do anything about it. Society is going to have to do something. Wallace said persons who engage in such violent incidents often are out of prison on pa- role for similar violent crimes, adding that that’s why he wants more prison construction money in Alabama—to hold offenders behind bars. “Penologists have all come around to the opinion that rehabilitation doesn’t work,’ he said. ‘‘Electrocutions may not be a deter- rent—I think they're a deterrent—but they get rid ot somebody who needs to be gotten rid of.’’ “You get retribution, at least,”’ he said.

Wallace's comments, which included few new remarks, came during @ talk before the Orlando Orange Juice Club, a businessmen's group that opened its weekly meeting to a crowd of some 400 people warmly receptive to the governor's speech. Possibly spurred by Kissinger's talk an hour earlier to the Southern Governors Con- ference, which Wallace has attended since Friday night, the governor spent considerable speaking time on this nation’s mistakes in for- eign affairs, on how badly other countries are treating the U.S, and on the need to maintain a hard line in dealing with the Soviet Union and » other Communist governments, Asked later about his response to Kissing- er's lalk and the secretary of state's efforts to- ward detente, Wailace said he believes Kiss: inger “wants to relax tensions,” but ques- tioned whether the administration's policies are in fact accomplishing that.

        "ocr_text": "Budget Squabble Indicates Priorities © Of Public Officials By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer If the Alabama Legislature fails to adopt state budg- ets this session, it could set a precedent for the remain- ing three years of this legislative term of office. That, at least, is the view of one administration offi- cial who fears the failure to strike a compromise in 1975 may preclude a settlement of budgetary quarrels until 1979 brings a new set of faces to the legislative cham- bers. The dismal view is due partly to the usual difficulties in negotiating who gets which serving of the state mon- ey pie, but is compounded by a shorter than usual short- age in general fund dollars, plus the personal nature of this year's House-Senate feuding. Senate cutbacks in the budgets of those who are poten- tial political foes of Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley in the 1978 gu- bernatorial race have not done much to cement rela- . hans between House members and senators, expecially e those reductions include a $300,000 slice in the budget of the Alabama Forestry Commission, which boasts -House Speakgr Joe McCorquodale as its vice chairman. Even if the 1975 battle of the budget is resolved, the war will remain for continued waging in 1976, 1977, and until state officialdom comes to grips with some basic fi- nancing problems. The supply of state money failing to meet the demand for state services isn't going to be cured by whatever remedy the legislature finally may apply this session, but as has been predicted time and again by legislators, it will be a recurring illness. And considering the uncertain economic times, the symptoms likely will worsen in the future. A major problem area has been the Highway Depart- ment, funded in large part from the gasoline tax. The revenue from that tax is experiencing little growth due to higher gasoline prices, and with the price tag ex- pected to be marked up even further in the coming year, consumers could be forced into conservation measures that will further curtail money available for highway costs that are likely to continue bloating under inflation and eat up revenue even quicker. Medicaid costs have spiralled at what many legisla- tors find an unbelievable rate, the Mental Health De- partment hardly can cut back its needs due to federal court overseers, and Alabama prisons probably come nowhere near meeting the conditions expected to be mandated ultimately by the same federal judges who have found the state's elected officials incapable or at least unwilling to serve the people who elected them. The money pinch isn’t unique to Alabama, having been felt across the nation by most states. The differ- ence is that some of those other governing bodies are ae to apply long-term solutions to their fiscal trou- Fie example, in Georgia, former Gov. Jimmy Carter undertook a major government reorganization project intended to combine uncoordinated state departments into several larger agencies and cut down substantially on personnei sucking dollars from the state till, partic- ularly in the middle administrative levels, Other states have made government employe cut- backs, doing no apparent great harm to the governed. In Alabama, it seems no state officials in the execu- tive or legislative branches have even considered the possibility of searching out expendable portions of the bureaucracy. A legislative committee did pay consultants to con- duct a study regarding state employes, but its only in- lent was learning whether workers here get salaries comparable to those paid in other states. There was no study of efficiency in either labor or supervisory divi- sions, or of how many workers actually earn. the. ay: checks they receive. Also, great fanfare surrounded the announcement months ago that the State of Alabama was embarking on a wonderful new program called zero-based budg- eting, through which department heads would be r quired to totally justify their expenditures, not just tromp up to the Capitol carting money requests adding another layer of fat to their budgets. To whom they justified their budgets remains a mys- tery, since no evidence of such has appeared on Goat Hill. Expenditures, as usual, seem to be growing with little, if any, control. Some states, such as New Jersey, North Dakota and Ohio, have taken the option of raising taxes, mostly taxes on industry and commerce, although Ohio does have pending a referendum on a gasoline tax increase. In Alabama, there seems little true concern over whether the taxpayers can afford to pay more, but ex: treme concern over whether public officials can afford to demand more and not shatter their ambitions for higher office. Gov. George (. Wallace has proclaimed loudly there will be no new taxes here, at least not this year or next, while the Democratic presidential nomination is pend- ing. So the state may have to coast along till then with makeshift budgets that fund expenditures no one knows are necessary or not, then raise taxes to fund some more, Even that doesn't appear likely, however, since legis- lators, particularly senators, have said any tax increas+ es must come early in their terms of office—not in the latter two years when the public might recall such ac- tigns as they step into the voting booths in 1978.

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Security Alerted in Threat By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Secret Service agents guarding Gov. George C. Wallace since the beginning of this week got their first taste of the violence sur- rounding this particular presidential candidate Tues- day, when a threat was made on the governor's life. Col. E.C. Dothard, direc- Public Satety, characterized the threat as ‘‘routine,” and refused to give many specif- ics about the incident. He indicated that a man somewhere in North Ala- bama was overheard ‘‘mak- ing statements about the governor,’’ which apparent- ly were threatening in na- ture, Dothard said he believed the man was armed, and had forcement officers by late Tuesday afternoon, He did not indicate wheth- er the person was an Alaba- mian, or whether he was re- ported headed toward Mont- gomery. Reports of the man’s action were received here about noon, Dothard said. Dothard said threats against Gov. Wallace are not by persons making antago- nistic statements toward the governor in public. In such cases, he said, se- curity details at the Gover- nor’s Mansion and the Capi- tol office are alerted to the incident as a routine safety precaution. ; If there is a description of the person involved or of an automobile in which he is traveling, officers in the tor of the Department of for questionning. Among those undoubtedly alerted this time are the Se- cret Service agents who be- gan guarding Wallace as of 12:01 a.m. Sunday, under di- rection of a congressional committee which mandated security forces for several presidential candidates. The federal protection was ordered earlier than usual this campaign season, in part due to recent attempts not been located by law en- on President Ford's life. The agents assigned to Wallace refused Tuesday to give any information on their detail, such as the num- ber of men in Montgomery to guard the governor, where they are headquartered, or how they operate. Four agents were seen around the governor's office Tuesday afternoon, recog- nizable by the radio ear- phones they wear to keep in unusual, coming through the mail, over the telephone, and _ area attempt to locate him constant communication with each other, and by the small, gold lapel pins that serve as a private, instant identification. One stood in the main Capitol hallway outside the governor's reception room, and another protected the reception room door leading into the governor's office. The other two were seen when the shifts changed in the afternoon. October 8, 1975 \f"

(Map, Details, Page Legislature’s Last-Minute Action Provides General Fund Budge By MARCIA KUNSTEL | 0 Advertiser Staff Writer a | The Alabama Legislature worked out a final general fund budget comprornise on the last night of the 1975 regular session late Thursday, but by 1 a.m, Friday had failed to resolve wrangling over the budget to finance all aspects of public education, A conference committee of House and Senate mem: bers worked into the chaotic early morning hours on ne- fotiations over the nearly $80 million education budg- et, and legislative leaders were predicting final approv- al before the session adjourned sine die, Presiding officers of the House and Senate pulled the plug from the clocks in their respective chambers just before the official adjournment, in order to allow fur: ther effort to compromise away differences in the edu: cation ledger, One conference committee reported about 11:30 p.m, that it had been unable to reach an agreement, and a second committee was appointed to continue negotiat: ing, Members of both chambers were awaiting word from that committee early Friday morning, The general {und budget action in the Senate was pos- sible only after Lt, Gov, Jere Beasley wielded a leaden gavel to silence opponents of the last compromise pro- posal worked out by a conference committee of House =» dL ‘ Meu and Senate meers, MCSE. 4A —— The $188 million budget was approved after conferees iia > negotiated a plan to transfer nearly $9 million of edua: tad by Allee Cannea! tion fund money to finance non-education programs in # the general fund.

Ronnie Flippo's motion to reject the conference com- mittee report and require further negotiations. The lieutenant governor then called for the final vote, and the upper chamber adopted the budget by a 210 vote, Shortly before the Senale action, the House ac- cepted the compromise, 922, Final passage of the education budget was far from secure late Thursday, as the Senate sent back to the House a ledger bloated with amendments giving more money to Alabama universities Although Flippo and a few others pleaded with fellow senators to hold the line on additions, the amendments came with such rapidity that finally Beasley asked that all further proposed additions be brought to the clerk's desk, and the amendments were adopled without even being read, ; About 25 amendments were added in a single shot, with no explanation. Beasley justified the action by saying another confer- ence committee would be needed to work out House and Senate differences, and the ultimate product likely would alter the Senate version of the education budget substantially. One senator reportedly threw a few surprises into the “grab bag” of 2 unread amendments, by submitting changes thal reduced appropriations for the junior col. lege system, the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa and Auburn University. He also reportedly removed Athens College entirely {tom the budget. The move was geared toward assuring that the bill would be rewrilten in conference. Prior to the spending spree, the Senate adopled a sub- stitute budget by Bay Minette Sen. L.D. “Dick” Owen, a measure scrutinized for less than half an hour before it was approved. That reportedly altered the some $400 million educa- tion budget by reducing the amount appropriated for teacher retirement benefits and almost totally wiping out the $20 million “cushion” of a reserve fund most ex: perts say is necessary for the education system. The reductions were made up by increasing alloca tions to the junior colleges by nearly $ million, and by adding money to the universities. The budget finally approved by the Senate was un- doubtedly out of balance, but was hoped to be rewritten and passed again by both chambers before the clock ran out on the session. The Senate then went on to approve legislation im: proving state employe and teacher retirement benefits, giving state workers an annual $500 salary increase, | and granting operating funds to five private in- Stitutions—Walker County Junior College, Marion In- stitute, Talladega College, Lyman Ward Military Academy and Tuskegee Institute. Earlier in the day, prospects for passage of (he gener: al fund budget appeared dim, when members of the con- ference committee could not agree on how much to cut the general fund budget, to accommodate the $1 million | reduction in the education fund transfer, | House members wanted to alice the $149,000 allocation tothe Inte Cooperation Corntlain, which has been criticized as a campaign operation for Bensley, Conferees finally did agree to cut the commission's budget by $40,000, and also reduced what have been characterized as pork barrel amendments added to the general fund budget by the Senate earlier, These in- clude cutting $10,000 from the Ave Maria Grotto, $6,000 from the Chilton County Peach Festival, $60,000 from the Department of Court Management, $25,000 from the Commission on Aging, and $120,000 froth restoration projects of the Alabama Historical Commission. Before that compromise was reached, Gov, George C. Wallace called a late afternoon press conference to an: nounce he expected an opinion Friday from Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley authorizing him to unilaterally fund vital state functions without legislative budgets, \"T believe no branch of slate government can stop the (over-all) operations of stale government,” Wallace said. He added that the 1974-75 fiscal year budgets would be “a guideline” for expenditures, but would not be follow- | ed exclusively, If the legislature were to fail to reach a final compromise on the education budget in the waning hours of the session Thursday, it was expected Wallace would go ahead and fund education programs under au- thority of Baxley's opinion.

        "ocr_text": "Gov. Wallace Acted Alone o Fund Education Program Promises Recall Of Legislature By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace acted unilaterally to fund state education programs Friday, in the wake of legisla- tive failure to enact an education budget hours earlier. Wallace also promised to call the Alabama Legislature into special session Nov, 3 for another budget try. Armed with an opinion from Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley that he is “not only authorized, but... duty-bound, to continue all the functions of state government,” Wal- lace directed that the administration's proposed budget be followed until lawmakers replace it with a new one. The governor also said at an afternoon press confer: ence that since the education funding crisis has been re- solved, he will make his planned trip to Western Eu- rope, leaving about midnight Saturday. Baxley's opinion said the governor could not simply extend the budget for fiscal year 1974-75, which ended Sept. 30, but that he could use the appropriations in it as ‘a guide for expenditures to carry on the current oper- ations,” Rather than do that, Wallace chose to follow the budg- et he proposed for the current fiscal year, which. pro- vides a $1,000 teacher salary increase and 600 new teachers for elementary and special education. The governor said both Dr. Wayne Teague, state edu- cation superintendent, and Dr. Paul Hubert, executive secretary of the Alabama Education Association, agreed a short ‘‘cooling off period’ is needed before the lawmakers are called back into special session to try again to pass the nearly $800 million education budget. That is necessary, he said, because of “deep differ- ences that existed in the legislature.” Asked what those differences were, Wallace cited the Senate move to have the State Board of Education pur- chase for §2 million some downtown property owned by Walter Johnsey, an Alabama Power Co. vice president who attempted two years ago to construct a new build- ing on the site to lease office space to state government, Controversy surrounded the project, which Wallace and some legislators opposed, and it finally was aban- doned. Wallace also said the Senate version of the budget was “Joaded down with too many things,” apparently re- ferring to amendments doling out vast sums to state higher education institutions, Although House and Senate conferees worked for some five hours on comprotnising away differences, they remained stalemated and finally ended the 197 regular session at about 3:15 a.m. Friday, Presiding of- ficers in both chambers had stopped the clocks shortly before midnight, but House Speaker Joe McCorquodale put the plug back in the wall when it became apparent that differences were irreconcilable. The lawmakers will be called back for another try Nov. 3, Wallace said, when they also will be asked again to improve workmen's compensation benefits and to re: solve a local cigaret tax question in Jefferson County, Wallace predicted the legislature would act on all three measures within the minimum five days needed to enact legislation, Until then, schools will operate on warrants sent out Friday by Finance Director James R. Solomon, carry- ing financing through November, Teague, who called his own press conference after Wallace's session, said the state checks will finance not only the teacher pay raise, but also an 8 per cent salary increase for school bus drivers, 300 new special educa- tion teachers, 300 new primary education teachers, and better insurance benefits, The money also will help eliminate the need for school fees paid by parents, by supplying each elementary teacher with $250 and each secondary teacher with $300 for instructional materials, Asked about contentions that he endorsed the plan for purchasing Johnsey's property, Teague said he was unaware the §2 million allocation was in the Senate budget until Thursday night, “I'm opposed to purchasing land with Special Educa: tion Trust Fund money,” Teague said, noting that is the stance of the State Board of Education, “It won't be included in the budget we recommend, he Said, Prospects for quick budget passage in the special ses- sion were not all good on Friday. Both Teague and AEA’s Hubbert indicated disagreement with some areas of the administration's proposal, and the superin- tendent said the state department will begin preparing its own budget plan next week, Also, the universities are not likely to abandon all ef: lorts toward winning more dollars than proposed by Wallace, although Hubbert expressed the hope they will “exercise some restraint.” October 11, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Senate Filibusters, Johnsey Amendment Angered House By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Johnsey Building emerged again last week from the crevices of bad memories to disrupt the workings of State government, This time, the plan to construct a building to house state offices resulted in the demise of the education budget during the death throes of the 1975 regular legis- lative session. Wrapped in the leaves of the education ledger written by a few Senate members, it was a surprise package not: received gracefully by the House of Representatives. The move last week was not a renewed effort to help Walter Johnsey, the Alabama Power Co. vice president, erect a new office building to sell to the state through a long-term leasing arrangement. It was aimed rather at helping Johnsey recoup the financial losses suffered when he was forced to abandon the 1973 proposal due to strident, high-level opposition. The help was to come quietly through one small line item in the budget, mandating that the State Board of Education put out $2.8 million to relieve Johnsey of the downtown site he once hoped to develop. It did not, however, remain a quiet effort. The plan was denounced on the floor of the House when discovered, and reportedly caused bitter, back Toom arguing among House and Senate members of a conference committee assigned to write a budget com- promise acceptable to both chambers. The major figures in those arguments were Demo- polis Rep. Rick Manley and Russellville Sen. Joe Fine who, incidentally, were the two lawmakers named as the most effective by the Capitol press corps shortly be- fore the fireworks erupted. Manley was the prime opponent of removing the al- batross from Johnsey’s neck, promising the House would never capitulate and pass a budget carrying that line item. Fine just as strongly maintained the bill would never win Senate endorsement without it. Although other points of contention existed, most close to the negotiations said those stumbling blocks likely could have been removed if the Johnsey question had been settled. It was not settled, and the 36th legislative day was ga- velled to a close, leaving all public education programs without a dime to continue functioning for the next year. Why the Johnsey purchase was included in Bay ette Sen. L.D. ‘Dick’? Owen's substitute education budget, and why it was so adamantly supported by Fine remain matters of speculation. And there has been plenty of that, most of which is unprintable, involving fi- nancial wheeling and dealing, political favoritism and assorted trade-offs between official public and private investment domains. Regardless of why the issue surfaced, the fact that it did in the way it did explains a lot about why the 1975 Senate has been unmercifully criticized as one of the worst in state history. From the time the regular session began in May, it was stalled with filibusters almost daily—some of only short duration to allow time for compromising differ- ences and others that lasted several days and prevented any action in the upper chamber, Long time observers cannot remember a Senate so plagued with useless filibusters, although the tactic is by no means unique to the current Senate. What they have caused in the past, and what they sim- ilarly accomplished this year, was plugging the flow of important legislation till the final day of the session, when little time remains to closely scrutinize bills for zingers like the Johnsey purchase. Some senators, House members and others associ- ated with the legislature maintain that is the long-range purpose of the filibuster—to force quick action on a tidal wave of legislation in the Waning hours of a session. In this case the policy was furthered by Owen's hold- ing back his substitute budget proposal till the last mo- ment possible, refusing to unveil it to other senators till it was too late to learn exactly what all it contained and still have time to pass it. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley made the situation more ac- ceptable to the rest of the Senate by permitting the adop- tion of more than two dozen amendments without even having them read to the full body. Unfortunately, most senators were expecting a much different budget from Owen, one that would reduce spending on universities, so they offered amendments to return the money to in- stitutions in their home districts. Everybody got to add an ingredient, and that finally was what made the broth unpalatable to the House. Most of the problem areas likely can and will be re- solved when the lawmakers return for another crack at the education budget in a special session beginning Nov. 3. The time factor won't be so critical as it was in the last hours of the regular session, and tempers should be re- stored to a cooler state. Another attempt in the Senate to make the education budget a Johnsey relief bill, however, likely will result in a continued House-Senate stalemate and the abdica- tion of legislative authority in favor of gubernatorial fiat in the expenditure of state resources.

        "ocr_text": "New Optimism Marks Wallace's Latest Bid for Presidency By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George Corley Wallace is about to make official another presidential campaign, but this time his bid for the nation’s highest office is buoyed on a new wave of op- timism missing from previous efforts. Whether Wallace actually expects to be successful probably will never be known—some close friends say the governor would be frightened and dismayed should his election appear imminent—but his chances of hav- ing at least a significant impact on the outcome of 1976 race seem greater than ever, His campaign is the best financed, with no sign that the flow of virtually nickle and dime contributions will dwindle soon. His issues, including the strangling middle class, busing, and the overwhelming federal bu- reaucracy, remain at the forefront of the American ex- perience. His “respectability” appears not to have di- mished since it surprisingly became a matter of public record in several 1972 primaries. His campaign ma- chine has profited from past mistakes and is credited with running on some of the more sophisticated cogs and wheels operational in the current crop of political organizations. More than one observer of the national political scene has predicted Gov. Wallace will roll into the Democratic National Convention next summer with a minimum 20 per cent of the delegates. Not enough to win, but enough to deal. With all those plusses, it would be easy for Wallace and his promoters to ignore the certain hazards of the 1976 campaign trail, to forget that many other candi- dates in the past have been unpleasantly surprised by unexpected whims of the voters, to misgauge the se- riousness with which the biggest political sweepstakes of the country is taken. An example of the possible surprises in store was seen on a recent visit to a high school in a small, upstate New York village, where seniors from several social studies ciasses were discussing the Alabama governor. There was little sympathy for the Wallace candidacy, and a multitude of pointed questions about exactly what is the condition of the State of Alabama, where his ad- ministration has held power for 10 of the past 12 years. The students, and their teachers, were not favorably impressed with the vital statistics on average income, school conditions and expenditures, housing conditions, and other facts of life here. One teacher, in speaking of the governor's thrust of appeal, went so far as to suggest a comparison between Wallace and Hitler, The comment and reaction would not have been sur- prising had this been a New York City suburb or a re- treat for the artsy-craftsy liberal set, : It was not, The town was a poor, conservative mill town, where the voters already have shown their anti- pathy to more taxes-more government service—the basic plank for the Wallace stand—through actions such as turning down a recent school bond issue. Not to claim these students reflected the majority thought of the entire town. But many of them will be vot- ing themselves in 1976, and most probably did reflect parental opinions which have sifted down to them through dinner table conversation. It may have been an isolated incident, born of political peculiarities of this area, but such unanticipated reac: tions have been known to result in stange voting trends. Perhaps the most interesting factor was the students’ concern over what's going on in Alabama. They are not the only ones turning their sights to the southland these days to find out what this fellow Wallace has been up to for the past decade or so. Practically any time an Alabamian with some knowl: edge of politics and government steps into foreign northern territory, the conversation quickly is con- sumed with George Wallace—his health, his chances as a national candidate, his record as governor. The health and record questions also are the ones being most actively pursued by writers for the national newspapers and magazines, who periodically invade the state to suck every possible tidbit of information from those living in the Alabama situation. Already a number of moderately to highly critical ar- ticles have appeared, and more undoubtedly are on the way, including some major works of book length, Wallace himself also has been more seriously ques- tioned over past months, now that he is considered a serious candidate, Several long-time Wallace observers have commented that the governor has been more re- strained in his views lately, since what might have seemed at the time to be innocuous statements have bal- looned into nationwide controversies. That can be expected to continue. Virtually every nook and cranny of Alabama government likely will be scrutinized by outsiders, with some reports of the find- ings not unlikely to be political bombshells, Some will be fair, some may not. But Alabama probably should prepare for the in- vasion, a8 campaigning heats up in the early months of next year. November 2, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Johnsey Property Once Again Leaves Education in Limbo ‘By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The question of the week, one that may determine whether public education in Alabama is properly fun- ded for the rest of this fiscal year, is whether the state has a legal and moral obligation to developer Walter F. Johnsey. The issue of spending $2 million of education money to buy a one-block parcel of Capitol Hill property from Johnsey went down the drain in tandem with the entire ~ education budget on the final night of the regular ses- sion last month, and ominous gurgling sounds signal the imminence of a repeat performance in the current spe- cial session. Now that Johnsey and his Alabama Senate supporters have bothered to explain some specifics of the proposed land purchase, at least the finger of blame is pointing in more directions, including the immediate vicinity of Gov. George C. Wallace. Wallace maintains he has been faultless since the lid first popped off this controversy two years ago, when Johnsey initially constructing a 14story of- fice building for lease and eventual sale to the state, on the site now being considered for purchase. Those supporting the sale gloss over the merits of the present deal—the price, the location, the utility, the fact that the State Board of Education says it doesn't want the land—in emphasizing their contention that Johnsey has been morally, legally and financially wronged by the state through the convoluted series of events which led to his dropping the office building plan and being stuck with the block of land. Those supporters contend that Wallace gave tacit ap- proval to the 1973 building proposal in at least three sep- arate talks with Johnsey, before the governor thwarted the plan by refusing to sign the leasing contract neces- sary for Johnsey to begin construction, a contract ap- proved by a majority vote of the Alabama Building Commission. What they say, the ‘‘they’’ being Johnsey and a small group of senators, and they have said it in public meet- ings, is that Wallace’s initial acceptance was turned 180 degrees by Montgomery realtors and property owners who continue to make lucrative deals by leasing for state office use small b scattered throughout the city, deals ‘that would end should the state collect these many ts into one central location. What some add privately is that those realtors are friends or associates of Gerald Wallace, and owe their leasing success to timely intervention by the governor's brother. Wallace denies that, saying he never gave even tacit approval to Johnsey’s office building proposal, that from the time it was first suggested he was opposed, or at least maintained a neutral stance, contending he held the legislature always has and should continue to make decisions on a project of such magnitude. Wallace denies that, saying he never gave even tacit approval to Johnsey’s office building proposal, that from the time it was first suggested he was opposed, or at least maintained a neutral stance, contending he held the legislature always has and should continue to make decisions on a project of such magnitude. No one probably ever will know what actually as said in those private conversations between Wallace, John- sey, et. al., whether the governor did pledge no opposi- tion or whether Johnsey and his friends simply assumed too much from a non-committal reaction. Those not involved in state government during the 1973 accusations, denials, confrontations and explosive building commission meetings, including a majority of the Alabama House, where opposition to the present land purchase is centered, feel little or no obligation to even partially bail out Johnsey now by using state dol- lars to buy the land he purchased under assumption the office building would be built there. In fact, traditional House-Senate antipathies have deepened over the surreptitious manner in which a few ‘senators attempted to secure the land purchase by qui- etly slipping the $2 million allocation into the Senate version of the education budget in the final hours of the final night of the regular session. Even some senators who believe Johnsey got a raw deal from the state still question whether many aspects of the current land purchase plan are proper, especially considering the speculative nature of his initial business investment. Opelika Sen. C.C. Bo” Torbert has produced docu- mentation that of the $2 million Johnsey would receive $296,675.93 for interest he paid on loans to purchase three-quarters of the block of land and to obtain an op- tion for purchase of the remaining quarter block. Anoth- er $24,000 would go to Montgomery realtor Paul Corwin, a partner of Johnsey in the office building scheme who would receive the money as a real estate commission for handling the option. Another $25,000 would be paid to an unnamed attorney in legal fees for his work in securing the option. A salient point no one has yet made in public is that Johnsey made the loan to buy the three-quarters block of land in May of 1973, some four months before the building commission took any formal action on the question in September, nearly six months before any commissioners affixed their signatures to the contract. That would seem to underscore the purely speculative nature of Johnsey’s investment and somewhat lessen the obligation of the state to assume costs he agreed to bear before the building commission endorsed his pro- posal. Until the Senate majority backs off its stand that the obligation is there, or until the House majority recog- nizes its existence, it can be expected that public educa- tion in Alabama will remain in limbo without any offi- cial legislative funding.

Wallace will meet Tuesday night with national campaign operatives from across the country, in a strategy session preceding the Wednesday morning formal an- nouncement of his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. A campaign source said 250-300 people will gather at Hampton Hall for a private dinner and briefing session conducted by Wallace and top person- nel in the national campaign appa- ratus. process of selecting delegates to the ‘Democratic National Convention next Summer. Spouses alsc have been in- vited to the meeting, expected to last less than two hours. Earlier, the Tuesday night function was characterized as partially a get- acquainted session for supporters who have never met Wallace, aimed at giv- ing them the opportunity to see the governor in person, speak with him, and generally develop a closer contact with the candidate on whose behalf they likely will spend long hours stum- “This is not a bunch of political fat- cats or cronies or anything like that,”’ the source said, “but people who are going to get the job done.” Paid staff persons, local volunteers, and those serving as chairmen or coor- dinators for the campaign machine in their home states are to hear Wallace outline how he expects to campaign for the Democratic nomination. ‘The purpose is to have a very frank meeting with Gov. Wallace about the future of the campaign,”’ the staff source said. ‘‘Strategy will be dis- cussed, and the governor will convey to these people, who are very impor- ping their home states over the coming months, Although news media photograph- ers will be permitted brief entrance to the session, reporters may be totally excluded, . The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday night to take advantage of the presence of the non-Alabama cam- paigners, in town for the governor's announcement Wednesday morning. That affair is expected to differ vas- tly from the closed-door meeting Tues- day night, with members of the gener- al public invited to attend, and the bas- November 11, tant in the campaign, what he intends to do over the next eight-month period. It won't be a locker-room pep talk.” It was stressed that most local Wal- lace supporters, other than those ac- tively involved in the national cam- paign, have not been invited, since the thrust of the session is informing out- of-state workers how the campaign is expected to proceed once the governor formally declares his candidacy. In addition to the top campaign per- sonnel from other states, also present will be those otherwise involved in the ic aim being what is described as stag- ing ‘a media event,” Preliminaries including in- troduction of the Wallace family will begin at 8:45 a.m. at the Governor’s House Motel, followed by a brief an- nouncement from Wallace, antici- pated to begin at 9 am. and to take about five minutes, The governor then will be open to questions fired by representatives of most major national news media. Wallace is expected to respond to questions for about half an hour, after which the session will end. 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace to Legitimize Campaign By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace once again will legitimize his national campaign machine Wednesday, when he for- mally declares his candida- cy for the Democratic presi- dential nomination, an event likely to bring little, if any, immediate change to the governor or his campaign. At the 8:45 a.m. press con- ference Wallace is expected to reissue his cry that the American middle class must be rescued, and likely will add a remark or two about ‘‘liberal media’’ efforts to stymie his mission. Wallace said in a tele- Phone interview Tuesday that he expects to announce plans to take his campaign to most states, though not all, and to keep his personal stumping to a minimum. “To run an active cam- paign in all of them during the period of time involved is impossible,’ he said, referr- ing to logisitical difficulties of travel in a wheelchair. ‘‘But the people know me and know the issues al- ready.”’ His issue is the economic survival of the middle class, which he says is threatened by the taxing growth of a fed- eral government that sup- ports too many unneeded welfare programs and lets the rich slip off the tax hook through innumerable _ looap- holes. — The governor likely will be asked whether he seriously expects to win, whether he actually wants to win, and whether he will take the third-party route should the Democratic Party again re- buff him. He will say yes to the first two, and won't speculate much on the third, although he likely will hint that a third party candidacy is possible, should the Democratic hier- archy deprive him of the nomination. “IT wouldn’t be involved if I didn’t expect to win,’’. Wal- lace said Tuesday, ‘‘al- though I recognize that any candidate running for this high office has many ob- stacles to overcome. If I didn’t want to win, I wouldn't run.”’ The latter has been dis- puted, even by those who have been close to the gover- nor throughout his political career. Although Wallace’s cam- paign staff is, in fact, con- centrating on winning dele- gates to the Democratic Na- tional Convention next sum- mer, operatives also are moving to assure that a third-party bid will be pos- sible in the fall by maintain- ing contact with and coordi- nating those groups now se- curing ballot position for No- vember. November 12, 1975 His Democratic candidacy taken seriously, however, “spoiler’’ than as a potential victor, a candidate who will draw sufficient votes from others to wreak chaos at the convention. As a candidate taken ser- iously, for whatever reason, Wallace has come under closer scrutiny than ever be- fore, and criticisms of his record as governor, of his physical condition, of his so- lutions to the nation’s domes- tic problems and of his stands on foreign relations policy are appearing with in- creasing frequency. “They're after me,'’ Wal- lace said of the media, claiming news reporters are and him alligned with liberals, both groups are against “TIT will be attacked more than any other candidate,”’ he said, ‘‘because the _ liber- als, the liberal media, can- not stand the fact that some- one has a constituency of the middle class that’s fed up with their (liberals’) guide- lines and schemes that have taken money from the people’s pockets and thrown it to the four corners of the earth, and given it to those who don’t deserve it.’’ The governor obviously is bitter over some of the criti- ques. “The buildup already all over the country is that they're going to attack Wal- lace with a vengeance,”’ he said. “They can’t understand a person from the middle class, without graduating from their ranks, being able to have a constituency and the support I have,’’ he said. “This is a people's move- ment, not a politicians’ movement.”’ Wallace is not expected to personnally take his people’s movement to the people im- mediately. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Cheers Greet Wallace Bid By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace announced his fourth presi- dential bid Wednesday with a new spurt of his old cam: paigning spirit, then took his first look at the campaign machine he hopes will carry him to the White House. Wallace's afternoon tour of his campaign headquar- ters on the eighth floor @f Montgomery's Executive Building was a subdued get-acquainted visit, in marked contrast to the earlier scene where a cheering crowd of some 400 supporters greeted his pledge to ‘see the Democratic Party returned to the American people.” ‘Lam entering this campaign for the purpose of win- ning the nomination and winning the presidency of the United States,” Wallace said in the opening comments of his declaration of candidacy. “I am able lo wage an active campaign in these United States and shall do so.” With an animation reminiscent of his earlier days as a presidential and gubernatorial campaigner, with a spark missing from his public pronouncements of the (Related stories, pictures, pages 2, 24) last two years, Wallace charged the Democrats lost the presidency in the past two elections “because the ultra- liberals gaine’ advantage of the conventions.” “Therefore, the people in the Democratic Party were forced to vote ‘against,’ instead of ‘for,\"” he said. “I am going to give the people in this country who are Demo- crats an opportunity to vote ‘for’ a candidate in Novem: ber 1976.\" The domestic issue in this presidential campaign, he said, is the economic survival of a middle class bur- dened with supporting a federal bureauracy helping those who refuse to help themselves, a bureaucracy that has failed to demand proper financial backing from the rich who can afford to provide it, In the realm of foreign relations, Wallace said the overriding issue is ‘to make this nation strong so that we shall be respected throughout the length and breadth of this world,” Wallace said his message to the traditional Demo- media, which Wallace probably will do in most states, requiring substantial travel and face-to-face contact with the voters, a strenuous campaign style for a candi- date in a wheelchair. On issues questions, Wallace criticized the recent United Nations resolution equating Zionism with rac: ism, saving he long has held the U.N. “is a no-account outfit . . in the hands of enemies of the United States.” New York City's financial dilemma, he said, was prompted by “profligate spending.” He predicted the city “can get its house in order,” but indicated he would favor some type of federal aid should New York verge on defaulting. Several times during his short announcement Wal- lace said his health can withstand the rigors of active campaigning, and the crowd of supporters booed later when a reporter asked whether the governor would sub- mit to a physical examination by a board of independent doctors. November 13, crats is ‘‘that you have an opportunity, through me as your candidate in the primaries, to take back the party from the ultra-liberal left who have led us into this mess that we find ourselves in domestically and in foreign policy,” Responding to reporters’ questions, the governor dis- counted a third party candidacy, saying he is ‘‘con- cerned and interested in moving the Democratic Party back to the people.” He indicated that simply losing the nomination would not prompt a third party race, although he promised that a replay of the 1972 Democratic Convention would have different results, . “If they run me out of the convention,” he said, “that’s a different story.” Wallace would not say exactly which of the 33 pri- maries he will enter, but he did rule out activity in the New Hampshire primary, and referred to likely en- trance in the second primary, in Massachusetts. New Hampshire is a difficult state to blita with the Wallace said that suggestion is an insult to some of the best doctors in the nation, who already have pronounced him fit, “But if all the other candidates want to submit to the board, all right,\" he said. Several hours after the brief announcement, made amidst flowers, palms and banners carrying the cam- paign slogan of ‘Trust The People,” the governor paid a much quieter visit to his national cémpaign headquar- ters in downtown Montgomery. That was Wallace's first look at the place where strategy, fund-raising and related campaign operations have centered for more than a year, and occasioned his first viewing of the film shown at organizational meet- ings held throughout the nation. The theme of the movie, \"A New Day For America,” follows the basic lines of his declaration of candida- cy—that the forgotten masses plagued by crime, busing and government interference in all phases of their lives can be heard by actively supporting Wallace and can bring in 1976 ‘‘a rebirth of all that freedom means,\" 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "udget Still Locked in Conflict; Another Session | in Talking Stages Tempers Flare. On Both Sides By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Legislature finally adopted a $796 mil- lion education budget late Thursday, but a possible ex- ecutive amendment by Gov, George C. Wallace to re- duce spending and unprecedented adjournment moves cast a shadow over the final outcome of the budget is- sue, Senators adjourned sine die, ending the session, but the House refused to concur with that action by the re- quired midnight closing hour, so the Senate will be forced to return for further deliberation, probably on Monday, The House refusal was seen as a means to al- low Wallace to offer proposed changes, and to allow the lawmakers to act on them. Tempers flared between the two chambers late Thursday, as members of both charged the other side was inflexible, was trying to run the state solo, was un- willing to. compromise. In an unusual, perhaps unprecedented action, the House of Representatives adopted a minority report of a conference committee of House and Senate members assigned to work out budget differences, Although five members of the six-member committee had signed a compromise version, Centreville Rep. Walter Owens presented his one-man proposal to make nearly $5.8 million of the appropriations conditional, meaning they would be released only if the governor found revenue was sufficient to support them. Owens objected that the conference committee budg: et left only a $199 million “cushion,” or unappropriated surplus, and said hig plan would raise that sum to $19.7 million, The original House budget left a $28 million sur. plus, which House members say will be needed next year because tax revenues supporting education serv- ices are growing at a slower rate each year. This year a §130 million surplus was available to sup. plement the revenues that will be generated for educas tion functions. Without a similar supplement next year, budget officials have predicted the amount available for education will be drastically less, and the program will have to be cut, Advertiser Photo by Mark Chesnutt Conference Members Owens, Joe McCorquodale, Hugh Merrill, Rick Manley Confer After extensive House debate, during which even the two House conferees who signed the report admitted their revervations over ils provisions, the House finally voled 6344 to adopt Owens’ report, rather than that of the committee, Many of the allocations he would make conditional would pay to replace schools destroyed by fires or other- wise unusable, and some House members in districts slated for the replacements objected to the move, Qwens’ argument that the legislate next year will be forced to cut back the education program or to raise taxes won the majority sentiment, Senate members were irate upon learning of the House action, terming it illegal, and adopting a resolu thon asking the Alabama Supreme Court to rule on ts validity November 14, 1975 They were especially algered because most believed the major objections of House members had been re- moved earlier in the day, when developer Walter F.

George C. . Wallace requested and leav- ing a cloud over future fi- nancing of state education programs. Wallace expressed dis- appointment over being re- buffed, a development some aides characterized as a ma- jor defeat, but said he has no choice other than accepting the will of the legislature. “I do hope the next legisla- ture will brace itself for being realistic,’’ Wallace said, ‘‘because we'll either have to cut back some pro- grams or have new taxes.” Although the House on Monday night had adopted Wallace's $8.8 million budg- | et reduction, the Senate re-' ‘fused by a 21-11 vote to con- cur Tuesday. Senators then voted 20-12 to override the executive veto resulting. from failure to adopt the gov- ' ernor’s proposed amend- ment, leaving House mem- ' bers in the uncomfortable | position of having to back off ° their earlier stand or kill the | ' entire budget on the last le- gal day of the special ses- sion. The House backed off. After a test vote showing a ‘majority of House members reluctantly would take the Senate position and not cut back the appropriation, the membership then voted 57-37 to concur with the Senate, and by a 57-39 tally to over- ride the veto. ‘That was four votes more than needed to override. Debate in both chambers was long and in some cases impassioned, including pre- dictions of dire financial con- sequences interspersed with angry jibes at the ad- ministration for transfer- , Ting education funds earlier this summer and charges in both houses that the other had been irresponsible and unwilling to compromise. The pros and cons did not line up in any usual pattern, with administration floor : leaders in both chambers di- viding sentiments. In fact, the House administration team, which had actively so- licited support for Wallace's amendment Monday night, was conspicuously missing from debate Tuesday. Indications had surfaced early that senators would deny Wallace his wishes, but the outcome of the House re- action remained uncertain November 19, 1975 until the votes were cast and tallied in the red and green lights of the electronic voting machine which physically dominates the lower cham- ber. Antagonism between the House and Senate, already at a high pitch after months of legislative wrangling, likely would have become devastating had the House balked and refused to ac- quiesce to the Senate’s de- mand, leaving only dim chances of budget com- promise in another special session. Basic arguments for Wal- lace's reduction revolved around predictions that in- sufficient funds will be avail- able next year to maintain education services at the current level, unless a hefty surplus remained to supple- ment new revenues. Opponents of the cut stres- sed the Wallace plan was unfair and not based on need, since it would have re- duced spending 2 per cent’ across the board, except tor teachers . salaries. The sala- ry account.-would have lost funding for incremental pay raises based on a teacher's extra years of education, but would have maintained the $1,000 annual raise for all teachers. The budget finally passed carries both the. $1,000 and the incremental raises. million for the state's basic elementary and secondary education program, a 51.8 per cent increase over last year. Junior colleges were granted $28.4 million, a 40.8 per cent increase, and voca- tional-technical schools got $22.1 million, 62.8 per cent above last year's allocation. Alabama’s four-year uni- versities received a total of $171.5 million for an over all 35.6 per cent increase. Although intial revenue es- timates show the budget as passed would leave about a $14 million surplus for use in the 1976-77 education appro- priation, revisions revealed Tuesday indicate the figure may lie in the $11 million to $12 million range. The amount of sur- plus—and the spending amendments which reduced it in both the House and Sen- ate—did ‘not emerge as a ma- jor point of contention until late in the months-long budg- et hassle. The earlier House- Senate controversy over purchasing for $2 million a block of Capitol Hill land from developer Walter John- sey was set aside when John- sey withdrew his proposal. That had been character- ized as the basic reason the two chambers could not reach budget agreement during the regular session which ended last month, but the other problems quickly arose to protract the special session as soon as the land argument was quieted. \f"

If the voters in Anniston approve a new three-mill - properly tax to improve local education programs in the same referendum, but are denied the opportunity to bet: ~ ter educate their children because the tax fails in the rest of the state, they, too, can thank the legislature, That long ballot and lack of local control over local issues stem from the anachronistic Alabama Con- stitution, which the legislature has failed to sig- nificantly reform since the 1800's, The most recent fail- ure came this summer, when comprehensive proposals for revision were offered but never seriously addressed by most’ lawmakers. The legislature has not totally neglected the need to write a 20th century organic law for the running of a 20h century state, since it did approve one major revision in 1973, which revamped Alabama's system of justice through a new judicial article to the constitution, That, however, came mainly because some of the stale's most politically powerful judges—including Ala- bama Supreme Court Chief Justice Howell Hef- lin—mounted a high-pressure campaign to secure its passage. The rest of the constitution, parts of which affect the lives of Alabamians as vitally as does the structure through which justice is meted, has remained prac- tically untouched.

So far only Birmingham multi-millionaire Hugh Mor- row Jr., an investment bank- er, has been charged with bribery or attempted bribe- ry in the scheme which re- portedly involved payment of an initial $10,000 to Eutaw State Rep. George Clark, who was asked to push for the appointment of three Greene County men to the new race track commission to be created there. Sources said state law affi- cers are looking for accom- plices partly on the basis of Morrow's using the word “we'’ in his Monday night conversation with Clark, ~ which was tape recorded due M¢ to Clark’s early reporting of the bribery attempt. The investigation is ex- pected to be wide-ranging und will include efforts to. so- licit further information from the men Clark report- edly was asked to select for the commission: Eutaw Po- lice Chief Ceci] Rhodes, busi- nessman Howard Brown and Isadore Branch, brother of Greene County Probate Judge William McKinley Branch. Other sources, said Wednesday that Morrow himself made initial contact with Clark, a lawyer and freshman legislator, several weeks ago. Clark imme- diately contacted the attor- ney general’s office, they said, and set up the moni- tored liaison with Morrow Monday night. That occured at a midtown ‘Moatgomery mete! -where- Morrow reportedly handed over to Clark an envelope containing the $10,000 in $100 bills. Clark was to receive an- other $41,000 later, plus an annual retainer of $20,000 for cooperating. | Morrow was arrested by state and local police in the motel parking lot, as he left the meeting with Clark that lasted les8 than half an erzaneaereab me refused permission for a search.

The amendment to the order, expected to be drawn and signed soon, will make the governor committee chairman, according to sources in Wallace's office, Now the lieutenant governor receives an official com: pensation of $300 a month, a8 do legislators, when the legislature is not in session, because the legislative jobs are considered only part time, Beasley, however, cam- paigned on a pledge of being a fulltime leutenant gov. ermor, and has made various attempts to secure addi- tional compensation, Even though Wallace never has appointed the olher committee members, Beasley apparently could have been drawing the daily pay since the order was issued Aug. 6, according to state finance official, Beasley reportedly has discussed the pay provision With the state comptroller in recent weeks, but never made an official request for the money and has not re- ceived any, Although Beasley supported the reorganization plan throughout legislative activity in late summer and fall—nhen be was drawing legislative pay—he recently has stepped up promotion of it.

Atty. Gen, Bill Baxley, a political foe of Beasley, wil be named to the executive committee, along with Beas- ley and MeCorquodale. All three are considered asp Beasley has not formally requested that Wallace im: plement the August order by appointing the other com mittee members, but privately he has questioned why the action has not been taken, speculating Wallace is in terested in activites other than governing the State of Alabama or is responding from pressure by stale bu: reaucrats who fear a massive reorganization would eliminate their jobs, The governor has not been an ardent proponent of any reorganization study, saying the state has fewer agencies and departments than the state of Georgia now has, aller a major reorganization move there, He malt Lins litle would be saved throu a similar approach here, sinee major expenses are ted {0 vital human re Source functions which hardly can be cut back or other wise see Savings elleced by changing their structures, Bally why Wallace signed the August order re mains in question, although speculation revelves attund a possible agreement that Beasley would ass the administration in ils legislative program in elu for creation of the renrganizatin committee rants to the governors chair in 118, Wallace reportedly decided to amend (he order be cause he believed Beasley should not get a fulltime salary for the reorganization work, and because he feaeds the Uewlenan gerne woud use te com ‘mittee appara for a campaign vetice over Ue nxt (wo years, The order inially required the committee to study government reorganization possibilities until 1977, when it would report its findings to the legislature Throughout that time Beasley would have drawn the pa), Wallace is altering that, too, requiring a fina re port be submited to the 1916 regular session, which con l nN \f"

        "ocr_text": "Sure Het Pot of Gold Awaits Greene Track Operators By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Whoever operates the Greene County race track will enjoy some financial advantages found at few tracks in the nation. An unusually high percentage of the bets placed, plus all the “breaks” and “outs” will go into the pockets of the person or group winning the license to build and op- erate the dog racing track. The yet to be named county racing commission will decide who does get that license, and the naming of com: missioners apparently is what prompted the scandal leading to the arrest of Birmingham multi-millionaire Hugh Morrow last week. Morrow was charged with bribing or attempting to bribe State Rep. George Clark of Eutaw, the young leg islator who will play the predominant role in selecting the racing commissioners, Morrow was arrested immediately after he met with Clark and allegedly gave him a $10,000 down payment on $51,000 he was to receive, in addition to a $20,000 a year retainer for the rest of his life, in return for which Clark was to select the three commissioners Morrow wished, Morrow is to appear in Montgomery County Court Monday for a preliminary hearing, Once that commission finally is created and deter- mines who will run the track, the operators can look for- ward to what might turn into a most lucrative venture. Of every dollar bet at the track, 18 per cent will come off the top to support the operation, the operators and some local government services. The racing commis: sion will get 4 per cent, which will be funneled to local municipalities, county education, law enforcement, public health care and other such services. The remaining 14 per cent will be held by the operator, to pay fixed costs of running the track and in profits, At the Mobile Park, the only dog track in Alabama, 18 per cent also is skimmed from the top of all bets placed. The Mobile owners, however, keep only 10 per cent of that, turning the other 8 per cent over to the Mobile race commission. When the racing season closed in Mobile Saturday night, some $50 million was expected to have been wa: gered this year Of that amount, $5 million will have ac- crued to the owners, under the 10 per cent plan, Sources familiar with the racing scene estimate the Greene County track likely won't fare quite so well as the Mobile park, taking in perhaps half that amount due {o its rural location some distance from major popu- lation centers, In Greene County, however, the owners also will keep all of what are termed the “breaks’ and “outs,” which are split in Mobile between the owners there and vari- ous public agencies, “Outs” money is unclaimed, uncashed or otherwise abandoned winning bets. For example, sometimes per- sons betting on a race lose their ticket, so cannot claim the amount due them for betting right. The “breaks” accrue in figuring the distribution of the betting pool among the winners. All money bet, ex- cept the 18 per cent, goes into pools divided among the winners, The odd cents of the redistributions are called: “preaks to a dime,\" and this also will be retained by the Greene County track ofners, The owners additionally will have the normal admis- sion fees and profits from the sale of food and liquor to help offset operating costs, The future for the franchise holder isn’t all rosy, since a certain degree of risk exists for the track operator. Talk of a similar track in Birmingham still is making the rounds, and, should one ever be built there it likely would detract substantially from the success of the Greene County venture, Also, no one knows exactly how well the Greene County dog track will do in attracting spectators and bettors who will have to travel some dis- tanice just for an evening or afternoon at the races.

        "ocr_text": "WNJrallace Bid to Roll Imto Miassachusetts By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace will kick off a heavy sched- ule of presidential campaign activity Jan. 9 in Massachu- setts, in all likelihood ap- pearing in racially-torn Bos- ton. Although his exact sched- ule has not been confirmed yet, a Wallace spokesfnan said the governor plans to take his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to Massachu- setts Jan. 9 and 10, Boston and Springfield likely will be visited. The Massachusetts trip is expected to finally initiate serious campaigning by Wallace, who till now has made only sporadic forays out of state for speaking en- gagements and other ap- pearances, usually at the request of the host group, not on the initiative of the cam- paign organization. Although other candidates have been running hard down the campaign trail for months, Wallace has main- tained a distance from na- tional political activities. He either has been tied down in Alabama with gubernatorial duties, including tending to the legislature till last month, or simply has said most people know him and his stand so he doesn’t need to campaign as actively as the others. Wallace did make a two- week trip to Western Europe ‘interview show in October, but even that was billed as partially related to state government, partially to national politics. The Massachusetts trip will be Wallace’s first jaunt connected exclusively to the presidential campaign, and will be followed by a fairly tight schedule of politicking for the next seven months, till the July Democratic Na- tional Convention in New York. From Massachusetts the governor will go directly to Washington for an appear- ance on the television news “Face The Nation’ on Jan. 11. He will return to Mont- gomery after that, but is ex- pected to spend substantial time throughout the remain- der of January and February campaigning in Florida and again in Massachusetts, two states with early primaries in March. Wallace also will cam- paign some those months in Mississippi, which begins its caucus method of choosing convention delegates in late January. Also in February, the gov- ‘ernor likely will make a few initial trips to other northern states which have April pri- maries, including Illinois and Pennsylvania. Although Wallace has pub- lically played down his chan-- ces of success in Massachu- setts, saying the eastern lib- eral news media has ‘‘propa- gandized’’ the voters against mote him, he should receive a warm reception at the least in Boston, the city wrenched with violence in past months over school busing to pro- integration. Wallace and his campaign operatives are maintaining a low key stance on chances of success in Massachusetts, apparent- ly so any size vote will look good in the March 2 primary. Massachusetts is the only state which gave a majority vote to the Democrats liber- al presidential candidate in 1972, Sen. George McGovern. The governor is expected to spend substantial time in Florida over the following weeks, in preparation for the March 9 primary there. His national staff has been organizing in the Sunshine State for months, but so has the campaign apparatus of former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, who will be Wal- lace’s main opponent in that State. Carter has shown surpris- ing strength there in polls and through his public recep- tion, and he is promoting that primary as a Carter- Wallace stand off that will be a key to future success else-| where. Most other candidates have taken a hands off posi- tion on Florida, leaving it primarily a two-man battle between the southerners. Political observers are predicting that even a good showing by Carter, not a win, would prime his campaign and pump substantial new dollars into the Georgian's coffers. Although Wallace has at- tempted to brush off the Car- ter offensive as carrying little importance, the fact that he plans to campaign so actively in Florida belies that casual attitude. In Mississippi, Wallace is expected to come down hard on Democratic leaders who opted for a caucus delegate Selection process, failing to take advantage of a legisla- tive act letting the party choose whether to select delegates by primary or caucus-convention. Wallace went to Mis- Sissippi to promote passage of that legislation, as he did elsewhere earlier this year in support of pending switch- es to primaries. Wallace Says party leaders at- tempted to squelch such movements toward primary votes, because he usually does better when the public makes decisions. rather than the party chiefs. Carter also reportedly is enjoying unexpected sup- port among Mississippi par- ' ty leaders. December 23, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Terrorism Closes In, Deadly Counterpoint To Bicentennial Hope By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Terrorism is coming closer to home. The atrocious bombing at LaGuardia Airport in New York last week, followed almost immediately by bomb threats called to other airports across the nation, per- haps for the first time raised the consciousness of U.S. citizens to a proper level of concern over the violence happening in our world. The accounts of bombings in England and Ireland and the Mideast don’t mean much, hardly register, to those of us here who maybe shae our heads in wonder, mumble a few words of amazement about crazies in foreign lands, then promptly turn to the comics or tune into the first family hour show on the tube, It’s quickly and easly for- otten ‘ The picture is a bit clearer after last week. It is for me anyway. I was driving from the Cleveland Hopkins Airport to my family’s home in Ohio when first news reports of the New York tragedy came over the car radio. The plane that was to have brought me back South that night had been grounded in Chicago, so it was back to the suburbs to await another flight the next morning. Later that night I learned I had barely missed the evacuation of the Cleveland terminal, prompted by one of those telephoned bomb threats that turned out to be exactly that—a threat and nothing more. The vague uneasiness felt that night while waiting for the morning plane was heightened some by the fact that former Israeli Premier Golda Meir was in Cleveland for a speech and brief visit, coupled with initial speculation that the Palestine Liberation Organization had set the ex- plosives that ripped through LaGuardia. I didn’t think about it much the next morning during the half hour ride back to the Cleveland airport, but the horror hit as I sat at my terminal gate before boarding, reading grisly newspaper accounts of the New York dis- aster. Innocent people decapitated. Bystanders walking through the rubble over dripping arms and legs no long- er attached to torsos. Pools of blood standing through- out the baggage area where the dynamite exploded. It was much easier to visualize than it might have been in another setting, having just walked upstairs from the baggage area of Hopkins Airport, sitting at that moment before a heavy plate glass window just like the ones at LaGuardia that shattered and went flying for yards, cutting through whatever stood in the path. In- cluding bodies. I wasn't seriously frightened though, had no thoughts of cancelling the trip or immediately putting as much distance as possible between me and the airport. It was the kind of incident that, if you let it get to you, probably will keep you locked in your house for the rest of your life, with only minimal ventures to the outside world to eke out a living and acquire the basic necessities. What the LaGuardia bombing did prompt is some thought of what life is like on other parts of this planet, and how it might change for us here as we become drawn into those other battles in other places, and, as we simply come of age in our 200th year as a nation. In this country we have managed to maintain an in- nocence of experience with the kind of slaughter seen in New York-dast-week and in places; like Northern Ireland “for years. There were the sporadic SDS bombings in the late ‘60s, but those mostly were crimes against proper- ty, protests against the government and the system which took few lives and generally weren’t intended to destroy the blameless. Then the country’s collective sensibility has been jolted perodically with the assassi- nations or attempts on the lives of prominent public fig- ures. But those too were aimed at symbols of society's frus- trations, apparently were the work of persons who sim- ply couldn’t cope, couldn’t make it like the rest of us and usually were branded deranged. What is bothersome now is that many people here are having a harder’ time than ever coping. The very rich are getting richer, and the rest are trying to truck along as best they can in the midst of constant desires to ob- tuin those finer things available to the affluent and temptingly spread before all through the various media. Some of “the rest” still are trying to obtain things like proper food and warm homes. Questions about the system and how it’s working are coming more fast and furious than ever before as the 200th birthday approaches. Not to say that everyone who can't afford a color tele- vision or juicy roast is going to start lighting dynamite; that’s not what has spurred the zeal of PLO or IRA com- mandoes. But it can spur anger and unrest and perhaps acts of violence with greater impact than a convenience store robbery. Even those robberies are bad enough. Many ot the hopes and dreams that kicked off the ex- periment called the United States 200 years ago have been fulfilled, but there are lots of rough edges left and the luster of the vision has dimmed for many. Perhaps the bicentennial year will bring a renewed dedication to those initial hopes and dreams, will bring efforts to brighten and expand the vision. It's a nice ay anyway. Not so nice a thought is that the birth- day celebration could be marred by more LaGuardias, January 4, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Capitol Complex Expansion Supported By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Building Commission gave concensus support Wednesday to the concept of expanding the present Capitol Complex of office buildings, but left in limbo dozens of realtors, de- velopers and property own- ers hoping to sell land or buildings to the state. The commission revived the 1973 master plan for ex- pansion, forming a com- mittee to work out details with Robert Bateman, the Mobile architect who has held the preliminary plan since the earlier commission contracted its creation The commission formed a second committee to analyze the multitude of proposals for land and building pur- chases presented in Decem- ber and during Wednesday’s more than two-hour ses- sion— a hot, stuffy, standing room only meeting in Gov. George C. Wallace’s office. The meeting brought an apparent truce of sorts be- tween Wallace and Birming- ham developer Walter F. Johnsey, the Alabama Pow- er Co. executive vice presi- dent who has_ unsuccessfully attempted to construct a new office building for the state or sell it his proposed site for the last three years His ef- forts have been plagued with political controversy and constant feuding with Wal. lace, whose protests have thwarted Johnsey so far Johnsey proposed Wednesday a $13.8 million building to be financed from a bond issue and constructed by the state, not by his Capi- tol Development Corp. as in- itially planned Of that, he would receive $1.7 million for the one-block site located in front of the Capitol build- state the land where those buildings would sit. Attorney Leon Capouano made the offer on behalf of Pinkie’ Hassan and Smith- Tyson Realtors, who have secured written or oral agreements to sell from the various property owners. They are asking a total of $2 million for the two blocks of land, which Capouano said equals $9.25 per square foot. Capouano emphasized the commission should act quickly, since the owners might change their minds or raise the price, and was vis- ibly distressed when the commission decided to fur- ther study all the proposals. Another distressed par- ticipant was Richard Pizitz, who wants to sell the state his company's downtown de- partment store located six blocks’-from and facing the Capitol. ~ ing. a reduction from the $2.08 million asking price this fall. Although the site is not within the confines of the Bateman master plan, which envisions expansion behind the Capitol, Johnsey produced a master plan ap- proved by the commission in 1965 which encompasses his land by showing expansion toward downtown Montgom- ery Although Wallace’ contin- ued promoting expansion ad- jacent to the present com- plex of buildings, he said commissioners ‘‘shouldn't close our minds to front or back’' expansion, and the committee to work with Bateman was directed to ad- dress that question. And, Johnsey made no mention of the past conflicts with Wallace throughout his presentation . The governor did note the Pizitz, who quietly had sat through the lengthy talk of- constructing new buildings adjacent to and in the same design as the existing com- plex. said he was ‘‘flabber- gasted\"’ that state officials would consider paying double the $2.8 million he wants for his building, just to have an aesthetic Capitol Complex. Commissioners said his proposal was not dead, des- pite the move toward the master plan, and several as- sured Pizitz after the meet- ing that his building would receive full consideration. Pizitz has announced the Montgomery retail outlet will close by the end of Feb- ruary under financial du- ress. The commission set a Feb. 11 meeting to receive reports from the two committees. 1965 master plan shown by Johnsey includes the site of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, asking whether pro- tests might be raised over destroying or relocating the civil rights movement sym- bol. Johnsey, however, said church officials had been re- ceptive to his earlier propos- al to swap his land for the church site. Bateman’'s preliminary plan to accommodate a growing state bureaucracy over the next 20 years calls for eight new office buildings and seven parking decks, with the Capitol building re- maining the dominant struc- ture. He suggested first con- structing new legislative and judicial buildings directly behind the Capitol, and his presentation was followed by a proposal from Mont- gomery realtors to sell the January 8, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Year's First Week Of Political Activity Brings Hint of Past By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer That nagging feeling that you've been through all this before nagged several times up on Capitol Hill during the first full week of 1976. In fact, much of the government and politics scene un- folded so far brought more than a hint of deja vu. It was rather like an instant replay somewhat delayed. Not that one should expect the advent of January to be accompanied by a grand departure from December, to carry with it momentous changes or to produce scintil- lating twists in earlier travelled paths, But the New Year's usual brief undercurrent of start- ing things afresh was unusually brief this time and was almost completely swept away within the first few days. For example, the Alabama Ethics Commission once again was visited last week by representatives of local government officials who tried to convince the commis- sioners, as they did back in 1973, 1974 and 1975, that low- er level magistrates should be exempt from mandated precepts of ethical conduct in office. One of the more’ fascinating arguments advanced on behalf of the locals’ cause was this: there was no ethics law in existence when present officeholders decided to seek election, so they shouldn't have to comply with the law unless and until they decide to run for new terms. Following that line of reasoning, one similarly would have to argue that anyone who received a driver's li- cense prior to adoption of the 55 mile an hour speed limit shouldn't have to comply with it since he didn’t foresee the law when he applied for the license. ~ Yet another holdover from earlier years of the same battle between local officials and ethics is that the offi- cials still haven't bothered to find out exactly what it is they're protesting. The greatest annoyance, one it is repeatedly said will prompt ‘‘wholesale resignations’ by those loyal public servants who work for the people gratis as members of various boards and commissions, is the requirement for income disclosure. One spokesman maintained the local farmer sitting on a municipal agency feels it an extreme invasion of privacy ‘‘to tell where he sells every bale of cotton,” He doesn't have to, What the farmer-official is required to tell about his farm is simply that he has one, and that it earned him in the past year: (a) less than $1,000, (b) between $1,000 and $10,000, (c) $10,000 or more. He also must reveal whether any government agency, such as the one he helps control, siphoned any public money to his farm op- eration that year. Another familiar scene was played out last week in the setting of the Alabama Building Commission, where commissioners once again addressed an issue dealt with at least as far back as a decade ago, as well as re- lated matters more than three years old and still unre- solved. The first question was that of a master plan for devel- oping the physical end of state government—the facil- ities to house the bureaucracy. One master plan was adopted in 1965, then apparently left on a shelf some- where to quietly disintegrate into crumbling parch- ment. Another was drawn in 1973, but only the prelimi- nary proposal ever was adopted by the commission be- fore it preempted overall planning in favor of construct- ing one specific building which in no way fit into the pre- viously adopted plan. The 1973 preliminary plan was back for Building Com- mission reconsideration last week, as was a revised ver- sion of the 1973 building proposal which also never got as far as bricks and mortar. At this point it’s still unadvisable to lay any money on whether the Building Commission actually will do much building in 1976, or whether it still will be re-thinking plans and proposals by 1977. Then there was the first meeting of a new agency, the Alabama Port Authority established to issue construc- tion bonds for the Docks Department and to decide how the money will be spent. That, it would seem, should have been a fresh puff of air in the state functioning of government, especially as regards the department which has been subject to periodic political controversy and innuendoes of less than exemplary management over the years. What the Port Authority did was lend its collective ear to the briefly-explained plans of docks officials, then im- mediately vote to sell $15 million in bonds for use ex- actly as the docks people wished, Without a question asked, How closely any authority will be exercised over the port this year remains to be seen. Gov. George C. Wallace, who on a national level rants over those faceless bureaucrats running the people's show with no accountability, in this case said the bu- reaucrats at the docks must be trusted to do right, since they know best what's going on down there. And now that he’s been brought into this exercise, it ought to be mentioned that the governor once again took his act out of Alabama last week for another romp down the campaign trail. Haven't we seen all this before? January 11, 1976 \f"

Wallace an- | nounced Wednesday the state will appeal U.S. Dist. Judge Frank M. Johnson’s order for sweeping prison re- » form. “The issue is not how we treat prisoners, but how pris- oners treat society,’’ Wal- lace said at a press confer- ence in his first public re- sponse to the court decree signed Tuesday. Taking a strong stand on the offensive, Wallace criti- cized the order for placing a massive financial burden on the state and for con- centrating on the welfare of criminals, rather than of vic- tims. The court order stated that Alabama inmates suffer ‘cruel and unusual punish- ment”’ in violation of their constitutional rights simply by being placed in state pe- nal institutions. It directed improvements throughout the corrections system, ranging from health and san- ‘The issue is not how we treat prisoners, but how prisoners treat society.” ~Gov. Wallace means of classifying prison- / ers, Wallace said the state has - tried to upgrade Alabama - _ prisons, “‘but we have found - the burden too great,” as - have officials in other states. He would not admit any serious deficiencies in the prison system, despite ad- , missions by state prison offi- - cials themselves that condi- tions violate con- Stitutionally-guarant +d rights. Wallace said the federal order ‘‘would require $40... $50 . . . $100 million to imple- ment. Where that’s .going to come from, I don’t know.” ‘Federal judges in Amer- ica are very good about tell- ing you how to spend money, but not how to raise it,” he said. The governor said the state now has $10 million to spend on prison improve- ments, $6 million from the bond issue approved by the voters Tuesday and another $4 million raised through in- vesting federal revenue sharing funds, Aides earlier > said Wallace had considered allocating the revenue shar- ing funds before Christmas, but opted for a delay out of fear the public would turn down the bond issue if it was known the $4 million was available, ‘‘We're going to appeal this order because the effect of it is the people whose goods have been stolen... or | * have been robbed or mugged ‘ or raped or maimed . . . must create a hotel atmosphere * with a catering service, a va- cation resort (for crimi- > nals),” Wallace said. If the appeal fails, Wallace said the state will attempt to taxes or elimination of “some very worthwhile pro- grams,” Wallace brushed off sug- gestions the highly critical court order might hamper his presidential aspirations. “I'm not worried about whether my presidential January 15, 1976 campaigning is hurt or un- hurt,” he said. “If that was the purpose of the order, I don't care one whit. ‘IT don’t know but that a vote for George Wallace might give a political barbed wire enema to some federal judges,”’ he said. . Despite Judge Johnson's specific statement that he does not believe in coddling prisoners or in making pris- ons into ‘‘hotels or country clubs,\"’ Wallace said that's exactly what will happen un- der the court order. “If you want to get a couple years rest, all you'll have to do is go and mug somebody,” he said. Under questioning, Wal- lace said there is ‘‘no utopia” jn Alabama prisons, but that there has been ‘‘no in- comply with the order, pre- eon neglect. dicting that will mean new © tended neglect,” he said, “I haven't been there in the prisons much lately.” “I don’t know about unin- \f"

        "ocr_text": "Following Order Realistic Solution To Prison Dilemma By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Frank M. Johnson Jr. once again has brought chaos to the corridors of Alabama state government. The U.S. District Court judge, in an order last week di- recting a complete overhaul of the state’s prison sys- tem, has at least caused bubbling chatter to erupt through the hallways and meeting rooms of Capitol Hill, as state bureaucrats and legislators and other elected officials predict the mandate will cause an uncon- tainable disruption in otherwise orderly workings of the government, will require either untenable taxation on the law-abiding public forced to support what has been labled by many as a luxurious lifestyle for convicted criminals or a reduction in vital services to a worthy majority of the citizenry. The talk is reminiscent of that in vogue when Johnson in 1972 ordered the state to similarly observe the con- stitutional rights of those persons committed to Ala- bama mental institutions. Since that time Alabamians have been forced to suf- fer neither massive doses of taxation nor a painful with- drawal of the aids provided by their state government. Gov. George C. Wallace now is able not only to point _ with pride to the lowest per capita tax rate in the nation, but also can boast of a mental health system approach- ing the model. Gov, Wallace, himself bearing lifelong scars of a trag- ic crime, has been the most publicly vocal critic of John- son's new order, While he stresses the financing re- quired will more than simply strain the state treasury, the governor is most vehemently opposed to the philoso- phy expressed through the judge’s decree. Wallace delivered a powerfully ardent critique dur- ing his press conference last week, one which even he suggested brought back memories of earlier demagogic utterances gauged to touch the average voter's most sensitive sore spots, one conveniently captured on cellu- loid by his presidential campaign filmmakers. He ranted against the taxpayers being forced to pro- vide “vacation resort” conditions for the same inmates who have raped and robbed and mugged and maimed them. On a more personal level, however, the governor has stated be believes some criminals have no rights. That, apparently, is his main argument with Judge Johnson’s order. The Montgomery Advertiser ALABAMA JOURNAL them. On a more personal level, however, the governor has stated be believes some criminals have no rights. That, apparently, is his main argument with Judge Johnson's order. Some criminals, Wallace believes, are mean, bad people who simply do not wish to abide by the basic rules of decent society. Those people cannot be changed or rehabilitated, so he says they should be lifted per- manently from society’s shoulders, whether it be by in- carceration or death. And, if they are imprisoned, they do not deserve amenities such as clean, sanitary living conditions, education, nutritious foods or planned recrea- tion—some of the items Johnson has ordered. Such miscreants should not be supported in such style, the gover-: nor says. When Wallace speaks of the criminals in those cate- gories, he most frequently points to Arthur Bremer, the man convicted of riddling his body with five bullets, or to perpetrators of similar atrocities which have left dead bodies or human vegetables in their wake. When asked whether inmates convicted of crimes such as theft or drug possession or the white collar vari- ety should be subjected to brutal conditions—to rape by fellow prisoners and roach-invested dinners—the gov- ermmor says no. om Ra ‘A POT OF HOT TEA TO CeLL 404.” Testimony before Judge Johnson said they are. Testimony also showed a large number of prisoners have mental problems that are not treated and often ex- acerbated during their stay in prison, that many con- victed of relatively minor offenses come out worse than when they went into the pen. Outside of the concern over inhumanity wreaked upon these human beings, John- son also obviously was addressing what degraded ex- cons wreak upon society when released. Unless Wallace wishes to keep all prisoners, regard- less of their crime, locked up forever, he could reconsi- der the utility of implementing the Johnson order, if only for the sake of Alabamians who must walk streets peopled with angry and frustrated former prisoners, It will take money, multi-millions of dollars that were withheld from the prison system over past decades, des- pite the pleas of top prison officials who reportedly were unable to even win an audience with the governor to make their case—before any suits were filed. The timetable for improvements will be difficult, per- haps, impossible, to meet experts feel. Johnson has shown before, however, that a good faith effort produc- es a good faith response, and ultimately does get the job done, January 18, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Looming Cash Crisis Forcing Legislators To Look Around By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer For possibly the first time in modern state history the Alabama Legislature is finding out how this state is run. Legislators involved in the new knowledge movement are quick to admit the lawmaking branch has been woe- fully ignorant of how the cogs and wheels spin in mak- ing the bureaucracy function—or sometimes hamper its functioning. They also admit that what has prompted the crash course in the finances and operations of state govern- ment is the prospect of serious money problems ex- pected to begin this year and to continue for no one, knows how long. Several lawmakers and staff people theorize the reason for past legislative unconcern over the specifics of statecraft has been a comparative abun- dance of money over the years, money that could be handed over to the departments and institutions with - » little regard for accountability in its spending. This year accountability has become the watchword on Capitol Hill. For years the line of public servants has marched be- fore the legislature each budget season with requests for more money than last time, citing inflation or the need for new programs and more personnel or demands for increased services, seldom being asked for hard jus- tifications of the purported needs. This year they are being asked exactly that, and more, before the formal budget hearings even begin. It isn't the entire Alabama Legislature that is con- ducting the close scrutiny, but the exercise primarily is a work project of two joint committees of House and Senate members. While other interim committees are studying limited areas such as the State Education Department or grants received by public agencies and departments, the two taking a broader look at the government system are dealing with (1) Alabama’s tax structure, and (2) the spending practices of the branches of government. The first committee, chaired by Birmingham Rep. Robert Gafford, has as its basic aim the finding of new revenue, Members are learning exactly who pays what taxes, and, perhaps more importantly, who isn’t paying. They will not necessarily propose a new general tax, or rais- ing an existing levy, but are trying to find out what - would be the ramifications of any change in the tax structure. One part of the study is securing data on the taxes and incomes of other regional states, to learn how Alaba- mians fare compared to their neighbors and to assure any changes here won't place this state at a competitive disadvantage with the others in terms of attracting and holding business, industry and people. While the committee members have been seen as among the most hard working, concerned and attentive to have sat through lengthy. interim sessions in recent years, they also have displayed the political nature of the elected official. They have been reluctant even to discuss the merits of some taxes or fees, regardless of the inequities that might be leveled, if they know the population segment to be affected is a powerful special interest group. But that, of course, is the virtue which won such groups exemptions or low taxes in the first place. The other committee conducting an exhaustive study of how Alabama operates. is actually a subcommittee of the usual joint interim budget committee that holds hearings on budget requests prior to each regular legis- _ ilative session, Spearheaded by Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, this group has assumed the ambitious task of getting detailed accounts of who gets how much and what they do with it. Members say they scarcely could approach their project without the constant aid of the Department of Examiners of Public Accounts, an agency established to help lawmakers keep tabs on state spending, but only in recent months actually utilized to its full potential. Beasley and other subcommittee members have ex- pressed astonishment on several occasions, upon learn- ing the massive sums of money with which some depart- - ments and agencies deal on a routine basis. They have been even more surprised periodically at how it is dealt with. While the need to reduce spending and make the wi- sest use of available resources has been amply docu- mented, it appears Beasley at times has been a bit over- zealous in his search for malfeasance or simple error. That particularly has been the case with his charges that the University of Alabama and Auburn University have been squirreling away multi-millions in in- vestments, yet asking for increasingly larger budgets every year, Those charges have been countered by officials of both schools, and even Beasley admits some of his harsh Words were premature. Some of his accusations regarding Docks Department investments also have been branded as empty down in Mobile, although department officials did not success- fully counter, or even attempt to discredit, any of them in a meeting with the subcommittee. Other practices, such as nepotism or failing to give back unused funds at the end of the fiscal year, also have been uncovered in the subcommittee’s probe. With the careful study and hard work going into both committee investigations, the state could realize over all economies and a hetter-adjusted tax structure over- the next several years. The potential for making politi- cal hay out of scapegoats or failing to act out of fear of political reprisals also exists, however, and it’s still a - up whether politics or good government will pre- vail.

        "ocr_text": "ACLU Suit Group Asks Removal of Ethics Commissioners By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The executive director of the Alabama Civil Lib- erties Union filed suit here Tuesday seeking to remove members of the Alabama Ethics Commis- sion from office, about six months after trying to prevent their ouster. ACLU Director Steve Suitts resurrected a little- used legal maneuver in suing in the name of the State of Alabama, filing a writ of ‘‘quo warranto” in Montgomery Circuit Court claiming the four commissioners have no legal authority to sit on the agency. Suitts said at a press conference here that the 1975 revision of the origi- nal 1973 ethics act man- dates that five newly ap pointed commissioners be selected by a New appoint- ing authority made up of the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the Alabama House of Represenatives. The appointing author- ity never has acted, and the four commission- ers—there is one va- cancy—have remained in office by virtue of an opin- ion issued by Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley. The commissioners are Chairman Donald Comer of Eufaula, Alto Lee of Dothan, George Bagley of Montgomery and Leslie Wright of Birmingham. Suitts said the commis- sioners are ‘‘honorable public servants’’ who all should be reappointed to the body, but that, until they are reappointed, they are sitting illegally. He said the fault is not with the commissioners, but with the appointing authority—Gov. George C. Wallace, Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley and House Speak- er Joe McCorquodale, who he charged have failed to act because Wal- lace is campaigning for president and the other two for governor. “Officials ought to be running the government business,’’ Suitts said, ‘‘not in the business of running for governor or president.’’ He suggested they apparently have been ‘‘too busy’’ to tend to State duties. Last August, shortly af- ter the Alabama Legisla- ture revised the law, Suitts supported the com- missioners in contending a new section prohibiting ‘*‘Government in this fort to remove an official state already is ruled far who has acted illegally or too much by personality has no legal justification Although Baxley says ieee * Sultts said ee for being in office ? s said. ‘‘For : : : fee Suitts said he knows of these individual commis- the old ethics commis- one occasion when such a sioners cannot be si sioners to continue : singled writ was used succes- es serving would be a trage- out as ineligible to serve gy for the principle of con- sfully, when a member of the Vestavia City Council on oe new commission, stitutional, lawful govern- as the in i ment i y are in the revised ment and an irony for an was removed from office in 1963. law, he has not questioned 28eDcy - ee ee ‘i ip.

His point was that economists seldom take a head-on approach to problems of the ecotomy (and the govern- ment), speaking rather in terms of: ‘On the one hand . . but then on the other hand, you also must consider...” Dr. Eugene Stanaland admitted he makes full use of the two-handed style, especially since Stanaland him- Self is, on tne one hand, a university professor dealing in abstracts and ideals and model solutions, but then, on the other hand, is a member of the Auburn City Council who also must work with the nuts and bolts realities of keeping a small community government serving its citizens. He expressed greatest sympathy for the legislative committee he was addressing, a joint committee of House and Senate members trying to find some new rev- enue to finance the state government over the next few years, which are expected to number among the leanest in recent history. Stanaland said he knew full well the frustration of se- curing additional funds, which the public doesn’t want to give, to pay for the services the people demand. He recounted how local taxpayers come to him. as a city councilman, ranting over needs for better streets. a sidewalk around the school, a fire house on the other Side of town, a bigger police force—then ask why the council doesn’t eliminate the occupational license fee. On the state level things aren't much different. People complain about the interstate system not being finished, want higher Medicaid benefits, clamor for improvements in education, wonder why the state doesn't have more troopers to patrol the highways, more bureaucrats to bring in industry, more regulatory personnel to keep tabs on polluters. Suggest the possi- bility of ending some tax exemptions—much less of levying new or higher taxes—and the protests imme- diately are screamed across the state. “We can brag about having perhaps the lowest tax burden in the nation,\"’ Stanaland said. “but the cost of that is not being able to provide the services available in other places.” He reviewed some aspects of the state's tax structure and of how the burden is distributed, finding potential changes already briefly discussed by committee mem- bers at earlier sessions also might produce two-handed results. There was the question of earmarked taxes, which are taxes passed with the understanding the revenue de- rived would be used for specific purposes only. All the State funds spent on education come from earmarked taxes, which have been the fastest-growing ones result- ing in the past in more money for education than other fields. Talk of unearmarking, which would give the leg- islature greater spending flexibility, has sounded frequently over the past six months. Stanaland noted the rigidity of living within a system where the majority of revenue is earmarked does pose problems for lawmakers, but also suggested earmark- ing gives the people the best opportunity of voicing how they want public dollars spent. Despite the recent federal court order for massive im- provements throughout the prison system, which is one place requiring a generous infusion of new monies this year, Stanaland questioned how the public would re- spond to taking education money away from children for spending on convicts. He also cited the arguments heard sporadically that local governments should bear a greater part of the bur- den for financing education, especially since the local input in Alabama stands at one of the lowest per- centages in the country. He noted, however, that the economic base, here as elsewhere, is not evenly dis- tributed throughout the state, meaning basicly that the state government has been engaging in a bit of redistri- bution by collecting taxes statewide and funnelling equal amounts per student to the various school sys- tems. Shifting more of the burden to the local governments likely would create a situation of unequal education op- portunity, he said, even raising a question of possible in- State migration it might prompt, aS some in the already sparsely populated rural areas move their families to the larger tax bases and resultingly better schools of the cities. He also briefly discussed industrial development as a spurt to the economy, but wondered whether some com- munities, if they took a close look at the pros and cons of new industry, might not find they've brought them- selves highly automated shops with little new employ- ment, big tax exemptions, and demands for more public services. By the time the committee meeting was done, Stana- land had proved himself to be very much the two-hand- ed economist, leaving the impression that Alabama's lawmakers are lodged on a political hotseat between Scylla and Charybdis, the rock and the whirlpool per- sonified in myth as monsters posing equally hazardous alternatives to unwary seagoing travellers who veer to- ward either.

        "ocr_text": "rison Managers Granted Reprieve To Reform System By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer It becomes clearer almost daily that a chasm sepa- Tates the federal court order to upgrade Alabama's pe- nal system and the existing conditions behind prison Walls, raising concem over the ability of corrections management to span the gap, Those conditions finally have been made apparent to a number of people, both inside and outside state gov- ernment, people who say they are appalled at the scenes that have unfolded at one institution after another as they tour the facilities or hear detailed reports of how the prisons are run, Few have bothered to catch even a glimpse of the pris- on situation in the past, but now are being forced by U.S. Dist. Judge Frank M. Johnson to read each chapter of what they are finding—an ugly story with a bad ending for the thousands behind bars here. , Now that they know, now that they are beginning to understand what “perturbed Judge Johnson so, they are asking exactly how things got the way they are and how things can be changed, “The concern is that the system itself is not. being managed, that just pouring money into it isn’t going to solve the problems,” said one source late last week, ech- oing sentiments earlier expressed publicly by Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley and legislators who recently got their first view of prison management and found it to be non-man- agement. The comment came after a two-hour private meeting in the governor's office, a session attended by most prin- -cipals in the upgrading movement, Included in the meeting were Roland Nachman, chairman of the Human . Rights Committee appointed by Johnson to oversee the peaceful revolution in the prison system, and Dr. George Beto, the consultant se- lected by the committee to advise it. Lt. Gov. Beasley was there, as were Acting Finance Director James R. Solomon and Henry Steagall, executive secretary to the governor, both representing the executive branch. ‘Three members of the Alabama Corrections Board also attended—Rev. John Vickers, Dr. Marion Carroll and. the newly-appointed Richard Robinson Although the discussion reportedly was wide-rang- ing, several who were there said one major topic was prison management personnel, and their ability to per- form the tasks that will be required over the next few years. None of the bureaucrats, not Prison Commissioner Judson C. Locke nor his lieutenants in the department, were at the meeting, apparently by design. The possibility of replacing the entire top echelon re- portedly was not discussed in specifics, but some said they left the meeting with the feeling that at least a few new faces eventually may have to be considered. Complaints about Locke’s uncooperative attitude have been issued from several quarters over past weeks. Personnel at the University of Alabama, who have been asked by legislative committees to help de- termine the potential cost of the upgrading, say Locke and his cohorts have been unreceptive, seeming to re- sent the outside interference of academia, even though mandated by the legislature. - Members. of the Human Rigkts Committee also have been quoted privately as being disturbed over the atti- -tude of the prison bureaucracy, over the latent hostility that precludes a fully cooperative effort to carry out the judicial decree. That hostility was° hardly latent during the hearings before Beasley’s legislative subcommittee in- vestigating prison management and other government operations. Locke appeared on the verge of an internal explosion, as he slouched and twisted in his chair when the questions - got tough, often spitting out strained, staccato answers that obviously left many thoughts unstated, Perhaps some of that can be understood, considering the enormous pressures placed on prison managers . suddenly being probed and questioned and Suspected by so many outside sources who till now have been satis- fied with blissful ignorance of the corrections system. Each new demand means that much less time to spend on the last one, means Spreading already stretched resources and personnel even thinner to ac- commodate the newly awakened interest in their busi- ness. It’s a totally new game and adjusting to the rules takes some time. It appears that time will be granted, but Locke and his fellow administrators, according to those involved in last week’s private discussions, will be watched rather closely to see whether the adjustments are possible. The stated concern is whether most of the men head- ing the prison operations have become so entrenched in the system, after long years of service under the tut- elage of others who led the institutions into their present confused morass, that they will be unable to extricate themselves and reform the system into the model desir- February 22, 1976 \f"

Wallace Stumps '¥j Through F oridel By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer OKEECHOBEE, Fla. — Gov. eC. Wallce sped his campaign entourage from the Gold Coast through the swamplands of Florida Saturday, hitting the heart of the State's Wallace country with the same stock phrases applauded in Boston and Brewton. The stops at the Swamp Cabbage Festival in LaBelle, Fla., and the Speckled Perch Festival here were re- menicent of Alabama gubernatorial campaign days, as crowds of small town country folk warmed to Wallace's routine attacks on the federal bureaucracy, other candi- dates and the liberal media. Wallace spent more words than usual in critiquing the federal judiciary, particularly the recent federal court order to vastly improve Alabama prison conditions. “The federal judges are about to get under my skin,” Wallace told some 1,500 to 2,000 listeners here, “Now they claim prisoners are too crowded, that they're sleeping too close together,” Wallace said. ‘The people they (prisoners) put in the cemetery are sleep- ing pretty close together too.” The Governor also commented on U.S. District Court Judge Frank Johnson's requirement that a college edu- cated nutritionist be hired to plan prison meals. “T have a prisoner cooking my food at the Mansion. I checked with her the other day and, sure enough, she's not a college trained nutritionist,” Wallace said. “I'm being denied my constitutional rights.\" Wallace did not mention that all prison laborers sup- plied to state officials also were ordered withdrawn from service jobs, which he indicated had not been done vet, at least not at the Mansion Sunday Morning, February 29, 1976 In the country fair atmosphere surrounding both ap- pearances, the Governor did not concentrate on unem- ployment and labor problems as he did in Fort Lauder: dale Friday night, which has about a 17 per cent unem- ployment rate. Both towns are predominantly farming and ranching communities, with a small American Indian population evident in each place. A number of blacks were milling through the LaBelle festival park site, but few approached the reviewing stand were Wallace's remarks were cut short by rain. About 6,000 to 7,000 people attended, many decked out in pioneer garb, and, while hundreds did not amble over to see Wallace deliver his talk, all were within earshot via the public address system.

After the rally, Wallace spent about 15 minutes in a vacant store front office, shaking hands with local sup- porters from whom he virtually always is physically isolated by special roped off entrance and exit routes at each appearance. A middle-aged black woman at the last minute was ushered to the room, heavily guarued by Secret Service agents, and a man wearing Wallace buttons told an agent: ‘‘she's okay. She don't have a gun or anything. She's my maid and just wants to meet the Governor.” Later Saturday night Wallace appeared briefly at a local Chamber of Commerce dinner and rally imme- diately afterward at Lake Wales, Fla.

He is Steve Sammons and he vir- tually always is the moderator-warm- up man at a George C. Wallace presi- dential campaign rally. He jokes be- tween the country music tunes and usually gets in at least one audience participation gig to start the blood coursing a little faster before the main attraction is rolled out. By the time Cornelia Wallace is sup- posed to appear, Sammons definitely has got interest and expectation up, and he leads enthusiastic applause as he offers “the beautiful, the vivacious, the next first lady of the United States —- Mrs. Cornelia Wallace.” But Sammons saves his heartiest tones for the man himself. “And now, ladies and gentlemen, | am proud to present to you, Alabama’s fighting governor, your next fighting president, Gov. George Corley Wal- lace.” And his voice crescendos to a pitch that, magnified over the micro- phone, is designed to raise goose bumps. Sammons, a young Montgomerian who owns a broadcast studio and got sucked into the Wallace operation deeper than perhaps expected when he offered the use of his recording facil- ities a couple of months ago, epito- mizes the efforts to give the 1976 cam- paign a bit of a face-lift. Smooth, sophisticated, attractive, Sammons is no hayseed or political hack, and he’s a youthful-looking 29. That seems especially important this time around, to the national oper- atives but even more so to local volun- teers who quickly tell any willing lis- tener that things are different now. “You should come to our Jackson- ville office,” said one middle-aged |a- bor volunteer at a recent rally. “You'd be surprised at all the kids working there. College kids and everything. And they do a real good job, too.” “The attitude of young people has changed,” said another worker at an- other place. “They like George Wal- lace now.” While the rally crowds are pre- dominantly middle-aged, there are unexpectedly large numbers of young- er faces dotting the audience. Of those questioned, a few say they are only curious to see the fabled man and certainly would never cast a ballot for him. Many others, however, proudly sport Wallace buttons. Although the younger rally-goers generally are more reserved — and sometimes seem a bit uncomfortable at being there — than the whoop and holler diehard Wa'laceites, both the young and the old warm to Sammons, just like they’re supposed to.

Recent polls and most published pre- dictions of the Massachusetts Primary oulcome have centered on a Wallace plu- rality, due to anti-busing sentiment and the wide array of candidates working to secure the liberal vote, although in the last several days a few political prognos- ticators have seen the tide turning to Carter, if not as the No. 1 vote-getter, then at least as No. 2 ahead of Wallace, with U, §. Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona capturing first place, The uncertainty is obvious, Also obvious is that other candidates have been worried about Wallace and now are issuing concern over Carter, mostly through published critiques Wallace, who long has maintained his party's leaders have been traveling a stop-Wallace course, refuses to recog. nize the apparent stop-Carter movement materializing in the party's liberal rank “Whatever problem they have, let them talk about it,” Wallace said at an impromptu press conference in Lake Wales, Fla., last weekend, when asked about the Democrats’ “Jimmy Carter problem.\" \"T don't have any problems myself,” he said, despite the fact Wallace has en- joyed the position of outcast Southerner spurned by the party hierarchy.

Wallace simply said that yes, he does support the right-tolife amendment that virtually would prohibit all abor- tions, and that yes he would stop fed- eral financing of abortions in the welfare program, Wallace did say he would be “flexible” on the question if a woman's The North Miami meeting did not ap- pear dominated by members of the Jew- ish community, but rather by long-time Wallace supporters. The governor did, however, briefly mention hopes that ‘‘the Russian gov- ernment will allow Jewish people to emi- grate,’ an issue of particular impor- tance to American Jews. , Questioned on his policy toward the Mideast, Wallace vaguely expressed a desire that all sides be made to realize that “‘lasting peace is in the interest of all people in the Mideast.\" Qn the United Nations resolution equa- ting Zionism with racism, he said: “It's about as silly a resolution as they ever passed. I'd just ignore it.” At the same meeting Wallace for the first time detailed his views of the decr- iminalization of marijuana. “The possession of small amounts should not warrant . . . long-time jail sen- tences,” he said. ‘I’ m not for total- decr- iminalization, but | am for taking push- Related Story Page 3 “physical existence’ were jeopardized by a continued pregnancy. “T haven't done much as governor be- cause we haven't had much of a problem there,’ Wallace said when asked what ‘actions he had taken to stop abortions in Alabama. “We haven't had any abortion mills in Alabama that I know about,’ he said, apparently ignorant of the fact that abortions are readily available for the asking in Birmingham. Wallace’s Florida campaigners par- ticularly have solicited the Catholic and right-to-life vote in Florida by con- tacting church leaders and actively spreading word of the governor's anti- abortion stand, The campaign announced Wednesday that Wallace the day before had become the only presidential candidate this year to meet with the Catholic archbishop of Florida to discuss ‘several major is- sues,” including abortion. ers of cocaine and other drugs and put: ting some of them in the electric chair. In my judgment marijuana is no good. It does nobody any good.\" The governor was questioned at both places about his chances of a victory next week over former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter who has been considered his most formidable opponent in the primary election. Wallace noted that Carter had “come up against me in one primary and two caucus states, and I won all of them.” He referred to the victories over Car- ter in Massachusetts, Mississippi and South Carolina. Although Wallace has been reluctant to criticize his fellow Southerner, he did say at a civic club luncheon Wednesday that Carter “used my name” to win the 1970 Georgia gubernatorial election, a reference to Carter's one-time effort to gain the votes of Wallace supporters in Georgia. 43 fig ee Bae AP W Irephoto Wallace sani Florida March 4, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Carter as Outsider Drawing Opposition Of Regular Demos By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer _ Imagine this: Washington liberals and other public figures who have been adamant critics of Gov. George C. Wallace, including contenders in the Democratic presidential sweepstakes, fervently hoping Wallace will trounce opponent Jimmy Carter in Tuesday’s Flor- ida_ primary. What an ironic twist for those who, until Carter’s vic- tory in New Hampshire, had expressed desires that the , former Georgia governor whip Alabama’s head of state in the Florida race, to discredit Wallace’s candidacy. That isn’t an unrealistic change of heart to envision, as attacks against Carter have mounted since he be- came a credible candidate with his winning of the New Hampshire primary vote tally. Taking a cue from Wallace’s frequent harangues about a “stop-Wallice” movement, some observers are trying to detect the stoking of a “stop-Carter” train chugging through Democratic political circles. __ If such a vehicle does exist, it probably isn’t any more intentionally constructed than the one hoped to block oe path to greater prominence in national poli- cs. . It is more likely, as some have admitted, a gut-level reaction to the success of an “outsider,” a politician who has not worked his way up through the center of pol- itics and government in Washington, D.C., and a South- erner to boot. The objections to Wallace obviously stem from more than his non-Washington outlook — growing partic- ularly from the fact that Wallace rose ‘to fame through staunch segregationist stands and negative politics of the disaffected — but the protests against the Alabama governor are predicated at least in part on his nose- thumbing at the Washington experts who believe they know the best way to run this country. Carter similarly has expressed anti-Washington, anti-establishment sentiments. Both men proclaim that, as elected state leaders forced to deal with the very real, very immediate problems of their constituents, they know better the needs and wish- es of the people than do those isolated in the theoretical, philosophical enclaves spread across the Eastern seaboard, especially in the District of Columbia. While Wallace long has taken potshots at Washing- ton’s briefcase-totin’ bureaucrats (who don't tote im- portant documents, but peanut butter and jelly sand- wiches in their satchels), Carter has directed more re- fined barbs at what he views as the unwieldy, badly or- ganized bureaucracy. These two do not believe that Washington knows best. The Wallace attraction was not taken at all seriously in establishment circles until he started amassing votes in the 1972 major primaries, just as Carter’s candidacy was brushed off until Iowa balloting followed by New Hampshire this year. The national media may be partly to blame for that, and partly may share the same penchant for dis- regarding Washington outsiders. When the national press suddenly realized just before the Iowa delegate selection caucuses that Carter was going to. do well, the recognition was coupled with shock. The hard-hitting critiques, the close examinations of Carter’s record as governor of Georgia came fast and furious then, a phenomenon some media critics suggest was not merely an effort to make for past omissions, but was a form of rationalization — media people attempt- ing to show they underestimated Jimmy Carter's vote- getting strength because he didn’t actually deserve to have it — or was an unconscious form of revenge for being caught off-guard by a political upstart. While such seems overstated, it is hardly too harsh to suggest the media was a bit tardy in taking Carter ser- iously enough to find out who and what he is. The Washington politicos were even later in deciding Carter was not just a Georgia favorite son, but a threat to the rest of the Democratic field, waiting until his New Hampshire win to begin serious attacks. Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh, who late last week effective- ly stepped out of that field, was so certain the public wouldn’t trust an innocent outsider like Carter that he campaigned on the slogan: “I am a politician,’ in- dicating he, at least, knows how to deal with the subtle politics of guiding the federal government's complex machinations. He seemingly chose the wrong slogan. | Bayh and other candidates began sniping at the Geor- gian, and the liberal and some not-so-liberal Washing- ton insiders have gathered quietly to discuss what to do about Jimmy Carter, according to a New York Times article late last week. Some of the very people who constitute those inner circles, however, have recognized something other than simple dissatisfaction with Carter’s ideology, ability or knowledge. One called the sudden disdain of Carter “cultural pro- vincialism,” according to The Times while another sug- gested the problem is not with the man, but is with Washingtonians because “none feels they own a piece of Jimmy Carter.” : The voting public may be aware of exactly that and may find it a refreshing change. A New York Times-CBS voters poll showed Wallace voters in Massachusetts, where Wallace came in a re- spectable third, were four times as likely to distrust the _federal government than were any other groups of vot- ers. A similar poll in New Hampshire, where Carter was the top man, showed he, more than any other Democrat- ic candidate, got the votes of people wanting a balanced budget and decentralization of the federal government. Rather than simply hoping Wallace and Carter some- how will knock each other out of contention, perhaps the Washington gurus should listen to what the two out- siders are saying, and to what the public is saying about . their government by voting for them, March 7, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Montgomerian Loves By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Above the cardboard box of green and white Jimmy Carter tee-shirts hangs a map of Broward County, Fla. It isn’t the usual street map or topographical survey, but breaks down the state’s second most populous coun- ty by voting precincts. David Dunn stands in front of the map and quickly jabs his finger at the surface: ‘‘That’s a Wallace pre- cinct, that’s Wallace, those down there are Shapp, this one’s Carter and so’s this and this. These two might go for Jackson.” Although he can’t say how many votes from each pre- cinct will go to each Democratic candidate in Tuesday’s Florida primary, the 26-year-old Montgomerian has a studiously researched knowledge of where his man’s strengths and weaknesses lie. _His man is former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, and his job as the campaign’s Broward County coordina- tor—as the only paid campaigner there supervising a cadre of volunteers—is getting out the vote for Carter. _Dunn has undertaken the task with the same kind of single-minded committment that characterized his work as a staffer in U.S. Sen. George McGovern’s 1972 spring blowouts. ; ; There’s little sign of sunshine frolicking under his dark locks or around his black moustache, however, his untanned skin evidence of the 12 to 15 hour days spent learning Broward County and its people since Dunn hit town in his white pick-up truck in mid-January. Better evidence of Dunn’s seven-daya-week commit- ment is the ease with. which he rattles off the demogra- phics of his county. ; Dunn, and others not associated with the campaign, call Broward County_a particularly representative cross section of America. There are the cowboy-ranchers in the west, retired Jewish and gentile blocs from assorted ‘northern cities, young. marrieds drawn to ur- ban and suburban growth centers, a sizable remnant of Old South settlers and an 18 per cent black population. Dunn and his volunteer staff have worked all these voting communities—lobbying local leaders, sched- uling and peopling events for the candidate, pushing pamphlets and buttons and bumper stickers. Dunn's rent is free and his salary almost covers the bills in Ft. Lauderdale and at home in Montgomery, but those tangible rewards hardly: repay the sweat, toil and emotional anxiety spent by campaigners like Dunn. He and other young campaign aides—some attached presidential campaign and more recently as a lawyer in Alabama Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley’s environmental diyj- sion. . .

Some are laying the groundwork for their own politi- cal futures, while others believe the candidate they sup- port might transform their visions of a better system into government policy and action. Some, like Dunn, are spurred by both aims. When he explains what he perceives to be Jimmy Car- ter’s philosophy, it sounds like David Dunn’s dream. “He's caused the voters to think about something be- sides themselves,” Dunn says. ‘‘:He’s causing them to think about the country at large. It’s a drawing out pro- cess, it’s saying come out of your shell, come out of your box, because you can’t be that way anymore, not if we're ever going to put things back together. “That's the issue this year, that’s the issue of this campaign: that the voter, the American public, has lost its imagination, lost its confidence, and basicly lost its sense of giving to the other side.” Dunn admits he doesn’t agree with everything his candidate believes, just as he didn’t sanction all George McGovern’s views. But in 1976 Carter comes closest to sharing this young campaigner’s vision, and, more im- portantly, Dunn believes he’s the most electable of the - lot. March 9, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Cancels AEA Appearance, By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov, George C. Wallace will not detour from the cam- paign trail to appear before the Alabama Education As- sociation Thursday, reportedly part out of fear the state's teachers would accord him a poor reception. The governor's potential trip from Illinois to the Bir- mingham convention had been an off-again, on-again proposition for at least two days, as Wallace several times changed his mind while weighing the possible benefits against liabilities. In Birmingham, AEA president Robert Lipscomb Florida —AP Wirephoww Wallace Heads Chicago Tribune After Florida Primary chided Wallace for bowing out of addressing the con- vention. “The governor must also realize that he is running for president in the state of Alabama,” Lipscomb said. “I think it is obvious we wanted the governor to come.” But, he added, he was “not going to condemn him be: cause he did not come.” Lipscomb said that because of Wallace’s drive last year to divert $30 million from the Special Education Trust Fund, the governor may not have received a par: licularly warm welcome at his annual AKA address. But, Lipscomb added, the organization still has “‘a tre- mendous amount of respect’ for the governor's office. When asked if he thought Wallace had aided or hin- dered education in Alabama during the last few years, Lipscomb said, “He has done both.” While the official reason given for the last-miuute re- fusal was bad flying weather up north, aides here were concerned about the convention hall climate in Bir- mingham. Sources said AEA leaders, including Executive Sec- retary Paul Hubbert, had been contacted Wednesday for assurances the massive audience would not hiss or boo Wallace should he appear. The possible negative reaction could have been prompted both hy the administration's suc- cessful move to divert education money to other state programs last year and by the absence of any pledge to forego a repeat performance this year. AEA bitterly fought diversion. The speech that will be submitted to the AEA con- vention, the same one Wallace would have used, merely outlines the governor's past performance in the educa- tion field and details the money problems ahead for Ala- bama, sources said. It does not promise any specific in- creased benefits for teachers or that the Special Educa- tion Trust Fund will be reserved for education only this year. Unless Wallace suddenly changes his mind once again, this will be the first year he has failed to appear before the teacher lobby. Had he made the trek to Birmingham, Wallace would have been accompanied by the usual entourage of media people who follow his every movement, including the national television network camera crews. After Wallace's second-place standing in the Florida primary Tuesday, a bad reception in his home state—one captured on film and broadcast around the country—hardly would have enhanced the governor's image. The AEA leadership reportedly promised that Wal- lace would be received cordially, but fears of protests, coupled with the complications of major schedule shifts, apparently convinced campaign operatives the risk would be too great to chance. National Campaign Director Charles Snider said he was unaware of any difficulties in the AEA appearance, scoffing at suggestions Wallace feared the potentially pee publicity would further damage his recently weak- ened campaign. Snider also downplayed effects of the Florida prima- ry balloting, calling it ‘just another state, just another step . . . in the campaign designed to produce delegates and designed for the long haul.” The reason Wallace did substantially worse than the 42 per cent vote attracted in the 1972 Florida primary, according to Snider, is that this year the campaign not only split its efforts between Massachusetts and Flor- ida, but also is operating in states throughout the nation. Wallace finished second to former Georgia Gov. Jim- my Carter Tuesday, with the two receiving 34 per cent and 31 per cent totals. “In 1972 we had absolutely nothing going on in the United States except Florida,” Snider said. ‘We had all ou resources and money and manpower there.” He said the primary results “will have somewhat of an effect for the other candidate (Carter),\"\" by boosting his contributions and momentum. But, Snider contended the Wallace campaign has laid better groundwork for future primaries and caucuses than have Carter workers, and he discounted any sub- stantial drop in donations to or support for Wallace. Asked specifically whether he expects any adverse ef- fect on the inflow of dollars, Snider said: ‘I don’t know whether it will affect the contributions. 1 don’t think so.”” In restrospect, Snider said the campaign erred itt fail- ing to recognize a few important issues in Florida—such as reforming condominium ownership laws—and in the way it divided Wallace's time between Massachusetts and Florida. Remaining optimistic, he added, ‘No one primary or caucus is going to disrupt our game plan.\" March 11, 1976 \f"

He also noted areas of significant employment decreases, however, in- cluding the two-year reduction of 76 employes of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board and of 409 workers in the State Highway Department. The ABC Board reductions were a response to an efficiency study, while massive highway layoffs came last summer when the department began running out of money. Rather than ap- prove an emergency appropriation to Perhaps half the 1,152 new Pensions and Security Department employes have been mandated by the federal government, according to Gill Jen- nings, the department's deputy com- missioner, while the rest are attribut- able to natural growth and the ex: pansion or creation of programs deter- mined solely by state officials, A recent personnel stat\" report, completed last week under order of Acting Finance Director James R.

State Budget Officer Jimmy Rai- ford, who compiled the report, attrib- uled the two-year increase of 190 people in the Industrial Relations De- partment partially to the processing of large increases in unemployment ‘ompensation claims that grew as the recession worsened. He also said about 90 per cent of that department's programs are funded and overseen by the federal government. Solomon's Finance Department felt two an increase of 36 new workers over the years and Raiford said those mostly were added in complying with recommendedations of the Governor's Jan. 1, 1974, and Jan. 1, 1976, in the de- partments and agencies run by Wal- lace's cabinet members, including the welfare system. Late last year Wallace sent letters to those arms of government under his jurisdiction, asking officials to refrain from new hiring unless absolutely es- sential, in light of anticipated revenue problems the remainder, of this fiscal year and over the next, Another similar letter is to go out Monday, repeating the request and Cost Control Survey. The recommen: dations by an independent group of tions business leaders included creating a new Division of Space Management to handle office space leasing and a Data Processing Office to centralize all state computer work. The net employment increase for the 1974 calendar year was 1,114 people, while the net increase in 1975 was only 47 new workers. Most addi- fion the latter year, including those in the Pensions and Security Depart: ment, were offset by the highway pay- roll reductions. Deputy Commissioner Jennings said one major federal requirement that boosted the ranks of welfare workers was expanding the food stamp program statewide. ~ About half Alabama's 67 counties asking for spending reductions in oth- er areas, such as travel and equipment purchases. The impact of the governor's per- sonal plea for austerity would show little, if at all, in the new personnel status report, since virtually the entire period charted in the report dates pri- or to Wallace’s first letter. Serious concern over the state's fiscal condi- tion was not issued from any quarter until the latter months of 1975. Solomon indicated the status report had been using the commodity system that was administered by the county governments wilh county employes As commodities were phased out under federal command, many of the those employes remained in the welfare sys- tem, but were switched to the state pavroll, Jennings said.

Whether it’s a dying gasp or a new credo hoped to buoy merely flagging spirits, the mes- sage being promoted is clear: Jimmy Carter is a screaming liberal. It was being whispered before the Florida primary tae marked Gov. George C. Wallace's first serious set- ack. . As a campaign tactic it gained more vocal messen- gers among Wallace supporters drumming up votes for i Illinois primary that became the second consecutive ow. Now, as Wallace and his people tramp through North Carolina in the crucial third, virtually face-to-face con- frontation with Carter, even the governor has begun tagging his opponent with the liberal label. A conversa- tion with any high-level staffer will not pass without at least one, and usually several, references to astounding similarities between Carter and Sen. George McGovern, the Democrats’ 1972 standard-bearer who was toppled by his leftward leanings. Back in Florida, before the voters snatched from Wal- lace the victory he was expecting and counting on to boost him through the next. few states, the governor oe not neatly file Carter away in the drawer marked iberal. Asked. specifically whether he agreed with a few aides’ contentions that the former Georgia governor was cloaking his pink-tinged stripes in the gray cloth of a moderate, Wallace hedged and reluctantly replied he didn’t know what Mr. Carter stood for, and he doubted Mr. Carter did either. That sort of response was to be expected, fitting nicely with the governor’s long-held conviction that the public doesn't like to hear politicians engaged in petty argu- ments, name-calling and back-biting. He frequently has shaken his head in condescending disapproval upon — hearing of such repartees between Alabama politicos. Although Wallace supporters in the past have stooped to the lowest level of dirty tricksterism in personal at- tacks on the governor’s opponents here, the candidate In North Carolina he has changed. This week he has called Jimmy Carter a liar. He petulantly has resurrected old tales of Carter using him to gain Georgia voter strength in the 1970 gubernatorial race. He has charged his number one opponent with mouthing moderate or vague ideology to cover up his true liberal orientation. To prop that shaky contention, Wallace cites as proof the names of former McGovern aides who this year have switched to the Georgian’s camp. , More citations of such can be expected, as staffers here continue researching the names of Carter workers and contributors to find which ones played a role in McGovern’s campaign. Michael Griffin, the Wallaceite with perhaps the best knowledge of out-of-state political personalities as the governor’s personal representative on the National Democratic Committee, seems the best-versed in the Carter-McGovern connection.

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Returns to Home Duties By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace returned to Montgomery Monday night for his first visit home in more than a month that will allow him sufficient time to tend to state duties from his Capitol Hill office. Arriving from North Carolina Mon- day night and scheduled to depart again for Wisconsin on Friday, the governor will have at least three full week-days to address affairs of state in person. Some of that time, however, likely will be spent in conferences with na- tional campaign staffers, discussing possible campaign strategy changes in an effort to offset unexpectedly poor primary showings seen as setbacks to his presidential bid. Some aides left behind in. the gover- nor's office—while Wallace zigzags across the country in quest of dele- gates to the Democratic nominating convention this summer—are hoping the governor will schedule a press con- ference with local media during his visit home, His last local press conference was Jan. 14 when Wallace gave his highly critical response to the federal court order mandating sweeping changes throughout the prison system. — The last time Wallace made a public -appearance at the Capitol to meet with constituents and a few reporters was the last week in January. His execu- tive secretary, Henry Steagall, said several weeks later that the governor did stop off in his office for a few hours on Sunday, Feb. 15, to tend to paper work. The governor last had a brief week- end respite at the Mansion here Feb. 28, then departed the next day to fulfill a heavy campaign schedule in Mas- sachusetts and Florida. His airplane did land on the Dan-. nelly Field runways March 9 and ‘parked there about half an hour, al- though the governor was not remov from the plane. . Aides said the stop en route to Il- linois was made to pick up campaign personnel. But the landing on Ala- bama soil also meant Wallace could resume steady campaigning without fear he would be stripped of his guber- ‘natorial powers. When a governor is out of state long- er than 20 consecutive days, the mantle of leadership automatically passes to the lieutenant governor. ; Had Wallace not made the brief visit home, he later would have been forced to interrupt crucial campaign stops in Illinois or in North Carolina for a trip back to Alabama.
