        "ocr_text": "China’s stand on religion earns qualified praise U.S. church leaders say they saw no evidence of persecution, although conflicts between church and state occur. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — The Rev. Andrew Young and five other American church leaders gave China a cau- tious accolade Wednesday for allowing the growth of relatively free worship for 10 million offi- cially recognized Chinese Protestants. “We found no sign of religious repression,” Young said as a dele- gation of ministers from the U.S.- based National Council of Churches of Christ finished its . Six-day visit. “Did we find reli- gious freedom in the U.S. sense? No. But we found no religious repression nor active persecu- tion.” Accusations that China is - broadly intolerant of religion are “distorted” and ignore the “vital, recognized and unrecognized public Christian community alive in China,” added the Rev. Albert Pennybacker, the council’s direc- tor for public policy. “That kind of campaign, if you think that’s not tied to the politi- cal campaign of the ultra-rightist people in Congress, then you’re naive about what is at stake here,’’ Pennybacker said. The six delegation members acknowledged that in some instances Chinese local officials have acted against Christian believers, especially those in “charismatic” religious sects that seem “eccentric” by Chinese norms. Young, a former U.S. ambassa- - dor to the United Nations, and the . others made no comment on ? human rights in general, on the government’s treatment of more than 4 million Chinese Catholics, or on the religious situation in Tibet, which they did not visit. The group attended both an authorized Protestant church and unregistered “house church,” ' talked to Protestant pastors and : parishioners in Shanghai, Nanjing ’ and Beijing, and met with govern- ‘ment officials. Their mission, according to a National Council of Churches news release, was “to look at the current status of church-state relations in China.” “They [Chinese officials] would not say there are not incidents that were problematic, clashes between governmental officials and religious officials,” Young said. ‘‘What they insisted is that there is no government policy to persecute the church.” The delegation met Wednesday with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consul- tative Conference, who ranks No. 4 in China’s ruling Communist Party politburo. A report on Chinese state tele- vision quoted Li as telling the vis- itors that although “the Chinese Communists are atheists,” the Chinese government believes that “religious freedom is a fundamen- tal right of the people.” Li was reported as saying that it was “groundless” to believe that “once religious freedom is promoted, atheism will be abandoned.” The Americans’ objective was partly to explain to Chinese lead- ers the new Religious Persecution Act passed this month by the U.S. Congress, which authorizes American diplomatic and eco- nomic sanctions against nations that practice religious persecu- tion. The bill is now on President Clinton’s desk awaiting his SiPpnatt re The ministers said they believe such sanctions against China would end up hurting Chinese Christians, who would be viewed as aligned with a foreign force hostile to China. The National Council of Churches ultimately endorsed the Senate’s version of the legislation after working to make its sanction-triggering mechanism less rigid. But Young said he personally believes Clinton should veto the bill. ““Even in Atlanta, where I’ve lived most of my life, I can’t say that there’s not a single religious per- son that’s not running afoul of governmental policy,” said Young, president-elect of the council of churches. “In fact, we’ve closed lots of churches and we’ve run lots of people off.” Chinese law requires that churches, as with other social organizations, register with the Communist government. The state also restricts religious education, proselytizing and ties with any religious entity outside the country. There are periodic reports of unregistered preachers being detained, meeting places closed or unauthorized shrines shut- tered. However, both the unregis- tered groups and the authorized churches that abide by govern- ment rules have seen _ strong growth in recent years. In the latest state-church clash, the French news agency Agence France-Presse reported Wednes- day that a Catholic priest, the Rev. Wei Jingkum, working for an underground church in Nan- song, had been detained for the last two months. Young’s delegation said the most important thing is that the number of believers is rising. “The church is alive and well in China,” said the Rev. Joan Campbell, general secretary of the council. “People are praying, people are coming to know Jesus. ‘Thousands of people are coming into churches. People are taking communion. Babies are being baptized. And we can be grateful to God for that.’’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 15, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "China may have blocked Web sites of CNN, BBC INet-savvy users have no problem foiling censors oseph Albright =i Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — There are signs that Chinese censors have once again set up electronic barriers aimed at blocking 1 million Internet users in China from accessing the CNN and British Broadcasting Corp. Web sites. : A spokesman for China’s ruling State Council declined Friday to answer a written query on why average Net surfers in Beijing no longer could dial up the CNN Web site. “It’s not an easy question to handle,’’ explained an official in the State Council’s information office. ‘ During the glow of openness before and during President Clinton’s visit this summer, China already had moved to pare down its list of about 100 foreign Inter- met sites that Chinese authorities made inaccessible in 1996 because of their alleged political or pornographic content. Among the sites that were unblocked over the intervening months were those of CNN and the BBC. But this week, the BBC dis- closed that China’s main state- controlled Internet service pro- vider, ChinaNet, was ‘‘believed to be blocking access’’ to major por- tions of its London-based news site. As a result, the BBC said, Web surfers in China were unable to access the BBC’s new Web-based Mandarin-language broadcast and transcript service. However, -it said some BBC English- language news reports remained unaffected. CNN has made no similar disclosure. But systematic tests by the Cox News Service Asia Bureau in Beijing during the last 10 days have found that it was no longer Possible to reach the main CNN Web site — CNN Interactive Chttp://www.cnn.com) — through a direct connection wi China’s Internet. At the same time, other pages of the CNN Web site dealing with sports and finan- ; cial news are accessible. Reached in Atlanta, CNN Inter- active Editor in Chief Scott Woelfel said, ‘‘We know the Chi- nese government has limited access to our site from time to time over the past few years. We oppose this action and urge the People’s Republic to allow its citi- zens free and unfettered access to the Internet at all times. ... No government should restrict its people from Knowing and under- standing world events as por- trayed by CNN.’’ There was no convincing explanation of why China appar- ently has now chosen again to cut off two of the world’s. most widely viewed news Web sites. The action comes at a time when Chi- nese Premier Zhu Rongji is stim- ulating the growth of the Internet in China, and his subordinates are allowing scores of other for- eign Web sites to offer news from inside China and around the globe. At the office of one of China’s major Internet providers, an employee speculated that the CNN site probably had been “banned’”’ by the security authori- ties because it was deemed ‘“‘against the Chinese govern- ment.’”’ But this could not be con- firmed Friday. Asked about the apparent blockage of the CNN site, William Palmer, spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, would com- ment only obliquely. ‘‘The United States believes that the free flow of information is essential to an informed citizenry,’’ he said, ‘‘and to a nation’s political, economic and social development.’” Like the Cold War jamming of shortwave news broadcasts a few years ago, China’s 1990s blockade of electronic news remains far from air-tight. The latest round of Internet censorship seems effective enough to limit the viewing habits of the broad majority of China’s casual Web surfers. But the new measures have not turned out to be much of an impediment for China’s growing minority of net-savvy aficionados, who delight in exchanging custom software settings for detouring around the censors. : Western experts believe that China’s Internet censors are housed inside the sprawling secu- rity compound just east of Tiananmen Square that is China’s equivalent of FBI headquarters. The censors are said to work for the Computer Administration Department, an affiliate of the Public Security Bureau. Privately, some employees at Chinese computer networks have told Western diplomats that, about every two weeks, they receive visits from Chinese secu- rity agents who bring them updated lists of Web sites to be blocked. To carry out these directives, the network controllers report- edly set up computer databases of blocked sites. Then, electronic **filtering’’ software automatically consults these databases to iden- tify and block all communications to and from any Web sites on the list of banned sites. Along with impediments to the CNN and BBC Web sites, tests this week indicated that longtime blockages continue against the news Web sites affiliated with The New York Times and Los Angeles Times. However, many other foreign news sites are not blocked inside China. As of this week, Chinese surfers could freely browse the net affiliates of The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe, Time Maga- zine, CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC and Fox News. The Cox News Service tests involved repeated attempts dur- ing the past 10 days to access news Web sites through the Cox News Service Asia Bureau’s com- puters. Spot checks also were made on two other Beijing com- puters that accessed the Internet through two separate Chinese Internet networks: Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 17, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "(, By Joseph Albright and Marcla Kunstel il barons around the world, take heart: China's leap toward prosperity has caused nearly | million families to switch from bicycles to cars. By itself, the coming of the car culture to China isn’t going to shock the world's oil markets, as did the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, But if the Chinese private-car phenomenon should gain momentum in the next few years just when the rest of Asia is soaring back from its cur- rent economic crisis, the combined impact on world oil prices could be dramatic, The simple mechanism of supply-and-demand could slowly crimp the world oil market in much the same way as members of OPEC did in the oil cartel’s heyday, when they agreed to cut produc: tion quotas — and then stuck to the rules, Gradually, oil would become less available and th price would go up. Already, the number of private cars in China has jumped from virtually zero five years ago to al least 699,000, according to a report by the China Automobile Market Survey and Research Society. ‘China's aut makers are now increasing the pro- duction of passenger sedans by 15 percent a yea ~— “By the year 2000, there will be at least 1 mil- lion privately owned vehicles in China's cities,” the research society declared. “In major munici- vincial capitals, the ownership rate M A NETCEN China ditching bikes for sedans Meanwhile, since 1996, China has “trimmed” the production of bicycles, the China Light Industry News reported last month. It attributed the fall-off to “shrinking market demand” and “accelerated development of the automobile indus- Ty. Although affluence is on the rise in China, the rest of Asia is in a deep recession. This has flat- tened Asia’s spectacular 5 percent-a-year growth in oil consumption that generally kept world prices above $24 a barrel throughout the 1980s, When Asia’s energy demand sagged last year, world oil prices slid by this summer to below $11 a barrel, their lowest level (on an inflation-adjust- ed basis) since 1973, Even so, almost every expert says Asian oil demand will start to rebound fairly soon. When that happens, it will probably spell the end of cheap gasoliné around the world. Writing this March in the American journal “Foreign Affairs,” world oil experts Daniel Yergin, Dennis Eklof and Jefferson Edwards predicted overall Asian energy consumption “will again rise sharply in two or three years” — once Japan and its neighbors solve their internal economic woes. Today, in the lowest trough of the Asian eco- nomic doldrums, Asian countries consume about '{9 million barrels of oil a day. That’s just over one-fourth of the oil that is used worldwide. _ Oil fields in Asia produce only 8 million bar- els for Asia's daily needs; the remaining 11 mil- lion barrels a day must be imported. Three-fourths of Asia’s imported petroleum comes from the Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia by far the largest supplier. “In sum, the prospects for Asia's oil supply A look decidedly grim,” wrote Yergin, Eklof and Edwards. “By 2010, (Asian) productive capacity will have declined 6 percent from its 2005 peak, with new oil field developments unable to compensate for maturing Indonesian, Malaysian and Australian fields, So regardless of exploration, Asia is des- tined to import more than 20 million barrels of oi! * per day by 2010, compared with approximately 1 million today.” China is the newest and fastest-growing cus- tomer for Middle East oil. Until five years ago, China was proud of its status as an “energy-inde- pendent” oil exporter. But thanks to its own mete: oric economic growth, China now imports 25 per- cent of its oil, amounting to | million barrels a day. So far, most is for industrial uses and only a small fraction for private cars. China derives another 3 million barrels a day from domestic oil wells while obtaining the bal- ance of its energy from massive reliance on coal, and hydro-electric and a few nuclear plants, Most of China’s imported oi] now comes from Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, Determined to diversify its oil sources beyond the Persian Gulf, China's national petroleum cor- poration last year outbid some of the biggest Western oil companies for the right to help devel- op some of the choicest Caspian Sea Basin oil properties in Kazakhstan. Still, China’s steep increases in oil imports worries some Chinese energy experts. Early last year retired scientists Yang Jike, the former vice president of China's national environmental pro- tection committee, published a warning that it was better to rely on coal than imported oil. If China allowed its oil imports to increase, “China will get entangled in Middle East politics, like the United States,” Yang wrote.

Officials in China’s northernmost Heilongjiang province have decided that the best way to house Bai and 75,000 other victims of last summer’s floods is in temporary camps consist- ing of brick-lined “‘dugouts.” Each dugout has sandbagged walls that rise a few fe et above ground level and are topped witha roof of: straw and plastic sheeting. The only heating comes from a single brick hearth that doubles as a cook stove. By January, the temperature is ex- pected to reach 22 below zero on the windswept hillside where Bai’s dug- out sits. And even the government worries about finding enough fuel for the dugout dwellers. “Our duty isto ensure thatnovictim of the flood will starve or freeze to death,” said Ma Shu Jie, the provin- cial deputy governor. To Western ears, Ma’s pledge may sound minimal. But accomplishing even that much will be no small feat here in this hardscrabble frontier re- gion that is worlds apart from the glitz and bustle of modern China’s cities. “We are now working out plans to bring 100,000 cubic meters of firewood from north of the province,” Ma said. “But we don’t have enough money to pay for it.” She would also like to bring coal from province mines to the dugouts, but so far there is no money for that either.

Heilonjiang authorities say that not a single human life was lost in the province of 36 million because of their insistent, sometimes forcible, efforts to relocate farmers in advance of the cresting waters. Most dugout dwellers have accepted the government’s determination about their future with the kind of resigned stoicism that has character- ized China’s farmers, now 900 million strong, for most of the past 5,000 years. Bai, however, i§an exception. She is hoping to go her own way with her 2- month-old daughter. “The baby can’t live in such cold in the winter. It’s dark and wethere,” Bai said. “I'll go to my relatives’ home. There isn’t much room, but it will be better than here.” Her husband and his parents will weather the winter in the dugout. Across China, more than 5.8 million families lost their homes in August and September floods that killed more than 3,600 people and caused losses estimated at $30 billion. Besides this northern province, the hardest-hit areas were in the warmer climes of central and south-central China, where victims can expect a less- punishing winter.

It is a region of jolting contrasts, where wealth from the Daqing 0il fields allows even small cities luxurious indoor swimming arcades and multi-level depart- ment stores, while hundreds of thousands of poor farmers live in mud houses without plumbing. About 10 miles from Bai’s dug- out, recent visitors were led to a nearly completed village of 112 solidly built brick duplex houses. Local leaders said the houses will be assigned to flood refugees, but probably not until next spring. Jiao Ming Zhe, head of the Hujitumo town propaganda com- mittee, said construction crews had not had time to put in the ceilings meant to go under the roofs. What’s more, the planned hookups for water, electricity and cable television have yet to be installed. And in any case, Deputy Gov. Ma said the roughly 75,000 dugout dwellers scattered in camps throughout western Heilongjiang do not have first priority in ob- taining the new brick duplexes. “The victims in the dugouts are considered to be living in very good shelters. The new houses Austin American-Statesman - October 25, 1998 (Continued) should be used for people living in other people’s homes,”’’ she said, referring to the more than 1.4 million other homeless flood vic- tims in this province, whoare now doubling up in mud farmhouses or tiny city apartments offriendsand relatives. The deputy governor said the Heilongjiang government has no thought of moving the rural dug- out dwellers into the hundreds of vacant apartments in modern high-rise cities such as Harbin, the provincial capital of 5 million people. “The victims are farmers,’’ Ma explained. ‘“‘They have to be near their land to prepare for farming next year.”’ The central feature of the shel- ters, which measure 9-by-18 feet, is a plastic-covered brick platform used as a bed. One end contains a wood-burning oven that not only provides for cooking, but heats the platform bed and radiates some warmth into the room. Firewood is the biggest worry of the refugees. “Now what we need most is wood to make fires, because the trees and the grass are all wet,”’ said Chen Ling Ji, 52. Without firewood, the refugees fear they will freeze to death once winter sets in. \f"

Six prosecutors are seeking to convict the nation’s most charismatic politician of covering up homosexual sex acts with former office stbordinates and others. The jailed defendant is Anwar Ibrahim, 51, who was sacked as deputy prime minister in September and could face up to 34 years in prison and a public whipping if convicted, He has pleaded not guilty to the five charges of sodomy and five charges of “corruption” growing out of his alleged attempts to cover up “unnatural” sexual conduct. “Of course I have to expect the best and be prepared for the worst,” Anwar’s 45-year-old wife and most vocal defend- er, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, said in an interview on the eve of the trial. Like Washington's Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Anwar case promises to drag on for months, producing a stream of kinky sexual details and politically charged innuendoes that will roil Malay- sia well into next year, After an opening 12-day barrage of testimony, the trial will recess in mid- November while Malaysia hosts the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Coopera- tion summit. President Clinton and more than a dozen other foreign heads of state will converge on Kuala Lumpur, the cap- ital, for two days of talks on the world economic crisis. Testimony is set to resume in Decem- ber, and there will be further trial ses- sions in February, March, April and June, according to a trial calendar released by Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah.

        "ocr_text": " tw .S. warmth to Taiwan, “Tibet chills China leaders joseph Albright aed Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — Chinese leaders are ‘irritated at President Clinton, who no longer appears the wise, _. benevolent partner they thought “he was this summer. The officials are expressing “strong displeasure” at Clinton’s “@ecision to dispatch U.S. Energy “Secretary Bill Richardson to Tai- wan this week. And the Chinese _ also are sounding hurt and angry '-on the resurgent issue of Tibet. Next week, Clinton may get a _¢hance to hear some of the criti- -Cism firsthand. He plans. to meet for an hour with Chinese Presi- dent Jiang Zemin in a mini- summit during a break in meet- ings of 21 world leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Coopera- tion forum in Malaysia. On Tibet, the Chinese are voic- ing frustration that Clinton met with the Dalai Lama at the White House for 30 minutes Tues- day, disregard- ing China’s loud objections that Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader is “playing tricks”’ to win Tibetan independ- ence. “The Dalai Lama has for a long time engaged in activities to split the motherland and preached independence for Tibet,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said. “To this day, he has not repent- ed,” Zhu said. ““‘We ask U.S. lead- ers not to meet the Dalai Lama to avoid harming China-U.S. rela- tions.”’ On Taiwan, Chinese statements reflect bitterness that Clinton is allowing continuing official American contacts with Taiwan, ‘despite his June 30 pledge in Shanghai not to support Taiwan- ese independence. “The U.S. side . . . has seriousl violated the principles in the three Sino-U.S. joint communi- ques and the United States com- mitment not to have official con- tacts with Taiwan,” Zhu said, citing a quarter-century of Amer- ican statements dating back to the Nixon administration. Richardson, Clinton’s former U.N. ambassador and diplomatic ‘troubleshooter, addressed a busi- ‘mess meeting in Taiwan and then met with Taiwanese President ‘Lee Teng-hui. Using Richardson’s presence to make his case that ‘Taiwan is an established fact, the Taiwanese leader said Taiwan’s gwovernment “not only exists, but also strenuously upholds democ- axacy and freedom.”’ China responded Wednesday by escalating its criticism. The official Xinhua news agency quoted a top Chinese military commander as expressing “seri- ous concern” over the Taiwan and Tibet developments. Washington should “strictly abide” by commitments to avoid all official contacts with Taiwan, Gen. Zhang Wannian, vice- chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, said after a meeting with the visiting Ameri- can Pacific Fleet commander, Adm. Joseph Prueher. China’s recent words reflect a remarkable change in tone from the warm glow that suffused Beijing rhetoric about the United States for the first three months after Clinton’s June 23-July 3 state visit. “A wise and practical move,” said the Chinese Foreign Ministry in July after Clinton signed a trade measure. And in Septem- ber, with Clinton facing possible impeachment, China declared that the president’s “difficulties” would not affect American- Chinese ties, which had reached “a new stage of development” thanks in part to Clinton’s “active contribution.’ But over the last six weeks “U.S. Trade Criticism Unfair”’ was the headline over an editorial in the official China Daily on Sept. 30, after U.S. officials expressed concern about China’s estimated $60 billion-a-year trade surplus with America. Two weeks later, China accused the U.S. House of Repre- sentatives of “a rude infringe- ment of China’s sovereignty” for supporting Taiwan’s entry in the World Trade Organization. China has so far refrained from using the heaviest bludgeons in its diplomatic vocabulary. For instance, China did not say it “strongly demands”’ compliance with its wishes, as it did this sum- mer when it sought to dislodge its smaller neighbor Vietnam from a disputed reef in the South China Sea.

Hall quoted vice minister of foreign affairs Kim Gye Gwan as telling him during five hours of face-to-face talks: ‘‘We won’t sell our sovereignty rights to pur- chase food.” Interviewed by telephone from a stop-over in South Korea, Hall said his driving tours of southern and northeastern areas of North Korea suggested malnutrition continues to be widespread throughout the countryside, even though conditions in the capital Pyongyang appear to have improved slightly since his last visit about a year ago. “I saw grave markers on almost every hill,” said Hall of his drives outside Pyongyang during a five-day North Korean visit. ““You know they’re new because they are white, while the older ones are gray and worn.” Hall said he was told by offi- cials of the United Nations Chil- dren’s Fund in North Korea that , 95 percent of water throughout -the country is contaminated and that 30 percent of North Korean children below the age of 2 are “acutely malnourished.”’ He said he questioned some 50 foreign humanitarian workers in North Korea on whether they knew of evidence that Western food aid for hungry civilians was being diverted to feed the army and other security technicians, as was charged recently by the international relief group Doc- tors Without Borders. “They said that food aid is not being diverted in any large-scale way,” said Hall, who said he was convinced that with some excep- tions, donated Western food was reaching people in real need. The Dayton congressman said he would return to Washington to caution colleagues that the United States should try to avoid a needless confrontation with North Korea. “T would say we’ve got to be careful about rattling our sabers,”’ Hall said. “‘We’ve got to be firm, but we have got to be patient. We shouldn’t connect the issues of humanitarian aid to the issue of site visits. If we do that, we will force a confrontation.” Hall spoke just three days before Charles Kartman, a high- level U.S. State Department offi- cial, is due in the North Kor capital to press for access to the nuclear site. He said he was cerned about recent news re from Washington suggestinge Kartman will insist on inspecting the underground site near the city of Yongbyon, where Amefi#® can surveillance cameras spotted’ more than 10,000 workers last August. iat, Hall, asked what he had = isyau learned from North Korean off) cials about the suspected under; ground plutonium-making facili; { ty, said, “I didn’t learn anything; < about it.

The drop in Russian purchases comes on top of declining demand from the Asian countries in economic distress for more than a year. At the same time, currency devaluations in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea have made China’s products less competitive in markets elsewhere in the world. Altogether, these factors pulled down China’s exports in September by 6.7 per- cent compared with the previous year. In July and August, before Russia’s crisis boiled over, China’s export drop had been 2.2 percent. Last year, Chinese exports grew 21 percent.

Atlanta Journal-Constitution series - November 15, 1998 (Continued) > \fBy Joseph Albright Kiara Payung, Indonesia undreds of thousands of chil- dren in once-prosperous vil- lages like this are dropping out of school and going hun- gry as Indonesia lurches into a Great Leap Backward. “T don’t go to school anymore,” says Supendi, a skinny 13-year-old boy with festering sores on his leg. Until six months ago, he attended the local public school that required a fee of 3,000 rupiahs (40 cents) a month. “My mother doesn’t have enough money to pay the fee,” says Supendi, who, like many Indonesians, uses a single name. So the boy lounges away the muggy midday heat by crouching on a tin-roofed porch and listening to the barefoot men talk about ‘the old days” just one year ago. That’s when ordinary people could afford to eat lamb or chicken at least three times a week, recounts one of the storytellers, His name is Mista, and he is a 23-year-old laid-off factory worker. Mista lost his $25-a-week job in a choc- olate factory six months ago. He says he doesn’t blame the factory for firing him, nor does he expect to be rehired, “The company had to buy materials from abroad, and it got too expensive,” Mista says. It’s only been a year since this fast- growing nation of more than 200 million people was dragged down by the riptide of the Asian economic crisis, In that time, the world’s fourth most populous country has seen its economy shrink by about 55 percent, inflation shoot up to 80 percent a year and its banking system go into vir- tual paralysis, with no loans made or col- lected. Indonesia is the country worst hit by the Asian economic crisis. Its suffering will cast a long shadow over the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this week, as Indonesia and the region’s other leaders press for measures to make sure that their people never endure a similar descent. World Bank specialist Richard New- farmer estimates that school enrollment throughout Indonesia has already dropped from 78 percent to 54 percent, as parents such as Supendi’s find even the nominal school fees too high to bear. In two years the number of Indone- sians living below the poverty line has shot up from 20 million to an estimated 100 million, dragging Indonesia down to a level of impoverishment it had not known since it was an underdeveloped backwa- ter in the 1960s. Mista says he, his wife and their 2- year-old daughter haven't eaten meat in three months. Today they eat rice from the market and fruits that they can find growing wild, such as jackfruit. “That’s the cheapest; at least it’s filling,” he says In Kiara Payung (population 10,400), children don't suffer . ae . the near-starvation of refugee camps in Sudan or Ethiopia. But Tintin, the village pregnancy nurse, has just reported to the district health office that in August she came across 12 cases of malnutrition among children she treated who were under 5 years old. The district health office says that another 35 malnutrition cases were reported in four nearby vil- lages, By comparison, the deprivation of the Asian crisis looks less acute in the capi- tal, Jakarta — even in neighborhoods torn apart by last May’s anti-Chinese riots that burned scores of Chinese- owned shopping plazas and killed nearly 1,200 people. More rioting broke out last week as Indonesian security forces bat- tled rock-throwing protesters and street mobs attacked suspected police inform- ers, F.M. Mendrofa, who has reopened his furniture store in the burned-out Ciledug Plaza riot corridor, complains that banks won't lend money, that prices of materials have skyrocketed and that “everything is unstable.” Somehow, he says, he manages to sell about two mattresses every day. For the poorest city-dwellers, the only way to avoid hunger has been to resort to “informal” occupations that most Indone- sians consider degrading, such as singing for a few rupiahs beside cars at stop- lights. Or hunting for metal and plastic bags at the Jakarta municipal dump. Somehow, they are surviving, Atlanta Journal-Constitution series - November 15, 1998 (Continued) > \fS. Korea: Controls hit middle class By Marcia Kunstel Seoul S outh Korea is not a scene of starvation and ram- pant poverty. It is the story of a proud and new mid- dle class suddenly gutted. “T never thought I would be on the layoff list,” said Cho In-Ho, 51, a gaunt and sorrow-- ful man still unnerved over losing his job as a senior man- ager at a book publishing company in February. Quarrels at home led to divorce. Now Cho sleeps on a blanket on the spotless yellow linoleum of a homeless shelter begun in May by a Buddhist order and the city govern- ment. Unemployment has tripled in a year and is expected to quadruple to 2 million, a rate of 10 percent. The gross domestic product is predicted to contract 6.5 percent this year, then another 2 percent in 1999. At least one-third of Korea’s conglomerates, known as chaebol, are bank- rupt or surviving on govern- ment emergency loans. Through unrelenting work, Koreans pulled up the gross . domestic product per person « from $1,200 to $14,200 in less than two decades. The fruits of that labor are disappearing. Wounded spirits are not confined to the 3,000 home- less in 80 emergency shelters, established to collect the fall- - out from punishing financial and monetary controls the International Monetary Fund. imposed in its $58 billion bail- out package in November 1997, “Usually a banker is a middle-class, stable job,” said. Shim []-Sun, the president of a federation of banking unions, ° who has seen 35,000 bank workers lose jobs since the IMF stepped in. “Now there is fear, psychological frustra- tion, loss of social status.” Around the city, store plac- 3 ards announce IMF going-out- of business sales. Subway ~ computer ads cite the IMF bogeyman, warning readers to learn new job skills or risk ~ sacking. Koreans routinely refer to life as it was before vs. what it has become since the diminishing, daily life changes the IMF wrought one year ago. The IMF, an international lending agency in which the United States plays a major backstage role, tries to save financially stressed nations from defaulting on interna- — tional obligations. To get bail- out loans, countries usually must swallow economic aus- terity policies. “People say the IMF made . the situation worse, with demands for high interest rates and open markets,” said Society, a suitication of of the Citizens’ Coalition for Eco- nomic Justice. “Social unrest is a profound concern,” said Yoo Jang-Hee, economist and dean of gradu- ate international studies at Ewha Women’s University in Seoul. He and others believe the country’s essentially demo- cratic processes have helped . defuse social disruption, but . they wonder what will happen as more Koreans exhaust their savings and patience. Some already are forced . into desperate solutions such as Dong Myung Children’s Home, a cheerful, noisy mix of kids and toys and hamsters. The orphanage’s vice presi- dent, Kim Kwang-Bin, said his complex soon will be 20 children beyond the capacity of 65, now that the city asked orphanages to temporarily help overwhelmed families. He expects another 30 per- cent increase next year. “The parents love their children and want to care for them,” Kim said, “but they canngt.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution series - November 15, 1998 (Continued) > \fcajole or coerce into leaving, © Skeptics wonder whether the == Tokyo, But Yamaguchi said they a K defying the once inviolable Japa- banks will do better with the new — buy small and less.

World Bank specialist Richard New- farmer estimates that school enrollment throughout Indonesia has already dropped from 78 percent to 54 percent, as parents such as Supendi’s find even the nominal school fees too high to bear. In two years the number of Indone- sians living below the poverty line has shot up from 20 million to an estimated 100 million, dragging Indonesia down to a level of impoverishment it had not known since it was an underdeveloped backwa- ter in the 1960s. Mista says he, his wife and their 2- year-old daughter haven't eaten meat in three months. Today they eat rice from the market and fruits that they can find growing wild, such as jackfruit. “That’s the cheapest; at least it’s filling,” he says In Kiara Payung (population 10,400), children don't suffer . ae . the near-starvation of refugee camps in Sudan or Ethiopia. But Tintin, the village pregnancy nurse, has just reported to the district health office that in August she came across 12 cases of malnutrition among children she treated who were under 5 years old. The district health office says that another 35 malnutrition cases were reported in four nearby vil- lages, By comparison, the deprivation of the Asian crisis looks less acute in the capi- tal, Jakarta — even in neighborhoods torn apart by last May’s anti-Chinese riots that burned scores of Chinese- owned shopping plazas and killed nearly 1,200 people.

Mendrofa, who has reopened his furniture store in the burned-out Ciledug Plaza riot corridor, complains that banks won't lend money, that prices of materials have skyrocketed and that “everything is unstable.” Somehow, he says, he manages to sell about two mattresses every day. For the poorest city-dwellers, the only way to avoid hunger has been to resort to “informal” occupations that most Indone- sians consider degrading, such as singing for a few rupiahs beside cars at stop- lights.

Korea: Controls hit middle class By Marcia Kunstel Seoul S outh Korea is not a scene of starvation and ram- pant poverty. It is the story of a proud and new mid- dle class suddenly gutted. “T never thought I would be on the layoff list,” said Cho In-Ho, 51, a gaunt and sorrow-- ful man still unnerved over losing his job as a senior man- ager at a book publishing company in February. Quarrels at home led to divorce. Now Cho sleeps on a blanket on the spotless yellow linoleum of a homeless shelter begun in May by a Buddhist order and the city govern- ment. Unemployment has tripled in a year and is expected to quadruple to 2 million, a rate of 10 percent. The gross domestic product is predicted to contract 6.5 percent this year, then another 2 percent in 1999. At least one-third of Korea’s conglomerates, known as chaebol, are bank- rupt or surviving on govern- ment emergency loans. Through unrelenting work, Koreans pulled up the gross . domestic product per person « from $1,200 to $14,200 in less than two decades. The fruits of that labor are disappearing. Wounded spirits are not confined to the 3,000 home- less in 80 emergency shelters, established to collect the fall- - out from punishing financial and monetary controls the International Monetary Fund. imposed in its $58 billion bail- out package in November 1997, “Usually a banker is a middle-class, stable job,” said.

Koreans routinely refer to life as it was before vs. what it has become since the diminishing, daily life changes the IMF wrought one year ago. The IMF, an international lending agency in which the United States plays a major backstage role, tries to save financially stressed nations from defaulting on interna- — tional obligations. To get bail- out loans, countries usually must swallow economic aus- terity policies. “People say the IMF made . the situation worse, with demands for high interest rates and open markets,” said Society, a suitication of of the Citizens’ Coalition for Eco- nomic Justice. “Social unrest is a profound concern,” said Yoo Jang-Hee, economist and dean of gradu- ate international studies at Ewha Women’s University in Seoul. He and others believe the country’s essentially demo- cratic processes have helped . defuse social disruption, but . they wonder what will happen as more Koreans exhaust their savings and patience. Some already are forced . into desperate solutions such as Dong Myung Children’s Home, a cheerful, noisy mix of kids and toys and hamsters. The orphanage’s vice presi- dent, Kim Kwang-Bin, said his complex soon will be 20 children beyond the capacity of 65, now that the city asked orphanages to temporarily help overwhelmed families. He expects another 30 per- cent increase next year. “The parents love their children and want to care for them,” Kim said, “but they canngt.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution series - November 15, 1998 (Continued) > \fcajole or coerce into leaving, © Skeptics wonder whether the == Tokyo, But Yamaguchi said they a K defying the once inviolable Japa- banks will do better with the new — buy small and less.

The only thing lacking are Russian buy- ers. “Sales are down more than 90 percent,” said Zheng Jiaodi, a Chinese entrepreneur catering to Russian clients who, until this summer, used to take containers full of goods back to Russia for retail sale. “It started getting bad when the Russian money began to depreciate,” said Zheng, who is shocked at the sudden collapse of one of Beijing’s most bustling, lucrative specialty markets. Zheng, 33, has more at stake than just the women’s coats and jackets hung ceiling to floor in her cubicle of a shop. She rents -an entire building and sublets space to 17 other wholesalers also dependent on the Russian trade. “For this period, the income won’t even cover the rent,” she said. The sales slump in the warren of stores and open-air stalls packing this market is one symptom of how the Asian economic contagion has spread. And it raises ques- tions of whether China still may catch the malaise. Russia’s wide-ranging economic prob- lems produced a meltdown in August — the sudden devaluation of the ruble and a moratorium on foreign credit repayments. In a world economic atmosphere already burdened by the Asian crisis, the Interna- Another slow dey The “Russian Market” in Beijing is stocked with everything but the buyers, who used to purchase huge quantities of goods to resell in Russia. tional Monetary Fund and big industrial countries couldn’t stop the Russian crash. Jittery foreign investors stampeded not only to exit Russia, but also to get out of emerging markets around the world. Russia’s fall has landed one more punch to China’s economy. The drop in Russian purchases comes on top of declining demand from the Asian countries in economic distress for more than a year. At the same time, currency devaluations in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea have made China’s products less competitive in markets elsewhere in the world. Altogether, these factors pulled down China’s exports in September by 6.7 per- cent compared with the previous year. In July and August, before Russia’s crisis boiled over, China’s export drop had been 2.2 percent. Last year, Chinese exports grew 21 percent. To prevent sliding into a Japanese-style recession, China has resorted to massive state spending on infrastructure projects and has backed off attempts to reform Chi- na’s old, inefficient industrial sector. One crucial unknown is whether China will be forced to devalue its currency in an attempt to revive exports. China has vowed dozens of times not to devalue — a move that could ignite a fire sale of competitive devaluations throughout Asia and delay the region’s recovery for several years. The absence of Russian buyers doesn’t cause trouble merely for the sellers in this one corner of Beijing. Li Shu Yi peddled a variety of goods including traditional Russian black fur hats at her open-air stall one recent afternoon. Her Chinese-produced knockoffs were so good they even had a Russian-language label saying “made in Novosibirsk,” a major city in Siberia. But she wasn’t selling much. “(Russian customers] used to order goods worth a million renminbi (nearly $125,000) at a time, but no more,” Li sighed. “The manufacturers of the hats have many goods stored in their factory that they can’t sell.” Like the hat factory outside Beijing, Chi- nese factories that would be pumping out coats and sweaters for the Russian market have a hard time keeping workers busy. “T think this is going to bring big prob- lems to China,” she said. “Sure I worry. ae should be the hot season, but it’s very d.” Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright are based in Beijing for Cox Newspapers. Atlanta Journal-Constitution series - November 15, 1998 (Continued) > \fBy Joseph Albright Kiara Payung, Indonesia undreds of thousands of chil- dren in once-prosperous vil- lages like this are dropping out of school and going hun- gry as Indonesia lurches into a Great Leap Backward. “T don’t go to school anymore,” says Supendi, a skinny 13-year-old boy with festering sores on his leg. Until six months ago, he attended the local public school that required a fee of 3,000 rupiahs (40 cents) a month. “My mother doesn’t have enough money to pay the fee,” says Supendi, who, like many Indonesians, uses a single name. So the boy lounges away the muggy midday heat by crouching on a tin-roofed porch and listening to the barefoot men talk about ‘the old days” just one year ago. That’s when ordinary people could afford to eat lamb or chicken at least three times a week, recounts one of the storytellers, His name is Mista, and he is a 23-year-old laid-off factory worker. Mista lost his $25-a-week job in a choc- olate factory six months ago. He says he doesn’t blame the factory for firing him, nor does he expect to be rehired, “The company had to buy materials from abroad, and it got too expensive,” Mista says. It’s only been a year since this fast- growing nation of more than 200 million people was dragged down by the riptide of the Asian economic crisis, In that time, the world’s fourth most populous country has seen its economy shrink by about 55 percent, inflation shoot up to 80 percent a year and its banking system go into vir- tual paralysis, with no loans made or col- lected. Indonesia is the country worst hit by the Asian economic crisis. Its suffering will cast a long shadow over the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this week, as Indonesia and the region’s other leaders press for measures to make sure that their people never endure a similar descent.

The only thing lacking are Russian buy- ers. “Sales are down more than 90 percent,” said Zheng Jiaodi, a Chinese entrepreneur catering to Russian clients who, until this summer, used to take containers full of goods back to Russia for retail sale. “It started getting bad when the Russian money began to depreciate,” said Zheng, who is shocked at the sudden collapse of one of Beijing’s most bustling, lucrative specialty markets. Zheng, 33, has more at stake than just the women’s coats and jackets hung ceiling to floor in her cubicle of a shop. She rents -an entire building and sublets space to 17 other wholesalers also dependent on the Russian trade. “For this period, the income won’t even cover the rent,” she said. The sales slump in the warren of stores and open-air stalls packing this market is one symptom of how the Asian economic contagion has spread. And it raises ques- tions of whether China still may catch the malaise. Russia’s wide-ranging economic prob- lems produced a meltdown in August — the sudden devaluation of the ruble and a moratorium on foreign credit repayments. In a world economic atmosphere already burdened by the Asian crisis, the Interna- Another slow dey The “Russian Market” in Beijing is stocked with everything but the buyers, who used to purchase huge quantities of goods to resell in Russia. tional Monetary Fund and big industrial countries couldn’t stop the Russian crash. Jittery foreign investors stampeded not only to exit Russia, but also to get out of emerging markets around the world. Russia’s fall has landed one more punch to China’s economy. The drop in Russian purchases comes on top of declining demand from the Asian countries in economic distress for more than a year. At the same time, currency devaluations in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea have made China’s products less competitive in markets elsewhere in the world. Altogether, these factors pulled down China’s exports in September by 6.7 per- cent compared with the previous year. In July and August, before Russia’s crisis boiled over, China’s export drop had been 2.2 percent. Last year, Chinese exports grew 21 percent. To prevent sliding into a Japanese-style recession, China has resorted to massive state spending on infrastructure projects and has backed off attempts to reform Chi- na’s old, inefficient industrial sector. One crucial unknown is whether China will be forced to devalue its currency in an attempt to revive exports. China has vowed dozens of times not to devalue — a move that could ignite a fire sale of competitive devaluations throughout Asia and delay the region’s recovery for several years. The absence of Russian buyers doesn’t cause trouble merely for the sellers in this one corner of Beijing. Li Shu Yi peddled a variety of goods including traditional Russian black fur hats at her open-air stall one recent afternoon. Her Chinese-produced knockoffs were so good they even had a Russian-language label saying “made in Novosibirsk,” a major city in Siberia. But she wasn’t selling much. “(Russian customers] used to order goods worth a million renminbi (nearly $125,000) at a time, but no more,” Li sighed. “The manufacturers of the hats have many goods stored in their factory that they can’t sell.” Like the hat factory outside Beijing, Chi- nese factories that would be pumping out coats and sweaters for the Russian market have a hard time keeping workers busy. “T think this is going to bring big prob- lems to China,” she said. “Sure I worry. ae should be the hot season, but it’s very d.” Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright are based in Beijing for Cox Newspapers. Atlanta Journal-Constitution series - November 15, 1998 (Continued) > \fBy Joseph Albright Kiara Payung, Indonesia undreds of thousands of chil- dren in once-prosperous vil- lages like this are dropping out of school and going hun- gry as Indonesia lurches into a Great Leap Backward. “T don’t go to school anymore,” says Supendi, a skinny 13-year-old boy with festering sores on his leg. Until six months ago, he attended the local public school that required a fee of 3,000 rupiahs (40 cents) a month. “My mother doesn’t have enough money to pay the fee,” says Supendi, who, like many Indonesians, uses a single name. So the boy lounges away the muggy midday heat by crouching on a tin-roofed porch and listening to the barefoot men talk about ‘the old days” just one year ago. That’s when ordinary people could afford to eat lamb or chicken at least three times a week, recounts one of the storytellers, His name is Mista, and he is a 23-year-old laid-off factory worker. Mista lost his $25-a-week job in a choc- olate factory six months ago. He says he doesn’t blame the factory for firing him, nor does he expect to be rehired, “The company had to buy materials from abroad, and it got too expensive,” Mista says. It’s only been a year since this fast- growing nation of more than 200 million people was dragged down by the riptide of the Asian economic crisis, In that time, the world’s fourth most populous country has seen its economy shrink by about 55 percent, inflation shoot up to 80 percent a year and its banking system go into vir- tual paralysis, with no loans made or col- lected. Indonesia is the country worst hit by the Asian economic crisis. Its suffering will cast a long shadow over the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this week, as Indonesia and the region’s other leaders press for measures to make sure that their people never endure a similar descent. World Bank specialist Richard New- farmer estimates that school enrollment throughout Indonesia has already dropped from 78 percent to 54 percent, as parents such as Supendi’s find even the nominal school fees too high to bear. In two years the number of Indone- sians living below the poverty line has shot up from 20 million to an estimated 100 million, dragging Indonesia down to a level of impoverishment it had not known since it was an underdeveloped backwa- ter in the 1960s. Mista says he, his wife and their 2- year-old daughter haven't eaten meat in three months. Today they eat rice from the market and fruits that they can find growing wild, such as jackfruit. “That’s the cheapest; at least it’s filling,” he says In Kiara Payung (population 10,400), children don't suffer . ae . the near-starvation of refugee camps in Sudan or Ethiopia. But Tintin, the village pregnancy nurse, has just reported to the district health office that in August she came across 12 cases of malnutrition among children she treated who were under 5 years old. The district health office says that another 35 malnutrition cases were reported in four nearby vil- lages, By comparison, the deprivation of the Asian crisis looks less acute in the capi- tal, Jakarta — even in neighborhoods torn apart by last May’s anti-Chinese riots that burned scores of Chinese- owned shopping plazas and killed nearly 1,200 people. More rioting broke out last week as Indonesian security forces bat- tled rock-throwing protesters and street mobs attacked suspected police inform- ers, F.M. Mendrofa, who has reopened his furniture store in the burned-out Ciledug Plaza riot corridor, complains that banks won't lend money, that prices of materials have skyrocketed and that “everything is unstable.” Somehow, he says, he manages to sell about two mattresses every day. For the poorest city-dwellers, the only way to avoid hunger has been to resort to “informal” occupations that most Indone- sians consider degrading, such as singing for a few rupiahs beside cars at stop- lights. Or hunting for metal and plastic bags at the Jakarta municipal dump. Somehow, they are surviving, Atlanta Journal-Constitution series - November 15, 1998 (Continued) > \fS. Korea: Controls hit middle class By Marcia Kunstel Seoul S outh Korea is not a scene of starvation and ram- pant poverty. It is the story of a proud and new mid- dle class suddenly gutted. “T never thought I would be on the layoff list,” said Cho In-Ho, 51, a gaunt and sorrow-- ful man still unnerved over losing his job as a senior man- ager at a book publishing company in February. Quarrels at home led to divorce. Now Cho sleeps on a blanket on the spotless yellow linoleum of a homeless shelter begun in May by a Buddhist order and the city govern- ment. Unemployment has tripled in a year and is expected to quadruple to 2 million, a rate of 10 percent. The gross domestic product is predicted to contract 6.5 percent this year, then another 2 percent in 1999. At least one-third of Korea’s conglomerates, known as chaebol, are bank- rupt or surviving on govern- ment emergency loans. Through unrelenting work, Koreans pulled up the gross . domestic product per person « from $1,200 to $14,200 in less than two decades. The fruits of that labor are disappearing. Wounded spirits are not confined to the 3,000 home- less in 80 emergency shelters, established to collect the fall- - out from punishing financial and monetary controls the International Monetary Fund. imposed in its $58 billion bail- out package in November 1997, “Usually a banker is a middle-class, stable job,” said. Shim []-Sun, the president of a federation of banking unions, ° who has seen 35,000 bank workers lose jobs since the IMF stepped in. “Now there is fear, psychological frustra- tion, loss of social status.” Around the city, store plac- 3 ards announce IMF going-out- of business sales. Subway ~ computer ads cite the IMF bogeyman, warning readers to learn new job skills or risk ~ sacking. Koreans routinely refer to life as it was before vs. what it has become since the diminishing, daily life changes the IMF wrought one year ago. The IMF, an international lending agency in which the United States plays a major backstage role, tries to save financially stressed nations from defaulting on interna- — tional obligations. To get bail- out loans, countries usually must swallow economic aus- terity policies. “People say the IMF made . the situation worse, with demands for high interest rates and open markets,” said Society, a suitication of of the Citizens’ Coalition for Eco- nomic Justice. “Social unrest is a profound concern,” said Yoo Jang-Hee, economist and dean of gradu- ate international studies at Ewha Women’s University in Seoul. He and others believe the country’s essentially demo- cratic processes have helped . defuse social disruption, but . they wonder what will happen as more Koreans exhaust their savings and patience. Some already are forced . into desperate solutions such as Dong Myung Children’s Home, a cheerful, noisy mix of kids and toys and hamsters. The orphanage’s vice presi- dent, Kim Kwang-Bin, said his complex soon will be 20 children beyond the capacity of 65, now that the city asked orphanages to temporarily help overwhelmed families. He expects another 30 per- cent increase next year. “The parents love their children and want to care for them,” Kim said, “but they canngt.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution series - November 15, 1998 (Continued) > \fcajole or coerce into leaving, © Skeptics wonder whether the == Tokyo, But Yamaguchi said they a K defying the once inviolable Japa- banks will do better with the new — buy small and less.

        "ocr_text": "Asia wary as summit approaches Gore to meet with . leaders of nations facing bleak financial future. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — Shellshocked by an unrelenting financial crisis, Asians are in a sour mood as they await world leaders for this week’s economic summit. And the near future doesn’t look any better for them. Maybe worse. Japan, the potential locomo- tive of an Asian recovery, is stranded in its worst post-World War II recession and keeps slashing imports from the rest of Asia. Even China’s long-vibrant economy seems on the verge of stagnating. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who will host Vice President Al Gore — a last-minute replacement for President Clinton, who remained stateside to deal with the Iraqi crisis — and 20 other Pacific Rim leaders at the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, has vilified Western institutions in caustic language seldom heard from a world leader since the end of the Cold War. Blaming the Asian crisis on “Western capitalist greed” and financial bungling by the American-backed International Monetary Fund, Mahathir accused the West of “a desire to dominate the Asians and stop them from developing.” But many Malaysians blame Mahathir, and thousands of them rallied Saturday, scream- ing anti-government slogans and surging toward the hotel where Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was taken after her arrival here. They were forced back by riot police and water cannons. Other participants in the annual summit will be more dip- lomatic than the crusty Mahathir. But Gore and Albright are likely to find other leaders who are obstinate about ticklish trade issues such as Japan’s renewed efforts to shield mar- kets against American exports. “It is inexcusable for the second-largest economy in the world and the largest economy in Asia not to fulfill its responsi- bilities,” U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Richard W. Fisher complained recently after Japan said it couldn’t keep its promises from an earlier summit to cut its tariffs on forest products and fish. ~ Japan and South Korea, the région’s leaders, remain baffled about why the 16-month-old Asian crisis has endured so long. Meanwhile, tens of millions of Asians from Indonesia to South Korea face another year of unemployment — still without a safety net. And per-capita income is projected to decline next year in India, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Asia’s “financial typhoon” has left a trail of devastation “far greater than anyone imagined,” Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said recently.

It also dripped inside vot- ing booths and seeped into the ‘cardboard ballot boxes, appar- ‘ently smearing scores of ballots. ‘The village election committee ‘declared more than one-fourth of sthe votes invalid, throwing the -final outcome into ‘doubt. : One result was clear: the 2incumbent village boss ran third, -behind a surprisingly strong =showing by a maverick village - businessman who campaigned as an unauthorized write-in candi- «date. Another village Communist ‘also ran ahead of the incumbent. It was the latest of the elec- “tions — some fair, some cooked — held at the rock-bottom rung of governance in China’s 930,000 villages. Wednesday’s election, which _ drew more than 98 percent of Ya ~ Ai villagers over 18, was the sec- ~ ond time in 12 days that the local “Communist Party branch got a “sample of those nasty surprise E oe that democratic pro- . cesses can land on a ruling elite. ij “Of course, to villagers, the vil- * lage committee is more important -than the Communist Party,” ~ explained Peng Bi Wu, a 36-year- .old mother and farmer in this - rice-growing village in southern * China.

The purpose of village elections still is to let off just enough steam to ensure stability in the sometimes raucous and unpredictable countryside, where 900 million of China’s 1.2 billion people live. However it turns out, the elec- tion in Ya Ai was supposed to be a model for three busloads of observers who bounced up dirt roads, past the dripping flowers of tea-oil camellia bushes, to view this first balloting he!4 under Chi- na’s newly revised village elec- tion law. Viewing this election was part of a training program for bureau- crats of Hunan Province, a rolling expanse of rivers and rice fields with 64.6 million people. Carter Center experts were on hand to teach them how to computerize data for a pilot project that ulti- mately aims to give a nationwide picture cf how Chinese villagers vote. Party has ‘core role’ Before observing the election, the provincial officials heard two days of the Chinese Communist Party line on how to carry out the new law, which is an amalgam of democratic formulas on majority rule and secret ballots, combined with a bedrock principle that the party should play “a core role in leadership” in village self- government. “The party’s leadership of vil- lage work is the reality of China. It is indisputable that the party leads all,” lectured Zhang Mingliang, director of the basic level government of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. His comments buttressed the views of foreign skeptics such as Merle Goldman, professor of Chi- - nese history at Boston University, who has said that a primary pur- pose of village elections is to make peasants more accepting of unpopular tax and birth control | policies. “The villagers vote for village committees, but they do not have . any control over the real leaders | in the village, the party commit- | tee, whose members and head are appointed by the upper level,” she | ‘Gta said in an e-mail interview. The Ya Ai election process may well turn out to prove her point. The nominating procedure called “haixuan” (“sea election”) allows every villager to make a nomination. Then the village rep- resentative assembly, whose 32 members are selected by groups of neighboring households, listens to candidate speeches and picks the finalists listed on the ballot. Huang Guo Fang is the upstart nonparty member who put his name before the “haixuan” (pro- nounced “high-shuwan”), writing in his self-nominating petition that he is a man “of the masses” running a successful construction materials company. Huang, 49, pledged he would neither take a salary nor spend a yuan of village money on the notorious banquets that villagers across China resent. In the first surprise to the local Communist leadership, Huang pulled 213 “haixuan” nomina- tions, the _most eee received. Scanning Photos by JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / St2 Rain played havoc with flimsy voting booths in Ya Ai Wednesday, but 98 percent of the villagers: over 18 went to the polls. Water seeping in the ballot boxes caused some ballots to be thrown out. It was 99 more than the next highest, which went to incumbent Liu Fu Quan. However, the village assembly somehow ditched Huang and chose incumbent Liu, a party member, and Wan Bing Kang, a member of the party executive committee, as the two official candidates on the ballot for vil- lage committee chairman. On election day Wednesday, the villagers showed they were not amused. The upstart Huang got 180 write-in votes. Of the offi- cial candidates listed on the ballot, Wan got 192 votes and Liu 174. “I think it probably was a pro- test vote because Huang was not on the ballot,” said Yawei Liu, associate director of the Carter Center project on Chinese Village Elections. “I think it was a fair process.” Villagers may have a chance-at a runoff election within three months, although it remajgns unclear who the candidates gu be. explaining the election process are observers posters from the (Carter Center, Tom Crick (left) and Yawei Liu.

JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Staff No U.S. tour for these beetles By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Changsha, China — Thousands of Chinese exporters are scrambling to destroy a tree- chomping beetle, amid hints that America’s new regulation to fight the bug may provoke Chinese trade retaliation. A Chinese customs official condemned as “un- fair and discriminatory” the rule that takes effect next month mandating that all wooden packaging materials from China must be treated to prevent more Asian long-horned beetles from migrating to “America. ; U.S. agriculture experts say the new demands only aim to defang a threat capable of causing $138 billion in damage and wiping out entire forests — if not species — of maples, poplars and other hard- wood trees. A trade war could result. Here in China’s Southern heartland, local exporters warn the expense of treating wooden crates and packing materials to kill the pest will cost them contracts and jobs, especially since the United States is not making other Asian exporters comply. “We have been doing business with an American company for 10 years, and we never had this beetle problem,” said Li Zhi Guo, deputy general man- ager of the Hunan Province machinery export company. Neither did America have a problem with the black, white-spotted beetle, until infestations of bugs believed from China were discovered this summer near New York and Chicago, leading to the quarantine, cutting and burning of several thousand trees. Within weeks, the US. Department of Agricul- ture issued demands that China treat its wooden packaging to kill the beetle, which cannot be killed Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 24, 1998 by pesticides and has no known predators in America. Factories such as Li’s client, which produces 30,000 casters a month for American garbage dumpsters, must comply, whether or not the Asian beetle ever has poked its 2-inch antennae from their packing crates. Without a government certifi- cate of treatment, any Chinese wood-packed goods shipped as of Dec. 17 risk being denied U.S. entry: As a state exporter, Li sent staff members to demand that the factory subject its wooden ship- ping materials to the heat and chemical treatment specified by the Americans. He estimates the pro- cess will add S percent to expenses. “These casters already are sold very close to cost,” Li said. “We have to compete with a Korean company, and the Korean company doesn’t have to do this.” Li’s firm recognizes America’s environmental concerns, but he said he worries what will happen to the caster company and its 2,000 workers. The cause of thousands of such Chinese export- ers has brought protests from Beijing officials such as Wang Feng Qing, deputy chief administrator of the agency that issues export certificates, the State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine of the People’s Republic of China. Wang had a list of complaints attacking virtually every aspect of the American regulation. She found the 90-day deadline for compliance unjustifiably short and the specified treatment methods expen- sive and environmentally hazardous. She said it is “unscientific and unreasonable” for America to subject all wooden packaging from China to the regulation, when the beetle is found only in limited geographic areas and feeds only on certain trees. Wang and Chinese trade officials have expressed irritation that the regulation targets only China, when the beetle also is found in other nations. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Taiwan plays it safe Independence shunned after warnings by China, which aims to rule the island eventually. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Taipei, Taiwan or weeks, Chinese leaders have fidgeted just over the horizon as democratic Taiwan neared bellwether elections that would test whether Taiwanese are aching for full independence from the Chinese mainland On Saturday, to the relief of Beijing and likely Washington as well, millions of Taiwanese deliv- ered a loud mandate for caution. With a turnout of over 67 percent, the voters signaled in mayoral and parliamentary results that they don’t want to risk confront- ing China’s threat to “use force” in case Taiwan declares indepen- dence. The most prominent advocate of an eventual “Taiwan Repub- lic,” Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian, was beaten by a 53-47 percent margin in what had been viewed as a neck-and-neck bid for his re-election as mayor of the capital city, Taipei. Chen, a native-born Taiwanese with an earthy charisma, had been expected to vault from this election to a strong run for the presidency in 2000 on a pro- independence platform. Although thousands of his tearful support- ers greeted the defeated Chen with chants of “President, Presi- dent,” it appeared that he and other pro-independence figures will have difficulty re- establishing momentum. ' “If this election had turned out in Mr. Chen’s favor, it would be another of those aggravating fac- tors that would be perceived as making the government in ’ Beijing more nervous,” said . Ramon Myers of the Hoover ‘Institution at Stanford University, KUO JIH-HSIAO / Associated Press Taipei Mayor-elect Ma Ying-jeou celebrates Saturday. His party, which sees independently gov- erned Taiwan as historically part of China, triumphed over rivals who back official independence. one of several American experts on Taiwan monitoring the elec- tion. He said both Washington and Beijing would be relieved at the outcome. Chen was knocked out of his City Hall power base by Nation- alist Party challenger Ma Ying- jeou, a descendant of the main- land Chinese elite that took control of the government when it was forced to flee here after the 1949 Communist takeover of the mainland. With a boyish charm and a Harvard Law School pedigree, Ma attracted voters who wanted peace and stability. To Beijing, Ma was the lesser of two evils in the race, since he and his party stand for Taiwan’s eventual reunification with mainland China rather than Taiwanese independence. . As firecrackers popped all over downtown Taipei, thousands of Ma supporters rejoiced out- side his downtown headquarters. “Everyone in Taiwan has a shadow in their minds,” said schoolteacher Daniel Chan, 38. “They are always afraid of being attacked by mainland China. I think Mr. Ma can give us a more stable situation. Tonight I can feel safer about my family.” Chen’s pro-independence Pro- gressive Party also lost heavily in races for parliamentary seats throughout Taiwan. The big winner was the long- ruling Nationalist Party, which roared back to reconsolidate its power following six years of steady slippage attributed to the party’s past reputation for favorit- ism and corruption. Taiwan’s Central Election Commission said that throughout Taiwan, the Nationalists had won 46 percent of popular votes in races for the parliament, far ahead of the runner-up Progres- sive Party’s 30 percent. The outcome increased the Nationalists’ share of the next parliament and guaranteed the ruling party enough seats to avoid a coalition government. Perhaps the most avid observ- ers of the Taiwan election were the six mainland Chinese govern- ment advisers on Taiwan rela- tions, who have been here for 10 days conducting quiet meetings on the fringes of the election cam- paign at the invitation of a Tai- wanese educational institute. Reached on the eve of the elec- tion, during a tour of a newspaper aimed at Taiwanese children, Chi- nese delegation member Su Ge’ said the group from Beijing is “concerned” about a clause in the Progressive Party platform call- ing for an independent Taiwan.

My translator, an unemployed stock analyst, thought we ought to cut and run. I thought the tent people would calm easily. They did, and a few hung around to talk. These, after all, were not fugitives hunted by police or people with scarred lives who belonged in mental institutions. They didn’t babble or draw knives or curse at passers-by. Nor were they inheritors of debilitating discrimi- nation, because they were not an ethnic or racial minority. Like other homeless South Koreans we met, these were middle-class people whose world had gone topsy-turvy when the rug was pulled out, when their country’s economy failed. Their stories were not even terribly dramat- ic, though most were certainly sad. These homeless people were impos- sibly clean, literate and hopeless, at least for the short term. They were the most puzzling aspect of my visit to South Korea. They were unlike any such homeless group I’ve encountered elsewhere, from Bombay to Chechnya to Washing- ton, D.C. - Often homeless people are stranded through entrenched poverty or per- sonal affliction, mental or physical.

She filed this report from Seoul, South Korea. wore clothes from the middle-class lives they had departed just months earlier. And somehow they kept every- thing immaculate, even those living rough in the park. They also were embarrassed. Often, they blamed themselves for landing in bad straits. I think that is why few wanted to tell their stories and often refused to give their names if they did talk. At an all-male shelter run by a Bud- dhist order, the director placed one condition: no pictures. People felt humiliated to be there, he said, explaining that losing a job in Korea had been rare. These people assumed they must have done something awfully wrong to wind up on the street. One man who agreed to talk there identified himself only as Mr. Oh. He refused to reveal the kind of small business he ran or to detail its bank- ruptcy and the subsequent loss of his apartment. I wondered why he was bothering to talk with me. Suddenly Mr. Oh plumbed a bruised emotional depth. He wanted me to know that personal consequence underlies the faceless economic charts. “Before I came here, I traveled all over the country. Sometimes, I slept in a tent, sometimes in a cheap boarding house. I traveled to forget every miser- able failure,” he said. “I found stability in my heart, a little bit.” ‘Mr. Oh, who had cleaned up for the communal dinner after doing cemetery maintenance work, wore a spotless navy blue track suit and cranberry sweater. Speaking with the same stoic bearing as the American actor he remarkably resembled, Charles Bron- son, he spoke of a daughter and son who are both university graduates, whom he had not seen since March. “I don’t want to show myself to my children, because I feel I’m in a miser- able condition,” said Mr. Oh, closing his eyes, clenching his jaw and falling silent. Back at the tent camp at Sosomun Park, the hostility had evaporated fast. But there, too, people demanded no pictures of themselves, only the bright- colored tents filled with the posses- sions that were their hold on former lives. After the camera was capped and our talks had lasted nearly an hour, almost everyone had returned to their routines — playing cards, checking the clothesline strung between trees, polic- ing the grounds for the few stray scraps or cigarette butts dropped by lax campers. One of the last to leave was a man in his mid-30s, wearing pinstripe pants and a button-down shirt. He hadn’t said a word, just listened. As we prepared to depart, I saw him sitting in his tent cross-legged, reading one of the books he picked from the neat piles by his sleeping bag. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 25, 1998 \f"

China already has 30 million laid-off or unemployed workers, and even graduates of prestigious universities are having trouble finding jobs. If China’s long- running, export-fueled boom runs out of energy this year, the jobless ranks will swell — and may grow angrier. As recently as four days ago, state-controlled media were pre- dicting that this year — the 50th anniversary of Communist rule in China — would bring further rapid growth amounting to a 7 percent to9 percent increase in the Austin American-Statesman - January 7, 1999 gross domestic product. But in the past few days, China’s propaganda organs have begun making uncommonly frank dis- closures of trouble throughout the eertt's 2 of lowerin: “It’s a way wering expecta- tions and preparing the people for some kinds of austerity,’’ said China scholar Steven Goldstein, a Smith College government pro- fessor now visiting Beijing. Monday, the official Xinhua news agency said the government is working on a plan to rescue ‘‘staggering amounts ofbad loans” that are “ ing the strength”’ of state-o commercial banks. Tuesday morning, the official China Daily reported that insur- ance companies in Beijing are suffering a “flood of cancella- tions’’ from people who bought policies a year ago and can no longer pay the premiums. ‘‘Some experts attribute this to the in- crease in laid-off workers,” the Paper said. By Tuesday afternoon, China’s powerful vice president, Hu Jin- tao, warned that ‘“‘problems with- in China’s financial sector are rife and must be tackled,’’ Xinhua re- ported. Hu said the Asian finan- cial crisis was by no means over and was beginning to affect China. Then came Wednesday’s state- ment by the finance ministry, which warned that China’s do- mestic economy will be weighed down in 1999 by poor performance of state enterprises and anemic consumer demand. To prevent a collapse of eco- nomic growth in 1999, the finance ministry said it plans further in- creases in public spending on highways, telecommunications and water works. \f"

And at leagt some were perplexed that Ghina has maintained this sliver of openness when it is in the midst of a crackdown on pro- democracy activists in the big Gites. oeThese local elections “fell sig- nificantly short” of all the bench- marks of democracy, which inalude offering voters a genuine ¢pice, a transparent nomination process, a secret ballot and a public vote count, the team said ia statement released after a six-day visit to the countryside. tDhree earlier Carter Center reports on village elections car- ried a more positive tone, although they also listed some deficiencies in the Communist Party’s decade-long effort to bring a semblance of democratic processes to the very lowest grass-roots level in China. osYou have to make one impor- tant distinction. This is the first time the Carter Center has seen township-level elections,’’ said Charles Costello, the new direc- eof the center’s Democracy am. e elections the observers wed were for township gov: vlltges around the central China city of Chongqing. They lacked many of the basic democratic ele- ments that had been present in earlier elections, the team found. bs.Earlier teams observed elec- tions for village leaders, which have a distinct set of regulations knaridating many of the processes the Carter Center viewed as cen- ‘wal to democratic elections, 4acluding individual voting booths and secret ballots. ““ifThe latest elections were for laelegates to the township peo- ple’s congresses. These con- are the first step in a pyr- id that eventually results in thé National People’s Congress, aOhina’s highest legislative body, and are governed by regulations ‘that do not even stipulate secret ‘ballots. 21Mhe observers’ report said one ‘positive element is the Chinese owillingness to let international ‘t#bservers watch the elections sand proffer recommendations for improvement. e2u“It is quite a paradox between caving a crackdown on a small ‘handful of democratic activists and then pushing these local grass-roots elections,” said Merle Goldman, history professor at Boston University and a scholar of political reform in China. She referred to the arrests and stiff sentences handed out in the past two months to a group of Chinese who tried to start what would be called the China Democracy Par- ty, a crackdown that has elicited Robert Pastor, the Emory Uni- versity political science professor who started the Carter Center’s China program on village elec- tions in 1996, said the observer team raised the crackdown dur- ing talks with China’s top Com- munist leaders. In response, some Chinese officials said the activists were arrested for trying to subvert the government and overthrow the Communist Party. Others recited a list of worries mostly related to China’s economic slowdown — from layoffs and labor unrest to an unhealthy banking system — and to the fact that the upstart party was able to organize across the nation so quickly. “Obviously these things are making the regime nervous, and that’s why they cracked down,” Pastor said.

For seven days, China’s ruling elite sat at the head of glorified classrooms on the northern fringe of Beijing and lectured se- nior Communist Party officials from across China. The party “could lose the support of the Chinese people” if it doesn’t per- form better, Jiang said in his fi- nal summation on Monday. The Central Committee’s Party School, near the old imperial Summer Palace, is a main drive- wheel of the Communist Party’s ideological transmission belt to the heartland. In coming weeks, audiences from the top-level re- treat can be expected to drum out the same jarring warnings to thousands of lower-ranking cadres at the network of regional party schools scattered nation- wide. Over the last three weeks, Jiang’s message, both in public and private, has been that 1999 looms as an unusually dangerous year for the internal stability of China and its 53 million-member ruling party. “Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud,” as Jiang put it in a chilling televised warning to his countrymen on Dec. 23. Though Jiang never said so out loud, China’s leaders are clearly nervous as they face a calendar jammed with politically sensitive anniversaries in 1999. In March, Tibetan dissidents will lament the 40th anniversary of the abortive uprising that led to the exile of the Dalai Lama. On June 4, pro-democracy advocates now in exile, and perhaps some inside China, will bemoan the 10th anniversary of the Tianan- men Square massacre. Then on Oct. 1, China will glori- fy 50 years under Communist rule, an occasion that may re- quire soul-searching by party leaders about whether to de- mythologize their brutal and er- ratic founding father, the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung. A deeper source of worry is that, after 20 years, China’s rock- et burst of economic growth is fi- nally showing signs of flaming out. As growth slows, there are likely to be fewer and fewer new jobs to satisfy tens of millions of laid-off urban workers and able- bodied villagers no longer needed on the farmland. Weighed down by the Asian eco- nomic crisis, its own dinosaur state industries and its barely solvent banking system, China has seen its growth rates gradually dip from spectacular double-digits in the early 1990s to 9.6 percent in 1996, 8.8 percent in 1997, and no more than 7.8 percent last year. This year, even optimists are ex- pecting growth to slide further — with unpleasant consequences. “At present, our economy hasn't reached the trough,” said Beijing University Professor Zhang Xue Bin in an interview with the Cox News Service. “It is possible that our economic growth rate will be- come even lower this year. There- fore, it is possible that more people will be laid off.” Zhang’s recently published book, whose title in English is “The Dan- ger Time of the Reform,” warns that China faces a “battle of deci- sive significance.” Four critical dangers that have not been well- addressed, he wrote, are “social chaos” arising from poverty in the countryside, “very serious” official corruption, a drop in the economic growth rate and growing critiques by Communist hard-liners opposed to reform. Last summer, China unleashed an emergency three-year, $1.2 tril- lion package of highway, dam and other government construction projects in an effort reminiscent of the American New Deal pump- priming to head off a full-scale eco- nomic slump. But even the govern- ment’s loyal academic experts like Zhang wonder whether China can spend enough to head off restive- ness among more than 20 million laid-off workers. Moreover, China’s economic stimulus plan has placed extra fi- nancial pressures on the nation’s already thinly capitalized state banks, notes Nicholas Lardy, a Chi- na expert at the Brookings Institu- tion in Washington. “They have purchased higher growth in the short run at the price of a larger problem of bank recapi- talization in the future,” Lardy said in an e-mail interview with Cox News Service. “And postpon- ing dealing with the underlying problems in the financial sector in- creases the risk that there will be a financial meltdown. The risk is probably still low but the key thing is that it is rising.” As has often happened in the last half-century when Beijing’s lead- ers felt threatened by economic or other internal difficulties, they re- acted last month by ordering a crackdown on the latest sproutings of political dissent within the intel- lectual elite. Their chief target was the China Democracy Party, a would-be op- position political party with a few hundred armchair activists. Though it had achieved some no- tice among Westerners by trying to register as an approved political party, it posed no perceptib threat to the Communist Party’s grip on power. It had attracted vir- tually no attention among ordinary Chinese, largely because the offi- cial media never covered it. Harmless or not, on Dec. 21, a Chinese court imposed an 11-year prison sentence on Wang Youcai, the 32-year-old activist who last summer petitioned authorities to register the China Democracy Par- ty as an official entity. Wang, who had also participated as an ob- scure student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, was convicted in a blare of publicity of “attempting to overthrow state power.” At least five other organizers were quickly imprisoned, and five others were placed under house arrest or in police custody. Two identifiable leaders — Xu Wenli, 55, and Qin Yongmin, 45, both vet- erans of the abortive Democracy Wall protests of the late 1970s — were given sentences of 13 and 12 years after hasty, heavily publi- cized trials. By Chinese standards, perhaps the most curious aspect of the crackdown was that the authorities went out of their way to call atten- tion to the dissidents through heavy publicity about their punish- ments. It was as if the Communist hierarchy wanted to signal other potential troublemakers that this is a year when even the mildest forms of protest will not be tolerat- ed. “My understanding is that the government was not terribly wor- ried about a few dissidents saying things to each other,” said Boston University’s China watcher Joseph Fewsmith, who was in Beijing for meetings with Chinese academic colleagues. “What they (the govern- ment) are terribly worried about is the prospect of a few dissidents trying to organize laid-off workers. That is the sort of thing they really want to nip in the bud.” Honolulu Star-Bulletin - January 16, 1999 \f"

BEING — When retired biologist Chen Linna was a 14 year-old schoolgirl, her nights Were tormented by a dream: must $he kill her father as a “criminal” who betrayed his country? * Walking home from school one day, Chen had read a wall ster pasted in her courtyard hat denounced her father as a “bourgeois rightist.” Soon ex- pelled from the ruling Commu- nist Party, her father was shipped off for a year to one of China's a labor camps. That was in 1957. Today, she bays the stain of the “rightist” la- bel has never quite disappeared from her father’s career — or hers. Last year, he died at the age of 84, officially “rehabilitated” but sfill bitter. Now, less than a year later, the historical fate of Chen and the 550,000 others in the first gener- ation of accused Chinese dissi- dents has finally come up for de- bate within the Communist Party. In a further irony, the party is deciding whether to expunge the guilt of this dwindling core of “rightists” even as it is aggres- sively cracking down on today’s new generation of dissidents. With China approaching the 50th anniversary of the commu- nist takeover in October, ranking party officials have told Western visitors about a still-secret docu- mentary that is said to make a powerful case that the party wrongly persecuted the “rightists” 42 years ago. _ The film was previewed for senior leaders and party histori- ans at a recent study session at the Central Committee's Party School in northern Beijing, ac- cording to one visitor, professor ‘Robert Pastor of Emory Univer- sity in Atlanta. Pastor said he Jearned of it from a senior Beijing ‘party official during the Carter Center's recent trip to observe Chinese township elections. “He felt he was never fully rehabilitated — emotionally,” ‘said daughter Chen, now 56, ce she heard about the secret The decision on whether to overturn the 1957 verdicts by party tribunals poses an exquisite dilemma to today's Communist Party, which exercises a hollow power with neither ideological or is force over 1.2 billion peo- ple. A full denunciation of the anti-rightist campaign might bring some new legitimacy to the ee but at great risks, said arvard University China scholar Roderick MacFarquhar. It might help revive patriotism among a generation of sons and daughters repelled by the hostility to intel- lectuals so long displayed by the party, he said. Among the strongest argu- ments against removing the stig- ma from the “rightists” is the need to protect the reputation of the late Deng Xiaoping. Deng, the former Chinese leader, remains a revered symbol for today’s top communists for thrusting China onto its winning path of market- oriented “reforms.” The problem is that in 1957, Deng was Chair- man Mao Tse-tung’s chief hatch- etman in the “anti-rightist” crackdown. By some reputable accounts, it was Deng who con- vinced Mao to open the first labor camps. Then after Mao's death, Deng pressured the party to declare in 1980 that the antrrightist cam- paign “was not erroneousin itself, the problem was that it became inflated.” That's why few experts expect that a documentary fully repudi- ating the “rightist” crackdown will ever be broadcast in China. The controversy remains so Photo by JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Chen Linna holds a picture of her father who, when she was a youth, was labeled a dissident. painful for the party because the “rightists” included some of the best and brightest in Mao’s revo- lution. China’s current premier and economic czar Zhu Rongji was one of the few “rightists” who endured the purge and went on to rise to top leadership. By contrast, the noted revo- lutionary novelist Ding Ling stopped writing for two decades never fully regained her vi- tality. Then-campus activist Har- ry Wu emerged from his “rightist” labor camp to go into exile, then turned into one of China’s most vituperative critics in the United States.

She said Tuesday that an officer at the Tongzhou police station near the night: Club had informed her that Peng had been “subpoenaed for prosecution” on sex-related charges, She said that at 11 p.m. Monday police burst into a private dining room where Peng and a male friend had been enjoying dinner, Later, when her husband failed to return home, she tried to call him on his beeper. When he failed to answer, she realized he was no longer “at liberty” and began trying to find him. By late Tuesday, Peng’s wife and friends did not know where he was. District police officials said they had no information on Peng, Peng’s case followed the pattern of four Other political dissidents whose opposition activities were cut short in the last two months by morals charges they also claimed were trumped up. China Democracy Party activist Han Lifa, Who tried to organize a demonstration in Shanghai during President Clinton’s visit to China last summer, fel into a similar predic: ament when he went out drinking with friends in Shanghai on Oct. 23, The next day, he awoke in police custody facing charges of patronizing a prostitute, In December, Shanghai authorities sentenced Han to nine months of detention on prostitu- tion charges, Sentenced with Han was fellow Democ- racy Party activist Cai Guihua, who con- tended he was arrested Oct. 30 while dining with a business partner in a Shanghai hotel. Suddenly, he said, two women entered the room and disrobed, Police immediately burst in and arrested him, In another episode, the Chinese Foreign ministry acknowledged in late December campaigners who had slipped back into southern China illegally were sentenced to three years forced labor. They were charged not just with evading border police but also with hiring prostitutes, The two men, Zhang Lin and Wei Quan- bao, both veterans of the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, were arrested Nov, 12 ina barber shop authorities insisted was a brothel. Since Peng, the latest detainee, emerged from obscurity less than a year ago, he has always claimed he is not a “dissident” since he isn’t trying to form an opposition political party. Instead, he said, he has just been toss- ing out reform ideas for discussion, Peng attracted Western media attention last summer when he began holding weekly discussion sessions in Beijing on such topics a8 human rights, democracy and environ- mental degradation, But last fall, he told Western reporters he was curtailing his activities “until things loosened up again.” His decision last October to suspend the activities of the China Development Union Was prompted by a raid on his home, in which police confiscated fax machines, com- puter equipment and some files on his tiny organization. “One thing that's interesting about the that two New York-based democracy new case against Peng is that he has not been very active at all for the last few months,” said Liu Si Qing, director of the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China | While targeting some lesser-ranking pr0- testers with tawdry sex accusations, the gov: emment crashed down much harder late last month on the three main leaders of the incip- tent China Democracy Party, Chinese courts sent Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcal to prison for at least 11 years each for such crimes as ‘attempting to overthrow state power,” The round-up resumed last week when a court in Shanghai imposed a lighter sentence on Lin Hai, a 30-year-old Web page designer who was convicted of exchanging e-mail addresses with a dissident group based in the United States, Lin got two years, The scattered episodes of sex-related charges coincide with a renewed campaign by Chinese authorities to stamp out prostitu: tion, which was virtually eliminated in the 1960s during the moralistic days of Commu nist Party fanaticism, Since economic liber: alization began in 1979, small-scale prostitu- tion has crept back into urban life, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 27, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Ultrasound a curse on Chinas girls By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Palm Beach Post Staff Writers PING YU, China — Life looks simple and tradition-bound in this misty mountain hamlet, but even here couples have access to a piece of modern technology that is mutating the face of China. The ultrasound scanner that reveals the sex of a fetus has led to the purging from China’s pop- ulation of between 500,000 and 750,000 unborn girls every year, recent statistics show. The imagery that identifies birth defects also allows sex- selective abortions, which have become commonplace in the countryside where sons are in highest demand. China has outlawed sex screening for a decade, yet it re- mains as agcepted here as the rickety mini-truck delivering big green cabbages, as unremark- able as the older women who monopolize the central village yard every Sunday with folk dancing. “Tf a girl is the first baby, they won't have an abortion. If it’s the second, they will,” explained Jin Heyin, 49, one of the women waiting on a recent Sunday for the drum and cymbal players to begin rolling out the rhythm for their weekly dance routine. “I know many people who do this,” she said. “Medically, it’s very safe now.” In Ping Yu, as in most of rural China, birth control regulators have tried to assuage the peas- ants’ ire over the 1979 “one child” regulations by adopting an un- stated “one son” policy instead. A couple giving birth to a son is allowed one child. But a rural family that has a girl first is per- mitted a second baby. Parents often will keep the first girl, then repeatedly abort subsequent pregnancies until an ultrasound shows the requisite male heir. Other Ping Yu _ dancers, dressed in pink satin trousers and tunics tied with a green sash, agreed with Jin that the process is simple. They don’t even need to travel the 100 miles northeast to Beijing, but can simply go down the winding road to the town of Shi Du, less than a half-hour bus ride away. Doctors there are reputed to be willing and able to scan a woman’s belly and tell her what is in her womb. Similar ultrasound machines are used in more than 200,000 local clinics and private doctor’s offices across China. This marriage of science and dition — the Chinese tradi- tional hunger for sons — has bloated to 1.04 million a year the éstimated number of “missing girls.” ' Selective abortion isn’t the only explanation, though it is the iggest factor. For centuries, un- anted girls have fallen victim to infanticide, abandonment and neglect: Others are “missing” because their parents never re- ported their births. » Recent mortality rates show girls aged 0-4 dying at the high rate of 37 per 1,000, compared with 28 per 1,000 for boys. In few other countries do young girls die at a greater rate than boys. _ One Chinese investigation in- to irregular girl mortality rates found rural boys getting more inilk, better food, and better and faster medical care, according to last summer's report in the Chi- nese academic journal Population and Economics. The pro-boy tradition at least has been a boon to foreign cou- ples seeking to adopt babies. Chinese orphanages are filled with abandoned, healthy little girls, and Americans took home nearly 4,000 of them in the year ending last September. - But now modern medicine has made it vastly easier to dis- pense with girls in advance. Chi- na’s 20-year experiment in social ngineering, rigidly limiting fam- ilies to one or sometimes two children, has made it compelling. - The ratio of boy vs. girl babies nationwide has steadily risen since the “one child, one family” policy took effect in 1979. The natural ratio of 106:100 climbed to 108:100 by the 1982 census. Once ultrasound machines were intro- duced in the mid-1980s, the pace quickened. Surveys in 1992 and 1995 found that the sex ratio had reached 118:100. ' This year, the newspaper Shanghai Express said a recent government survey put the ratio at 120:100, but there has been no official confirmation. _ Judging from population sampling and sex ratios in the mid-1990s, for every 1,000 babies that were born in China, another 51 female babies should have been born but are not ac- Palm Beach Post - February 3, 1999 > Parents hungry for sons choose abortion 500,000 times a year when fetus is female counted-for. These comprise the “missing” girls. Some researchers have con- tended that parents do not regis- ter all eo births, keeping them hidden in order to dodge the restrictive reproduction poli- cy and have another child. But a 1997 study by the State Statistical Bureau concluded that underreporting was only a lesser cause of the skewed sex ratio. “The basic reason is the se- lective abortion before birth,” the study said. China — with nearly five times America’s population — has about the same per capita abortion rate. In 1992, China re- ported 5.6 million abortions for “birth control purposes,” com- pared with America’s 1.3 million abortions in the late 1990s. How many sex-selection abortions were there in China? Using a methodology developed in the U.S. Census Bureau, it ap- pears from Chinese birth data that there were at least 500,000 and possibly as many as 750,000 sex-selective abortions last year, Consequences of sex- selective abortions include health complications women may suffer from late-term and_repea abortions. The low-tech, two- dimensional ultrasound ma- chines typically available to pri- vate physicians or grass-roots clinics cannot determine the sex of a fetus until the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy. “We don’t allow them to have ultrasound machines, and also they cannot do operations to stop area said Sun Ailing, apputy director of the family commission in coastal Shandong, where the sex ratio in» some places stands at 125:100. Even in the province’s public medical clinics, ultrasound must be administered by two doctors, both of whom must swear in writing that the test was given for medical reasons. “This way we can protect women’s health,” said Sun, citing cases of women forced into abor- tion by a husband or in-laws until they produce a son. “Some abor- tions are very painful and cause permanent sterility.” Sun expressed concern over women who act without medical advice by walking into a pharma- cy and buying the Chinese equivalent of RU-486, known as the “morning after” pill. In larger doses it will cause a miscarriage even if a woman is well into pregnancy. Danger exists if some fetal material is not expelled and flares into a uterine infection. Why do women take these risks? In the cities, where the “one child” policy is more strictly en- forced, many fewer do. Among more educated Chinese, daugh- ters have gained almost equal status with sons and the urban sex ratio is about normal. It is still the countryside, where more than two-thirds of China’s 1.2 billion people live, that boys are so prized. Jin Heyin, the folk dancer in Ping Yu, had the luck to birth a son in the days before ultrasound scanning was available. She un- derstands the anguish of those ~ “want very badly to have a oy.” “Because of feudal traditional thoughts, they think if they have a boy he can keep the family line going,” she said. A son also is a guarantee of care in old age, es- ay important in a country acking solid pensions or reliable social services for the elderly. The other operative aspect of Chinese tradition means that care or money spent rearing a girl, at least in the countryside, is virtu- ally wasted. “After she is married,” Jin said, “a girl will leave the family.” Palm Beach Post - February 3, 1999 (Continued) \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Phnom Penh, Cambodia — Sitting on a bamboo-slatted bench, widow But Lin crumbled dried lumps of cooked rice in a basket and talked about what she wants to happen to the Khmer Rouge leaders who brutalized her country. “If we arrest them, we should cut off their heads,” the 52-year- old woman said. “In fact, if they asked me to do this, I am willing to do it myself. “I lost six children from star- vation, and my husband and par- ents were killed,” she said. “I am ‘still alone today. We cannot for- * get that regime. No Cambodian people can forget.” ‘ _. Such an outburst seemed ‘incongruous from a fragile woman in simple clothes, a poor , woman who saves burned rice. Twenty years after the Khmer Rouge fell from power, their day of judgment may be approach- ing. But Lin hopes it will put her ‘:. anger to rest. **- A United Nations team of - three legal experts this month is - scheduled to recommend to - Secretary-General Kofi Annan . whether to start action against . the remaining Khmer Rouge . leaders living openly in Cambo- ‘| dia. Some form of international _ tribunal probably will be pro- posed to hear evidence against the men who masterminded the madness that took the lives of more than a million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979. However, not all Cambodians, including the country’s leaders, view trials with the same longing as the widow But Lin. And even those who believe that only jus- tice can release the ghosts haunt- ing their country fear that justice might bring new dangers. “We must be cautious and con- sider how to avoid a civil war before holding any trial,” said Sau Sisovanna, a Cambodian eco- nomics professor and govern- ment adviser who described Cambodians as “hostages to fear.” Even when 3,500 wiry guer- rilla fighters finally abandoned their Khmer Rouge jungle camps this month, switching allegiance and uniforms to the Cambodian army, that fear was not allayed. The fighters were believed to comprise the last sizable groups of hard-line rebels holding out at jungle bases. Cambodian defense officials hailed their “integra- tion” into the regular army as the final dissolution of Khmer Rouge power. Yet photos of a ceremony in Anlong Veng, a rebel center in northern Cambodia, showed some fighters putting on their new army uniforms over their old guerrilla fatigues. The Cambodia Daily quoted one ex-guerrilla as pronouncing in one breath, “The Khmer Rouge is dead,” but adding in the next that he would keep his old uniform “just in case.” Some rebel commanders among the defectors admitted they would be tempted to go back to the bush if their old Khmer Rouge leaders called them. The key leaders are living openly in Pailin, a town on the Thai border that the government virtually ceded them as an enclave when they began agree- ing to lay down their weapons in 1996. These are the men most likely to face any international judg- ment, and some have made it clear that they will not do so quietly. A JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Staff At Cambodia’s Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocide, a grim display of victims’ skulls from the 1975-79 slaughter under- scores the debate over trials for surviving Khmer Rouge leaders. Senior leader Leng Sary, once the No. 3 Khmer Rouge com- mander, warned that any trial could have disturbing conse- quences. His new political union in Pailin issued a statement that “in order to make our nation live in peace,” the courts “should not try this or that person.” The Khmer Rouge were ultra- Maoist Communists. They emp- tied the cities and forced Cambo- dians into peasant lives. They killed almost one-sixth of the population through execution and torture, and left others to die from starvation, exhaustion and disease. The Khmer Rouge were ousted when Vietnamese troops swooped into Cambodia in 1979, but thousands who were not killed or captured continued fighting from jungle hideouts. Cambodia’s autocratic prime minister, Hun Sen, has tried to break the back of the Khmer Rouge by luring them to defect and peacefully rejoin society, demanding no accounting for the bloody tyranny they imposed. His policy of appeasing them drew protests at home and abroad last December, when two of the last major Khmer Rouge leaders left their hideouts. The prime minister treated them like visiting dignitaries and sug- gested that the past should be forgotten. After a public outcry, Hun Sen has vacillated over whether and how the Khmer Rouge should be tried. Even if there is an interna- tional tribunal, Cambodian gov- ernment cooperation will be cru- cial to making it work. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 17, 1999 \f"

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel COX NEWS SERVICE PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Only a few monarchs left in the world really matter. And not one has mattered for longer than King Norodom Siha- nouk, Cambodia’s master of dra- matic intrigue for the past 58 years. In the 1940s, Sihanouk acted the playboy king with scores of mis- tresses, the self-described “randy rabbit.” In the ’50s, he became the father of Cambodian independence from France and the slippery Cold War neutralist. In the ’60s, he occupied himself as the absolute ruler who doubled as a filmmaker. In the 70s, he be- came the figurehead of the geno- cidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then the Khmer Rouge’s gilded prisoner. Twenty years ago, when Siha- nouk was an exiled prince with slim prospects of reclaiming his country, he was told by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that he was as good an actor as Sir Laurence Olivier. Now Sihanouk is back on the throne, playing the most improba- ble role of his checkered career. At 76, history has cast him as the indispensable pacifier in a country still traumatized by the Vietnam War and the subsequent butchery of up to 2 million Cambo- dians in the “killing fields” of the Khmer Rouge. Many of the 12 million Cambo- dians are frightened that without the king to balance the factions, Cambodia's 20-year civil war could burst out again. Others fear that Sihanouk’s death would remove the last roadblock to dictatorial rule by Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former communist with close ties to Vietnam and China. “We are lucky to have the king around with us,” says former gov- ernment adviser Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of the Cambodian Cen- ter for Conflict Resolution. “But we have to ask ourselves how to pre- pare for the day when he is not around, It is too easy every time there is a problem just to turn to the king to solve it.” Few expected that then-Prince Sihanouk would make so much dif- ference when the political parties agreed to allow him to reclaim his throne in 1993, after United Na- tionsbrokered elections. Though he was head of Cambo- dia’s 800-year-old royal family and a descendant of Cambodia's great 12th-century god-king Jayavarman VII, he was relegated by the new constitution to “reign but not rule,” Besides that handicap, Siha- nouk had been beset with colon cancer, high blood pressure, diabe- tes and several minor strokes., But over the past six years, Si- hanouk has emerged as a mixture of Machiavellian politician and godlike Buddhist patriarch who is summoned at the last moment by the squabbling politicians to save his 12 million “children” from cha- os. And for now, his cancer has gone into remission. Last July, Sihanouk’s impor- tance increased. Another round of elections produced an uncomfort- ably narrow edge for Hun Sen's Cambodian People’s Party over the royalist FUNCINPEC party, led by the king’s 54-year-old eldest son Prince Ranariddh. For three months, almost all ministries were paralyzed by fac- tional struggles, as the two main parties resisted a coalition government. With rumors of coups roiling the city, the king put out the word that he was leaving Cambodia for medical treatment in Beijing. Hun Sen all but begged Si- hanouk not to leave the country until a government was formed. “If the king leaves, we will miss legal pro- cedure,” said a spokesman for Hun Sen. “For example, who would be the acting head of state if one were needed?” He'll soon celebrate the 58th anniversary of his first coronation, AIler a show of reluctance worthy of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the king canceled his departure and spent a month conferring with one fac- tion and then another. Finally he worked out the coalition: Hun Sen would become the sole prime min- ister, and Prince Ranariddh would become president of the National Assembly. _ As the king approaches the 58th anniversary of his first coro- nation this April, the Cambodian capital has been in the grip of the latest royal intrigue: Who will suc- ceed Sihanouk? He does not have the power wielded by the late King Hussein of Jordan, who just weeks before his death stunned his family and nation by withdrawing the title of crown prince from his brother and conferring it upon his son Abdullah. The Cambodian constitution leaves it to the Council of the Throne — made up of Buddhist leaders and top parliamentary and government figures — to choose a male successor from the royal family within one week of the king’s death, Though few believe it, King Si- hanouk insists he won't be part of the closing drama, “I have no right to designate (or suggest the designation of) my successor or a regent,” he said.

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Liquica, Indonesia — Ragged [/_. coffee farmers are battling with bows and arrows, while teachers and doctors are packing their bags to flee chaos they fear will descend if the disputed territory of East Timor goes independent. - “All of us are in danger,” said Timorese separatist Gregory Dos — Santos, who last week gave har- ’*bor in his home to five skinny warriors who had run from fight- ing 10 miles away. Two of them ss were 12 years old. They share his sentiment that East Timor must seize the chance for full freedom from Indonesia, and this is the issue that has sparked a monthlong escalation of violence.

Army officers admit they are supplying guns but say their aim is maintaining order. “It is Indonesia’s scheme to build a civil war,” said David Ximenes, a one-time guerrilla fighter and now a leader of a pro- independence coalition. “Their goal is to legitimatize their army here.” Whether for or against inde- pendence, many East Timorese acknowledge they are not ready for it. The international community, which did nothing to restrain the often brutal colonial handling of East Timor by Indonesia, now is scrambling to prevent a slide backward to an anarchic past. A U.N. peacekeeping force or tran- sitional authority may be needed to head off total societal collapse. Only late last month, Indonesia Life of violence: East Timorese boys at a village outside the town of Liquica take up bamboo spears and clubs after Indone- sian police rounded up all the young men in the village in mid-February.

JOSEPH ALBRIGHT/ Staff first suggested East Timor might be set free if its people turn down a‘limited autonomy plan still being constructed under U.N. auspices. Then, on Feb. 11, Presi- dent B.J. Habibie stunned his countrymen and the world by saying this Connecticut-sized ter- ritory could be independent as early as next Jan. 1. Habibie engineered a reversal of his country’s policy that began when Indonesia invaded East Timor in late 1975. Its troops smothered a civil war that broke out as soon as the previous colo- nial occupier, Portugal, abruptly withdrew earlier in the year. In 1976, Indonesia formally annexed East Timor as its 27th province. The annexation was not recog- nized internationally — except by Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 21, 1999 > \fEast Timor independence Detail 4 area Australia — and guerrilla fighters of the East Timor independence movement, Fretilin, have clashed with Indonesian armed forces ever since. Civil servants fearful An estimated 200,000 East Timorese died through fighting, executions or starvation and dis- ease attributed to draconian resettlement policies. Now, those Timorese who cooperated with Indonesian authorities fear retri- bution in an independent East Timor. The visiting Swiss president of the International Red Cross, Cor- nelio Sommaruga, appealed for permission to expand the relief agency’s presence in East Timor for an urgently needed “humani- tarian mobilization.” He cited the departure of frightened essential service providers and a growing wave of thousands of internal ref- ugees from local hostilities. “We have started packing up stuff. Our worry is that-we will have to leave very quickly,” said August Sugiarto, 32, who has taught chemistry for 10 years at General High School No. 2 in Dili, the East Timor capital about 15 miles east of Liquica (pronounced “Li-KEE-sa”). “If there is conflict, we may be caught in the middle,” said Sugia- rto, who is from Indonesia’s main island of Java. An estimated 90 percent of jun- ior and senior high school teach- ers on East Timor, like Sugiarto, are not Timorese. They are employees of the central govern- ment from other parts of the Indonesian archipelago who were assigned to work here, as are thousands running everything from hospitals to power anc water plants. If Indonesia cuts ties te East Timor, these civil servants expect to be removed. And many of them, fearing they are obvious targets if hostilities flare, want to go.

It will generate as much electric snap as aweekly flower club luncheon. - But with Indonesia facing its first free election since 1955, a score of news cameras and tape recorders suck in every word and gesture. For the woman in black sdon may be the most powerful woman in Asia. Candidate Megawati Sukar- noputri, 52, is the daughter of the father of Indonesia, the late Pres- ident Sukarno. She wants to make the presidency a family tradition. “Megawati is regarded as the most popular, charismatic fig- ure, with a huge 7 following,” said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, spokes- : man for Indone- Stkamoputri  sia’s interim president, B.J.

His departure elevated then-Vice President Habibie to power and cleared the way for parliamentarv elections in June. ‘The new parliament will be cen- tral in selecting the next presi- dent this fall. One mark in Megawati’s favor: Since joining the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) in 1987, she has been a foe of Suharto. It was Suharto who became head of state in 1967 after a coup evicted Sukarno, and it was Suharto’s forces that stage-managed Mega- wati’s expulsion from the PDI in 1996 when her growing popular- ity became a threat. The ouster sparked riots. Rather than take to the streets herself, Megawati quietly re- formed a party lately named PDI- Struggle. Now she is its presiden- tial candidate. Her second asset is her father. Sukarno (who like many Indone- sians used only a single name) pioneered the movement to throw off Dutch colonial rule at the end of World War II. He gathered this archipelago of disparate cultures and tradi-' tions into one country, something’ even the Dutch had not attempted to do when they administered the. islands as a group. of “sub- colonies” rather than a single, homogeneous unit. Despite his increasingly auto- cratic rule, Sukarno the liberator decades later still wears a hero’s mantle to many Indonesians. Megawati, a mother of three whose husband Taufik Kiemas is a businessman, capitalizes on her father’s heritage. “There’s a new trend. People want to have a woman as their leader. But besides that, Mega- wati also is attractive because she is the daughter of Sukarno,” said Abdul Madjid, 81, a Cabinet sec- retary under Sukarno who swore to faithfully advise PDI-Struggle. “She always stands for the people.” Megawati may stand for the people, but she also keeps her distance from them. “She is surrounded by thick walls. I think Megawati is a pup- pet leader, directed by her advis- ers,” said political rival Amien Rais, leader of a Muslim-based . He complained that Megawati won’t even give him her home or cell phone number so they could conswit about com- mon strategies. Critics. speculate that Mega- wati, who attended two Indone- sian universities but did not grad- uate, cannot handle the verbal thrust and parry of politics. She would have to answer for some nonreformist positions, like her resistance to ending the polit- ical role of the military, which still fills 38 seats in parliament, or her flat opposition to indepen- dence for East Timor. Perhaps more important, she stood silent during months of con- frontation when Indonesian stu- dents risked their lives in violent demonstrations that finally forced the ouster of Suharto. “Many average people like her image. But we couldn’t count on her to make a better system than we have now,” worried Mustafa Fakhri, a law student and a leader of the demonstrations. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 28, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Dell confident it can duplicate European success in China By Joseph Albright and Marcla Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Xlamen, China — King Michael of Dell is capturing territory in China, Here in the converted avionics plant, where Dell Computer Corp. builds computers for Chi- nese customers, optimism is bursting like sunrise over the South China Sea. Remember how fast Dell grew in Europe in the early ‘90s? “We will do the same thing in China — absolutely no doubt about it,” says Irishman Buddy Griffin, who has movéd on from Dell's European operations to oversee the start-up. Across the big open work floor from Griffin's After about a year of market surveys and other intelligence gathering, Dell launched its assault on China early last year, winning permission to start a 100 percent Dell-owned computer factory here. As of February 1998, Dell was on the verge of locating in the hurly-burly of China’s biggest city, Shanghai. But then the | mayor of this quaint old port city, one-tenth the size of Shanghai, approached Dell with a still unpublicized package of tax and other incentives. MARCIA KUNSTEL / Staff Dell owns 100 percent of its China plant and employs the same direct-selling strategy it uses in the United States. Delighted with its reception in office, the Dell sal has erected a.Chi- ee wh Xiamen, Dell announced a year nese gong, Whenever a salesperson clinches a major order — say 20 or 30 computers ~ the sales manager bangs on it with a wooden rod, This year, the gong will be sounding more often, or so the company is expecting, Dell China President David Chan predicts annual sales in China will double in 1999, and then double again in 2000, “Back in Austin [Texas], the guys know what we are doing here,” said Chan, a former marketing executive. “Michael knows what been doing on a month-to-month basis, he sees the results, He's very happy oh progress we've made to date,” Indeed, Dell echoed Chan's sentiments, saying that the China operation's progress has i “very positive,” “It’s quite impressive to see them kind ‘of knocking down milestones in terms of quality, order run rates and capacity,” the Dell chain added. Already China ranks as the world’s r . largest market for personal computers, Wi about 4 million sold last year, compared million in Japan and 36 million in the United States. With personal computer sales in China growing at 27 percent a year, China is projected to surpass Japan and become the world’s third-biggest computer market by 2002. As a latecomer to China, Dell ranks only 11th in computer sales on the Chinese mainland. It lags well behind the entrenched American multinationals IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, and even further behind Legend, China’s fast-growing, state- owned computer maker. But Dell’s results for the last four months show signs of mov- g up. For the first time, 1 pe cent of personal computers sold in China were Dells, according to International Data Corp.’s pre- liminary findings for the last three months of 1998. And in January, Dell notched probably its strongest month so far. “Our take on it is that Dell is going to grow relatively quickly in China,” said Dane Anderson, an analyst at Connecticut-based IDC. “They had a relatively strong performance in the fourth quarter. I think they certainly will break into the top 10.” Dell’s work force in China has jumped from 200 to 330 in the last six months, and is projected to expand past 500 this year. ago this month it would open a sales, manufacturing and service center here. But three weeks lat- er, China’s central government threw the entire project into limbo by suddenly ordering all companies to cease “direct sell- ing” in order to prevent “social chaos” throughout China. Although the order mainly tar- geted alleged “pyramid sales” schemes by Chinese and Taiwan- ese hucksters, the language was broad enough to cripple the China operations of Avon Prod- ucts Inc. and several other blue chip international companies. Arguably, Dell’s “direct sell- ing” strategy could be viewed by the Chinese as akin to the leg- endary Avon Lady’s tactics in selling lipstick door-to-door, Atlanta Journal-Constitution March 7, 1999 > Dell confident outside normal commercial ven- ues. But after a few days of wor- ried consultations with Chinese authorities, the Dell advance party concluded its own direct selling strategy was not jeopardized. By last May, Dell resolved to push ahead. In what must be record time, Griffin’s team of five expatriates recruited and trained a 200- member Chinese crew — everyone from computer assemblers to sales- people to telephone help-line technicians. Last Aug. 20, Dell started the assembly line. The early prod- ucts were clustered at the most expen- sive, high-tech end of Dell’s com- puter line: Optiplex desktops, Latitude notebooks and even Poweredge servers. Trouble was, Dell’s foreign legion could find almost no Chi- nese customers ready to buy Dell computers. Michael Dell’s vaunted worldwide “model” of selling computers directly to the customer didn’t seem to catch on. Not at first, anyway. For the first month Dell was running the factory, it had to rely almost entirely on sales to China-based American multinationals that China is projected to surpass Japan and become the world’s third-biggest computer market by 2002. purchase Dell equipment for all their worldwide offices through their ‘‘global accounts.” Dell’s market share in China actually sank lower than in the previous year during the first month the factory was operating, according to IDC. In cold num- bers, Dell had done better when it was still exporting computers from abroad, and selling them through Chinese vendors. Chan, one of the spark plugs of direct selling in Dell’s Singapore headquarters, was named president of Dell China last October and took on the responsibility as Dell’s bilingual salesman-in-chief. As if by magic, the tide began turning. By the time Michael Dell arrived last November to commemorate the opening of his Xiamen factory, Chan’s salespeo- ple were clinching orders from provincial telecommunications companies and banks. How much of China does King Michael think he can capture in the next 10 years? For outsiders, perhaps the best gauge will be to watch what hap- pens in the next few years to a block of land five miles up the highway from Dell’s present Xiamen factory. At least four months before Dell opened its assembly line last August, its executives had already reached a preliminary agreement with Xiamen city authorities for a 99-year lease on the much larger piece of land. Dell viewed its present leased plant as a starter factory that would handle only the first few years’ growth. - Since then, Dell and its archi- tects have laid detailed plans for an efficient two-story factory on the larger block of land — one with at least twice as much work space that would contain highly automated assembly lines. It could theoretically manufacture “huge” numbers of computers, many more than the current Xia- men factory, according to Dell’s Griffin. Next month, Xiamen city authorities are scheduled to start preparing the land for construc- tion of the second Dell factory. The land for the second fac- tory should be cleared and ready for the start of construction as early as August. But Dell’s top management has yet to announce final approval. If sales flatten, there could be an indefinite delay. “My best estimate is that in two years, we’ll be in there,” says Griffin. “It won’t be less than 12 months, that’s for sure. But it could be a year and a half from now.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution March 7, 1999 (Continued) \f"

Back in 1871 Frank Vincent Jr dropped out of Yale University, and despite frail health, the 17- year-old embarked on “a systematic tour of the most interesting parts of the world.” After reaching Bangkok in the Kingdom of Siam, the New York-born Vincent decided to pursue a fantastic tale about a lost city in the jungles, This “city of monasteries” had been uncovered a decade earlier by a French explorer: naturalist named Henri Mouhot, who died of a jungle fever before he could make it back to Paris to publish his findings, Vincent set off eastward from Bangkok into the Kingdom of Cambodia. He travelled in river boats, on foot and on horseback. He reached the little Cambodian fishing town of Siem Reap after 17 days. Vincent kept on, and eventually emerged from the forest into a clearing next to an ancient moat 600 metres wide filled with lotus plants, Behind the moat and nearly overrun by giant fig trees rose the outlines of the colossal sandstone temple, Vincent was one of the first American travellers to see the great temple of Angkor Wat, amonument to the fowr-armed Hindu god Vishnu the Preserver. Covering nearly 2.5 square kilometres and cresting in a central tower taller than the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the temple of Angkor Wat is the largest and one of the most haunting religious edifices in the world. “My heart almost bounded into my mouth,” wrote Vincent. “The general appearance of the wonder of the temple is beautiful and romantic as Wel as Impressive ania grand... 1 mUSt De seen to be understood and appreciated.” For the next 98 years, an ever-growing stream of sophisticated travellers from around the world {4 journeyed to Angkor Wat and the ruins of the nearby royal city of Angkor Thom.

In 1995, Professor Susan Hadden from Texas, was killed in a Khmer Rouge guerrilla ambush. Local guides say she disregarded their warnings and tried to visit the exquisitely carved temple of Banteay Srei, 32 km down a lonely road from Angkor Wat. Fortunately, it has become quite tame in the last year to visit Angkor. At least that was our experience this February when we toured Angkor Wat and eight other nearby temples, including Banteay Srei. As Frank Vincent felt 128 years before us, we found that Angkor is one of those rare sights that carvings inside the temples are so intricate and vast that connoisseurs can spend months here, Just on the walls of the main Angkor Wat temple, the bas-reliefs stretch on for 1.6km and contain thousands of carved figures depicting such captivating scenes as “the battle of the gods and the demons,” and the “churning of the ocean of milk.” ~ Angkor is humbling and yet addictive for a photographer, with Its mix of ever-changing light, elegant shapes, and exotic live people who are sweeping or selling or simply visiting.

An early start makes sense for other reasons. Middays are steamy hot. Four or five hours of touring followed by lunch and a long recline by the hotel swimming pool comprise a normal schedule. Emerging for more sight-seeing in the late afternoon gives the advantage of more fabulous light effects as the sun goes down. Reading about Angkor Wat before you leave home will help you narrow down the choices to fit your time. But even with the best guidebooks, the traveller is well-advised to hire a local, trained guide. Choup Lorn, our guide, added immeasurably to our trip, giving the history pointing out the best-preserved garudas (statues of mythical creatures with birdlike wings and human bodies), tipping us to good camera angles and sharing the local gossip. WEIGH THE RISKS For travellers averse to any kind of risks while on holiday, it may still be too soon to visit Perhaps this is why only about 100 foreign tourists visit Angkor on an average day Occasionally there are still terrifying incidents. On the road from the airport toward Angkor Wat, unknown assassins last September set off a booby trap of rocket-propelled grenades. They were trying to kill the visiting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, but he escaped. Then early this year, a gang of teenage Cambodian robbers knocked a Belgian woman tourist on the head several hundred yards from Angkor Wat, sending her to the hospital. For inveterate globe-trotters, fears of another security incident must be balanced against a second risk: although Cambodia is stable now, the curtain of civil war could once again descend on Angkor. Even should politics remain under control, in another few years it Rouge units have come out of hiding and accepted “integration” into the Cambodian Army Already 10 big new hotels are under construction on the outskirts of Siem Reap, So if you are a nervy traveller and you don't like crowds, you'd better go to Angkor soon. \f"

        "ocr_text": "No exit: Kosovo border sealed U.S. airmen work to shelter refugees x By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Rinas Air Force Base, Albania — American airmen began laboring Wednesday to turn this broken-down airfield into the key element of a res- cue mission for hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees driven from their Kosovo homes. “I told my boys I had to go away to work to help some people out,” said Staff Sgt. Wesley Paul Eidson of Bow- don, Ga., who left his wife and two sons back at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Hours after stepping off an Air Force C-17 transport Wednesday onto a cracked concrete runway, the 26- year-old sergeant was burying water pipes at the grassy air base. Dotted with scores of abandoned domed con- crete bunkers, the base is the former headquarters of the Albanian air force. “We’re trying to get potable water to the shower units,” said Senior Airman | Mitch Raney, 27, of Waco, Texas. He was taking a break —_ with Eidson in the Eidson of sunny and still Bowdon, Ga. warm late after- noon. “We’re still not entirely sure if it’s potable ourselves.” But it’s the only water available from the capital city, Tirana, 15 miles to the southeast. And this air base, which doubles as Albania’s sole com- mercial airport, is the only big field available to handle the bulky cargo transports and megatons of supplies that are beginning to arrive from gov- ernments around the world. Rinas airfield illustrates the obstacles military and relief organiza- tions are encountering in Albania, a threadbare nation where the best roads are awful, supplies are hard to find, and equipment is so marginal that aid workers said there was but a |) . single forklift in the country just a few | weeks ago. The American airmen and a few air- |g women are taking the lead for NATO | at this site, where Albanian, French and Italian military also are working, according to the U.S. Air Force spokesman here, Master. Sgt. Michael | Land, 33, of Lakeland, Fla. The first U.S. contingent arrived Sunday night, and by this weekend an estimated 400 American troops will be on the ground and working. Their job is air traffic control and circulation, and loading and unloading umanitarian aid that comes in. nm Wednesday the NATO soldiers dled six U.S. C-130 transports d five of America’s larger C-17 sports, plus an assortment of Blanes from the Middle East to e Atlantic. Two wide-bodied rgo planes, one with Russian markings, another from Egypt, still sat on the airfield. » “We have the only K-loaders Fob. forklifts. So we can do the ob,” Land said. NATO has not disclosed where t will headquarter Task Force awk, which will include 24 U.S. pache helicopter gunships and ,;OO0OO0 support troops. The “Apaches are expected to arrive as ly as next week in an escala- tion of the assault on Yugoslav orces.

Staff Sgt. Noah Coon, 26, of Cocoa Beach, Fla., is a security officer whose unit had six weeks of special training at Charleston _Air Force Base in Sguth Carolina, where he is stationed. The course was in weapons training, map and compass use, and land navigation, Coon said. Those skills are useful out in the field, not guarding a ’ gate, as he was doing Wednesday. “It looks a little scary, just being in a different country, being so close to Yugoslavia,” admitted Eidson, the Georgia airman. Eidson said his wife back at Ramstein was frantic, at least briefly, when she learned he was being shipped out to the NATO operations here. “She was worried we’d be in Macedonia, where those guys got captured,” he said, referring to three U.S. soldiers held by Serb authorities. The Serbs claim the GIs had infiltrated Yugoslav terri- tory during a perimeter exercise. Nor is Eidson totally sanguine about the prospects. “Nobody knows what will hap- pen,” he said. “‘That’s what’s so scary.” ¥ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 8, 1999 \f"

Food Program, the main agency keep- ing the 280,000 Kosovo refugees already in Albania from starving. Late last week, the United Nations’ stockpiled rations in Albania dwindled toward exhaustion. Then at noon Satur- day, NATO launched a military special operation from Ramstein Air Base, Germany, airlifting ready-to-eat meals to replenish the U.N. stockpiles. In the last 48 hours, NATO military transports and char- tered jets have been landing or taking off every 15 minutes at this former Albanian air force fighter base, hauling in 107 tons of emergency rations from mili- tary depots in the United States. Huge Albanian flatbed trucks rolled onto the runway every few hours, and the crates were hoisted aboard by olive-painted forklifts operated by U.S. troops from NATO bases in Europe.

With rain and lightning expected the next three days, aid workers were making emer- gency plans to rush supplies to a new cluster of 14,000 Kosovo ref- ugees who suddenly materialized overnight in a remote border region of southern Albania, near the town of Korce. U.N. officials said they had been transported to Korce by authorities in the neighboring nation of Macedonia, an ethni- cally divided land whose govern- ment has decided to close sev- eral temporary camps rather than grant permanent sanctuary to Kosovo refugees. Another 20,000 Kosovo refu- gees were expected to cross on Thursday into Korce from Mace- donia, and the number from Macedonia ultimately could reach “just less than 100,000,” Lopes-DaSilva said.U.N. officials were forced to scrub the Korce flights Thursday but will try again today. One source of unease about helicopter flights to Korce is that the refugees were clustered very close to the Macedonian frontier. The Korce landing zone may be within the range of SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder-mounted anti- aircraft missiles thought to be in the hands of Serb forces. As the numbers in Korce swelled, another stream of terri- fied ethnic Albanian refugees was entering Albania by crossing south across the border from Montenegro. About’ 1,000 refugees a day have been leaving Montenegro — the republic that, along with Ser- bia, makes up Yugoslavia — whose democratic government has been shaken by rumors of a military coup being engineered by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. Six months ago, the U.N. Food Program had stockpiled enough food in and near Albania to feed 200,000 Kosovo refugees for one month. But optimism surround- ing the American-engineered Rambouillet peace conference in February led the United Nations to slash its stockpile dedicated to a potential Kosovo crisis. By the time the Rambouillet talks col- lapsed, the U.N. Food Program had stockpiles to sustain just 60,000 refugees for one month. “Unfortunately, we got it all wrong, and our stockpile went down much faster than expect- ed,” said Lopes-DaSilva.

        "ocr_text": "MYRIAD HOMELESS Refugees enduring |. indismity and privation Many were tricked into eviction from Macedonia, their second or third move since fleeing home. By Marcia Kunstel nd Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Korce, Albania — More than 11,000 bewildered Kosovo refu- gees are reeling from their sec- ond or even third forced deporta- tion in as many weeks. And some of them say police in neighboring Macedonia tricked them onto buses and abruptly dumped them off here across the border. “They were deceived,” said Stephen Galegor, 30, an evangeli- cal missionary from Fort Collins, Colo., who organized aid when at least 80 busloads of refugees showed up at dawn Wednesday in this mountain town. He said refugees were told that if they boarded buses in Macedo- nia, they could choose their desti- nation, including Britain or Cana- da. Instead, they were taken here. It was the latest installment of a sad odyssey for these ragged people who tell stories, not easil confirmed, of beatings and other abuses en route from Serb- controlled Yugoslavia. Hava Kelani is a striking 22- year-old who reluctantly told how members of a Serb militia stripped her naked. The women and elders of her family say they left their village when Serb forces began threaten- ing. They stayed in Pristina six miles away until Serb police arrived there, too, and ordered everyone to leave. As Kelani walked out of the house, she said, five police sin- gled her out and told her to come back inside. “They put a knife to my throat. They undressed me completely,” she said. Kelani, who is unmar- ried, said the men did not rape her, but took all her valuables, including identity papers, and slashed her clothing with knives. Then they told her to run. “I had no thoughts of getting out alive,” she said. Only her underwear and leg- gings were intact, but she strug- gled into them and the rest of her shredded clothes while fleeing, she recounted. Kelani caught up with her family, and they headed for trains that deposited them in a Macedonian limbo, to which they were consigned for nearly a week., Raif Syla, a creased 80-year-old: settled on blankets on a gymnar, sium floor close to his wife and another 700 or so refugees, also, described a painful flight. r2N “All I had was burned, even the. cows,” said Syla. fof! He said Serb police or paramil- itary troops kicked his family out of their Kosovo village five days. before NATO started bombing Serbia on March 24. As they, began the 10-mile walk to the. Kosovo capital, Pristina, Syla said he watched the Serbs douse his house with gas and set it afire. After about 10 days in Pristina, Serb forces made their way to the, neighborhood where Syla’s family, had taken refuge. They were given two hours to clear out, he, said, so they went to the trains as directed, and on to Macedonia. ..: Somewhere on the journey he lost track of two sons and theif families. He mentions them first, then bemoans the fact that in all this time there has been no chance to wash his aging body. ‘< Now, Syla and his fellow Koso” var Albanians are stuck here. “The way they were brought’ here was absolutely inhumane,” said Galegor, who has worked in southeastern Albania more than three years, 96 On Wednesday and Thursday, Macedonian authorities shipped: out as many as 55,000 refugees, whom they had kept penned up between the Macedonian and Kosovo borders for as long as.a week. Macedonia, with a majority of restive Serbs, feared upsettin its own delicate balance of ethnic peoples and refused entry to the ethnic Albanian refugees. “ Around 30,000 were taken to tent camps NATO built further inside Macedonia; others were dispersed to Turkey and Albania, “The police told us they were sending us to some other country, like Germany. They said, ‘You will go abroad,’” said Melihate Rrmoku, 47, who sat Friday eat ing uncooked hot dogs with het’ son and daughter on the section of hard bleachers they have staked out as home. There they sleep and eat and simply sit all day along with hundreds of others. \" They may not be abroad, bu they are out of the rain. More than 1,000 refugees live in the “gym, while others of the Korce contingent have been taken by buses to stay in surrounding vil- lages or have been taken in by local families. .

        "ocr_text": " Serbs, guerrillas step up fighting at border crossing By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS 4 Tirana, Albania — One of the world’s } nastiest border zones became even more dangerous Saturday when Serb forces and Ff ethnic Albanian guerrillas escalated fight ing and created new perils for the Kosovo Albanian refugees trying to flee to safety here in Albania. “There has been machine gun fire, rifles, sniper fire, artillery, mortars, even heavy artillery at some stages,” said Andrea Angeli, spokeswoman for the 55- nation Organization for Security and Coop- eration in Europe. The OSCE monitors, expelled from Yugoslavia before the latest ethnic cleans- ing campaign against Kosovar Albanians, are posted at border positions. The moni- tor team confirmed the continuation of hostilities that began Friday. “This is not far from refugee crossings,” Angeli said, placing the skirmishes about 12 miles north of a border post used by ethnic Albanians escaping what the refu- gees describe as threats and harassment from Serbian Yugoslav police and militia. ‘The border-area fighting carries the danger of broadening the Balkan conflict, should Albania itself come under heavy attack. Albanian Information Minister Musa Ulgini said at east two and as many as six % On Friday, the OSCE reported that four KLA fighters were killed and two wound- ed.

He said Saturday that the Albanian gov- ernment removed 10,000 refugees from the more than 100,000 who have been located in the region’s biggest camp, at the northeastern Albanian border town of Kukes. The effort to relocate the Kosovar exiles has become more urgent since the buildup of troops on both sides of the bor- der began this week. The major fighting between Serb troops and guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army is about 30 miles from the primary border crossing used by refugees heading to Kukes. But Angeli said the exiles have been making their way into Albania at a nimber af harder Ineatinns ernment after it closed the border crossings. The KLA and the Serb-led Yugoslav gov- ernment were principals to the Yugoslav peace talks brokered by the United States in February. The guerrilla leaders reluc- tantly agreed to accept a package that would give the Kosovo province of Yugo- slavia the status of autonomy, but not independence. The KLA also would have put down arms under the agreement, and an interna- tional peace force would have been sta- tioned in Kosovo to protect the population of both ethnic Albanians and ethnic Serbs. But the Serb-led government would not agree to the plan, resulting in the ethnic cleansing campaign that apparently started just before NATO bombing began on March 24. The KLA may retreat back across the border again to hideouts in Albania if NATO steps up its military campaign against the Yugoslav government, as has been promised once the weather clears and more NATO air power arrives.

Maj. Brian Jurticovac is in charge of Air Force troops that in one week have transformed a sleepy commercial airport into the nerve center of the humanitarian relief effort.

Interspersed every half hour or so was a transport plane from one of a half-dozen non- NATO aid donors. Im the last five days, the Air Force has pushed more than 2,000 tons of cargo through Rinas’ sin- gle runway — a cargo flow the Air Force says is greater than the ton- mage handled by Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. Berlin Airlift 2, I sup- pose,’’ said Air Force Maj. Brian Jurkovac, 38, of Columbus, Ohio, who flew in from Germany a week ago to set up satellite com- munications and help coordinate unloading. *“*Today’s C-17 transports can carry so much more than the C-47s and C-S54s that they were using SO years ago,” he said. ‘“The flow and amount of aircraft and the density of the aircraft is very Similar to what was used in the Berlin Airlift, except that the ton- mages and the transport planes are much bigger.’’ Sunday was the first day the U.S. Air Force took over control of all the air space within five rmiles of the airport from Albanian air controllers. And Sunday was the first night the Air Force had enough landing beacons and radar in place to extend the daylight airlift into a round-the-clock operation.  Members of the Ist Combat Communications Semin from Ramstein Air Base, besnmery, eneitite a 20-foot savaine antergi’ Sunday that will give the U.S. military at Rinas everything from Internet to secure international telephone connections. By today, American airmen at the base outside Tirana, Albania’s capital, expected to take over control of a wider sector — the so-called ‘‘approach’’ zone extending out to 60 miles from Rinas. The hulking U.S. transports that made up the bulk of the air- lift Sunday carried everything from aid rations to the first batch of heavy trucks to support the U.S. Army’s expected Apache helicopters and artillery rocket launchers. For many of the 430 airmen in the Air Force’s ground party at Rinas, Sunday will be remem- bered more as a mudlift than an airlift. Spring is supposed to be sunny in Tirana, but over the last three nights it has rained buckets. “The water table is so high that if you dig down a foot you hit water,” said Staff Sgt. Jesse Park- er, 32, who woke up Sunday with eight inches of water in his tent. “We are below ground water level, and we are living in water,” said Staff Sgt. Neil Rothbauer, 33 of Hallettsville, Texas. A week ago, Rinas was Alba- nia’s only functioning civilian air- port. And it wasn’t functioning much. Without a single working radar or beacon for instrument land- ings, Rinas managed to attract only about five or six flights a day by Albania’s national airline and a few intrepid foreign carriers. The buzz among journalists was that Rinas was about the scariest air- port in Europe. In a week, almost everything at Rinas has changed. Up in the ramshackle Albanian control tower, Air Force master sergeants who are some of the top air controllers in the U.S. military were giving crisp orders on the radio to pilots from France, Swit- zerland, Germany and a half- dozen other countries. “Robot 41, reposition granted,” intoned Air Force Tech. Sgt. Whit Morrison, who until a week ago was drafting radar procedures at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. There was one plane — a slen- der blue and white Lear jet — that seemed oddly out of place as it circled the base amongst the military hubbub. At least a dozen times, it whooshed in for land- ings, only to pull up at the last nf an second and whirl around the aif? field to make another approach, ; ;a:, The Lear, based in Oklahoma, City, was sent by the U.S. Federal?

Beautiful 22-year-old Shpresa Halimi gave little thought to becoming prey herself. But just after dark Monday, the young jf woman was spotted by a helmeted Serb mili- tiaman as her refugee caravan rumbled into the town of Dakovica. That is the place where the Pentagon reported last week that Serb forces had been systematically round- ing up young refugee women to rape and sometimes to kill. Four fellow refugees say they saw a Ser- bian paramilitary soldier grab the tall, dark- haired woman from the tractor wagon to keep for himself. Then, her father-in-law, Ferhat Halimi, related, the soldier turned his head, looking for other women. Shpresa took the moment to.try to escape, but the Serbian saw her and riddled her back with Kalashnikov bullets from her head to the base of her spine, said Halimi, who was inches from her when she was shot. “She was killed in my hand,” Halimi said, weeping. “We are completely destroyed now,”: her bereaved husband, Rasim Halimi, 29, said just hours after the family crossed the bor- der into Albania on Tuesday morning. The tale of the Halimi family of Slatina is the latest crest in a tide of tragic stories Kos- ovar refugees have brought out of the embattled province in recent weeks as NATO warplanes have bombed Serb mili- tary targets. JOSPEH P. ALBRIGHT / Cox Newspaper: Married less than a year, Rasim Halimi, a Kosovo refugee whose wife was shot in the back Monday by a Serb militiarman, is overcome as he describes her death. The flow of refugees into neighboring countries has slowed since the Serb-run gov- ernment of Yugoslavia apparently began intermittently closing the border and turn- ing back fleeing Kosovar Albanians last week. But descriptions of life inside Kosovo, given by some of the more than 4,000 refu- gees who were allowed to cross the border overnight Monday, suggest that ethnic Alba- nians remaining in Kosovo face hellish conditions. While impossible to confirm, details of the more than twohweek odyssey of the people from the Kosovo village of Slatina were told with no deviation by more than a dozen peo- ple. Their story lends credence — and chill- ing reality — to Pentagon accusations made at a Washington briefing last week and repeated Tuesday by British Foreign Secre- ar Robin OK “Our evidence .. . comes from the women who have been taken to that camp and are now in the refugee camps inside Albania,” Cook told reporters at the Defense Ministry. He said “a number of aid workers” — including Americans in the area — “have heard the same story from a number of women.” On Tuesday the Halimi family and others from Slatina, a strategically critical village overlooking the Pristina airport in Kosovo, had gathered their tractors and wagons on the muddy edge of the Albanian border city of Kukes, They were grieving over losses greater than just one woman, Shortly before that killing, they said, a 13- year-old boy was shot dead and his mother | fatally wounded when Serb forces spraved gunfire into the makeshift plastic sheet cov- Shpresa’s brother-in-law, Arsim Halimi, 25, was wearing Shpresa’s black parka Tues- day, sitting on the edge of the wagon with his face in his hands, heaving with sobs.

She was a little afraid to go on this trip, but she was more worried about us,” said Arsim Halimi, referring to himself and to his broth- er, Shpresa’s husband of less than a year, What Shpresa’s husband lost perhaps is embodied in her name.

        "ocr_text": "By Joseph Albright Palm Beach Post Staff Writer KUKES, Albania — In a sign of how difficult itis to coordinate a refugee crisis on a foggy day, two U.S. Navy helicopters on Tuesday unloaded 6 tons of food aid at the wrong airstrip — only to have it looted by enterprising mountain people in Albania. The stolen boxes of food weighed about 6 tons — enough to feed about 10,000 of the roughly 95,000 refugees in this border town for one day. U.N. offi- cials said the theft will not cause hunger STRIKE ON YUGOSLAVIA Looters take food aid dropped off at wrong airstrip | in the refugee camps because they have sufficient stockpiles of other food, at least for the next few days. Pentagon officials confirmed Tues- day that the helicopters were sent from the USS Inchon, a mine countermea- sures ship stationed in the Adriatic Sea that has been running humanitarian supplies into Albania for the past two days. Since early Tuesday, they said the ship had delivered more than 66,000 pounds of daily rations in about two dozen helicopter flights. Pentagon officials had no information on Tuesday's specific incident of looting supplies, but no one ruled it out as im- plausible. U.N. aid officials here learned of the episode Tuesday when the American pi- lots of the two Navy helicopters made their way to the office of the U.N,’s World Food Program on the fourth floor of the Hotel Turizmi, asking to use a satellite phone to call their commanding officers. The pilots tolda U.N. duty officer that they landed at an Albanian military air- strip about 2 miles south of this refugee- packed border town. The pilots said they had flown from an American carrier in the Adriatic and had been directed where to bring the food by air controllers at the Rinas Air Field in the Albanian capital of Tirana, whose control tower has come under the direction of U.S, Air Force air controllers within the past 48 hours, The pilots didn’t give the name of the carrier on which they are based. U.N. officials said they were told that one Navy chopper set down just inside the boundaries of the Albanian base and the other landed in a field just outside the boundaries. Navy personnel aboard the copters managed to unload about 6 tons of food. But there were no secuttty guards to protect the cargo, they said. Within minutes, many people showed up and began carting away the food, the Navy pilots told U.N. officials. U.N.

        "ocr_text": "Scores of refugees killed in disputed convoy attack By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONIDENT IN KUKES, ALBANIA and Bob Deans STAFF WRITER IN WASHINGTON U.S. and NATO officials launched an investigation Wednesday into an apparent military attack that killed as many as 70 ethnic Albanians in a refugee convoy moving through Yugoslavia’s embattled Kos- Ovo province near Kukes, Albania. Details of the incident were sketchy and in dispute. By late Wednesday, however, investigators with the Organization for Europe said refu- gees reporting firsthand know- ledge of the attack suggested it ‘was staged by Serb troops who wanted to make it appear the alli s were the work of NATO bombs.

The 15 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 15, 1999 > European Union nations also sug- gested that Europe could tempo- rarily administer Kosovo if Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces and allowed Albanian refu- gees to return. U.S. and NATO officials said the initiatives were a “construc- tive” step toward keeping the dip- lomatic door open. They dis- missed out of hand, however, a suggestion by Milosevic that United Nations monitors might take the place of NATO peace- keepers, as the alliance has _insisted upon, once the current ‘ conflict ebbs in Kosovo. Far from halting the bombing, officials with the Clinton administration insisted they would continue to intensify the air campaign. The ‘point was underscored with the deployment of 24 additional F-16 fighter/bombers and four more A-10 combat attack jets. The air- craft, part of some 80 fresh war- ‘planes and refueling tankers the Pentagon approved last weekend for the NATO mission, are due to arrive at Aviano Air Base in Italy today. Officials in Washington suggested Wednesday that -NATO’s air campaign in Yugosla- via could stretch into the sum- mer. In addition, the first of 24 Apache combat helicopters were scheduled to fly out of Germany on Wednesday and arrive at a base in Albania today. All of the helicopters were scheduled to be in place in Albania by Saturday, though it wasn’t clear how soon and with determination, until the crisis ends on acceptable terms,” Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Washington. “Serb security. forces must leave so that the refugees can re-enter, an international security pres- ence must be permitted, and the people of Kosovo must be given the democratic self-government they have long deserved.” Milosevic offered no such arantees. \fKosovo: War may stretch into summer The attack under investigation ‘on the convoy of refugees Wednesday is the latest harrow- ing episode in the Kosovo crisis. It occurred along a road near the southwestern town of Djakovica in Kosovo. Two starkly different versions of the events quickly emerged. State-run television in Yugosla- via blamed the attack on NATO pilots, saying they bombed the refugee convoy. If correct, that would be the single worst case of civilian casu- alties in the three-week-old air campaign and the second major incident this week involving civilians. Video from the catastrophic scene was replayed over and over in Yugoslavia, with scenes of chil- dren and elderly people weeping and nursing what appeared to be serious wounds after their rag-tag convoy of tractors, wagons, live- stock and carts came under attack. The Pentagon said the results of the NATO investigation could be available as early as today. At NATO headquarters in Brussels, pilots involved in the mission told NATO Supreme Allied Cmdr. Gen. Wesley Clark that they bombed military vehi- cles shortly after 3:30 p.m. Yugo- slav time in the area where the convoy was attacked. The pilots, and the forward command air- craft that guide each plane’s indi- vidual air raid, are under orders not to bomb unless they can iden- tify their target. “They believe they hit only mil- itary vehicles,” Pentagon spokes- man Kenneth Bacon told report: ers at the Pentagon. Clark told Bacon that he had received independent, but not verified, reports that Serb troops had positioned military vehicles near the front and rear of a refu- gee convoy. Clark was investigat- ing reports that the Serbs, after the NATO attack, turned their fury on the civilians, attacking them with gunfire and grenades. O’Sullivan said he had two teams of OSCE investigators try- ing to track down what happened to the refugee column. He said none of the refugees who spoke to his teams said they believed the assault came from a NATO plane. A translator for the humanitar- ian group Doctors of the World said a woman had been treated around 5:30 DP. m., Albanian Mime, by a hand grenade or bomb. Meanwhilé, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin for the first time officially accused Serb forces of using rape as a weapon of terror in a campaign of repres- sion that has driven up to 1.4 mil- lion ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo. In other developments: @ The FBI warned the U.S. mili- tary to be alert for possible Serb- led terrorist attacks inside the United States after several churches received “threats to kill” American soldiers, accord- ing to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. FBI counterterrorism agents issued the memo last week after Serbian Orthodox churches in the Sacramento, Milwaukee, Chicago and Indianapolis areas received via fax a Serb-language letter urging Serbian Americans to respond violently to NATO strikes on Yugoslavia. @ The flow of refugees picked up again into Macedonia and Alba- nia, apparently representing a shift in policy by Yugoslav authorities who had turned refu- gees back from border areas last week.

        "ocr_text": "Refugee tide flows over reopened border By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Kukes, Albania — The Yugo- slay government’s inexplicable policy on refugees took another mysterious twist Wednesday when thousands of Kosovar Albanians, including some pre- vented from leaving the country last week, began _§ straggling across the reopened border. Another 3,000 refugees had also entered Macedonia by train, foot and car at two border cross- ings, and 7,000 were expected to be coming along behind them, Interior Minister Pavle Trajnov told the Associated Press. It was still uncertain late Wednesday whether this would be the flood tide of families that humanitarian aid workers have anxiously awaited since the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav government suddenly shut the border last week. More than 3,000 had crossed into Albania by midnight, and there were some indications that a major sweep of ethnic cleans- ing might be underway. In Brussels, Belgium, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata told the Associ- ated Press on Wednesday that 525,000 Kosovo refugees were outside the Yugoslav province, but she could not say how many remained inside Kosovo. She said relief agencies pro- vided humanitarian aid to 400,000 people inside Kosovo until March 23, the day before NATO air strikes began. UNHCR officials expected Macedonia to receive 50,000 ref- ugees soon. The estimate was based on accounts from people in Kosovo who said many people from the city of Urosevac, 20 miles from the Macedonian bor- der, were on the move. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 15, 1999 Albania has taken in 300,000 Kosovo refugees in the last three weeks; Macedonia has_ had 120,000. The influx has strained the two poor Balkan countries. Macedonia has said its new camps are almost at capacity. Wednesday, many arrived on foot and many were making their second, exhausting run at the border. Their stories still did not clarify the Serbs’ aim in earlier turning them back. “None of us can understand it,” said Jaferr Deliaj, 50, moments after his family of eight walked into Albania. Early last week, Serb police stopped them before the border and told them to go back home because the fighting was over, Deliaj said. But when they got back to their village of Dveric, about 60 miles to the north, Serb militia were occupying the burned-out remains. They told the refugees to go and stay in a school at a nearby town. About 600 of Deliaj’s townspeople remained in the school until Serb militia came to them Monday and demanded once again that they depart their native territory. “They told us the road is now open, so you must go to Albania,” said Deliaj, a farmer. Before they left, Serb forces confiscated six of the _ group’s_ tractors, including Deliaj’s. His family rode with a neighbor — 40 peo- ple cramped for two days in a tractor-hauled wagon — until they got three miles from the border. The gasoline ran out, so they walked the rest of the way. None of the refugees indicated they had been used as human shields. They simply stated that they had been told to go back home because the fighting was over. Then they were kicked out again. \f"

But — many refugees who talked with reporters Thursday remained loyal to NATO and its efforts. Some of the refugees still reeling from one of the Wednesday assaults adamantly refused to believe — despite its admis- sion — that NATO could hit refugees.

NATO acknowledged it hit a truck in a civilian convoy. But the refugees in Kukes said they had no trucks but were traveling in convoys comprised of trac- tors and thousands of people on foot. Neither journalists nor investigators for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have found refugees in Kukes who describe a bomb- ing attack that left as many dead as the worst of the attacks in Kosovo. Refugees from the caravan that arrived late Wednesday and in the early hours Thursday set the number of vic- tims in attacks they witnessed at between two and six. They also claimed that at least two MiG-21s — the kind the Yugo- slav air force flies — had been circling low before the bombing. Bojrami said the planes struck three times, missing them with the first two bombs. Others heard similar comments from Serbian police and military along the way. They said, however, that they did not believe the Serbs. They also acted surprised when American journalists said NATO actually might have done the bombing. “T thought, of course, it cannot be NATO, but the Serb military, because I trust, I have lots of belief in NATO,” Sania Fazliu, 27, a geological ane She and others who passed the bom! site on foot said the Serb police filming the wreckage and intervi wounded man.

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT IN MORINA, ALBANIA and Charies W. Holmes STAFF CORRESPONDENT IN BRAZDA, MACEDONIA Day and night, Kosovo refugees stumbled out of their homeland Friday, describing tens of thou- sands following them in what many said was an increasingly brutal Serbian campaign of ethnic cleansing. By midnight Friday, Albanian time, 10,000 had entered through the single main Albanian border crossing at Morina, tripling the entries of Thursday. At least 6,000 crossed three border points into Macedonia, equaling the number Thursday. Many of the refugees told of killings, of girls being grabbed and kept by police and soldiers, of family separations, beatings, theft and the conflagrations they say Serbs made of their homes back in Kosovo when they chased them out. Officials from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said they had reports that a trail of refugees more than 15 miles long was stretched back beyond the border, headed for Albania. IKHAIL METZEL / Associated Press The new flood of refugees came as NATO stepped up its air strikes on Yugoslav targets and the Pen- tagon indicated it may call up as many as 33,000 reservists to help in the conflict. NATO officials said the targets Friday included oil refineries, military barracks and airports in Kosovo, Montenegro and the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. They called it one of the most success- ful nights in its nearly monthlong air campaign against Yugoslavia. On the Yugoslav-Albanian border, Albanian and Serb forces exchanged fire for five hours, Albania’s Interior Ministry sai Adding to the international sion was a decision by the Russian parliament to urge President Boris Yeltsin to include Yugosla- via in a Slavic union with Russia and Belarus, despite warnings the move could push Russia into a conflict with the United States.

Now little Arta has a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder. “We had 20 cases like this over in the Cultural Palace,” said Elvana Zhezha, the coordinator of the Alba- nian Center for Human Rights, who is running the psychosocial program for children here in coordination with the United Nations Children’s Fund. The Cultural Palace is a Communist-era activities center now housing both refugees and programs to help them. It is part of the ad hoc network of shelters for 100,000 refu- gees who descended upon a city with a population of 25,000. Fully half these refugees are younger than 18. UNICEF trained 30 Albanians, mostly health care professionals, to work with children like Arta who are traumatized by the shock of war. Zhezha said she is hoping to train doctors and nurses among the Koso- var Albanian refugee population. “They can take the experience with them,” she said — but only if the ethnic cleansing is reversed and they . can return to their ravaged homes in Kosovo. The mental and emotional damage done to children in wartime situa- tions like this is an often hidden problem, but it is among the most critical and long-lasting. “Our biggest concern is sanitation and hygiene, followed by psychoso- cial problems,” said Paul Martin, the UNICEF coordinator here. These youngsters have the advan- tage of being generally healthy to start with. They are not malnour- ished or plagued with exotic diseases, as poverty-stricken Africans often are, and they are already toughened by rough country living. Still, children 3 years old and younger often don’t get fully washed for weeks when families have been traveling as these have. Behija Thaci is grateful for the two Pampers a day she gets from a local church for her 6-month-old daughter, but she needs more. “Tt isn’t enough because of the diarrhea,” she said. After the intense pressure of mov- ing across embattled territory, fami- lies land in a refugee camp where toi- lets and clean water are a long walk away. Or they may end up in a field that has neither. Water that is available is cold — so cold that it leaves infants wailing.

On Thursday at one new tent camp, even though chemical toilets stood available 50 yards away, moth- ers took their tykes to a closer grassy spot that happened to be next to a stream where others were washing clothes. But those are conditions that will be alleviated and are not so likely to leave deep scars. Other traumas will stay with these children forever. Zhezha talked about young girls of 13 or 14 who were raped in front of their families — an offense that, among Muslims, leaves as deep a stigma on the victim as on the preda- tor. “There are also children trauma- tized from the scene where Serb sol- diers — three or four of them — raped the mother,” she said. “Imag- ine what it would be like seeing your mother scream and struggle.” Symptoms of troubled children ca be seen everywhere. The small, silent faces with unnaturally wide-open eyes peering out of plastic cover's on tractor-drawn wagons; aggressive children who kick and punch and de away from their parents; the screams when a helicopter passes, a frequent event in this mountain region where supplies are most easily carried on whirlybirds. Many of these children need seri- ous counseling, but for now they mus’ make do with the aid of people who have two weeks’ training in dealing with troubled children.

West is one of the operational chiefs who would be in charge of deploying the battle-ready Marine landing unit of roughly 2,000 Marines that is now afloat in the Aegean Sea aboard the assault ship U.S.S. Nassau. For his part, NATO com- mander Gen. Wesley Clark, made no mention of a possible deployment of Marines during his first visit Saturday to the Balkans since the start of the alliance's bombing of Serbian targets. But after flying in for whirl- wind consultations with Alban- ian political and military lead- ers, Clark disclosed that the Army's new outfit, called Task Force Hawk, was now in busi- ness at its impromptu camp by the air field. He said Task Force Hawk will be under the command of a three-star Army general, Lt. Gen. Jay Hendrix, who com- mands the U. S. Fifth Corps in Heidelberg, Germany. The choice of a three-star general to command Task Force Hawk was a hint, perhaps for Slobodan Milosevic’s benefit, that the Pentagon might even- tually send as many as 20,000 ground troops here. One of the few times in this decade when the U.S. has entrusted a three- star general to command an expeditionary force was the Somalia operation in the early 1990s, where U.S. troops exceeded 25,000. The Fifth Corps, which incluces the famed First Infantry Division — the Big Red One — that has made its mark in nearly every conflict involv- ing American troops in this century.

By Joseph Albright COX.NEWS SERVICE RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania — An Air Force transport plane on Sunday disgorged more than 110 U.S. Army ground-to-ground mis- siles as NATO continued to unfurl the first elements of a ground force that could blast its way. into Kosovo. Nowhere in sight were the long-awaited Apache tank-killer helicopters. In recent days, the Apaches have assumed a mythic importance to the nervous Alba- nian public, and so all day small knots of Albanians gathered near the airfield to gawk at what many here expect will be a weapon that will immediately turn the tide against the hated Serbs. As night fell, the word spread that the Apaches’ arrival was put off at least until today because of lightning storms over the air field. With the Apaches still stuck on the ground in Italy, correspon- dents waiting in sporadic rain and hail on the Rinas flight line were allowed to see crate after crate of Army mid-range missiles for the Multiple Rocket Launcher System unloaded from a C-17 transport. Stenciled on the side of the olive green rocket pods were the words “Guided Missile and Launching Assembly” and “‘Do Not Drop.” The white block writ- ing also specified that the mis- siles had been manufactured by Loral Vaught Systems of Dallas, Texas. Known as M-39 ATACMs, or “Attack-’ems,”’ the missiles are America’s most advanced artil- lery weapons.

The mobile rocket launchers that fire the rockets have not been seen here. This suggests it will be a number of days at least before they could be used to strike into Kosovo. The MRLS launchers, which resemble heavy military tractor- trailer trucks, will presumably be driven soon to launch bases in northern Albania, near the Kos- ovo border. Deployment of the MLRS was announced by the Pentagon more than a week ago. Also flowing off the Air Force C-17 transports on Sunday were hundreds of elite American com- bat troops. Among the Sunday arrivals were Army paratroopers from a U.S. Airborne outfit based in Ger- many. They wouldn't talk about anything but the weather. And the spokesman for the fast- growing Army contingent, Lt. Col. Garrie Dornan, made him- self unavailable, as he has done since flying in from Germany two days ago. The first mission of the para- troopers could well be to secure a series of firing bases in the mountains of northern Albania, between the refugee-packed towns of Kukes and Bajram Cur- rie. The paratroopers could well be assigned to establish a front- line cordon to shield the mobile missile launchers. But if they are augmented later with more paratroopers and Blackhawk transport helicopters, they could become the lead ele- ments of an airborne landing deep inside the territory of Yugo- slavia’s President Slobodan Milosevic. Initially, the Army’s mobile Dayton Daily News - rocket launchers will probably be fired from within a dangerous Albanian mountain terrain that looks like a washboard. In the last week, Serbian infiltrators have repeatedly conducted cross- border raids into northern Alba- nia and lobbed artillery at irregu- lar Kosovo guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army operat- ing in the border area. If they could operate safely from sites near the border, the Army’s missiles could drill tar- gets along the bloody refugee escape trail through the Kosovo towns of Dakovica and Prizren. The missiles also have suffi- cient range to hit Kosovo's capi- tal Pristina and well beyond. But before they can shoot, they have to receive the precise map coordi- nates of the targets from drone helicopters, satellites or other intelligence. April 18, 1999 \f"

At border points in neighboring Macedonia, fewer than 1,000 new refugees arrived Sunday, compared with a total of 12,000 on Friday and Saturday.

Marani said the film showed “neat rows of individual graves pointing to the southeast, toward Mecca.” He called that a sign the mostly Albanians were trying to*bury the victims of Milosevic with respect.” Spokesmen said NATO jets had flown more than 500 missions in the 24-hour period ending Sunday afternoon, the highest daily total yet.

Other targets reportedly included an oil refinery in Yugo- slavia’s second-largest city, Novi Sad, military jets and vehicles on the ground, and several bridges. The official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that a 3- year-old girl was killed when a bomb hit a school in Batajnica, northwest of Belgrade, also the site of a military airfield.

Those same military sources estimated that 750,000 to 840,000 displaced people were wandering within Kosovo province, accord- ing to Angela Walker, spokes- woman for the WFP. Also on Monday, NATO heli- copter crews began arriving here to begin airlifting refugees out of this border region teeming with sudden guests. O’Sullivan said the troops expected to take out 3,000 refugees a day from concentra- tions at various border points. So far the troops that have arrived are American, British and Danish, and the helicopters are American, he said. Yugoslav officials in Belgrade told radio reporters that the refu- gees from Kosovo had stopped coming because of the intensified NATO bombardment. “Before, they said the refugees were leaving because of the bombing,” O’Sullivan said. “That’s not the reason they’re not coming.” Whatever the reason, the disap- pearance of the refugees terrified friends and relatives waiting for them here. “I am afraid they will be killed,” said Nimani Haxhi, a 50- year-old who drove eight children of his extended family out of Kos- ovo on Friday. Walking some- where behind them were Haxhi’s wife and two eldest children, his brother and sister-in-law. Since Friday, Haxhi and the children have remained at this isolated border crossing, sleeping in the car and waiting for the rest of their family. “It’s been cold,” he said. For his crew it’s been very cold, since Serb militia bashed out the win- dows on the driver’s side of the car, front and back. He had attached plastic to the driver’s side window. He also pointed out a bullet hole in the back end of the car, another going-away gift bestowed by Serb troops as Haxhi drove his family’s future generations out of their home in Mitrovice, in north- central Kosovo. There hasn’t been a lot of food for them. He had just fed the chil- dren lunch, bread and long green onions that a farmer was peddling from the back of his car. Behije Nushi also has been liv- ing out of her car here since Fri- day, waiting for 15 people left behind. Their family chose to send the older relatives, a man and six women, in one sedan. “We checked every tractor,” Nushi said, “all the day and all the night.” Hundreds passed the area, often very quickly during the peak period when more than 20,000 people entered Albania in a day. There has been no sign of the missing 15. She is waiting for her husband and two of her children. Nushi, 49, said her family also came from Mitrovice, a city that refugees report suddenly was emptied of virtually all its ethnic Albanian residents late last week. How long will she wait in this spot? “Tll wait until the children come — two weeks, one month. I hope they will come today, but I’ll wait as long as it takes,” she said. “We cannot live without them.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 20, 1999 \f"

' Mc€all, 71, was a director of the Washington-based humanitar- ian. aid group Refugees Interna- tiqnal. He and his wife, 57, were on a mission to assess the needs of the growing refugee population in Albania, where more than 340,000 ethnic Albanians have sought refuge from _ repressive activities in the Serbian province of Kosovo. | Also killed in the accident were Refugees International’s Euro- pean Representative, Yvette Pierpaoli, and the group’s Alba- nian driver, whose name was not provided by the refugee group. “David and Penny McCall and Yvette Pierpaoli died as they had lived: on a mission to help people in need,” wrote U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, chairman of the Refugees International board. “Their generosity and courage will not be forgotten.” McCall, a former New York advertising executive, had been tapped to replace Holbrooke — special White House envoy for the Balkans and President Clinton’s nominee as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations — as chairman of Refugees International. The sport-utility vehicle the four victims were riding in slid off the edge of a winding moun- tain road two-thirds of the way from Tirana to Kukes on Sunday, said Shep Lowman, vice president for policy for Refugees International. The mountain road they were on is a treacherous proposition. Its hairpin curves and steep grades present countless opportu- nities for disaster. Sheer cliffs drop off the road with no barriers to warn the unsuspecting driver or to halt and deflect a vehicle that fails to negotiate a turn. These days it is especially haz- ardous, -with trucks carrying humanitarian aid, tractors haul- ing refugees down the mountains and more behemoth buses than normal plying the route to carry Kosovo refugees to the southern part of Albania. There scarcely is room to pass them. Lowman, who was recently on the road, said the vehicle plunged roughly 400 yards down a mud- slicked ravine in a pouring rain. The organization did not offi- cially confirm the deaths until after the bodies were recovered by helicopter Monday. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 20, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "600 U.S. paratroopers semt to Kosovo border They will safeguard Apache helicopters that will target Serb tanks, troops; some say NATO ground war near. By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT IN ALBANIA and Scott S' STAFF WRITER IN WASHINGTON Hundreds of battle-ready ground troops of the elite 82nd Airborne Divi- sion departed from American shores Monday night for Albania to conduct “infantry-type missions” against Yugo- slav forces that are based in Kosovo Province, U.S. military officials said. About 600 members of the S0OSth Parachute Infantry Regiment were being airlifted from the airborne divi- sion’s headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C. The operation is part of Task Force Hawk, the deployment of 24 Apache attack helicopters and land-based mis- siles in Albania for possible use against Serbian tanks and soldiers in Kosovo. The principal mission of the para- troopers is to provide security for the basing of Apaches near the Kosovo bor- der. Members of the 82nd Airborne per- formed a similar role as peacekeepers in Bosnia in 1996, providing security at an air base in Tuzla. But a statement issued Monday by a spokesman at Fort Bragg on the depar- ture of the paratroopers raised questions about whether NATO is moving closer to a ground war. “Our paratroopers will perform a variety of infantry-type missions, including security,” said Bob Coultas, spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg. Spokesmen for the 82nd Airborne Division declined to elaborate. About 2,000 NATO troops are already in Albania, and Pentagon officials have indicated that as many as 2,000 more airborne troops could be sent there as part of Task Force Hawk. Another 6,000 ground troops are expected to help with relief for Kosovar refugees in Albania. About 2,400 Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C., are in Albania helping set up refugee camps, and another 2,200 from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit at Lejeune set sail last week for the Adriatic Sea. In addition, there are about 12,000 NATO troops in Macedonia, including ' about 600 Americans. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has emphasized repeatedly that NATO has no plans to authorize a ground invasion of Kosovo. But on Sun- day, he significantly added to the ongo- ing dialogue about ground troops. “If the moment comes when it is nec- essary, I’m sure the countries that belong to NATO will be ready to do it,” ENRIC MARTI / Assoc iated Pres: Paratroopers arrive Monday at the military airport in Tirana, Albania, as U.N. . High Commissioner for Refugees helicopters take off to deliver aid to refugees. he said, referring to sending troops into Yugoslavia. Lead units of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived Sunday at Rinas Air Field in Albania after a nine- hour flight from Fort Bragg. They began moving out of their overnight quarters on the airfield Monday, departing in camouflaged Humvees to points unknown along Albania’s frontier border with Kosovo. “I feel motivated being here,”’ said Army Pfc. Sam Cruce of Gainesville, Ga., one of the first arrivals. ‘It’s pretty cool. I never expected to be deployed out here.” A squad leader, 2nd Lt. Ryan Leigh of St. Cloud, Minn., said: “It’s a good mission for America. And I am happy to be here; I’m proud to be here. We are doing the right thing.”’ When asked how many troops of the 82nd were on their way to Alba- nia, a captain replied: “A bunch.’ At the Pentagon, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald said Monday the Apaches would arrive in Albania by today, weather permitting. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), back in Washington after a trip to the Balkans, warned Monday would be “many weeks” and erhaps months” before the Apaches would be a major factor in the conflict. *“Everybody’s looking for a silver bullet,”? said Levin, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He briefed reporters in what he said was an effort to lower public expectations for the helicopters, which are expected to begin flying missions in about a week. “<The pilots have to become accustomed to the terrain,” Levin said. The complex support and defense preparations, which include putting spotters on the ground to guide pilots to potential targets, are a long way from com- pletion, he said. The 82nd Airborne Division was formed in 1917 at Camp Gordon, Ga. Because members of the divi- sion came from all 48 states, includ- ing Sgt. Alvin York of Tennessee, the unit was nicknamed “‘All- Americans,” which led to its famed “AA” shoulder patch. The division led the J)-Day assault at Normandy Beach in World War II. Following the surren- der of Germany, it was ordered to Berlin for occupation duty. The division served during the Tet offensive in Vietnam in 1968, in Grenada in 1983, as p of “Just Cause” to arrest Pana dictator Manuel Noriega in 1989, and for the liberation of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. As the 82nd Airborne troops were getting organized by the taxi- way at Rinas on Monday, an Ameri- can mobile artillery unit from Ger- many rolled out of the airfield gates in the general direction of the Albania-Kosovo border. The artillery troops were armed with truck-borne multiple rocket launchers designed to fire tactical ATACM missiles, nicknamed “Attack-Ems,”’ at targets 60 miles away or farther. As the U.S. artillery unit passed along the roads leading northward, Albanians watched by the side of the road with apparent delight and wonderment. Monday was also a day of consid- erable jubilation at the headquar- ters of the Kosovo Liberation Army in the Albanian capital, Tirana. Members of the guerrilla organiza- tion were issuing KLA press cre- dentials to journalists for use in ter- ritory inside Kosovo after it has been “liberated” from the Serbs. “I hope the U.S. Army will stay’ forever in Kosovo,” said Visar Reka, a KLA spokesmen. “I wish America wor id make it the, Sist State.” a Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 20, 1999 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Tide of refugees By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Kukes, Albania — Trucks and buses are carrying 10,000 people a day away from the frigid nights and windy, rain-spattered days of this mountain valley, making room in refugee camps for the thousands still expected to arrive. A NATO helicopter ferry service is expected to start flying by Thursday, taking away those who are ill-suited to the nine- to 10-hour ride out. They will be flown to Tirana, Albania’s capital, and other cities farther south. Jacques Franquin, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said the helicopters will be used only for ‘“‘vulnerable” people. But to avoid breaking up families, sick or elderly people will be accompanied by all the relatives who are with them. Many refugees have dug in ada- mantly for a long stay. This is as close as they can remain to their ravaged homes and missing relatives. “For two months, I won’t move at all,”” said Osman Sllamniku, who is liv- ing in a tent camp with 21 members of his extended family. “After that, we'll consider it for the sake of the children.” The U.N. refugee agency declared its camps in Macedonia full beyond EDWARD KEATING / N.Y. Times A mother kisses her child at a refugee camp near the Kosovo border. their capacity on Tuesday, leaving 2,000 to 3,000 new arrivals from Kosovo stuck in a frontier no man’s land with no food, water or blankets. While the exhausted refugees faced a sec- ond night of driving wind and rain, those for- tunate enough to cross the border faced new harassment in Macedonia, which has reluc- tantly taken in the fleeing throngs. With its largest camp packed with 25,000 displaced people, the U.N. High Commis- sioner for Refugees was forced to put recent arrivals outside the enclave’s fence because local farmers would not sell or lease land to expand the Brazda camp. That leaves people on its fringes vulnerable to raids by a local population resentful of the overwhelming influx of ethnic Albanians. Macedonian civilians come nightly to the exposed tents, throwing stones, shining flash- lights into the tents and shouting while the exiles cower inside, the Kosovo Albanians said. It is feared the Serbian-led Yugoslav mili- tary forces have prevented the departure of hundreds of thousands of people who were en route to the Albanian and Macedonian bor- ders to escape ethnic cleansing brutalities, and these refugees may be hiding in remote mountains or forested areas. The U.N. World Food Program has begun discussing an airdrop of supplies to those swamping relief efforts ALBERTO PELLASCHIAR / Associated Long suffering turns to desperation: Kosovar refugees grab the back of a truck distributing food in Kukes, Albania, as it tries to move to avoid the crush of humanity. hiding within Kosovo and has made an appeal to donor countries for 6 million of the food packages called humanitarian daily rations. But a NATO official in Kukes said neither the aircraft nor the supplies are in place to mount such an operation. If the Kosovo Albanian refugees still trying to flee their homeland are permitted by the Serbs to leave, the situation on the borders of Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro again will become critical. Once again on Tuesday, while 2,000 to 3,000 refugees did make their way into Mace- donia, only a few crossed into Albania. They said thousands more were behind them. The grim prospect of a resumed refugee flow is fueling the effort to move out refugees who in many cases are settling in Albania to await the conclusion of NATO bombing aimed at forcing Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, to allow them back into an autonomous Kosovo province. New tent camps are creating a white-and- green mosaic across the spring countryside in anticipation of a new rush of exiles. But aid authorities are aiming to keep them as transit camps, not semi-permanent homes. “These camps have to be transitional,” said Daniel Endres, coordinator for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees here. “We have to explain to refugees that staying up here means many risks, and those risks increase ae the intensification of war on the other side.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 21, 1999 \f"

Morris said the border between Montenegro and Croatia had been closed by Serb forces, cutting off that escape route. Some refugees were trying to find safe haven by crossing far- ther northwest into Bosnia. Morris expressed concern over destabilization of Montene- gro as Serb forces continued their effort to take control of Montenegrin police, who have remained largely neutral in the Kosovo conflict. @ Albania: People apparently were being diverted from cross- ing into Albania at the main bor- der point just north of Kukes.

        "ocr_text": "APACHE HELICOPTERS First flock of tank-busting aircraft arrives to join NATO air campaign By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Rinas Air Field, Albania — This mud-slicked tarmac moved toward a war footing Wednesday after the first formation of the U.S. Army’s most lethal tank-busting helicopters touched down and prepared to battle the Serbian army. Hundreds of U.S. troops lined up along the run- way to gawk as the six wasp-shaped Apaches landed at Albania’s only functioning civilian and military airfield. “I thought they were going to play ‘The Flight of the Valkyries,’ like in ‘Apocalypse Now’,” said Army Sgt. Matt Fredrickson, 24, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The Apaches will launch their first attacks with- out warning, possibly in the next few days. “The risks to Serbian forces are great,” said an Army briefer, Capt. Mark Arden, 29, an Apache pilot now serving as a staff officer. “They have been successful so far against women and children that are unarmed, and I think the table is about to turn when we enter the conflict.” The six Apaches — the first of 24 — flew in . They were part of a deafening convoy that included five troop-carrying Black Hawks, two Chi- nook heavy lifters and two Black Hawk medical choppers. © NATO has earmarked another 18 Apaches to intensify the air war against Serbian tanks, heavy guns and troop formations. Arden said the Apache pilots “are all fired up — they know that they are the tip of the spear in the entire United States military.” During the Gulf War, the AH-64 Apaches were credited with destroying more than 500 Iraqi tanks as well as scores of artillery pieces and armored personnel carriers without the loss of a single Apache. But an Apache pilot was also responsible for one of the Gulf War’s worst episodes of “friendly fire.” In the heat of combat, the pilot transposed two map coordinates and launched several laser-guided Hell- fire missiles, which scorched two American Bradley | fighting vehicles, killing two Americans and wound- - ing six. Some American commanders in the Gulf were so . distrustful of the Apaches’ inability to distinguish | targets at night that they ordered American tank columns to advance only by daylight.

The Apaches are armed with up to 16 laser- guided Hellfire missiles and 76 Hydra rockets as well as a 30mm “chain gun” cannon with 1,200 rounds of ammunition. Though they are capable of reaching 200 mph, Apaches tend to creep up on their targets at very low altitudes, concealing themselves behind tree lines and hilltops. At night, their pilots wear night- vision goggles. After receiving target intelligence from U.S. reconnaissance satellites and drone helicopters, the Apaches are designed to pop up for a few seconds to lock onto and identify a suspected target. They use thermal and other imaging devices packed into a big antenna pod shaped like a giant hockey puck that rests above the rotors. Their greatest vulnerability is that they lack stealth ability and readily show up on enemy radar. through a slate-gray sky from the direction of the Adriatic Sea and touched down an hour before sunset.

REFUGEES Albania told more coming as 800 arrive By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Morina Border Point, Albania — A small surge of about 800 refugees escaped here from Kosovo on Thursday, giving clues to the fate of hundreds of thousands of others thought still trapped in the vise of Serbian ethnic cleansing. At least 2,000 refugees walked through Macedonia’s main border crossing, Blace, on Thursday. It was unclear if these were the vanguard of a new pha- lanx of ethnic Albanians who would be permitted to leave or merely one group set free by some authority’s whim. Some of the refugees who reached Albania bore bullet wounds, others a glazed look of exhaustion. Most had walked about 20 miles that morning after taking refuge for four nights at a village northwest of the border crossing. They confirmed that the Serb army and police had halted their flight from Kosovo last Sunday, the day the flow of refugees here virtually dried up. ’ “The soldiers stopped us and told us to go back, to go home,” said Ganimete Ber- isha, 43, who was traveling with her hus- band and seven children, including a 6- week-old baby. Her family and others were too fright- ened to return to their villages, which they said local Serbian police and sol- diers had forced them to leave. The people of a village called Zrze let them stay in a large greenhouse and gave them food and milk for the babies. On Wednesday night, the refugees said, Serb soldiers said they had to leave Zrze in the morning. They said they were told to choose their ravaged homes or this Albanian border town as a destination. None of the refugees questioned had any explanation for the erratic policy of Yugoslavia’s Serb authorities. What happened to this group still does not explain the whereabouts of tens of thousands of others who had been reported on the road in Kosovo and even standing in a line that refugees arriving last Saturday and Sunday said extended more than 10 miles to the border. Those others may have run into simi- lar roadblocks to departure, but have not yet been told they can cross into Albania. But if these refugees are any example, the Kosovar Albanians are on the run. Most of the refugees who arrived Thurs- day had been away from their homes for weeks. They described similar odysseys, punctuated by beatings and shootings. Meanwhile, at the Tekepat Ceshmes military post along the Macedonian bor- der of Kosovo province, humanitarian aid workers were finally allowed Thursday to get food, water and blankets to refu- gees sheltering in “medieval” conditions in a snowy mountain village on the frontier. Macedonians had for days forbidden access, citing what they said was Serb military activity in the area. Aid workers expressed relief at the Macedonian deci- sion to finally let supply convoys through and said they hoped it heralded improved cooperegion.

And about the ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo the Serbs might be holding as human shields. “Yes sir, it’s not a nice thing,” said Hoover, 29, of Twin Falls, Idaho, the fire direction chief for a Multiple Rocket Launch System mobile launcher. “But I have confidence that the right people above me will make the right decisions.” Hoover, who flew in from Germany about four days ago, fights his battles from a computer terminal inside the cab of his launcher. He belongs to Charley Battery, 1/27 Field Artillery. And his launcher is a big green military truck with what looks like a giant cigarette pack rest- ing on the flat bed. Inside the box are six rockets, each about 13 feet long without their warheads. Charley Battery’s job is to serve as the remote-control bodyguards for the slow- flying 24 Apache helicopter gunships when they start attacking Serb tanks and guns — which could be in the next few days. Apaches are easy to spot on enemy radar. If American commanders get intel- ligence of a Serb anti-aircraft crew pre- paring to shoot an Apache, it will be Charley Battery’s responsibility to “sup- press” those Serbs before they get off a fatal shot. In case anyone needs a translation of the military verb “to suppress,” it means anything from scaring their pants off to blowing them to pieces. With an MLRS, it’s likely to be the latter. To Charley Battery, it really doesn’t matter, so long as the Apache and its two- man crew flies back to this base unharmed. In recent days, Charley Battery has been practicing to help protect the first Apache attacks on Serb tanks, artillery and troops. Based on how MLRS mobile launchers functioned in the Gulf War, the launcher crew moves almost at the last minute to a forward firing position. That’s where Charley Battery will await a radioed “fire mission” from an operations officer at a battle headquarters in the rear. The crew takes a reading on a Global Positioning System satellite to set its firing position. Most of the shots fired by the 1/27 Field Artillery in the first few days of Apache attacks are likely to be MLRS rockets, During the Gulf War, these fired at targets out to about 30 miles. For targets further out, the MLRS units are also capable of firing a longer-range and more. accurate weapon called the Army Tactical Missile System, known by its phonetic acronym “Attack-Ems.” The latest version of “Attack-Ems” is a guided missile that car- ries 950 cluster bomblets and shoots out to a range of more than 180 miles.

Once is enough.” A stepped-up program urging voluntary departures from Kukes (pronounced KO00’-kihs) has convinced some refugees to leave. But not nearly the tens of thou- sands relief agencies say will be necessary to make places for a potential influx of more escapees from the embattled Yugo- slav province of Kosovo. Most refugees who agree to leave will be heading to unknown accommodations, perhaps camping out in a gymnasium or crowding into a private home. On Friday an estimated 4,500 refugees departed. Earlier, officials had expressed hopes of relocating perhaps 10,000 a day. Only about 200 refugees crossed the border from Kosovo on Friday, but a tor- rent of people could be released any time. “I don’t want to leave,” the boy said. . “All the men have stayed there. My father is still there.” His camp on the outskirts of town was the site of a snafu that only aggravated the problem. When the information campaign started Thursday to induce refugees to leave for less crowded and safer areas, hundreds of people packed to go. “In the morning, we thought all these people will go, so we will go too. We didn’t want to stay here alone,” said Sherife Xhe- GRY ingili, a 28-year-old mother in Kukes with . MARCIA KUNSTEL / Staff Haxhi Haxhaj reluctantly drives his extended family of 16 people from the spot they had been camped since arriving in Kukes, Albania, two weeks ago. In a bizarre twist, one group of 60 men arrived without their wives and children, whom they said had been held back by Serbian forces. Routinely, men — espe- cially young men — have been kept. Other pressures to vacate this place include fears that summer conditions could be catastrophic or that the Serbs’ increasing cross-border assaults into Alba- nian territory could target these camps any day. The latest bad news is the city’s esti- mate that by high summer the water sup- ply will stand at only a third its present level, And the current spring flush of moun- tain mfalt, coupled with unusually heavy rains, has barely been sufficient to meet the needs of the additional 120,000 or more refugees piled on top of this city with anormal population of only 25,000. Thugs also are a growing problem, organizing thefts of everything from food to refugees’ property. But these disadvantages are dwarfed by the refugees’ wish to stay as close as they can to home. The family of 12-year-old Bujar Mecini lost its single most valuable possession when its tractor was stolen in the night. Still, his family is willing to tolerate the mud swamp surrounding cold tents that legk in order to stay close to relatives,still inne \"t eight relatives. However, the promised buses never came, So the families unpacked. Many said Friday they would not bother to try it again. “We thought about how they didn’t tell us we would go to better houses,” Xhema- jli said. “We cannot accept that.” Relief officials said the city government | failed to get buses out to the camp. The Albanian police on Thursday demanded that scores of tractors be moved from a parking area in the center of the city. The people who have been living\" in open wagons attached to the tractors . were rounded up and put on buses. Families were separated because the tractor driver usually stayed to look after the machine, while his family headed out on a bus. On Friday, the tactics employed with the few tractors still remaining at the site were more gentle. Police were demanding the tractors and wagons be moved but were permitting refugees to park in another part of town. “I don’t know where it is better and where it is worse,” said a confused Haxhi Haxhaj, 32, who was preparing to drive his family of 16 people somewhere the police had yet to specify. “Right now they told us to stay in Kukes. Maybe there they will tell us to leave, too, and go someplace else., I'm afraid of this.” ‘ ui Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 24, 1999 \f"

I wondered about news stories from the Balkans — stories I didn’t cover myself — and questioned whether it was justified to describe long-running civil conflicts as something of broad consequence, something that is the younger brother of genocide. Marcia Kunstel is Cox Newspapers’ Betjing bureau chief. She ts on special assignment covering the refugee crisis in the Balkans. Now I know. I’ve watched thousands of Kosovar Albanians cross the border 10 miles from here. I’ve talked to them there, in the hurly-burly of arrival and bureaucra- cy, of emotion, uncertainty and relief. I’ve talked to other refugees here, hours after they’ve been processed and found a spot to settle. And I’ve talked to still others of them days afterward, once they’ve contrived a sparse routine of refugee life. Having been in other wars and war- like conditions, I’ve turned skeptical at finding how easily people can embroider details or even stitch together entire episodes to make a tapestry of events that authenticates their anger and ha- tred. I think they usually believe what tred. I think they usually believe what they have slowly manufactured, espe- cially if they’ve repeated it enough or heard like tales from compatriots. But here I have listened to scores of stories that don’t deviate from a stan- dard base, whether the bearers of them are new arrivals still confused by what they’ve been through, or people who have had time to ponder and recon- struct what they lived. The core stories differ only in the degree of brutality wielded and suffering withstood. Even if there are embellishments, they don’t disguise the underlying facts: Ms. Kunstel THE HUMANITY: Albania needs a Marshall Plan to deal with the war refugees. 5E Healthy skepticism aside, the eyes don’t lie whole populations of villages, towns and cities have been ter- rorized into leaving their homes, usually stripped of their posses- sions and often without all the members of their families. What has ha ned is indeed what the wor calls ethnic cleansing. i The details are a bit squishy. Vague stories of Serbian protag- onists carrying out mass execu- tions or wantonly strafing villages with extended gunfire won’t be verified soon, if ever. Sometimes a refugee will finish such a story and then acknowledge that he personally did not see the 200 people gunned down, but some- body in another village told his friend about it. What is known is that chil- dren are traumatized, feeble grandparents hobble for days to reach safety, strong young men driving tractors break into tears as they pull their wagons of pre- cious cargo — their families and neighbors — across the border. These people have been through something bad. What is truly embarrassing to this listener is that sometimes their stories get stale. There are so many that sound so similar. Oh yeah, I’ve heard a couple dozen times about Serbs sur- rounding the village and giving everybody 10 minutes to leave. Yeah, I know about homes being burned and cars confiscated. So tell me something new. I can snap myself to attention by looking straight into the eyes that reflect sorely wounded spir- its. Or something else will bring me back to the consciousness that these people I’m talking to have suffered horrible blows. And that decency demands care- ful listening. A teardrop will usually do it. One of the most heroic story- tellers I encountered was a 61- year-old man (he looked about 10 years older) named Bajram Cit- aku. He saw me talking to a fellow refugee about one of the civilian convoys that had been bombed and clearly wanted to give his version of the story. He offered that he could tell me much more. Such eagerness usually hits my skeptic button, but I sat down on the grass with him outside a refugee tent. He began by citing exact hours that events tran- spired, from the morning his group left the school where they had been collected for days by Serb forces. OK, I thought, let’s cut to the chase and describe the bombing. Then he did something un- usual. He pulled out his reading glasses, then retrieved from his jacket pocket a square of card- board covered with tiny hand- writing. It was the back of a ciga- rette box. Mr. Citaku had taken scrupulous notes on every stage of the odious journey out of his country. He had a stack of these card- boards and periodically referred to them. Times, places, dates. The numbers killed in six villag- es. Names of the Serbian para- military commanders and of the Kosovo guerrillas killed. We talked for an hour. Mr. Citaku had hidden the precious cardboards in his shoe, walking for three days on possi- bly the only written eyewitness account of a shameful episode of modern history. Had any Serb en route seen him secretly pull the papers from his shoe in order to add the latest installment, he surely would have been shot on the spot. In the end, it is the sameness of this multitude of sad stories, plus the rare cases of candor too solid to question, that make clear what has been and still is hap- pening in Kosovo. I feel perfectly confident to call it ethnic cleansing. Or maybe something worse. A postscript I have discovered, yet again, the need for skepticism. After writing this article over the weekend, I ran into a fellow journalist Monday morning who had looked up Mr. Citaku after | raved about the quality of this man’s information. Referring to his notes, Mr. Citaku told my friend that he had seen 64 bodies at the site of the convoy bombing we had dis cussed, and had watched Serb forces pile them five at a time into vans. No, no, I said. Mr. Citaku told me afew days earlier he had been unable to count the bodies. There were no vans, no piles of fives in his story to me. He supported the comments of other refugees in the caravan who said they had seen between two and six dead people. I went back to his tent camp Mioonday morning to find him, but other refugees said he and his wife had disappeared. They found an Albanian family to stay with some miles away. Did he recover a memory? Find another card with his scrib- bles? Hear news accounts putting the dead at 64, then add the flourish? No matter. Terrible things are happen- ing inside Kosovo, I know. And I will be even less trusting in tracking down the details. Palm Beach Post - April 25, 1999 (Continued) \f"

Five here. Ten there.” Hyseni said he is one of the Kosovo Albanians who discov- ered the butchery. He helped gather the bodies and dig 151 shallow graves. Bajram Hasani is another Kosovo refugee who described the painful duty of examining the bullet-pocked, sometimes muti- lated remains of his compatriots. He, too, dug graves at Izbica (pronounced Iz-BEET-sa), then carefully deposited the bodies of his wife’s father, uncle and cousin. . “We covered them with blan- kets. When we buried them we put them in the right direction as our habits say,” Hasani recalled. These Kosovo refugees talked of scores of graves near Izbica. Shallow graves mounded with dirt. All lined up and orderly. On April 17, NATO officials in Brussels said a spy satellite had photographed what appeared to be scores of graves, all pointing southeast toward Mecca out of [= respect for the victims’ Muslim religion. The officials cited the discovery as compelling evi- dence of Serbian atrocities. The graves had not appeared in a sat- ellite photo in March, But intelligence authorities » had no way to learn what or who ay pe really lay beneath the earth, no way to answer how they died or why. These two refugees, in tent camps on opposite edges of this city, seem to answer at least some of those questions, While their stories cannot be verified, they support NATO’s accusations of Serbian human rights abuses. The men’s descriptions don't line up fact by fact, but on most points their stories agree, and match what human rights groups have heard from other refugees: In the last week of March, tales of killings flew through the mountain villages that for months had been tormented by wen ple any troops and The area is home to a predom- | inantly ethnic Albanian popula- tion and a stronghold for guerril- las fighting for Kosovo's independence. But it also holds a large Serb police presence and a smattering of villages where eth- nic Serbs dominate. The people in settlements between Pec to the west and Pristina to the east had been on the run from village to village, from village to mountains, from mountains to home — constantly moving to find a place that seemed momentarily safer from the Serb forces they said had been mounting sporadic attacks for nearly a year.

        "ocr_text": "Albania: | Clear the border By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Kukes, Albania — Nearly 100,000 Kosovo ref- ugees will get today what may be their last chance to voluntarily move away from this tenu- ous border region before Albanian authorities order them to leave. “We've been negotiating to prevent the use of force,” said Jacques Franquin, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ° An Albanian government official said in an interview Monday that authorities would not forcibly remove the refugees, but he also said they must leave. Special government envoy Kristo Mertiri said there are two reasons Albanian authorities want the refugees to leave: the danger of massive casualties should the conflict between NATO and Yugoslav forces expand, and the social and phys- area. Albanian government officials were prepared Sunday to issue the humanitarian groups a dead- line for moving the refugees out, Franquin said. But long discussions led the Albanians to give the UNHCR another opportunity to persuade the ref- ugees to go voluntarily. Refugee leaders are to be flown today on NATO helicopters to the sites where the govern- ment wants them relocated. They will report on the conditions in these cities farther from the border and recommend to their people whether Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 27, 1999 ey should stay or go. “It is so difficult, because they will feel for the second time that they have been expelled from their houses. The first time in Kosovo and the second time from these tents,” said Shaip Haj- dari, 37, one of the leaders selected to take today’s inspection tour. Hajdari, speaking Monday outside the rainy 104-tent camp where mud approached ankle lev- el, pulled from his pocket a rumpled notebook in which he had recorded the names of every family in his jurisdiction. The camp leaders had visited each and polled them on whether they want to move or stay closer to their homes and to rela- _ tives who have not yet managed to escape from — or been forced out of — Kosovo. “They all said, ‘If it is up to us, no,’” he said, . showing the column of names and responses in \" his ruled notebook. Hajdari said he thinks the helicopter site ~ inspection will be useful. If the conditions are good, he said, he believes the people can be per- suaded to go. “But if the conditions are not suitable, we shall refuse,” he predicted. He also said refugees are unwilling to go if the aim is simply clearing space for an expected influx of more Kosovo exiles. They wonder why the authorities don’t take incoming refugees directly to the new sites, rather than relocate the people already settled in these tents. They are more sympathetic to the argument they have heard that NATO may need this as a staging area for raids across the border into ical burden of so many people in such a small . Yugoslavia, he said. NATO commanders have not announced any plan to use this area as a base or a route for the Apache attack helicopters expected to be opera- tional some time soon. With Serb shelling already a fact of life just 25 miles from here, the possibility of an attack is not alarmist. “If [Albanian officials] have to evacuate the population because of a war situation exploding, they will put priority on their own population before the refugees,” Franquin said. “Then we will be in trouble.” \f"

They were on board to defend the refugees, U.N. refu- gee agency operatives and a couple of journalists. That was the start of a trip to Peshkopi, one of the towns in south Albania where UN. relief agencies and Albanian officials are trying to persuade 100,000 refugees to relocate. The departure point was Kukes, the northern border city where refugees now are crammed in tents, tractors and homes. It is a city that authorities fear may be a target of war any day, a community under physical and social stress. The excursion was meant to convince Kosovo refugee leaders that there are safe, comfortable places away from the border where their families can move, By the end of the day, a few did seem convinced. But others asked why they hadn't been 6 shown the actual places that would be available to them and their townspeople. They wondered, too, where were the food and medical and relief services they need. What the refugees saw was meant to be tempting. In a secondary school dormitory, families each had a room with foam mat- tresses. They shared running water in communal bathrooms and were fed from 4 group kitchen. Conditions clearly were superior to the cold, wet tents in Kukes. Those tents are surrounded by mud ponds from days of rain.

        "ocr_text": "MILITARY Fiery crash of Apache frustrates NATO By joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Rinas Air Field, Albania — U.S. Army officials speculated Tuesday that an Apache attack helicopter that crashed suddenly during a training exercise Mon- day may have first hit an unseen power line. Army accident investigators flew to the scene of the crash Tuesday to launch their probe. The investigation could delay the first Apache strikes in com- bat until all commanders up through President Bill Clinton are satisfied about what went wrong. Also of concern is that the crash amounts to a public rela- tions fiasco that may breathe new hope into Yugoslavia’s mili- tary forces. The crash was the second mis- hap since the attack helicopters, which were used heavily in the 1991 Gulf War to knock out Iraqi tanks, began their journey to Albania last week. One of the AH-64 Apaches was earlier forced down by engine trouble over Italy. The U.S. Army allowed sev- eral American news organiza- tions to record the secret dry- run mission. They caught the $16 million helicopter going up in an appalling fireball on videotape. “We have folks out on the ground looking at it,” said Army Lt. Col. Garrie Dornan, spokes- man for the force of 23 remain- ing Apache gunships. “We'll take that [information] back and adjust procedures, if that is required.” An Army statement said ‘there are no initial indications” that the chopper was felled by host cars Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 28, 1999 Dornan assured Albanian reporters “there is no danger that I know of” to villagers from Apache operations. Some villag- ers herd their sheep near the crash scene. The Army said the Apache crashed about 30 miles north of Rinas Air Field, in a very sparsely populated, mountainous sector of Albania. A preliminary theory offered by senior com- manders was that the Apache had hit an unseen power line well hidden by the darkness and trees. *““This is the cost of doing busi- ness,” Dornan said. “You fly in very hazardous conditions. You are flying totally blacked out with Night Vision Goggles on. You are flying at high speeds at low altitudes in mountain terrain. “And why do you do that? The reason is so you are prepared when you are given a mission.” The Apache pilot, an experi- enced warrant officer, had been trying to land in the Albanian mountains late Monday using night vision goggles. The pilot struggled out of the wreckage and suffered only a fractured finger and bruises. The co-pilot and weapons officer, an Army captain, also pulled himself to safety with only cuts and bruises. The cap- tain later went into shock as the cameras of ABC News’ Nightline kept rolling. The Apache, loaded with fuel, rockets and Hellfire missiles, was destroyed. So, for the moment, was the helicopter’s vaunted reputation as the invin- cible anti-tank weapon that many Kosovo refugees have been waiting for to turn the tide of war against Yugoslav Presi- dent Slobodan Milosevic. Both pilot and co-pilot were expected to be released Tuesday from aé military hospital unit Rinas Air Field, the Army said. Meanwhile, the Army took steps to fly another Apache to Albania to replace the crashed chopper. ~ The Apaches in Tirana are from the Army’s 1ith Aviation Regiment, based in Illesheim, » Germany._’ uadrons have served three sin Rosnia \f"

After a week of relative calm in which only a few hundred refugees a day crossed from Kosovo, Serb forces were said by the refugees to be torching whole villages again. ~ Many of the 2,500 refugees who crossed into Albania on Wednesday said men between 15 and SO years old had been separated from trac- tor convoys and beaten, then al- lowed to continue. Most reported being forced to give up money and jewelry. More refugees repeated varia- tions of the story first heard late Tuesday of 200 or more dead bod- ies in a field off the road at a vil- lage called Meje, near the regional center of Djakovica. A group of women who arrived earlier had said about 300 men with them had been separated out and taken by the Serbs to sit in a field. That happened late Tuesday morning, said Zenije Pajaziti, 23.- “The police were around them in a circle. They had their guns on them,” she said. When interviewed in Kukes on Wednesday morning, she said her family still had no idea what happened to the men. In similar accounts, later arriv- als reported seeing a concentration of dead men. Two cousins who had been head- ing on foot toward Albania came over the border in tears and said Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 29, 1999 they saw a group of men around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday squatting in a field off the road at Meje. “After we left them 10 meters behind, the police stopped us and asked for gold jewelry and mon- ey,” said Valdeta Rama, 22. The young women said they gave what they had, then were allowed to continue. “We heard a lot of shots. We turned our heads a little, and we saw they fell face down. Their faces were covered with blood,” she said. Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, said similar accounts were given by refugees who crossed the bor- der in the early morning hours Wednesday. : “It looks very ominous. Th reports seem consistent,” he said. If true, he said, this would be among the worst massacres of the Kosovo ethnic cleansing campaign. Wilkinson said some of the women also reported they were detained by the Serbs for several hours. They said younger women were taken away for 11% to 2 hours and that they “had been touched” by the Serb forces. Later Wednesday, scores of peo- ple arrived from Meje, saying they had been ousted from their homes Tuesday night. Some reported see- ing bodies, but others did not. “All the town is leaving,” said Gjon Prishi of Meje, who had just driven a tractor over the border. He and his son said they saw 80 to 100 mostly young men dead in a field as they pulled out of town. They spent the night in a nearby village, then moved on toward the border. \f"

At the same time, aid workers questioned whether the Kosovo Liberation Army is manip- ulating refugees crowded into border areas of Albania for its own purposes. Refugees from Prizren, 15 miles north of the Albanian border, said they left Kosovo because Serb forces came to their homes Wednesday night and threatened to draft the men into the army. The prospect these men would be armed and put in fighting units is slim, since Kosovo Albanian rebels are fighting for independence from Serb-controlled Yugoslavia. In the last two weeks, Serb police in Prizren increasingly have grabbed ethnic Albanian men from their homes, the refugees said, tak- ing some for manual labor and putting others in anti-NATO television propaganda. “Today I saw [Kosovo] Albanians digging trenches. There were two on one side of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 30, 1999 Kryeziu, 28. “I know them. They were arrested 10 days ago.” He said the young men were wearing Yugoslav army uniforms. “T think they are making them wear uni- forms so NATO will think they are Serb sol- diers and will bomb them,” he said. Other refugees said men taken into custody have appeared on Serbian television. Some, saying they had volunteered, were shown in uniforms. Others were placed prominently at televised anti-NATO and anti-American rallies. On this side of the border, questions also arose whether KLA fighters are manipulating the refugees in their own protection plan. “There are rumors that the KLA doesn’t want the people to move from here,” said Staffan DeMistura, a special envoy here for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu- gees. “They want to be defended, and they want more recruits for their ranks.” DeMistura is trying to disperse the more than 100,000 refugees clogging this northern border region. But some refugees said the KLA has made clear it has a stake in keeping the refugees here. The refugees may or may not be viewed as protection against Serb assaults, on KLA bases in the area, including a barracks in the center of this city close to refugee camps. But the KLA clearly views them as a pool for new recruits, “As for us young men, when there is a gen- eral [KLA] mobilization, we have to join them. That’s why not only I, but others want to stay here, closer to the border,” said Reza Abozaj, 24, a refugee leader. He said KLA fighters have urged him to resist the dispersal of refugees. In Macedonia, relief workers spoke of another worry: land mines. Both the Macedo- nian Defense Ministry and the U.N. refugee agency said several refugees were killed by mines Wednesday on the Yugoslav side of the border. \f"

High Commissioner for Refugees. “They're cleaning Prizren,” he said, refer- ring to the municipal area of more than 100,000 people located about 15 miles north of the border. In Kukes, relief agencies scrambling to put up more tents for the newcomers were ham- pered by strong winds. Even the 100 new tents planned by the Red Crescent Society of the United Arab Emirates and another 120 being raised by Médecins Sans Frontiéres of Belgium were expected to accommodate only about 4,800 people. More than 11,000 crossed into Albania between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. “They said 50,000 will be coming,” said Ahmad Alburainain, head of the Red Crescent delegation, which is trying to expand the Emirates’ tent camp. It had filled existing vacancies with 10 truckloads of refugees by 2 SANTIAGO LYON / Associated Pres No-man’s land: Hundreds of refugees wait Friday to cross into Albania from the Serbian province of Kosovo. p.m., and workers were struggling to raise the additional tents, he said. By nightfall, thousands of people were sit- ting on the ground around the main city square and outside packed refugee camps, or were Waiting in parked cars to learn if there was any place in schools or government build- ings for them to sleep. More than 630,000 refugees have poured outof Kosovo province since NATO air striltés began March 24, including an estimated 373,000 into Albania, according to the UN. refugee agency. More than 7,000 refugees arrived Thursday in Macedonia, the largest number in at least two weeks, officials said. Families from Prizren — Kosovo's second- largest city — and surrounding towns started arriving in Albania on Thursday, but the stream turned into a flood of humanity around 9 a.m. Friday. “My husband came yesterday. We sepa- rated because they were taking up the men,” said Hamensha Zyberi, a 28-year-old mother of two who traveled from Prizren by bus Fri- day with her mother, children and in-laws. Many also were spurred to leave Prizren now because they had heard Thursday night on the Kukes television station, which is avail- able in Kosovo a few hours a night, that peo- ple had made it safely from Prizren across the border. “They gave my husband’s name, so I knew he made it all right,” said Zyberi. The station broadcasts names of Kosovar Albanian refu- gees seeking missing family members or wishing to deliver a message back to Kosovo. Men from one family after another told of remaining in hiding for weeks, fearing the Serb police would come for them any time. Many said they have been sleeping fully clothed, and some men said they normally slept in a basement or at different neighbors’ homes, slipping out only after dark to find a place that might be secure. “T was in the house for three weeks,” said Islam Abdullahu, 29. “Women, only women can go out for supplies.” Serb forces apparently were not only engaged in a military mobilization, but intended to drive these people out. For the first time in a couple of weeks they made available buses to carry the Kosovar Alba- nians from Prizren to the town of Zhur, two or three miles from the border crogsing.
