Blount levcied an attack here Saturday at the press and the ‘‘liberal cocktail eircuit’’ for what he called their critical attitudes toward Vietnam veterans. Blount spoke at the American Legion’s S3rd an- nual state convention during a luncheon honoring Alabama families of POW-MIAs. Blount told the _ several hundred Legionnaires that they and other veterans groups must bring Vietnam veterans into their ranks and help them stand against a ‘self-serving crowd telling them what they have done for this country was stupid, was immoral was all for nothing.”* emphasis is placed on the unhappiness and complaints of Gis in a battle situation. ‘“‘No soldier in a combat zone is ever happy.’” Blount said. “‘But this kind of thing is beamed nightly to millions of people in the United States. As a result, it has made it much more difficult to fairly evaluate the importance of what we are fighting for in Vietnam. “Some young TV announcer views a microscopic part of the war and proceeds cach night to tell the American people night after night of the whole strategy and what's wrong with the U.S. presence — as if he had any earthly idea,’’ he said. Blount also took a verbal slap at ‘‘those who want a retreat in Vietnam’*® and use the veteran as ‘‘a scapegoat and a whipping boy’’ because he carries out governmental In his first public ap- pearance in his home state since the Post Office Depart- ment became an independent agency and Blount lost his Cabinet member status July 1, the postmaster = gencral criticized media coverage of the war and of recent anti- war demonstrations in the nation’s capitol. He especially denounced national news coverage of demon st rating Vietnam veterans who joined this spring’s war protests in Washington, D.C. Blount said fewer than 1,000 veterans ed, and they numbered fewer than  one- tenth of one per cent of the total who have served in Vietnam. “I think there is something wrong with the fact that this is presented on the national media as representative of the veterans of Vietnam,’ policies. “Those who cannot muster popular support among the People . . . those who can't reet themselves taken seriously outside the liberal cocktail circuit turn their frustration on the young man who does his duty and serves aly patom faithfully,’” Blount said. He added that Gis are defending liberties including ‘‘the liberty for this ragtag group of misled and misguided softheads around this country to libel his ser- vice and throw dirt on his in- tentions and to deny his honor.*’ Blount said that such at- tacks on a “patriotism and nationalism and ‘everything we believe in’? have made Feturpie soldiers disillusion- **“You must redouble our legislative efforts on behalf of WINTON M.

John Sparkman told conven- tion delegates he is confident the American people will solve the crises besetting the nation. *‘Americans are faced with some of the greatest crises in their history,’’ Spark man said. ‘‘We faced and solved such crises before, and I have the utmost confidence in our ability to solve them again.** July 18, 1971 \f"

Additionally, the code re- quires the veterinarian in custody of the dog to “report the results of his observation of said dog” to the physician of the person bitten. Crosland explained in ‘response that one must be “practical” in interpreting the law.

Shortly before the friend died she warned the gitl to keep away from drugs that would only get her hook- ed. The story of what happened Friday night is perhaps a typical one. It may not be sensational or worthy of note, but it did result in one frightened girl who was still dazed from her strange ex- perience the next afternoon. She leaned back against the couch in the police Youth Aid Division office with her long blonde hair waving down to her shoulders and sometimes across her glazed eyes. She was tripping. And probably the worst part of it is that someone had slipped her a drug at a rock concert here Friday night without her even knowing it. No, the worst part is that now she fears sudden flashbacks from the drug that she didn’t want and said she It’s a story as simple as a 16-year-old girl who went to get a drink of water, found a long line of people at the drinking fountain and ac- cepted a drink from a youth who appeared to know her.

Police said the two 16-year- olds confessed to at least i11 thefts ranging from Florida to Texas. Police said they left Mt. , Fla., last Saturday and left a trail of car andé_ store burglaries across the South. When they were caught here, police said, the two boys were in possession of at least $1,700 worth of stolen goods. The boys were apprehended here early Friday morning when a Woodley Square resi- dent called police about two suspicious youths at the apart- ment complex parkKing lot. When officers arrived, they found a stolen motorcycle in the trunk of the car. The boys were brought to police headquarters where officers of the Youth Aid Division questioned them and found the stolen goods packed in their car. Police said the youths gave the following account of their travels: After leaving their homes in Mt. Dora, the boys drove to Meridian, Miss., where’ they burglarized three cars parked at a Holiday Inn. From those cars they obtained a tire, tape player, speaker, tapes, ice chest and suitcase filled with clothes. Traveling on to Jackson, Miss., they took two tires off a telephone company Car in a parking lot. When they reached El Paso, Tex., they hit two Holiday Inns. At one of the motels they took three suitcases belonging..to Lt.. Col. John F. Ohlinger, who just] had *been. transferred. from Maxwell :Air Force base to the| Philippines. | at ee Heading back east again, the boys said they stopped off. at Richardson,~- Tex., where~ they.

They again traveled through Mississippi, and somewhere between that state’s boundary and Selma, on U.S. 80, they broke into a store where they said they took a case of soft drinks, more than 100 packs of Cigarettes, candy, gum, bat- teries and various other items. Police here said they do not know to whom most of the merchandise belongs, but they have sent dispatches to the towns the youths said _ they visited and are awaiting further information. .

Smith recognized the difficul- ty of having only other mental patients as direct witnesses, but said if they can be shown to be competent their testimony should be accepted. *‘In this case some of these particular patients were real competent to state what hap- pened,’’ Smith said. *“*‘We have a person here we thought was mistreated, and we don’t want that,’’ Smith said. ‘“‘After careful investigation we thought we'd better press charges. *‘We hope this will deter any further mistreatment of pa- tients,’’ Smith said.

        "ocr_text": "Tracking I rug sources Difficult Job for Police BY MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer (Second of Two Parts) “Drugs are available to any young person in this country who wants to try them today. And Montgomery is no ex- ception.” The above statement may come as a shock to those who have envisioned Montgomery aS a world isolated from the Pushers and addicts fre- uenting big-city streets. But the words are those of Detective Don Terry, head of Ne police department’s Vice Nareotics Bureau and the man who probably knows better than any Montgom- “lan the intricacies of the drug trade here. .rerry’s job is to shut off the lfetine feeding that trade. qtlow drug abuse has filetiorated to the point There it’s “like trying to plug hy a sieve” to stop it, is at- »| Tbuted to outside influences ‘thd to the fact that a drug | atrest is one of the most dif- j ficult to make conviction on. ,clontgomery youths simply 42Ye been sucked up in the /,°Nd that has seen drug | faffie on the rise all across the country, Terry said. Ja,,Vith today’s new at Omobiles, super-speed (lghways and air travel they “an reach many points out of state where there are ex- cellent sources of supply,” he said. A day spent trekking to Atlanta or Mobile or even New Orleans can garner a supply of illegal drugs suffi- cient to sustain a circle of users for weeks. Once the drugs have hit Montgomery streets tracking them down can be a matter of Herculean proportions— even with the aid of an informant. ‘Often the parent of a drug victin: will bring his child into our office and demand he give us a full statement as to his Supplier,” Terry said. “After many hours of investigation, most of this type of information is found to be unreliable.” In what way unreliable? — “They lie to us. They give us the wrong names so their supply won’t be cut off or be- cause they’re afraid of physical harm,” Terry said. Essentially the same thing is true of other drug abuse “victims”? — those arrested for possession or who end up hospitalized from a bad trip or overdose. “The victim of a drug crime is different from any other,” Terry said. “The vic- tim in a burglary case will be most helpful in bringing a suspect to trial.’ But the boy who testifies against his dealer might be putting his best friend in jail. As for the pushers themselves, Terry said a major handicap is that “there’s no organization to drug traffic in this city. Each and every user is a potential seller,” Three years ago there was an average of one pusher for every 50 users, Terry said. “Now everybody wants to deal, either to, as they say, ‘help a friend,’ or to get enough money to buy their own drugs.” Once a complaint is lodged or information concerning August 30, 1971 > \fPolice Havwe Difficult Job In Tracking Drug Sources possible drug abuser subse- quent uncovered, the investigation could take anywhere from two hours to two years, Terry said. The reason? Protecting the individual’s rights. ‘People come into this of- fice and offer information for many reasons,” Terry said. The information often is false. It might be based on a grudge, or come from the man upstairs who’s been kept awake by too many late night parties. Or the informant simply might be mistaken. “We feel we have to be right when we go into court,” Terry said. ‘‘For one thing it’s unfair to the individual, it’s unfair to the court and it’s unfair to waste the taxpayer’s money” on a shoddy investigation. “There’s nothing I’d like better than to get a complaint and close it out two hours later,” he said. But two hours is searcely sufficient to obtain the good, solid courtroom evidence needed for conviction today. That kind of evidence turns up only after long hours of surveillance, the work of un- dercover personnel — in which Terry says the depart- ment is very limited — spe- cialized equipment and the een of money to fund it all. But the difficulty of making a conviction and obtaining a search warrant is justified in Terry’s eyes. “It certainly eliminates the number of innocent people who would be victims of searches” or would end up sitting in a courtroom, he said, Although Terry said his bureau is only Elvan the top’ because of manpower and money limitations, he finds Montgomery still is better off than cities of a comparable size which don’t even have a special depart- ment handling the spread of drug abuse. . Terry hopes that conditions will improve, that the money will be found to expand his nine-man work force, that parents will awaken to the fact that drugs have indeed come to Montgomery and their child may be among those in need of guidance. Even if Montgomery citizens fail to respond to the drug problem here, it will re- main a “ton priority battle” in the police department. For, as Terry said. “We feel that even if one person is abusing drugs in a city, that city has a problem.” August 30, 1971 (continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "florrec Azaaitre ‘By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer RAMER— Burglars struck again here Thursday, this ime at the home of John D. Holmes which had been burglarized some three weeks before the te slaying of rs, Jean Rhodes Aug. 30. This is the first burglary reported here since the killing of Mrs. Rhodes, who is believed to have been shot when she came upon a burglar emerging from a friend's home. A series of at least 30 burglaries has rocked this small community in south Montgomery County over the past year. Holmes sald little was stolen in the Thursday morn- ing burglary, although the intruders went through nearly every drawer in the house, strewing clothes and other items across the floors. “It looked like they were looking for money,” Holmes said. ‘‘We don’t know yet ex- actly what they did take.’’ He eaid some beer and food are farmer FAzct oy MHuersvetlars are missing from the refrigerator, as well as a few other small items “that don't amount to much.”’ In the previous burglary — which also took place on a Thursday morning — the thieves made off with two shotguns, Mrs. Holmes’ jewel- ry box, half a case of am- munition, a fly rod and reel, and orthopedic shoes just pur- chased for the Holmes’ crip- pled child. ° Like most residents [n Ramer and the surrounding area, the Holmes family is scared. They had been worried about the wave of burglaries that has swept through the community and since Mrs. Rhodes’ death they have taken special precautions. Holmes said he refuses to let his wife stay home alone while he’s working. When she ends her job delivering mail, Mrs. Holmes spends the af- ternoon with ber sister. When it’s time for thelr boy to leave schoo] she picks him up and they return to her sister's home until Holmes gets back from his job in Montgomery with the County Engineering Department. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Department initiated an intensive investigation following the slaying of Mrs. Rhodes, the mother of five children. Since that time Sheriff Mac Sim Butler has tried to keep at least one deputy on duty around the clock in the Ramer area, but the depart- ment’s manpower has present- ed a problem. The County Commission recently applied for a $47,000 federal grant, part of which _would be used to set up a sheriff's department substa- tion in Ramer. The commission also posted a $1,000 reward - - for ine foruation leading to the arrest and conviction of Mrs, Rhodes’ killer after a delegae tion of Ramer residents peti- tioned the commission for added proteotion.

Unlike most of the 12 defen- dants found guilty in Judge D. Eugene Loe’s courtroom June 25 of charges arising from the 1965 disturbances, all seven said they would appeal. Six of the group had forfeited ipart of their bonds by failing to ishow for the June 25 trial, but did appear in court Sept. 3 to avoid total forfeiture and to have their new trial date set for}; Friday. The seventh defendant, Junius W. Williams, who directs the peas City program in Newark, forfeited his bond Sept, 3 eae ‘said he showed up Friday with the others to ‘‘clear thel, record.”’ Although Williams was =  ac- companied by a New Jersey attorney, the lawyer was not allowed to defend him because he had not received permission from the Alabama Bar Asso- ciation. Williams — and the other six defendants — were represented, however, by two local civil rights attorneys. The attorneys said they had been asked to assist in Williams’ case by Georgia state representative Julian Bond. Although the two local lawyers were asked only to assist in Williams’ defense, they said they decided upon request of the other defendants to represent them all. “We felt a moral obligation to defend them,” one _ attorney said. The two local lawyers said they will remain with the cases throughout all appeals pro- cesses. The defense’ attorneys’ at- tempted to show during the trial that the defendants could not be positively identified as partici- pants who refused to obey police in the 1965 march that took place over a period of several days in March of that year. Although most of the defen- dants were not pictured in police photographs taken during the demonstrations, police of- ficers testified for the prosecu- tion that once a group was declared arrested no one was allowed to enter or leave the group until he was booked. Since all the defendants were listed on city arrest records, the prosecution contended they must have been among the groups which failed to obey police orders and thus broke the law. Among those testifying for the prosecution were former Police a 3) Capt. Stuart ‘$100, Moody and Assistant Chief C. E. Swindall. All testified they were certain no one had been booked at the old city jail who had not failed to obey police orders either to disperse or stop loitering on the sidewalks. The seven defendants are Richard Becker of Washington, D.C., Worth Long of Atlanta, Ga., Posey Lombard of Massa- chusetts, Clyde Hollie of Tus- caloosa, Irad Valentine of Phila- delphia; Par, Lemual Green» of Montgomery, and Williams. All appeal bonds were set at and all defendants re- quested a jury trial when their ‘appeals come before Circuit Court. September 25, 1971 \f"

Mayor Jim Robinson’s an- Although Wright said he has had to assign priorities to calls and has backlogged some complaint calls, he gave assurance that “law enforce- ment activities will not be curtailed.”’ As for purchasing new equipment, another area that Robinson said cannot be fit into the budget, Wright said he can’t even hazard a guess’ as to what will be needed. “We’re more susceptible to accidents in this line of work,” he noted. ‘Hopefully not, but we could have two or three cars totaled out within adequately protected with current stations Odom said. The insurance association also recommends that fire trucks be replaced every 15 to 20 years. Odom was not ex- plicit about the age of: his trucks, but some are known to be more than 20 years old. Odom said he does not know when the insurance team will pick its way through Montgomery with a fine-too nouncement that he plans to hire no new police officers should have had the effect of a double-whammy on Wright, who has gone without replac- ing policemen since his re- quest for 40 new officers was turned down last fall. - Wright's first stated reac- tion was that he is ‘op- timistic’ about the mayor's economy measures, He did go so far as to admit to “a shortage of personnel that is growing by leaps and bounds,”” but said the most serious effect will be ‘not giving people the kind of ser- vice we'd like to,’ the next two or three weeks.” He not the department will manage in such an_- event, or how long existing patrol cars will hold out under the normal wear and tear of police duty. The cars now in use range from 1964 to 1971 models. One of the less optimistic police officials guessed the department ‘‘won’t last out a year” with current equip- ment. Wright said he derived hope from the mayor's statement that the police and fire departments will be  con- sidered “first priority” areas “it could be y now,” They were due last year and for some reason didn’t make it, Odom exhibited the same philosophical attitude as Chief Wright: “If we have to we'll do without things like new equipment. We'll keep things repaired and do the best we can. say how He did not mention the facts that even now le must sometimes call two and three times before an officer can respond to a complaint, or must wait until the next morning before a detective is free to investigate a reported crime, He did not bring up the fact that the policy of detectives traveling in the safety of two- man teams recently was ended. First and second shift detectives now investigate alone so they can cover more territory and answer more calls, In an obviously dangerous when and turns up. “This will create pro blems,” Wright said, “but we are going to have to do the best we can, and people will have to realize we’re limited.” Chief Odom’s situation in the fire department § is somewhat different. Odom said sald he has a full complement of men who handle adequately all the fire stations now in existence. Raising new fire stations certainly is not in the city’s plans, but then it’s been more than 10 years since’ the if some money “Of course if you let this build up over a period of years, it just makes it that much worse later when a lot of equipment must be replac- ed at one time.” Both chiefs say they agree with the mayor's aim of bal- ancing the budget before the situation more than one man will be sent. “If we don’t get some relief in the police department, we will have to curtail more nonenforcement details than we have already,’’ Wright said, noting that his depart- ment has gotten used to “economizing” over the past few months. Nonenforcement details that already have been cut back provide such services as con- trolling traffic around strect construction areas, providing bank escorts and assurin traffic safety during funera processions. nsurance Asso- ciation has inspected the city and made recommendations on what must be done to keep fire insurance rates down Odom said. Currently the city enjoys the lowest fire insurance rates in the nation, Odom said. Those rates were set The city has annexed land since then, and no one can be sure whether the insurance men will feel those areas are deficit gap widens, They just hope that maybe next year they'll be able to re- place the men and facilities they should replace this year, and should have replaced last year—before the safety gaps become to wide to close, October 21, 1971 \f"

Grooms left his four stepson: at the welfare division of the county Pensions and Securit; Department Wednesday after noon, saying he could not rea them properly on the monthh $10 welfare allotment he get: for each child. Jesse Gann, the governor’: jexecutive assistant, sai Wallace learned of the couple’: plight in a news story an “became real concerned abou a man and his wife and si: in such desperat jneed.”’ Late Wednesday nigh Wallace made telephone calls t the couple in jail, to one of thei children at the county Shelte Home, to the city polic« department and to county pro bation officer Denny Abbott. After getting informatio: about the couple and their need: Wallace met with them Thurs day morning and turned then over to Gann with instruction: to help Grooms find a job am et emergency funds for the amily. - Gann said he told Grooms he was eligible for Aid to Depen- dent Children assistance, but the man said he wanted to work, not be dependent on the state. Gann also set about trying to help Grooms get a job and said Grooms is scheduled to meet Friday morning with someone in ‘‘private industry” about employment. Gann said a number of People, whom he would not name, have displayed concern over the family and _ have assisted in seeing that thei basic needs are met. Wallace’s press secretary, Billy Joe Camp, said _ the governor ‘instructed the staff to do what we can.’’ Camp said Gann has spoken with city and state officials and with representatives of private industry on behalf of Grooms. Grooms’ employment hinges on his getting a surety bond, required for a job as a private detective. Grooms has a state private investigator’s license and a pistol permit but cannot get a city license without the surety bond. The bond cannot be ob- tained without an approved financial statement. — Camp said application for a surety bond was filed Thursday but had not been acted upon. Grooms’ last steady job several months ago was with the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, a private detec- tive agency owned by former Montgomery Police Chief Drue Lackey. The Grooms’ six children, two of his and four of hers by a previous marriage, remained in custody at the Shelter Home Thursday night. The couple could not be con- tacted at their 227 W.

Several persons said they kept money and pistols hidden in the same place, but only the money was taken. Another item frequently stolen was luggage. Preliminary p0lice reports, which do not always contain a full account of all items stolen in a burglary, indicate less than $1,200 in cash was taken in all of the burglaries. According to the same reports, the value of all items stolen total less than $1,500. Most of those items are easily usually wrecking the door handle in the process. The homeowners interviewed said police usually suggested a crowbar or similar tool was used to pry open the lock. All the victims contacted said they were away from home from one to three hours, and many added they routinely were away during those hours on the day of the week their homes were burglarized.

Advertiser Staff Writer Helen is similar to more than 300 Montgomery young people who “ran’’ Over th but unlike the others, she ended up freaked out on drugs in a hospital bed, her body swollen and infected with gonorrhea. Most of the city’s teens and pre-teens who run awa home luckily have a hal end to their travels, and if they do, it is only because of luck. cause the youngsters themselves’ take no precautions when they decide to leave their homes for greener from strangers passing by, just as they accept food ang shelter and sometimes drugs. Officers Clifford King, whose work in the Youth Aid Division brings them in frequent contact with runaways, say this trust and independence are two reasons the number of runaways has drastically increased here over the past ten years. In 1961 police handled 161 cases of juveniles who ran away from home. In the first 11 months of 1971 there were 317 such cases. ; By the time December’s head count of runaways is made, the 1961 figure should be doubled: The officers tick off a simple list of reasons for ‘this huge in the number of youths who run. They say that | basically young people today have more money, more freedom, are smarter and braver. Behind these basics lies turbulent decade of technological and _ social _ in- novations that have wrought equally disturbing changes in values and attitudes. Members of the new genera- tion have grown with and into the new values, while their elders often have moved around them. “It’s gettin y more and more pace for parents to be an e past year,|children,” says Officer Henley. “Often they don’t like their children’s friends, can’t abide their music, and disapprove of their hairy or the way — they: dress’? from ppier special’ pastures. They blithely accept rides FIRST OF TWO PAR less in their less_ interested Kids usually run to get away from such ‘fussing,’? although sometimes there are deeper Montgomery police attribute Problems such as alcoholic or their good fortune to luck be-'|physically violent parents, the officers said. Mrs. Henley and King agree that the parents are ‘“‘wrong,”’ are expecting too much, giving too little, about 60 per cent of the time. Youths through the ages have been dissatisfied with their June Henley and;)parents and home life for one ‘reason or another, but today \\jthey’re in a position to do something about it. They often have liberal allowances, exclusive use of a car or motorcycle, and the maturity to ‘make it’’ on their own in a strange place — at least for a while. There also is what King calls “an underground network of| information here,” so young people easily find out the best place to run to and where to find help once they get there. And there is plenty of help, especially in places like Atlanta and Pensacola, Fla., the two most pOpular destinations of Montgomery runaways. In a recent interview several , parents of runaways expressed surprise and even shock that no, one turned in their offspring or persuaded them to return. All the youths involved received rides, food and a place to stay both from other young people and from adults. All the benefactors knew the teen-agers were fugitives. Members of the peer group: assist in other ways too. At one city schoo] a group of) friends took up a collection to finance the romantic flight of. several classmates. Then they: ihad a small farewell celebra-! tion. . What police is hampers friends who refuse to give any| information on where the| runaway might be heading. “If we think a friend is hold- ing back, we'll try to convince him it’s in the missing child’s best interest to help,” said Of-, ficer Henley, ‘“‘Then we'll re- mind him he coulq be charged with contributing.” The latter tactic frequently loosens tied tongues. “Another problem is_ that nowadays children can make up any kind of wild story about home life and the children will believe them,’’ Mrs. Henley said. ‘‘There was a time that youngsters would accept the word of an adult far before they would accept the word of a child. Now the pendulum has swung completely the other way.” Officer King added that while at one time peers didn’t respec the runaway child and parents might disown him, now running is a status symbol. “Usually it’s the only status symbol they have,’’ Officer Henley said. ‘‘The youngsters we get aren’t in clubs, the don’t do anything constructive they’re not in the Boy Scouts the band, church activities. “They're kind of dangling.’’ From all appearances the will continue to dangle Although the police say the seldom ‘“‘lose’’ a child, or fail to find him, there is a high degree of repeaters. When a= runaway returns police set up special counseling sessions with him and with his parents. They also might refe the family to an gency such as Alcoholics Anonymous, a Unite Appeal agency or a _ mental health group.

The increased distance didn't seem to matter much to Janet and Marie, for they too easily walked up to unknown youths and formed quick friendships. The boys they met at a teen- age hangout in a northern cily let them sleep in their cars several nights, and one youth even took them home where his mother offered to adopt the girls. Janet and Marie decided, however, that they didn’t want the initial reaction was, of, course, one of relief. But tears shed on both. sides had to subside, and the logical next step was finding out why they ran. In many cases the question remains unanswered.

February 7, 1972 other Despite the parents’ seeming| unawareness of the specific reasons their daughters gave for running, at least one motner may have put her finger on the broader social causes. “Truthfully, I don’t think I can understand her generation, or even the ones a little older,”’ she said. ‘‘They have totally different values, “In my time there were two loves to fall back on-the love jof God and of country.

In __ secret-ballot voting sessions held throughout the afternoon and night Thursday, union members voted 467 to 9 to walk off the job Monday. The strikers will set up picket lines at City Hall, Oak Park, the city lot, Dannelly Field and the two city dumps, according to Clyde Jones, president of Public Service and Industrial Employes Local Union 1314, AFL-CIO, “We will wait for the City Commission to contact us on negotiating sessions,” said union organizer Bruce Carr late Thursday. “We have - begged long enough.” - Carr said the union likely would not have taken the strike vote if city officials “had given us any kind of figures” on possible pay raises. In two sessions with city commissioners, Carr said, the union received no estimate of how much city workers might receive when the budget is checked next week for revenues available for pay increases. He said union officials have figured raises would come te about 5 per cent under the plan now being considered by the commission. Union members are looking for a figure nearer 15 per cent, Carr said, or the equivalent of a three-step jump on the merit pay scale. ‘ Officials would not estimate how long the workers will re- main on strike. “It may be three days, maybe three weeks, maybe three months,” Jopes said. Most residents will be hardest hit by the lack of garbage col- lection, since about 80 per cent of the sanitation workers are unionized. Public Works Commissioner Cliff Evans, who heads the department that employs most of the union members, said before the strike vote was tallied Thursday night that he |Parks didn’t know whether there would be a “total breakdown” in the collection system. “We must wait and see how’ many (employes) may work,” Evans said. While the average Montgomerian will bear the, increasing burden of piled up trash, the city fathers will be strained by coping with other! departments that will be un-' derstaffed or totally without! workers. Two more _behind-the-scenes areas that will acutely feel the, loss of workers will be main- tenance and the city garage. “We have over 800 pieces of equipment maintained by the shop,” Evans said, ‘and will have to make other arrange- ments.” ’ Those vehicles that undergo, periodic repairs and guzzle gas’ from city garage pumps include’ police — aed fire Packs. | officials ” Police Chief Ed Wright said Thuraday morning that there are seldom less than three cars or eight autos per day.

Union officials saig Thureday morning, however, that union members also would picket any commercial shops where city might ‘farm out” vehicles. When asked whether addi- tional police officers would be assigned to special duty at the picket sites, Wright said, “We're sitting by te see what ha pens. er divisions where lesser numbers of employes are due to walk out include the airport, and recreation depart- ment and water works board. “A strike certainly would create problems for all depart- ments and would affect every citizen,” Evans said Thursday morning. And the strikers themselves may fee] some serious reper- cussions from their Thursday night action. City-County Personnel Direc- tor Wade Moss outlined a regulation saying unauthorized or unreported absences from work for a period of three days or more may be con- sidered a resignation by the | “appointing authority.” S means Montgomery City Commission will determine whether the strikers’ absences are unauthorized and they will lose their jobs. this regulation is not appealable and that those who lose jobs through it are not eligible for a day in for repairs, with the number averaging around seven Moss said action taken under | ! accumulated annual leave or sick leave, or for retirement - benefits. i _ Moss added that persons - absent even one day withoy cause could be suspended for yp to 30 days withoyt pay gpd. without appeal.

Union officials said Thursday they have had no commitment. that the city will negotiate on. salaries and benefits. ‘ On negotiations Evans said “we'll cross that bridge we come to it,” and Rucker said he would be willing to: negotiate with the employes but “not with outsiders.” , Mayor Jim Robinson has shown the same distaste for “outsiders,” or the organizers who came in last fall to set up the union.

Robinson emphasized at the time that commissioners dig not: respond to Carr’s telegram but met with the union leaders upon request of a city employe, union. President Clyde Jones.

The dump off Highway 143 remained open, although gar- bage carriers had to pass through peaceful picket lines to get to the landfill. Exactly why the Wares Ferry Road facility was locked re- |mains a mystery, since Public Works Commissioner Cliff Evans and Sanitation Depart- ment head L.B. Green could not be contacted for comment. Other city and county sources indicated two possible reasons. Some said the striking mem-. bers of Public Service and In- dustria} Employes Union Local 1314 had diminished the city work force so badly that only a handful of men were available to run the dumps, and all had been placed at the Highway 143 landfill. Another possibility, raised at a Montgomery County Com- mission meeting, is that the ‘Wares Ferry Road dump is outside the city police jurisdic- tion so officers cannot patrol the area to ward off possible trou- ble. County Sheriff Mac Sim {Butler said he is increasing patrols along the road, since garbage already has begun ac- Jcumulating on the road ‘shoulder. | The county problem of; ‘dumping along the road had lessened somewhat since Butler ‘instituted the patrols, but now is expected to be worse than ever. “I'd like to let the public; know that if we catch them dumping we have no choice but to make an arrest,” Butler said. Penalties for unauthorized dumping range from $25 to $500 in fines, and in some cases up to six months in jail. Montgomery County Com- mission announced Monday the county dump on Ramer-Grady Road, about a mile south of Ramer, will be open for city residents during the strike. The city police and fire departments also have had to sidestep the union pickets to carry on normal duties. A picket line has closed access to the city lot and garage, where police and fire vehicles are serviced and gassed up. Public Affairs Commissioner | Jack Rucker said Monday the departments have been using private service stations at an ummeves tala extra cost to the city. He would not say what sta- tions are cooperating. Union officials have said they would also set up picket lines at com- mercial stations if the city ‘farmed out” vehicles. Rucker said police are “making periodic patrols (at picket sites), just like they do at any other area where there’s a strike.” He added he doesn’t know what will happen in the line of negotiations and said he had made no overtures to meet with striking employes for settlement talks. Mayor Jim Robinson made no change in his policy toward the strikers Monday, repeating his position that a budget review will be made this week to see how much money is available for raises. Robinson said he should have an announcement on exactly how much can be plowed into raises later this week. From the other side of the picket line, union organizer Bruce Carr announced Monday the local has hired former Coun- ty Attorney John P. Kohn as its legal adviser. Carr said the union has no made a move toward setting i negotiating sessions, and i: discussing all aspects of the matter with Kohn. He said the union also is con sidering a federal court sui! against the city based on alleg ed discrimination betwee! classified and _ unclassifiec workers, and in the granting 0 merit pay increases for classi- fied employes. An announcement on_ the law suit may come Jater thi: week, Carr said. He also emphasized that union members are ‘‘not picketing the dumps to prevent people from taking their owr garbage there.’’ The action is aimed at the city government, Carr said, not at the residents The 550-member union voted Thursday night to strike after several meetings with city offi: Cials about wage hikes. Union officials have said they are thinking in terms of a li per cent or three step jump on the merit pay scale, while thi city is likely to offer little over 5 per cent when available revenues are tallied this week. Most of the striking workers are in the sanitation and main: tenance departments. April 4, 1972 \f"

This steel pres cludes any possibility that the tops would come tumbling down, she said, “There's nothing golng to fall—the cracks in the slabs are nothing,” Mrs, Wright sald, Workmen at the site of the canopy installation voiced the same sentiments, they said the cracks were visible before ~ the tops were raised onto the supports, but ‘they were ordered to put them up anyway.

While some minor modifica- tions already have been made, a major overhaul such as the Justice Department claims is needed would take a good deal of money, city officials say. City-County Personnel Direc- tor Wade Moss said Monday he has already made initial con- tacts for obtaining a grant from! the U.S. Civil Service Com- mission. Moss said he plans to apply: for a grant ‘“‘somewhere in the} neighborhood of $50,000\"? under’ the Inter-Go vernmental Personnel Act that is ad- ministered by the commission. | The money specifically would be used to validate employment examinations, which the Justice Department suit claims “‘have a detrimental impact upon blacks as compared to whites’ and ‘which are not related to job performance.” A battery of psychologists and other professionals in the field would be employed with the federal money to see how valid the city’s examinations are and to suggest modifications _ if needed, Moss said. | “It’s my understanding the money also could be used for the expansion and improvement of the personne] function,’ Moss Said. Although Moss did not detail what changes might result from the suit, it has been indicated generally that the city will ad- minister more oral and prac-' tical examinations, as opposed to written tests. This means more personnel workers would have to be hired to oversee practical exams, such as a driving test for ap- plicants wishing a job operating heavy machinery. | More people also would be Works; needed to handle the influx of applicants expected when it is made known that the city actively is seeking bdlacks for the work force. One change already made is the addition of a phrase stating the city is an equal opportunity employer on all communica- tions concerning job openings, including sheets giving descriptions. Moss said his department also has expanded its mailing list, and now sends information on jobs to agencies or groups likely to have greater contact with blacks, such as the local trade schools. | One change Moss said “was not prompted by the Justice Department investigation into city employment practices was the adoption of a formal state- ment that the city does not discriminate in hiring. The statement was adopted by the City-County Personnel Board in May, about a month after the investigation began. The addition of the statement in the personnel rules was “primarily to protect the city when applying for federal funds,” Moss said, noting that most federal agencies require such formal statement before handing out grants, “Our policy has been non- discriminatory all the time,” Moss said, “but this is the first time we it in writing.” August 8, 1972 \f"

        "ocr_text": " City Wage, Use Taxes Voted $5.4-Million Yield Expected in 19735 By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Montgomery’s City Com- mission voted 2-1 Tuesday to levy an occupational fee and a use tax to balance the 1972-73 city budget that had shown a gaping $5 million deficit. The measures, both of which were opposed by Mayor Jim Robinson, are expected to yield $5.4 million next year—almost exactly the amount needed to balance the preliminary budget released to The Advertiser Tuesday. Voting for the lev- 1 ies were Commissioners Jack Rucker and Cliff Evans. The occupational license fee, similar to a city income tax, will affect the most people by requiring that 1 per cent of wages earned in Montgomery be turned over to the city gov- ernment. The fee, proposed by Public Affairs Commissioner Rucker, will not be applied to occupa- tions demanding a city business or professional license. | Professional license fees, however, were changed for those earning more than $20,000 annually in another ordinance passed by the commission Tuesday. Currently those in the high income bracket pay a license fee of $150. As of Jan. 1, the ef- fective date of the professional license ordinance, they will pay $125 for the first $20,000 of earnings and .3 per cent of al earnings above that. Rucker said the change will eliminate ‘‘some inequities” in the professional license or- dinance, The license must be purchased by all professional persons such as doctors, lawyers and architects. One example of the effect of pis change -is that a pro- essional earning $50,000 next license fee, while this year he will pay only $150. Those who do not professional fee will be affected by the new occupational license fee, which goes into effect Oct. Most employers will be re- quired to withhold the 1 per cent fee from employes’ salaries and funnel the money into the city ‘coffers on a quar- terly basis. Some employers, specifically the state and federal govern- ments, cannot be forced legally to withhold the fee. Under the new ordinance these employes must file their own returns and make payment directly to the city. Domestic workers in private homes or business are not re- quired to pay the occupational license fee. The revenue from this fee—anticipated at $5 million next year—will be placed in two special funds. The new License Fee Warrant Fund will hold revenue suffi- cient to cover the cost of in- terest and principal on warrants and bonds issued by the city after the ordinance takes effect Oct. 1. The rest of the occupational fee revenue not needed to cover year will have to pay a $275 pay the.

Patter. the meeting Rucker voiced disagreement with the mayor’s comments, saying he believes city money is being spent in the best possible man- ner now.

Prior to the 10 a.m. com- mission meeting the budget listed expenses totaling $22,- 450,000. e revenue side of By noon, after the meeting elosed and the new taxes were law, the revenue and expense figures were equal.

The budget itself is not yet final, but may be revised before Klits expected passage next t Tuesday. It must be approved by Sept. 30 to go into effect the first day of the new fiscal year Oct. 1.

On the revenue side, the new taxes will bring in the biggest lump, but some other revenue sources are expected to increase next year also, ac- counting for the total budget increase of some $6 million. For example, real and personal property taxes are expected to bring in nearly $200,000 more next year than anticipated by the end of this year. And tobacco stamp sales are hoped to garner about $20,000 more than they have in the first 11 months of this year.

Odom said the fire began ‘jwhen sparks’ from a welder’s torch ignited a conveyor belt near the structure’s roof and the flames spread down the belt, through the length of the building = With the south side of the ouilding uncompleted and open a@ Southerly wind fanned tne flames through the roof and north side of the structure, en- Gangering another warehouse about 200 feet away, Odom said. But the chief added later that the open side providing light, plus the lack. of obstruction inside the building, were factors in preventing injuries‘ to his men. 4. They were hampered, however, by the presence of | only two fireplugs for water |sources and by one old fire hose that burst several times. Odom said that under “nor- mal’? circumstances tne two available plugs would have supplied adequate water. In this case the construction workers in the building delayed reporting the blaze for about 10 minutes, attempting instead to put out the fire with seven extinguish- ers that used an estimated 50 gallons of water, the chief said. This delay allowed an ab- normal amount of fire to build up, Qdom_ said, spreading through the tar paper lined aluminum roof and_ creosote support posts inside coverea with plywood. Odom also said the 9-year-old hose that burst six or seven times hindered the firefighting operation. : Each time the hose broke the firemen had to back away from the building, return to their trucks for replacement pieces, and insert the new hose sec- tions, he said. “This takes time, valuable time in firefighting,’’ Odom said, adding that specifications had been sent out earlier that morning for the purchase of 10,000 feet of new huse. Odom said money for the hose had been cut from the fire es at P Fireman Atop Ladder Shoots Stream department’s budget last year, and was not made available to him by the City Commission until the 1972-73 budget was approved in October. _ The chief said a small con- tingent of his men would stay at the scene until nightfall to be sure all sparks were extinguish- ed, preventing a renewed out- break of fire.

And if bleak national foreeasts for single-family housing come home to Montgomery, a leveling off that began last vear can be expected to continue down- ward. The peak apertment year of 1971, when permits issued for 1,944 units, was followed by a sharp cutback io 739 permits in 1972. - The apartment boom that hit Montgomery in 1971 ap- peats to be making a com- ebarck, however, with permits assage of the amendments by the City Commission. \"While this action plus the time-consuming rezoning process may delay sorne of the new-style Gevelopments ast the prime spring con- ‘struction period, a new spate of complexes should be under way at Jeast by 1974. i While the construction of single-family ‘homes did rise + 1972—1,878 permits were: ie d compared to 1,592 in tee the increase was not as a as the jump between 1970 and 1971. n 1971, 532 more permits eye issued than, © were wd in 1970, while 1972 a only 281 more permits 1. than 197; crease in single- amily homes slowed last ae, ang national economists 2s SVEN REARS RAN were Were ~ SSNS hit Montgomery in 1971 appears to be making a comeback, however, with permits for 432 units already issued in January.

Even more can be expected, since the city Planning Com- mission already has epproved or is in the process of. ac- cepting plans for more than 1,000 units in several major complexes. Issued so far are permits for 312 units at the Ski Lodge complex off the Eastera Bypass, and 120 units at In- ternational Apartments off Woodley Road. In the’ works are the massive Fieldcrest complex, say the outlook for 1973 is even worse.

Apparently no new housing starts will be authorized for the popular Section 235 hous- ing, Officials have said. Farm labor housing loans and grants, rental and cooperative housing loans and Section 502 loans, all handled by the Farm Home _ Ad- ministration, also have been halted. In addition to the freeze on subsidized housing, the mortgage and interest rates also may have a bad effect on housing nationally.

The Special Education Trust ‘Fund, which finances the .education budget, comes from a number of state taxes, getting its major input from the income and sales taxes. On Tuesday the Senate Finance and Taxation Commit- tee had approved $3.58 million worth of amendments to the same bill, and _ all amendments were included in the House committee’s addi- tions. _ While the original budget was ney pie for the purpose of presenting the legislature a “unified’’ budget, that purpose essentially was defeated through the expected amend- ments. For example, vocational education people weren’t happy with their share of the pie, so lthey found allies among the committee members who added another $1.5 million for voca- tional education through amendments. The idea behind the select committee was preventing such actions once the budget was placed in the lawmakers’ hands. But the amendments conti- nued to flow up the table to chairman Mathews, who sighed in resignation over changes such as the one giving another $1.5 million to the state’s junior colleges. One amendment Mathews gave wholehearted support allocates an additional $200,000 to the Alabama High School of Fine Arts, an amendment that came after Mathews was called from the meeting to answer a phone call from the governor’s wife, Cornelia Wallace.

        "ocr_text": "House Members File 152 More Bills, Head Home By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A weary Alabama House membership took their tomato plants and went home for a lon weekend Friday, but not unt they threw another 152 bills into the legislative hopper. ' The two-hour session brought| little other action, except favorable reports on 10 bills from a local legislation com-| mittee and a resolution mourn- ing the death of Tuscaloosa Rep. Bert Bank’s father, whose] funeral was Sunday. The House members walked back into the chamber to resume their regular session just 10 hours after closing a raucus special session at mid- night Thursday. Failure in the special session to enact a bill setting pay scales for legislative clerical workers and authorizing a staff for Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley still hangs over the lawmakers’ heads in! the regular session, but that bill is only one of 527 filed so far in the regular biennial session. The other 375 bills were introduced on May 1, the first day of the regular session that immediately was interrupted by the call for the special session devoted mainly to enacting a reapportionment law. The tomato plants sitting on each lawmaker’s desk Friday morning were the donations of Jim Paulk, a former House member and owner of Bonnie Plant Farms. They elicited one wry comment from a legislator who suggested the members take them home, toil over them, and return the fruits of their labor to the clerical workers whose full pay won’t be re- stored until the _ legislature wrings out a new pay bill. ‘ That may be even harder to do in coming weeks than it was in the special session, since the House likely will complicate things soon with a bill to make the lieutenant governor a full- time assistant to the governor, having no role in the legislative process. This apparently would be in retaliation for Beasley’s at- tempts to expand his staff through the clerical pay bill so} he can run his office on a full- time basis. According to the Alabama Constitution, the lieutenant governor's job. is a part-time one centered on presiding over the Senate. House Speaker G. Sage i.yons has endorsed the concept of the change, just as he was vocally opposed Beasley’s wishes for more money and staff. Outside of the pay issue, a few other hot items will demand the legislators’ attention as the regular session winds through the summer months, and some of them were introduced in bill form Friday. They include Birmingham Rep. Bobby Timmons’ proposal for no-fault insurance that would make bodily injury insurance mandatory and institute quick payments of up to $10,000 for injuries sustained in an accident regardless o who caused the eee Another came from Rep. H.L. Callahan of Mobile, who wants to prohibit any agency from setting minimum retail prices for milk, a bill that essentially would abolish the Alabama Dairy Commission which i about to raise the price of milk for the second time this year.

And even more expensive amendments to the budget bill are expected once it hits the floor of the House for debate—probably Tuesday—as lawmakers continue efforts tg fund pet projects and keep the folks at home happy. The committee have a fav. orable report to a substitute for the administration’s $25% million budget bill that was introduced the first day of the session after tacking on nearly, 20 amendments that increased the total to some $257 million. © The , substitute bill alone increased the proposed budge! by $761,000, leaving a surplu‘; of $350,000 in the general fund? according to State Budget Of- fice James V. “Jake” Jordan. ' Jordan told the committee the additions would go for items such as funding the judicia} study commission, which was inadvertently left out of the original bill, increasing — the state controller's appropriation so he can implement certain recommendations from the governor's cost control survey, and financing relocated quar- lers for Capitol maintenance crews. The $350,000 estimated surplus was quickly eaten away through amendments, despite one initial attempt by committee Chair- man Pete Mathews and Speaker Pro Tem Joe McCorquodale to llimit additions with an unsue- cessful tabling motion. Nearly all 15 committee members offered amendments that ranged from $4,000 for the Mobile Carnival Commission to $490,000 for reforestation by the |Alabama Forestry Commission.

' | Acting as conducter who ap- plied the brakes was House Speaker Sage Lyons when he won approval of a substitute to the _still-growing education budget bill. The substitute erased all spending amend- ments tacked on to the measure by the Ways and Means Com- mittee last week and by the House membership during the previous few hours Thursday. But the House refused to give Lyons a total victory by ad- journing until Tuesday instead ‘of rewriting the bill that after- ‘noon as the speaker requested. | The action came amidst cries of fiscal irresponsibility being ‘issued from all corners of the House, and constituted a total reversal of the free-spending attitude lawmakers have displayed since they began tackling the money bills two weeks ago. While the costly amendments spending mo on everything from teacher health’ insurance to a university-run diabetes hospital were flushed down the drain, the House members will have ample opportunity to run a repeat performance when they reconvene Tuesday. The long weekend respite gives education interests time to lobby for their various needs and desires outside the Capitol hallways, which is what Lyons was trying to prevent by aski the House to stay in session to finish off the bill Thursday. But Lyons and other leaders expressed optimism after the gavel fell on Thursday’s session that most lawmakers’ will return intent on passing an education budget that reasonably resembles the reve- nue projections offered by ad- ministration fiscal experts. That fact that those projec- tions repeatedly have fallen below actual revenues in past years is mostly what has pro- mpted the legislators to disregard the administration budget that spends $1.153 billion pe experts say will be avail- able. Already in this biennium the state has accrued $40 million nore than the administration said was expected to finance eee two oa eee ago. The quntticnte be resol Lae = PA ACL iow a over the revenue estimates the House will spend on education, since even Lyons and Ways and Means Committee Chair- man Charles ‘Pete’? Mathews agree some additions must be made due to oversights. Without anv additions the ad- ministration’s original budget that was accepted as a substitute for the amended bill spends more on education than »ver before in Alabama history. That budget gives elementary ind secondary education a 39 yer cent increase over the cur- ‘ent. biennium, allots post- secondary education a 36 per rent increase. and awards eachers a $1,000-a year raise. It also specifies funding to idd 1.750 more teachers to the minimum education program, 500 for special education and 255 for vocational] education. Other questions that may arise next week, apart from how much to spend, involve how much spending direction to give educators. Several amendments approv- ed by the House Thursday before all additions were erased by adoption of the substitucc would earmark money in junior colleges and trade schools for teacher raises.

And they were right. Lack of direction, apparent absence of goals and a general floundering in the legislative morass have been the trademark of this session, The Senate has engaged in one filibuster after another, unable to decide even which bills to consider. The House membership has been bent on a spending spree resulting in an education budget so outrageously out of balance that even the lawmakers became disgusted and suddenly made a 180-degree reversal with their decision to Start over and try to do it right. While the House members expressed the best of intentions to practice ‘‘iseal responsibility” when they return to work Tuesday, the odds against it are high, The spending snowball could get rolling again if just one questionable amendment gets tacked onto the budget bill, serving as a cue to start dipping into the pork barrel again. House Speaker G. Sage Lyons may have been right in attempting to keep the body assembled in order to write a NeW budget by week’s end, but he has drawn increasing, quiet criticism {rom members who fee| they're being almost totally excluded from the decision-making process by the House leaders. The vote to adjourn against Lyons’ wishes and delay further action on the budget until Tuesday was a close one, but the House did tell the speaker they wouldn't let him ~~ steamroller through a bill drawn to his suiting alone, Whether they'll be able to produce anything better remains \\n question, Those Young Turks who want a greater role than merely passing local legislation have yet to show a capacity for wearing a leadership mantle, although each wants to try his turn as leader. Some of them did manage to wrest contrdl in the Ways and Means Committee last week, and what resulted was a case of T'll serateh your back if you'l} scratch mine, Each went along with what the others wanted in the way of financing capital improvements, and nobody much bothered to find out whether the money was available or the individual improvements needed, So there the House sits, with some well-intentioned lawmakers wanting to do what they feel the state needs, but few willing to give up their lesser ambitions to achieve a common goal, None has won the trust and respect necessary to unite the House and lead it through a legislative program that would begin raising Alabama from what has been described as its present position at the bottom of the heap in comparison 0 other states. One powerful House member who's been around long enough to observe the vacillations of many sessions agrees that all is chaos as usual, But he also says he's optimistic that by the end of the summer the state will have its budget and other vital concerns will have been tended to, The Capitol still will be standing, Alabama goveroment will continue (0 {unelion, and all this will have been born in the {umultuous session of the legislature, . While he finds this a cause for optimism, perhaps his speculation should generate exactly the opposite attitude. Until it does, Alabama likely will continue down the same governmenta) course that has left the state trailing in national assessments of services ranging from education to mental health to the legislature itself June 10, 1973 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Alabama House Rubber-Stamps 3 Dozen Bills By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Members of the Alabama House surrendered their last vestige of legislative control to the state administration Tuesday by adopting a special order calendar, then proceeded to rubber-stamp some three dozer bills listed on the new calendar with little or no explanation of their provisions. The lawmakers finally balked midway down the specia 1 calendar when they rewrite workmen’s compensation laws, since it appeared considerable debate and delaying tactics would tie up further passage of legislation. - One unsuccessful battle was waged to stave off adoption of the special order calendar, which is a new order of business drawn by the House Rules Committee and essentially is an administration tool to defeat or promote certain bills. The Rules Committee, dominated by allies of Gov. George Wallace and his administration, picks and chooses which bills receive a favored slot on the special order calendar, which replaces the regular calendar that lists bills in the order they are reported out of committee. Rep. David Cauthen of Decatur proposed delaying adoption of the new calendar until Thursday to give House members time to study the bills listed on it. “If you'll look on the calendar, you'll see there are some very controversial bills in it,” Cauthen said in response to Rules Committee Chairman Tom Drake’s characterization of the calendar as one holding only“non-controversial” Measures, Huntsville Rep. Hartwell Lutz sided with  Cauthen, charging that “commitments have been made that members be given one day’s notice before adopting a special order calendar,” “If we adopt this the Rules Committee reached a package of bills that would commitments,” Lutz said. “But more important, it would be a gross violation of our responsibility to adopt this with no more notice than we had.” But Drake’s move to table Cauthen’s proposal prevailed on a vote of 46 to 30, and the special order calendar was ruled adopted by Speaker G. Sage Lons after a voice vote whose outcome was questionable to most observers. With the new calendar of 70 bills in hand, the House membership sped through the list, demanding full explanations of few, if any, of the bills, After passing uncontested local bills, Rep. Charles ‘Pete’ Mathews of Ashland stepped to the microphone to gain passaze of his bill described on the calendar as ‘State Budget Of- ficer.” Mathews said the bill would place the budget officer under the merit system, but did not explain why the move is needed. The bill passed, 83-0, Rep. Murray McCluskey of Sylacauga then took the microphone to explain his two lengthy bills des wbed on the calendar as ‘‘Regulation of Elections in Municipalities.” “This bill brings municipal election laws up to date,’”? McCluskey said. ‘‘It’s non-contzoversial, as attested to by the fact it’s on the special order calendar and was ruled so by the Rules Committee.” The bill passed by a vote of 81 to 0. Speaking to his second bill, McCluskey said, “It does the same for comm’ssior- type cities as for the others.” It passed, 84 to 0. The House continued to adopt committee substitutes and amendme..ts to bills and pass numerous measures with explanations similarly detailed. The lawmakers approved legislation to “rule out the possibility of double taxation on insurance holding companies” without learning provisions of the bill, to raise the fees levied in the Uniform Commercial Code without finding out how much they’d be raised, to “simply update and increase” state employe retirement benefits without learning how much to would cost the state. and to increase sick leave and insurance benefits for state employes will be flying in the face of those without asking how much the better benefits would cost the taxpayers. Some controversy did arise, however, over a package of bills that would re- enact laws granting tax exemptions on industrial pollution control equipment and would let the air and water pollution control commissions usurn the State Personnel Board by creating new employe pocitions and setting their salaries without meeting merit system reauirements. The latter bill was temporarily nostponed after some members objected the commissions would be granted power to engage in wide-ranging acts of nenotism and to set exorbitant salaries. Objections that State Revenue Denartment officials are concerned over vague definitions of pollution control equipment held little water with the lawmakers, however, and they voted to re-enact the present laws after sponsor Rep. Charles Graninger of Huntsville said questions over their legality had arisen, The problem, he said, is that the bills originated in the Senate. and money bills are supposed to originate in the House.

        "ocr_text": " Turns Out! 30 Bills By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer ~ Anxious to consume a little pork for a change instead of dishing it out, the Alabama House adjourned Tuesday before completing its special order calendar. But the lower chamber did manage to push through about 30 bills, including a new strip-mining measure and a last-hope reapportion- ment bill, before adjourning to a pork barbecue hosted by the Alabama Farm Bureau, one of the most powerful lob- bies in the state. The lawmakers also sal- vaged the remains of the spe- cial calendar at the last min- ute by reversing an earlier vote against continuing the calendar when they next meet on Thursday. Despite numerous efforts to write a stronger strip-min- ing bill than the one offered by Jasper Rep. Bobby Tom \"Crowe, only one strong amendment was added be- fore the bill won passage. That amendment would require strip miners to com- letely refill the mined area in the reclamation process, instead of just contouring the land to a ‘‘reasonable’’ de- gree. Birmingham Rep. Chriss Doss, sponsor of a rival min- ing bill, failed in his efforts to stiffen the proposed regu- lations and warned his col- leagues that Crowe's bill won't ‘‘remedy the prob- lems” caused by strip min- ing or meet the minimum federal requirements that should be forthcoming. The new reapportionment bill won speedy passage with no debate or attempts to amend it. It’s the legisla- ture’s last-ditch effort to re- place a federal court plan that remaps the state without regard for existing county lines and is expected to create havoc in next year’s ‘elections. _ Even if the bill wins Senate approval, most lawmakers feel there is little chance the federal court will consider another reapportionment plan after recently rejecting the legislature’s last propos- al for redrawing legisla- tive districts. Sponsors of the bill are basing their hopes on the opinion of one judge on the three-judge federal panel who said the legislature's original plan would have passed muster if it hadn't been amended. The bill passed Tuesday is the original plan without amendments.

        "ocr_text": "Baxley Hits Farm Bureau, AIA By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley said Monday he will seek grand jury indictments against the Alabama Farm Bureau and Associated Industries of Ala- bama (AIA) for alleged vio- lations of the Corrupt Prac- tices Act in last year's cam- paign against annual legisla- tive sessions. His statement came at a press conference one day af- ter a Birmingham state rep- resentative charged Baxley and 24 other officials and or- ganizations with violating the same campaign spend- ing act. a charge Baxley de- scribed as ‘a smokescreen’ aimed at ‘‘intimidating’’ him and hampering his in- vestigation into the AIA and Farm Bureau. Baxley said he began the investigation at the behest of two Birmingham state sena- tors. Richard Dominick and Larry Register. While his in- uiry is not yet complete, axley said he was announc- . y ' front group for the Farm Bu- reau, AIA, and ‘‘other spe-- ing his intentions to seek in- dictments against the two powerful groups as a direct result of the charge leveled against him. That charge came from State Rep. Quinton Bowers . of Birmingham, who said Sunday the law regulating campaign practices needs revision. To support his case, Bow- ers listed the names of 25 candidates and organiza- tions he said vioiated the law's provisions requiring fi- nance committees to report campaign expenditures. to the secretary of state. Baxley, who was listed among the violators, flatly denied the charge Monday. ‘The important thing is that this statement is noth- ing but a sham,”’ the attor- ney general said. ‘‘It was written by AIA for Bowers,” He said the AIA and Farm. Bureau are ‘‘using the same tactics they did in No- vember,’’ when an ex- pensive campaign was mounted against a con- Stitutional amendment pro- osing annual sessions of the egislature. he amendment was voted down by the people, and a group called Taxpayers Against Annual Sessions generally is credited with gaining the defeat. Baxley charged Monday that the organization was a cial interest groups,’’ with the AIA providing the financ- ing and Farm Bureau in- . fluencing ‘‘innocent people to lend their names.” ‘That committee failed to ‘file with the secretary of state anything about where that money came from and uo it was spent,’’ Baxley said. ‘They have the absolute right to speak out or cam- paign against anything,” Baxley said, ‘but they don't have the right to hide behind a sham committee. ’’ Baxley refused to say how much money was involved in the campaign, but upon questioning said the sum was ‘“‘close to’’ $50,000. He said his office will present evidence to the Montgomery County grand - jury in an attempt to win in- dictments against the AIA, Farm Bureau, and probably against two individuals from the groups who he refused to name. Baxley also said that after AIA learned of his in- vestigation, Bowers came to him on July 10 asking the matter be dropped.

She also discounted Bow- ers’ contention that Baxley and the other 24 candidates and groups, including Gov. George Wallace and U.S, Sen. John Sparkman, vio- lated the Corrupt Practices Act, saying all filed the nec- essary reports. A representative of AIA could not be reached for comment Monday evening, but a Farm Bureau spokes- man denied Baxley’s accu- sation. “Our initial response is that Farm Bureau and its 156,000 member families is not guilty of any wrongdoing in the matter that was spo- ken to by Mr. Baxley this af- ternoon,’’ he said. “We view his accusation as an attempt to make Farm Bureau a scapegoat for al- leged violations of the Cor- rupt Practices Act,” he said. . “We categorically deny any wrongdoing.” Farm Bureau President J.D. Hays was out-of-state Monday, but the spokesman said Hays may have a more detailed statement Tuesday. August 21, 1973 \f"

Wal- lace still could administer the first aid necessary to re- Vive it. The House State Adminis. tration Committee gave the bill an adverse report at a quick meeting called espe- ‘cially to consider the mea- sure, The committee, which has refused to bring up the bill since it won Senate passage ‘last week, finally was forced to consider it by an unusual action of the House member- ship earlier in the day. On a motion by Huntsville Rep. Doug Hale, the House voted 61-1 to direct the com- mittee to act on the bill and report its action back to the House when it next meets. The unfavorable report will place the bill on the ad- verse calendar on the next to last legislative day, and bills on that calendar cannot be considered until all legisla- tion on the regular calendar has been disposed of. Parliamentary maneu- vers, however, could switch the bill to the regular calen- dar in time for a vote on the last day of the legislative session. Or Gov. George Wallace, who repeatedly has ex- pressed his desire for strong ethics legislation, could legislative day in advance. With two legislative days remaining, it appears there is enough time for such a maneuver. But its success also could be thwarted by a ruling from House Speaker G. Sage Lyons, who has given little indication he supports the legislation. Lyons abstained wield his influence over com- [rom voting on the motion di- mittee members and urge a reconsideration of the vote. Hale and several other House members talked with Wallace just after the lower chamber adjourned Thurs- day, and said they won a “‘re- luctant’’ commitment from the governor to speak with committee members in sup- port of the bill. But while they were con- ferring with Wallace, the committee was voting to give the bill an unfavorable report. Committee Chairman Rankin Fite of Hamilton had announced. his committee would meet immediately upon adjournment, but said the group only would decide when and where to meet to consider the ethics bill. If the governor refuses to intervene, or is unsuccess- ful, proponents of the bill might be able to get it on the regular calendar by winning a suspension of the rules. The bill also could be switched to the regular ca- lendar by a vote of the House membership, but the vote cannot be taken unless a member files notice that he recting the committee to act on the bill. Under present circum- stances, the debate given that motion may be the only public airing of the ethics bill by the lower chamber. When Hale made the mo- tion, he described it as ‘‘our last and only chance to act on ethics legislation in this ses- sion, indeed in this term of office.” Much of the debate on the motion centered not on the merits of the bill, but on the group that wrote the original ethics proposal—Common Cause, the national ‘people's lobby.” Rep. John Casey of Heflin asked who are members of Common Cause, and noted that the group failed to regis- ter as a lobby until the last few days of the session. Rules of both houses require lobbyists to register. And Rep. Tom Stubbs of Helena contended the goal of tion of local government.’ Florence Rep. Robert Hill, sponsor of the bill in the’ House, responded that the makeup and goals of Com- mon Cause weren't at issue. . “Where the bill comes from is of little concern,” Hill said. “I don't think this has any bearing on the bill. Look at it for its own mer- its.” Other opponents sug- gested the state already has sufficient laws to cover the ethics of public officials, laws that prohibit actions such as bribery and stealing. Proponents argued in re- turn that numerous areas of official conduct are not regu- lated by any existing laws, and Birmingham Rep. Chriss Doss said: “If there is some duplication, so what? A double good never hurt anybody,\" If the bill should be ap- proved by the House, it would require state, county and city officials make a public disclosure of their fi- nancial interests and would prohibit conflicts of interest. It would require the same disclosure from candidates for public office, and would set up an ethics commission to enforce the new law. August 31, 1973 \f"

Essentially the measure will unify the state court sys- tem that presently is a hodge-podge of inferior courts with little uniformity, and will give the chief justice of the Supreme Court certain administrative powers over all other courts.

The House voted to in- definitely postpone the bill early in the evening Thurs- day, but Sen. Aubrey Carr of Guntersville, a funeral home director and adamant propo- nent of the measure, sus- tained a filibuster in the up- per chamber to block all pas- sage of House bills and force the lower chamber to re- consider its action. Selma Rep. Milam Turner proposed reconsideration, saying the House should give Carr a definitive answer so he might end his delaying tactics in the Senate. Rep. Charles ‘‘Pete'’ Mathews of Ashland made September 14, 1973 > \fHiouse “Tackles Sticky Issues one of the most stirring $peeches of the entire ses- sion. during debate on the re- consideration motion. “IT want to vote for this bill,\"’ Mathews said. ‘But: when they tell me, ‘You must pass this bill or nothing else will get through,’ then some- thing in me rises up.” “T say to Sen. Carr to get off his arbitrary position so we can vote on the merits of this: bill,” Mathews said. His sentiment was shared by ‘a majority of the House members who loudly ap- plauded his words, and the membership proceeded to reconsider the vote and in- definitely postpone the bill once more. With just moments re-. maining in the ses- sion—unless the presiding officer would choose to stop the clock as has been done in the past—the House still had not considered two other highly controversial mea- sures. These include a bill to make the lieutenant gover- nor’s position a full-time job with expanded powers and one to reform bail bond prac- tices. The House did run through a substantial number of ‘*noncontroversial'’ mea- sures, many of which were brought up out of order be- fore the judicial article and ethics bill, by proponents an- ticipating a major tie-up over those bills. The House also concurred with Senate amendments to a bond issue to finance capi- tal improvements for all lev- els of education. The changes reduced the amount of the House passed bill from more than $200 million to $179.9 million, which still is a higher amount than en- dorsed by the administration of Gov. George Wallace. Earlier, much of the day was consumed with proce- dural matters such as con- curring with non-contested Senate amendments tacked onto previously passed House bills, giving final ap- proval to local legislation, and adopting or killing exec: utive amendments proposed by Wallace, Many members sat through the final day with the knowledge they never will fill a legislative seat again, mainly due to the court-ordered reapportio- nment plan that will take: effect before the next elec- tio#s. ; Same also \"reportadly will: not *seek re-election if forced to meet the requirments of -the ethics bill designed to force into the open any con- flicts of interests by public officials.

        "ocr_text": "Ethics Bill May Make 3 Resign By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama's new ethics law may force the resignations of three members of the sev- en-member Montgomery Planning Commission. The provision that could remove almost half the com- missioners from their posi- tions prohibits anyone from serving as member of a State, county or city regu- latory board or commission that regulates a business with which he is associated. The ethics bill originally applied only to state regu- latory agencies, but Bir- mingham State Rep. George McMillan won an amend- ment to include county and city agencies when the mea- sure was debated in the House of Representatives. Earlier in the legislative session McMillan had failed to gain passage of a local bill that would have prohibited certain persons, such as realtors, from serving on the Jefferson County planning agency. His amendment to the eth- ics bill was an effort to achieve the same result by a different route. There is some legal ques- tion, however,whether his tactic will bring that effect, and the answer likely won't be known until the provision is tested in the courtroom. If the McMillan amend- ment is successful, the law will affect not only Jefferson County, but planning boards and similar agencies throughout the state. In Montgomery, it could result in the resignations of John Starr, Ed Dennis and John Jackson from the city’s Planning Commission. One crucial question is whether the commission le- gally is considered a regu- latory agency, and if so, ex- actly what enterprises it regulates. Among the commission's duties are giving final ap- proval to the layout and plans for subdivisions, and approving development plans for any building that requires a building permit and is proposed for an indus- trial, commercial or multi- residential zoning district. It could be construed that the commission regulates everything from architects to realtors or land devel- opers. If so, the law would affect Ed Dennis, an owner of Den- nis and Barnes Realtors, which among other things specializes in office build- ings. Starr, an electrical con- tractor, and Jackson, a plumbing contractor, also would be affected by virtue of their clients, who come un- der direct supervision of the Planning Commission. They would fall under the provision because the law defines the phrase ‘‘business with which he is associated” as meaning not only a regu- lated business which the commission member owns, but any regulated business which is a client of the mem- ber. The phrase additionally is defined as including any business of which the com- mission member or a mem- ber of his family is a direc- Thus the provision might affect other members if they hold financial interest in any company regulated by the commission.

        "ocr_text": "Aderholt Resigns Post Aas MH Commissioner | E. Folsom, By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Commissioner Charles Aderholt leaves the State Mental Health Department under circumstances sharp- ly contrasting those that sur- rounded the departure of his controversial predecessor. Aderholt’s announcement Thursday that he is resign- ing as Mental Health Com- missioner as of Dec. 31 was greeted with verbal regrets and good wishes from those who worked closely with him over the year he served as chief of one of the state’s most troubled departments. His decision to return to private business, rumored for several weeks, obviously was accompanied by mixed feelings. . As Mental Health Board Chairman Jack Nolen ac- cepted the resignation and bestowed praise on the com- missioner for his service to the state, tears welled in Aderholt’s eyes and it took a visible effort to control his emotions. A little over one year ago a very different scene was enacted when then-Commis- sioner Dr. Stonewall Stick- ney was fired by the board for prompting dissent among departmental ranks and failing to perform ad- ministrative duties ade- quately. It was amidst this turmoil, and following the stinging in- dictment of a federal court that ordered sweeping im- provements of state mental institutions, that Aderholt ascended to the number one spot in the department. In the year he served, Aderholt did much to restore order, and said after Thurs- day’s board meeting that he leaves ‘‘under no pressure.”’ “T hope I’m leaving with- out anyone mad at me,”’ he said. ‘‘I’m not mad at any- , one.”’ His advice to a successor is to ‘‘be strong—tough and strong and dedicated to the mentally ill.”’ The matter of a successor was taken up immediately, when Chairman Nolen ap- pointed a five-man _ selection committee headed by vice- chairman Carl Boley to be- gin the search for a replace- ment. The committee meets in 10 days. Already some controversy is evident over who will be the new commissioner. Board members them- selves, who will make the ul- timate decision, said little Thursday about what direc- tion the search will take. But numerous names have been mentioned in circles both inside and outside the department, and adament proponents of any one person are balanced by just as ada- mant opponents. A main difference of opin- ion lies in divergent philo- sophies' over whether a doc- tor or professional adminis- trator should head the de- partment. For example, some are pushing Dr. Ciark Case, for- merly the senior psy- chiatrist of the well-known Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kan,, who came here as the department’s director of mental health services in March.

        "ocr_text": "Superport $$ Assured By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Ameraport Corpo- ‘ration has been assured of private financing for its pro- posed superport off the Ala- bama-Mississppi coast, and construction could begin within a year. Although numerous hur- dles still must be swept aside if the deep water port is to be- come a reality, officials say This includes money to build the facility. “‘We've got people who have said that if we get the li- cense, they'll build it,”’ Moeller said last week. . He would not name the concerns that have com- mitted the capital, but did say ‘‘two of the largest in- vestment banking’ concerns in the world have come to us to offer aid.” Another important aspect of the operation also is prog- ressing well—getting refi- neries to locate in Alabama. “In order for a deep water port to be a viable concept off the Alabama coast,\"’ Moel- ler said, ‘‘there must be a re- fining capacity in the state or the economic benefit will be miniscule.,”’ Without refineries and the jobs, taxes and support serv- ices they generate, the im- ported oil would at best pass through or around the state, making littie economic im- pact on Alabama. At least one company, Odessa Refinery, an Ameri- can. French and Russian corporation, has committed itself to the project by pur- chasing an option on 800 acres of land near Mobile. the biggest problems vir- tually have been resolved. These are private finan- cial backing for construction of the monobuoy and pipe- line where mammoth oil tankers can deposit their loads of foreign oil, and as- surance of at least one new refinery in the state to pro- cess the crude oil, according to Dr. John Moeller, execu- tive director of the Amera- Negotiations also are ong- oing with other firms that have expressed interest in locating here, Moeller said. It has been estimated that one new refinery with sup- portive services would create 6,850 new jobs and boost the state’s economy by $175.2 million over a two- year period. Over 20 years, that same refinery would add $2.2 bil- lion to the money circulating through Alabama. An added enticement to the oil refining industry is the near certain prospect of oil drilling beginning in the Outer Continental Shelf off the coasts of Alabama, Mis- sissippi and Florida within the year. The U.S. Interior Depart- ment is expected to sell drill- ing leases next month, so the money commitments, road to construction is a long one filled with potential port Corporation. Work began about a year ago on the superport, a facil- ity proposed to be located about 20 miles out at sea to accommodate the huge ships that carry foreign oil but find few places to dock at Ameri- can coastal ports where wa- ter is too shallow. The name superport is somewhat of a misnomer, since the facility would be First, the project is a two- state effort between Ala- bama and Mississippi, which already has significant re- fining capacity in Pasca- goula just across the state line. Federal legislation is needed to authorize a bi- state compact between the two, which would apply jointly for a federal license to build the port. The licensing lure it- self hasn’t been up by the federal government, but some type of license is needed because the port would be located in waters under U.S. jurisdiction, not state. A bill to create a new fed- eral agency that would regu- late construction of any su- perport now is being written in Congress, with input from Ameraport advocates from both Alabama and Mis- Sissippt. Once the agency is created, which Moeller esti- mates should be by spring, it must develop the rules and regulations governing deep water harbors. ‘“*‘We hope to anticipate these and even have a strong inpet into (writing) these rules,\" Moeller said. comprised in the main of a monobuoy or docking ter- minal for the ships, and pipe- lines to carry the oil from the terminal to shore. With little government money—state or feder- al—available, backers of the deep water port have had to solicit money from private industry since inception of s bi-state group then would apply for a permit in accordance with regulations drawn by the new agency. “I don’t see a way in the world for Alabama-Mis- sissippi to be denied a deep water port permit,” he said. The bi-state group then would supervise construc- tion and operation of the har- bor by private industry. Moeller suggested that these activities should be completed by next fall, with or set as the earliest possible date for beginning construction of The timetable is a tight one, and a potential delaying aspect that Moeller hardly mentioned is protests from environmental groups throughout the country that undoubtedly will demand that the federal licensing agency adopt stringent regu- lations over superports. The possibility of oil leaks from pipelines and devas- tating spills from tankers as they transfer their cargo from ship to pipe are by no means remote. And ecolog- ists are well aware of the hazards. November 4, 1973 \f"

        "ocr_text": "“Filack Gold FeRuaaesha As By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The black gold rush is on, and Alabama is in the heart of the stampede. — Whether the state and some of its most valuable natural resources will be crushed, or whether Alaba- mians will reap untold eco- nomic benefits from the search still is in question. The black gold, of course, is Oil, and the place it will be sought is in the Gulf: of Mexi- co off the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi and Florida, pro- vided the U.S. Interior De- partment sells drilling leases as scheduled next month. | The prospect of drilling for oil as close as 15 miles from the gulf’s most scenic beaches and most produc- tive fishing areas is ana- thema to conservationists who document the devas- tating effects of oil spills, leaks and blowouts. But the prospect of a wor- sening energy crisis with ramifications ranging from freezing families to depend- ence on hostile Arab nations for oil supplies generates just as much concern among government officials and economists. The scales tilt in favor of avoiding the latter, since the government controls the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), and Interior Depart- ment spokesmen have said the sale of leases for 147 tracts of land there is vir- tually assured. The only action that might stop oil companies from buy- ing drilling rights from the government is the filing of ‘Chiles, €CIPra”~ lawsuits against Interior, an action that both Sen. Lawton D-Fla., and Florida Gov. Reubin Askew have threatened. To date those threats have not been translated into court action. Unless they are, 817,297 acres of submerged land will be up for grabs in December through the competitive bid process in which oil com- panies make an offer for each nine square mile tract lawsuits against Interior, an action that both Sen.

The offshore sale should swell the U.S. Treasury by between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. an additional entice- ment to the government. This particular sale, known as MAFLA for the re- gion involved. is only one of Many expected in the next five years. according to the environmental statement drawn by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the Interior Department. That statement called MAFLA -‘the most logical “mew” area for a proposed sale since it would be a north- eastern extension of over 2 years of leasing experience off the Texas and Louisiana Gualf.*~ The five-year pian that starts with MAFLA even- tually would result in sales covering 15 million acres of land. some off the coasts of southern California and Alaska. but most located in unspecified areas of the Gulf of Mexico. That means even more wa- ters off the eastern Gulf States may be dotted with @arilling rigs in the future, es- pecially if the MAFLA ex- Ploration proves to be a big oil find. At present, BLM esti- mates the MAFLA sale will result in production of any- where from 1-5 billion to 2.4 billion barrels of oil. and 1.8 to 2.9 trillion cubic feet of gas. which usually is found in pockets with the oil. It could take as long as 20 years—the average life of an oil field—to deplete the un- derground cache, and the to- tai amount of oil produced would be about enough to meet the nation’s needs for six months. One-sixth of that produc- tion would go to the U.S. gov- ernment in the form of roval- ties for allowing use of feder- al lands. Jim Hart. executive direc- tor of the Alabama Petro- teurn Council, explaimed the usual procedure once leases are sold. The oil company that wins the contract has five years from the day it was awarded to explore for oil. If none is found in that time. the land then reverts to tk. govern- ment and the company its bags and goes packs home. If oil is’ struck. however. the company has as long as it takes to drain the area dry . Hart conjectured that ex- ploration of MAFLA should begin “‘in a big way” by next March or April, depending upon the availability of dril- ing rigs. These are mobile or tem- Porary. affairs that can be moved from place to place, drilling through the ocean floor in search of oil and gas. If enough is found to be commercially valuable, a Platform built on shore is transported to the site and production drilling begins. --Assuming oil is found.”’ Hart said. *‘it would be three to five years before produc taon is substantial.” AS many as 30 separate wells can be drilled from one Platform base through the use of slant drilling. The Platform carries not only technical and safety equip- ment. but living quarters and usually a helicopter landinogearearto accommodate the crews that spend a week at a time offshore. working and res- ting in 12-hour shifts. Once the oil is out of the ground. it then must be car- ried to the shore for refining. If less than 10,000 barrels a day is produced from a piat- form. the company likely will decide to barge the oil in, which is not a favored meth- od because barges are con- sidered unstable and suscep- tible to whims of the weath- er. If production is sufficient. however. a pipeline is buried in the ocean floor stretching from the platform to shore. Im some cases oil tankers must be used for trans- portation, if the drilling site is too far from the closest re- finery. The tanker method may be used for tracts off the west- ern coast of Florida. since that state has no major refi- neries. The tracts off the Ala- bama,. Florida panhandle and Mississippi coasts cagoula, Miss... which al- ready has a major refining capacity. Although the BLM _ report and the petroleum council's Hart both -expressed opin- ions that most oil would go to Mississippi refineries. some State officials here are hop- ing sufficient oil will be dis- covered to prompt the con- struction of new refineries in this state—a definite eco- nomic boon to Alabama. Those especially hoping for new refineries to tocate here are officials of Amera- port Corporation, the group Pushing corstruction of a deep water harbor off the Alabama-Mississippi coast that would attract the huge tamkers that bring foreign oil to this country. The ships cannot dock in most ports on the coast. including Mobile, because coastal waters aren't deep enough to ac- commodate their bulk. The deep water port would be located about 20 miles off- shore. and the foreign oil would be piped to land much as it is from domestic oil drilling platforms. Ameraport officials feel their project, coupled with new supplies of domestic oil in the same area, would draw major refineries to the state. lf the refineries with their vast economic impact don't follow the scent of oil here. Alabama stands to gain little from the advent of offshore drilling. November 4, 1973 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Mobile Bay Drilling Near By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer , With oil drilling almost a certainty in the Gulf of Mexi- co off Alabama's coast, rigs springing up even closer to home in Mobile Bay may be just around the corner. While most Alabamians, with the exception of state: officials, hardly have been aware of drilling probabi- lities in the gulf, many have raised a hue and cry at the thought of pulling oil from land beneath the bay waters. Yet federal actions toward leasing drilling rights some 15 miles south of Alabama's coastline may set a precedent hard to break when time comes to consider drilling operations in the bay. The same justifications are advanced for both: mainly the current energy crisis, coupled with the re- fusal of nine Arab nations to supply this country with more oil, demands exploitation of as many domestic re- sources as possible. State development officials also cast envious glances at neighboring states reaping substantial economic benefits from oil drilling in state waters which extend three miles from the shoreline, as well as drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf that is controlled by the U.S, government, On the opposite side stand those who fear the problem of chronic oil spills and pipeline leakage, not to mention the ever-present possibility of a major accident that would spew thousands of barrels of oil into the bay and onto the shore, An accident in the bay unquestionably would cause greater damage since it's surrounded by coastline and beaches that would suck up oil like a sponge. , ° At least a major Grilling blow-out or spill might be SSrannqge Second of a Series more easily contained in the gulf and the oil would have to travel farther to reach the coast, the ecologists argue. The submerged bay land already has been leased by the State Oil and Gas Board to Mobil Oil Co., but the board has yet to grant a drilling permit so operations may begin. The time for a decision on the permit is growing closer, The board and Alabama Geological Survey staff cur- rently are undertaking environmental analyses or- dered by the Alabama Legislature this summer as a prerequisite for receiving $200,000 needed by the board to monitor drilling in the bay. Some lawmakers, including administration leaders, wanted to grant the money unconditionally, but opposi- tion forces led by Mobile State Sen. Robert Edington at- tached the requirement for the .study. The study is to include recommendations for over-all drilling guidelines, and upon completion will be turned over to an independent consulting firm which will ‘eval- uate its adequacy,” according to Philip LaMoreaux, su- pervisor of the oil and gas board. Hired for the geological survey staff to coordinate the effort is Dr. Ralph Chermock, formerly an ecology pro- fessor at the University of Alabama, and Parsons Col- lege in Fairfield, Iowa. and engineers from various state depart- ule with Chermock, and their efforts also will be coordi- nated with those of numerous federal agencies. For example, LaMoreaux said, the Interior Depart- ment's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has drawn up an environmental statement for use in connection with federal leasing of land in the gulf for drilling pur- Portis mammoth five-volume study will be used by the state when applicable to environmental conditions in the bay, LaMoreaux said. But this same BLM study has been severely criticized by other federal agencies (such as the Environmental Protection Agency) as well as by ecology-minded citizens from gulf coast states. The board's study, as demanded by the legislation, must be completed within six months of the start of this fiscal year, which fixes the deadline at April]. “This is what we're trying to do (meet the deadline), LaMoreaux said, “but I don't know if it’s humanly pos- sible.” , “ae He said he doesn't think the appropriation will be lost if the final study is submitted late. . | “The legislature required such a study, he said, “and I would think they wart a competent study. Even after the study is submitted to the board, the consulting firm might determine more work Is needed in specific areas, which would require further research. The final product will be only partially the basis of the board's decision on whether to permit drilling. LaMoreaux said board members will closely scruti- nize Mobil Oil Co.'s drilling proposal to make certain all its a guidelines for technical equipment and safety pre- cautions will be met. “They may read that environmental statement, for example, and say that (drilling rig) is right in the middle of a channel that shouldn't be disturbed for any reason, LaMoreaux said. Whatever the board's ultimate decision. it could come within six months, he said, “if everything went like clockwork.” It could. however, take considerably longer. One of the few certainties of the whole situation is that considerable pressure will be exerted both in favor of and against drilling in the bay over the next few months. Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley already has gone on record as opposed to the proposal, and groups such as ‘Save Our Bay\" are mounting campaigns against drilling. Even Gov. George Wallace has been quoted as pri- vately expressing concern over the potential impact of drilling in Mobile Bay. The oil industry and state development officials con- cerned with bringing more jobs and stimulation to the Alabama economy likely will be pressing for favorable action on the drilling permit. Much of the conflicting efforts. deservedly or not. will fall on the head of Gov. Wallace. One board member's term expires soon, and both sides undoubtedly will be pushing for an appointee ame- nable to their opposite points of view, since that person | could be pivotal in the ultimate decision.

        "ocr_text": "Environment vs. Energy: Offshore Drill Question By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Will offshore drilling for oil destroy the Gulf of Mexi- co, or will it be a salvation in this country’s worsening energy crisis? Drilling rigs may begin sprouting in the Gulf waters within months, but nobody can answer such questions about the ultimate effect of the search for new energy supplies. The three states that should have an immediate, vital concern in the answers are Alabama, Florida and Mis- sissippi, because the U.S. Interior Department has scheduled for next month the sale of offshore leases, or drilling rights, along their coasts. Reactions to the pending sale vary from vehement op- position to middle road non-commitment to adamant support. In most cases the sides have squared off along ex- pected lines—ecologists versus industry and govern- ment. But in some instances the prospect of oil drilling has, resulted in unusual bedfellows, such as the chamber of commerce and environmental groups in Panama City, Fla., both working against oil production as a potential hazard to the ‘beaches that attract free-spending tour- ists. admitted seeing ‘‘a conflict of concerns,” but said he doesn't have sufficient facts to determine whether drill- ing off the Alabama coast is necessary or desirable. U.S. Rep. Jack Edwards of Mobile. the man whose constituency would most feel the effects of drilling oper- ations, wauld not even approach a stand on the matter. “In an effort to provide sufficient energy for this na- tion,\"’ Edwards said, “we are going to have to face up to the question of offshore drilling. The question which must be answered is whether there are sufficient pro- — devices available to prevent oil leakage and oil spills “I would not favor drilling in the Gulf or the bay (Mo- bile Bay) without proper protection,” he said. Gov. George C. Wallace and officials of the Alabama Development Office (ADO) responded to inquiries from the BML that they support offshore drilling, with only minor reservations. In Florida the situation is reversed. Gov. Reubin Askew and Sen. Lawton Chiles both have threatened law suits against the Interior Department to delay leasing until more environmental facts are avail- able, and Chiles is to announce Tuesday legislation that would give the three states involved a portion of the money gained from selling leases to oil companies. The rest of the revenue would finance research on al- ternative energy sources, such as solar energy, and the State share would be funnelled into monitoring offshore oil operations. Poor supervision by federal agencies has been a ma- jor criticism of environmentalists such as William Fut- rell, a University of Alabama law professor who wrote the national Sierra Club response to the federal leasing proposal. He was joined by the National Resources Defense Council, Inc., in citing federal studies which rapped the U.S. Geological Survey for failing to adequately inspect egulate oil company drilling. Last of a Series (Related story, Page 11) Exactly how great that hazard is, however, is an un- known factor and thus has been used to justify both op- position to and support of offshore drilling. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Manage- ment (BLM) admits in its environmental statement that it cannot accurately assess the full impact of drill- ing, except that it will be adverse—perhaps greatly damaging, but maybe only slightly detrimental. The BLM says no in-depth studies have been made in the wake of 25 years of drilling off the Gulf coasts of Louisiana and Texas, but assures that such analyses - will be on-going during the Mississippi-Alabama-Flor- ida (MAFLA) drilling. Opponents, including some high-placed Florida state officials, ask why the federal government can’t-wait un- til the petroleum industry comes up with better tech- nology to avoid polluting accidents and until further re- search can determine specific repercussions of deep- water drilling. Advocates say dwindling energy supplies mandate immediate exploration for more domestic oil. President Nixon, in fact, started the ball rolling last Futrell and others also criticized the BLM for failing to weigh the benefits of a six-months supply of oil—the amount expected from the offshore drilling in the east- ern Gulf—against the ‘‘costs of the environmental haz- ards only partially revealed” by the BLM. Some state officials issued concern over problems connected with drilling which are unique to Alabama. The offshore tracts to be leased would interfere with several proposed sites for a superport, according to the ADO. The BLM recognized the conflict, and said merely that it “‘must be identified as an unresolved issue.”’ Dr. John Moeller, executive director of the Amera- ‘port Corporation that is seeking to locate the superport off Alabama’s coast, noted another problem. Several tracts to be leased sit in the middle of six ship- ping safety fairways, which are the lanes ships traverse . on the way to coastal ports. Nothing is supposed to ob- struct these fairways, including oil drilling rigs. Jim Hart, executive director of the Alabama Petro- leum Council, said rigs may be placed in the fairways as long as they are lighted and marked on U.S. Coast Guard charts. A spokesman for the Coast Guard in Mobile, however, confirmed that regulations permit no structures in the fairways. Hart also cited numerous technological advances the petroleum industry has made since environmental tra- gedies, such as the Santa Barbara blowout, made off- shore oil drilling a national concern. Ecologists like Futrell continue to contend that in- dustry equipment and safety measures are inadequate a to assure protection of the environment. Unless the Interior ‘* .

Alabama officials, both congressional and on the state level, either have directly supported offshore drill- ing on the basis of energy problems, or have taken to the middle road of no opinion. ‘. US. Sen. James B. Allen, D-Ala., said he is ‘‘satisfied that exploration and development of oil resources in the Gulf of Mexico can be carried out without harm to the environment, if this is done within the confines of proper regulation and = supervision.’’ U.S. Rep. Bill Dickinson, the Republican who repre- sents the Second District, said in testimony before the BLM that he is ‘convinced that further exploration and utilization of oil reserves in this area is in the public in- terest and is definitely in order.” He urged the Interior Department to lease the Gulf ‘lands, mainly to decrease dependence on mideastern oil.

The new Code of Profes- sional Responsibility accept- ed by the bar's Board of Commissioners covers con- duct ranging from fee splitt- ing to activities of lawyer- legislators. The code must be ap- proved by the Alabama Su- preme Court before it may go into effect. ‘We're very proud of this,’ said bar President Ro- land Nachman in making public the code. ‘'It’s a prod- uct of long and hard work.” Nachman said the code is based much on the American Bar Association's code, which took effect in 1970, and was compiled by a state bar committee headed by Julian Harris of Decatur. \" Committees have been working to revise the bar's code since 1965. While various amendments have been made to it since that time, this is the first major + updating of the code. Nachman especially point- ed out the lengthy section re- garding activities of lawyers who hold other public office, such as legislative seats, not- ing that the State Supreme Court turned down similar rules several years ago. At that time, however, the measures were proposed as mandatory regulations, and the court suggested such rules should be drawn by the Alabama Legislature, not the bar. The section on lawyer-leg- islators in this code is classi- fied ‘‘ethical consid- era.ons,\"’ which means _at- torneys are not bound to ab- ide by them but should ‘‘as- pire’’ to meet them. Other sections fall under the category of ‘‘disciplinary rules.\" Lawyers who break these rules are subject to dis- ciplinary action such as dis- barment. One disciplinary rule gov- erning the conduct of public officials who are attorneys prohibits them from ‘‘ac- . cepting anything of value when the lawyer knows or it is obvious that the offer is for the purpose of influencing his action as a public offi- cial.’ One ethical consideration says that ‘‘under no circum- stances’ should a lawyer- legislator accept employ- ment by any group or associ- ation which has a primary interest in promoting or de- feating legislation. It apparently is directed at wide-spread criticism of leg- islators who accept retai- ners or are employed by spe- » Cial interest grou The provision governing fee-splitting, which Nach- man said is not as stringent as those in some other states, prohibits the division of fees with a non-partner unless the client consents. Fee-splitting has been a controversial matter here, especially in a recent case involving Gov. George Wal- lace’s brother Gerald and former Speaker of the House of Representatives Rankin Fite. Other sections of the pro- posed code severely limit publicity during criminal trials, including a prohibi- tion against making public ‘an. accused's prior criminal record, and require prose- cutors to inform the defend- ant or his attorney of any evi- dence uncovered which ne- gates the accused's guilt or mitigates the degree of the offense. Lawyers, their families or employes also are prohibited from posting bond. ROLAND NACHMAN November 17, 1973 \f"

Phillip LaMoreaux, super- visor for the State Oil and Gas Board, said Mallard Oil Co. reported this week that the Big Escambia Creek field now is expected to pro- duce 800 million cubic feet of natural gas, about double the amount originally antici- pated from the field. The company announced that new drilling caused the revised estimate, and also spurred plans to build the processing plant in western Escambia County, which is located in the south-central section of the state. “If we had a dozen or so fields like this in Alabama, and I think there’s every rea- son to believe there are, it would alleviate the present (energy) shortage,’’ La- Moreaux said. Exploration and devel- opment, being stepped up in response to the energy crisis, should result in the discovery of additional fields, he said. drilling turned up more gas reserves that will take two to five years to develop. About 20 wells will be drilled to a depth of some three miles. Cost of the total operation—wells and pro- cessing plant—will repre- sent an investment of $25 million, LaMoreaux said. Nine million cubic feet of gas and 765 barrels of con- densate oil (produced from condensing gas) should be produced from the field each day. _The $9 million plant is de- Signed to process 65 million cubic feet of gas a day, and that capacity can be doubled if necessary, LaMoreaux said. Also produced each day will be 4.000 barrels of dis- tillate oil and 1,000 barrels each -of propane, butane and ethane.; Jim Hart, executive direc- tor of the Alabama Petro- leum Council, said only 10 trillion cubic feet of the total consumed was produced in this country. The nation has been using more than has been pro- duced here since 1968, in part because federal regulations’ have kept the price of natu- ral gas low, and often un- profitable for companies to’ ‘produce. It is one of the most envi- ronmentally desirable fuels, and is thought to be in abun- dance in this country. Numerous pleas have been made to federal officials to raise the price ceiling on nat- ural gas to encourage more exploration, and action is being considered. November 21, 1973 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Solar Power May Help... But Not Now . By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Solar energy eventually may ease the energy pinch, but it won’t help immediate- ly nor will the sun come close to meeting the nation’s total energy needs. The viewpoint was ex- pounded by Dr. Reginald I. Vachon, an Auburn Univer- sity professor of mechanical engineering, during the school’s Conference on Tech- nology Assessment and En- vironmental Quality held here Thursday. Vachon, as did many other speakers, focused his re- marks on the energy crisis which is a prime example of how technology and environ- ment may conflict, but also may enhance each other through proper planning. Solar energy used to heat and cool buildings ‘‘offers the biggest promise to us, not to replace other fuels, but to relieve the burden on fossil fuels,’’ Vachon said. The country will remain dependent on oil and gas for much energy, he said, and foreign imports must in- crease in coming years un- less there is zero population growtir coupled with a dras- ti¢ change in life style. Nei- ther of these seems likely. Even if imports and other energy sources increase, so- lar power still will be neces- sary to meet the burgeoning demand for energy, Vachon said. Solar power is used only slightly now, and mostly in experimental situations. If research and development of the sun’s rays are stepped up considerably, to the point where solar energy is more readily available to the aver- age consumer, the sun still will supply less than 4 per cent of the country’s total: energy needs by the. year 2020, Vachon said. And it won't be a cheap proposition. Vachon said placing a_ so- lar heating system in an 1,800 square foot house under present technology would be a $4,000 initial investment. **I sound like I’m ‘talking against solar,’ he said, ‘‘but I want to convey a realistic concept.”’ Among solar energy’s fa- vorable points, Vachon list- ed the facts that -it is in- exhaustible, is in ample sup- ply and is widely available. Bad points include its not being continuous, such as on cloudy days, not being trans- portable without conversion to another form such as elec- tricity. and being in variable supply in different parts of the country. ‘*‘Solar energy isn’t going to be a panacea, it won’t bea- short term answer,’’ Vachon said. ‘‘But it will help.”’ . Addressing the conference luncheon, Gov. George C. Wallace directed his re- marks to ‘‘Progress Through Research.’’ November 30, ‘‘Research itself is cos- tly,’’ Wallace said, ‘‘but it also produces new tech- nology which can be applied to current problems.’’ As an example, he pointed to current research under- way in Alabama focusing on a process to remove sulfur from coal before it is burned. A major problem with coal burning is the sulfur dioxide released into the air as a pol- lutant. Other speakers at the day- long conference included John White, deputy regional administrator of the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency, William Harrison, vice president for research and development at South- ern Services Inc. in Birming- ham, Dr. Rowland Burns of Huntsville, president of the Alabama Conservancy, Wil- liam T. Willis, director of the Environmental Health Ad- ministration of the State Health Department, and Dr. M. Frank Hersman of the National Science Founda- tion. Their topics ranged from the need to change life styles in order to conserve energy to the necessity of better managing research by balancing conflicting con- cerns and by assuring that research information is siph- oned to the people who can utilize it for resolving prob- lems. he \f"

        "ocr_text": "Hardin As MH By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer State Finance Director Taylor Hardin officially was appointed and accepted the job as state mental health commissioner Thursday. Hardin will move from his Capitol office on Jan. 15, replacing Commissioner Charles Aderholt, who is re- Signing from the state’s top - mental health position to re- turn to private business. Hardin was appointed unanimously by the State Mental Health Board during a special afternoon meeting, just after the board’s selec- tion committee reported the finance director was its choice as a replacement for Aderholt. There was no discussion of | the committee’s recommen- dation, with the unanimous Named Chief vote coming immediately following the announcement from Carl Boley, chairman ‘of the selection committee. Board Chairman Jack No- len, Boley, and other mem- bers of the committee met earlier in the afternoon with Hardin, then with Gov. George Wallace, apparently to discuss the appointment. Hardin, who has been Wal- lace’s chief political and pol- icy advisor, reportedly leaves his cabinet position with the governor’s bless- ings. “The governor reluctantly let Gen. Hardin go,’ Nolen said after Hardin had been summoned to the meeting to receive official word of his appointment. Nolen, who served with the selection committee as an unofficial member, said it was decided to offer Hardin the job during the com- mittee’s Nov. 15 meeting in Birmingham. Hardin had not been aware he was being considered un- til that time, Nolen said, and the finance director's first reaction was one of ‘‘shock and surprise.” Nolen added that board members felt Hardin ‘‘could make a more lasting contri- bution to the state through the mental health depart- ment than in the position he has held for so long.” Hardin admitted it was “somewhat of a shock and Surprise that they (the selec- tion committee) would en- tertain the idea of my com- ing over here to join you, and that they would want me.” He would not have accept- ed the post, Hardin said, if Wallace had not given his ap- proval. “I come with the full un- derstanding, full blessing and full support of the gover- nor,’ Hardin said. He is expected to remain an influential advisor to Wal- lace while in the mental health department. ‘I do believe there are tre- mendous contributions one can make to the program,” Hardin said in accepting the job. “I do have a fairly good working knowledge of state government, and I know about administration and fi- nance.”’ He will, however, have to ‘learn some professional as- pects” of mental health op- erations, Hardin said. There has been specula- tion that Hardin in part agreed to accept the new po- sition to retain his standing aS a major general in the Na- tional Guard, which pays him about $5,000 a year. The ethics bill passed by the Alabama Legislature this fall prohibits cabinet members from receiving in- come from ‘“‘any other state, county, city or federal serv- ices agency or institution.” In addition, Hardin's sala- ry will increase from the present $19,800 a year to $32,500 annually. The change in command is the latest in a long series of major disruptions that has shaken the department in the past few years. It still is under federal court order to upgrade men- tal institutions, and is focus- ing on decentralization of services to decrease in- stitutional population. - The change in commis- sioners is the second in less than two years. Aderholt be- came commissioner after the board fired former chief Dr. Stonewall Stickney, whose administration of the department was beset with personnel and other prob- lems. December 14, 1973 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Greil Hospital Set As MH Facility - By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The State Mental Health Board agreed Thursday to take over Greil Memorial Hospital in Montgomery and convert it into a regional psy- chiatric hospital. Under the three-phase plan adopted by the board,. the former tuberculosis fa-. cility eventually should be expanded into a 200-bed mental hospital, with the price tag for conversion and expansion totalling nearly $4 million. In other action Thursday, the board voted to raise the salary of its new commis- sioner, Taylor Hardin, from the $32,500 a year earned by his predecessor to $45,000 an- nually. Hardin officially be- came commissioner Wednesday. The Greil plan still hinges on formal action by the pri- vate hospital’s board of trustees, but a spokesman said Greil's trustees have agreed to deed the $2 million facility to the Mental Health Board with the stipulation it revert to the trustees if aban- doned by the state. The spokesman said he ex- pects ‘‘no difficulty’ in com- ‘pleting the transaction. Greil essentially has been phased out of existence as a tuberculosis hospital by the State Health Department, which has stopped funding it and several similar facilities in order to concentrate tu- berculosis treatment in re- gional centers. The first development phase calls for, converting the 50-bed main hospital building into a psychiatric unit by fall. Patients would be drawn from Montgomery, Autauga and Elmore coun- ties. Several older buildings on the 14acre site on Upper We- tumpka Road are to be razed, and, if funds are available, a new kitchen and dining building will be added at an estimated cost of $200,000. In the second phase a 50-bed addition will be built, and a 100-bed addition in the third phase. No timetable has been developed, since January 18, 1974 the additions would come as money is available. The hospital eventually is expected to serve an 11-coun- ty area, with the expansion bringing Lowndes Butler, Crenshaw, Pike, Bullock, Macon, Lee and Russell counties into the service re- gion. The Greil proposal, sub- mitted to the board by Depu- ty Commissioner Dr. Clark Case, cites ‘‘a need for addi- tional short-term care and a critical need for services for children and adolescents’’ in this region. In addition, an average of 14 persons needing psy- chiatric care are placed in area jails for seven to ten days each month, with serv- ices provided by the Mont- gomery Mental Health Cen- ter. These patients, some awaiting transfer to Bryce Hosptital in Tuscaloosa, will be placed in Greil instead of jailed. The proposal also notes that a regional facility in Montgomery fits into the board’s overall scheme of decentralization keeping patients in smaller commu- nity facilities rather than sending them far from home to the major state in- stitutions. It is envisioned, too, that Greil could become a ‘“‘pilot facility’ used to develop new programs since it is close to department headquarters in the Capitol City. Although the State Board of Health initially suggested the Mental Health Board in- vestigate the possibility of converting some former tu- berculosis hospitals into psy- chiatric units, the specific proposal for Bryce came from the Montgomery Men- tal Health Association last August. Association Executive Di- rector Mrs. Louise Reynolds said Thursday the group's members ‘‘are delighted’ with the board's action and “feel this is one of the best things that has happened in the field of mental health.” She said Montgomery area patients now “are housed in the very oldest, worst build- ing in Bryce Hospital. It’s de- ‘pressing up there,”’ she said, “depressing for the patients and for the staff. The whole Structure is permeated with those horrible institutional odors.’ Not only will patients’ families be closer—both to visit and obtain help them- selves in dealing with prob- lems of the mentally ill—but area volunteers will be able to better serve the patients, rs. Reynolds said. She also spoke of the Mont- gomery Area Mental Health Authority having an oppor- tunity to ‘‘make Montgom- ery a model city in mental health services.\" “I honestly believe that if we have a model here in the community, the legislators can see what can be done and would be more apt to appro- priate funds for similar pro- grams,’’ Mrs. Reynolds said. \f"

Gen. Bill Baxley told more than 100 political types gath- ered here Saturday for his honesty workshop. The two-hour ses- sion, held to explain the state's Corrupt Practices Act, was conducted by Baxley and two assistants, George Royer and Bill Step- hens, who late last: year won and statewide organizations charged with violating the act. Baxley emphasized the meeting was called “‘to help you so you can comply with the law,’ and wasn’t meant as a warning of extensive in- vestigations by his office. ‘We're not going to play super-snoop and check on ev- erybody running in this elec- tion,’ he said.

        "ocr_text": " Demo Women Deal Seen By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer BIRMINGHAM—A reso- lution to split the Democrat- ic State Executive Com- mittee’s membership evenly between men and women re- portedly will be offered at Saturday's committee meet-. ing, but the move is seen by women party faithful here as a lip service proposal. State Party Chairman Robert Vance has verbally supported the idea of elec- ting two committee mem- bers from each of 105 legisla- tive districts, one man and one woman from each dis- trict, but he has taken no con- crete steps to translate the idea into reality. And Democratic women, who are pushing hard for in- creased representation on the committee that seats only a small handful of wom- en now, aren't counting on Vance or anyone else to bring a 50-50 ratio to the par- ty councils. While female party lead- ers all want more women in decision-making roles, they are split among themselves over how to achieve greater representation. One group, supporters of Vance who are led by Dot Little of Huntsville, are hop- ing for an enlarged com- mittee with three additional women nominated by them- selves but finally approved by the committee. Another group of pre- dominantly Jefferson Coun- ty women agree with the three-woman expansion idea but want the women elected from the ranks of the Feder- ation of Democratic Women by federation members. These women, mostly members of a Jefferson County Democratic Wom- en's Club (there are four such clubs is the county), say they have been ignored by Vance and his people and feel women will have no sig- nificant voice in the party unless they elect their own committee members. Vance is under pressure not only from Alabama women, but from the Nation- al Democratic Committee, to assure more representa- tion of women, as well as blacks and young people. This is the thrust of the na- tional body’s requirement for affirmative action plans in which states outline how they will actively recruit leaders from those traditi- onally under-represented groups. The affirmative ac- tion plan replaces the con- troversial quota system un- der which the states selected delegates to the national con- vention of 1972. As long as six months ago Vance did toss out the idea of a state party composed of half women and half men, parallel to the national com- mittee composition in which a man and woman come from each state. He privately suggested the idea at an Atlanta hearing held by the national com- mittee’s delegate selection committee, It was this group that later proposed the af- firmative action plan. His sentiment was echoed then by Mrs. Little, whom he appointed as party vice chairman in charge of wom- en's affairs. Since that time, however, Vance has made no public mention of the 50-50 proposi- tion, and his 17-page propos- al for state party rules changes does not contain such a plan. Party rules call for all prior to the meeting, and this Suggestion has not been for- mally distributed. It could come, however, in the form of a proposal that was circulated in advance of the meeting. February 2, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Propane Gas Prices Take Big Jump By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer In January of 1973 Mr. and Mrs. Paul Somers paid 22 cents a.gallon for propane gas to heat their Pike Road home. One year later, the cost of propane heat had inne oe a gallon, The Somers’ still aren’t sure Wi y. ae) “ ‘ ‘ Their dilémma is similar to that faced by thousands of . rural “Alabamians, and millions of propane gas users across ' the: country. Pee “I'm not complaining about it myself,” Mrs., Somers said, “but out -here-on: Pike Road many people are on “pensions or social security or welfare, and I don't know what the answer is going to be for them.” Some answers will be sought this week when the ‘ board of directors of the National Liquified Petroleum Gas Association meets in Point Clear to discuss this and : other ‘matters of concern to the propane dealers who Supply, rural tesidents with the energy to warm their homes, cook their-food and heat their water, Consumers like Mr..and Mrs, Somers say they have asked: their local supplier about the dramatic increase ‘in propane costs, and ‘believe the dealer isn’t raking in the extra $20 or more they're paying him each month for The money isn't skimmed off the top by retail sup- pliers, since they are bound by federal regulations pro- hibiting them from making a penny more profit per gal- Jon than they earned in May of 1973. Where the money apparently is going, according to Claude Allison, is the major oil companies. Allison, executive director of the Alabama LP Gas As- sociation, said about 35 per cent of the propane used in this state comes from crude oil, and the oil industry has jacked up the price of propane. . Since the price of crude also has risen, Allison said, an increase in propane costs is only fair, But the incredse hasn't been proportionate, he said. “We feel they (the oil companies) are told not to put so much of an increase on gasoline, diesel and fuel oil,” Al- lison said. Since federal officials are putting pressure on the ma- jors to keep down the price of these other petroleum products, Allison theorized, the oil companies are mak- ing up the difference by raising propane prices a dis- proportionate amount. “We need a rollback,” Allison said. The association, along with similar groups in other states, has started a campaign urging Congress to take action. On Sunday Allison and Jamie Rainier of Roanoke, president of the Alabama association, met in Birming- ham with U.S. Sen. Jim Allen (D-Ala.), “He (Allen) assured us he was very much aware of this problem and concerned about the hardship caused the rural people,”’ Allison said, “He told Jamie and my- self this would be the first priority in his work when he gets back to Washington,” The association also has contacted Alabama's other congressmen, and is urging the state's 300,000 propane customers to do the same. William Simon, head of the new federal Energy Of fice, did hand down a directive several days ago that limits the amount propane prices may be increased, But Allison said this is not enough, that propane costs need to be dropped, There is little the association or propane consumers can do except communicate the problem to federal offi- cials, since no state agencies regulate propane prices. The State Energy Management Board has no say in these prices, and the Alabama Public Service Commis: sion, which has been receiving many inquiries, also is powerless to act. February 5, 1974 \f"

Wallace Vows to Keep Peace Patrol Beefs Up To Curb Violence By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Increasing acts of violence related to the nationwide truckers’ strike were reported in the state Wednesday, but the relative calm of southern Alabama was punce luated by only one serious shooting incident, Alabama Pubiic Safety Director Col, £.C. Dothard cancelled all leaves and off days for state troopers, and beefed up patrol personnel with officers from the Stat Conservation Department, Alabama Marine Police, and Alcoholic Beverage Control Board agents, Gov, George C. Wallace, in a brief televised address Wednesday night, said he ‘‘shall use all other means” necessary {0 preserve the peace and protect the lives and property of Alabamians, He apparently referred to the possibility of activating the Alabama National Guard to patrol the state's highways, Wallace announced he also had sent a second tele fram to President Richard Nixon, following up a sims ilar missive to Washington Tuesday, asking the federal government to give “immediate relief” to the striking independent truckers, if “We shall prevent violence and make the highways Safe for those who want to travel them and haul goods,” Wallace said, Meanwhile, US, Rep, John Buchanan of Birmingham sent a telegram to Wallace urging the governor to call out the National Guard to protect truck transports. By late Wednesday, troopers had made 11 arrests in connection with trucking violence, all in north Ala- bama. Additional police personnel also were being con-’ centrated in the troubled northern sectors, Dothard appealed to Alabamians to “exercise cal- mness and restraint,” and said troopers have been in- structed “to be especially alert for anything that could led to violence, and without exception to make arrests on the spot.” In the one incident about 15 miles south of Montgom- | ery, an unidentified truck driver apparently was shot at twice while travelling toward the city on I-65 near the Tyson. exit, An employe of a nearby roadside restaurant sald the came in the restaurant about 11 a.m., uninjured but “shook up.” The employe, Don Griffin, said the two shots came through the right fender and at least one entered the truck’s cab, narrowly missing the driver. The driver was not a professional trucker, Griffin said, but was transporting a piece of equipment to Mont: gomery for repair. ; No arrest had been made in the shooting incident Wednesday night. Although no other serious acts of violence were re- ported in this area, the diminished numbers of truckers on the road were taking precautions. Many were observed traveling in pairs or even in packs of five or six rigs, and trucking traffic reportedly was slight during night-time hours. At an open truck stop and cafe in Prattville, a waitress said most truck drivers are not traveling after dark, and that already had filed up telwed to crows the och another truck stop off 1-45 north of that city was closed.

The truckers’ spokesmen, meeting in the offices of the Alabama Energy Manage- ment Board here, were se- questered earlier in the day with Harry Pennington, Gov.

Two truckers at the night- time meeting said that any agreement to end the shut- (See Related Stories, down would have to be ac- cepted by their fellow stri- kers in home cities before re sults would be seen. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the oil industry said a continued strike would leave the gasoline situation in Ala- bama in a ‘‘critical’’ state by Monday. Jim Hart, executive direc- tor of the Alabama Petro- leum Council, said pickets at fuel terminals reduced gaso- line deliveries to between 15 and 50 per cent of the norm in north Alabama on Friday, and deliveries from Mont- gomery south were holding at about 70 per cent. It was reports of shooting and rock and bottle throwing incidents in 15 counties late Thursday and on Friday that prompted the call for the Na- tional Guard. Wallace said the guard Emergency Operation Cen- ter (EOC) in Montgomery also would be activated, and that local guard command- ers throughout the state were being directed to con- tact local officials to deter- mine whether emergency conditions’ exist. Gen. Rollo said the EOC is the command control center activated in any emergency. State troopers and guards- men will work in teams to guard convoys of trucks that are rolling, Rollo said, and generally will ‘‘see that trucks are moving on the highways.”’ They will travel in regular federal sedans and jeeps, Pages 5. 15) and some wreckers may be involved in the operation, Rollo said. He said it has been about five years since the guard was called out to ‘‘help Keep the law,’’ although units have been activated in natu- ral disasters such as last year’s’ flooding. The series of truckers’ meetings throughout the day had brought no concrete re sults by late Friday, al- though Ray Miller of Phenix City said he hoped informa- tion from Washington, re- ceived through the gover- nor’s office, would induce strikers to get back on the road. ‘““‘Whether we’re going to succeed tonight or not de- Pends on how good we Present this story (from Washington),’’ Miller said. “‘All we can do is hope the people we represent will go along with us.’’ J.D.

The smattering of unfriendly signs raised over Big Springs International Park were vastly outnumbered by ban- ~ ners of support for the President who has been the target of hostile comment for ‘months. - Tf Richard Nixon came to Alabama for warm reinforcement of his patriotic values on this national holiday, he came to-the right place, = - ; But the men charged with ferreting out malcontents waiting to aim more than hostility at the President took no chances that all spectators were here to wish Nixon well. For days, Secret Service agents have been organizing security measures in conjunction with state, county, and city lawmen. By 8 a.m., Huntsville city police were checking every crevice and corner of the few tall buildings with a vantage point over the park. At the Russell Erskine Hotel, they in- vestigated every room on the 12 floors, and suggested that occupants wouldn't be wise to open their windows for a high- level glimpse of the ignitary. Police also ringed streets leading to the park, and perched atop multistory buildings for a sweeping view of the ground through powerful binoculars. But no major incidents requiring plo-’ lice action were visible, so the officers’ main task was keeping the thousands of spectators moving into the park in an or- derly fashion. And the crowd was orderly, even the two dozen members of the Impeach Nix- on Committee. . These few walked through the crowd’ Soliciting signatures for impeachment petitions to be sent fo Alabama congress- men, but they gained little more than several hundred names and at least as many unfriendly glares. They were supported by another few dozen sign carriers, mostly teen-agers who wielded cardboard placards with slogans such as ‘‘Dethrone King Rich- ard,” or ‘Impeach Nixon Before he Lies Again.” On opposite sides were the thousands of yellow printed pennants: bearing the words, ‘‘God Loves America, God Loves Nixon, Support Our President.” The great majority of well-wishers, many of them large families with picnic lunches, hardly took note of the protest- ing youths. They began arriving as early as six hours before the first strains of country music signalled the program’s begin- ning at about 11:30 a.m., and they stayed until the very end when Nixon was whis- - ked from the speaker’s platform for his ‘journey back to the nation’s capital. One father pushed his blonde-haired daughter to the front line for a glimpse of the vanishing President. “There he is, honey,” the panting fa- ther cried. ‘‘That’s our President.” February 19, 1974 \f"

With raised fists, Wallace repeatedly told a crowd of some 700 supporters, ‘‘You are getting more attention than you ever got before,’’ and repeatedly drew hearty applause from the faithful who were crammed into a lo- cal armory. In thanking the crowd for its strong support, Wallace also noted that he had re- ceived endorsements from a Mobile newspaper and from the Building and Construc- tion Trades Council, one of the larger Alabama unions. Wallace pledged to get Mo- bilians in 1975 the $115 mil- lion bond issue for docks im- provement that the Legisla- ture failed to approve last year, and talked of renewed effort to secure more federal money to complete the in- terstate highway system through this city. For the first time on the campaign trail,. the combo accompanying Wallace swung into a jazzed up ver- sion of Dixie at the beginning and end of the rally, amd the Confederate flag waved all the harder. Few blacks were seen here, but the campaign rally in Monroeville earlier in the day drew a high percentage of blacks in the crowd of per- haps 400 people. Wallace held up well in the 83-degree mid-afternoon sun that beat down on the court- house grounds in Monroe- in view ville, one of the larger South- west Alabama communities. Beads of sweat popped out from the governor’s face, but he showed no signs of wil- ting. . In Monroeville, Wallace geared his talk to the small town dweller, noting how he, too, grew up in the country and knew first hand of the need for education and health services—which he promised to deliver in the next four years. Returning to the theme of Alabama's new national po- litical prominence, the gov ernor said, ‘‘I’d like to be your governor again and give them (national politi- cians) a chance to make their pilgrimage to Mecca. We'll open the doors to the political church.”’ After his speech Wallace remained on the speaker’s stand for a lengthy hand- shaking session, but the per- sonal contact was elimi- nated in Mobile so he could make a short, unexpected ‘appearance at a countrv- western concert. On Saturday, Wallace campaigns in Troy and Doth an. March 30, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Wallace in Rare Form By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer DOTHAN-—George Corley Wallace began spitting a few sparks again Saturday, rail- ing against federal bureau- crats and leaving little doubt that he still wants to to hold a prominent place on the na- tional scene in 1976. The networks television cameras in Troy and the rousing crowd may have warmed the governor to his topic, but, whatever the cause, Wallace was possibly more animated and forceful than he has been since five bullets struck him down and paralyzed the lower half of his body nearly two years ago. His campaign for a third term as governor took Wal- lace to an outdoor rally in Troy where about 500 people heard his remarks, and to the Farm Center in this city later in the evening. The Dothan appearance was the first true campaign rally since Wallace officially kicked-off stumping March 24, with a maximum of 2,500 people frequently in- terrupting his talks by loud applause and cheers. The most riotous reception in both places was withheld until Wallace picked up Steam and lit into his critics or the federal government. The governor's remarks about his adminstration ac- complishments were re- ceived with polite attentive- ness, When Wallace addressed critics ‘‘who have called us red-necks and everything else,’’ he won the wildest rece responses. “TI don’t say I'm running for president in 1976,” Wal- lace said, assuring his Doth- an audience he wants only to be their governor. But I want to tell those critics that if I think it’s in the best interest of Ala- bama,” he said, “I’11 run in 1976 whether they like or not.”’ Wallace, as in past rallies, repeatedly told the crowd that the attention he has won nationally has been for the good of this state, since the faithless, nameless bureau- crats’’ in Washington now listen when he tells them of labamians’ needs. | ‘A governor ought to be in a position to talk about na- ional affairs,” he said to a ound of applause. ‘Anyone ho doesn't, isn't a full-time governor.” Also as he has done in pre- ious appearances, Wallace assurred his listeners tha his administration has been honest—appararently re- ferring to scandals that have copped up throughout his years in office. “Every single dollar that has been spent, as far as I am concerned, has been spent honestly,’’ Wallace said. “If you elect me _ again, you'll have four more years of honest government in Montgomery.” March 31, 1974 \f"
