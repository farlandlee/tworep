Listening from Basir Khel, a village in the hills 10 miles away, I clocked the heavy booms at an average of one every five seconds. In the sky, two Russian-built helicopters could be seen circling high above the green plains where the tanks were firing. Every 15 minutes or so, there was the pow-pow of a . heavy machine gun. Guerrillas were vainly shooting at the helicopters. That night — April 15 — clanking like that of tank treads could be heard in the distance. By morning, the tanks were gone. These were the sounds of the major Soviet spring offensive that thundered throughout this nation of 13.5 million people that serves as a hinge between Russia, Iran and Pakistan. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the offensive has featured rebel strength along a critical 50- mile stretch of highway that runs north from Kabul toward the Soviet border. From a military standpoint, the main problem for the Soviet com- manders is finding targets in the Shomali worth destroying. It is a land of wheat fields, mulberry trees and apple orchards, bordered by picture- postcard mountains. The guerrillas periodically raid supply trucks on the highway. But they have no fixed firing positions, no tanks, no heavy equipment, no fuel dumps. The main military target here is the big Bagram Air Force Base, already a Russian bastion. Instead of military targets, the tanks bombard villages near points where the rebels have fired anti-air- craft guns or anti-tank rockets. Perhaps there are places in the Shomali where the guerrillas are being pounded into submission. But I didn’t encounter any. After my 500-mile journey into Af- ghanistan, reporters in India were told by Western diplomats that the Russian attacks in the Shomali were perhaps the ‘‘most savage’’ of the Af- phan war. savage aerial bombing, concentrated near Herat and west of Kabul, Western analysts said. Here in the Shomali region, the main thrusts by the Russian and Afghan army forces have been tank assaults, Resulting press reports spoke of refugees from Shomali streaming into Kabul to escape the bombard- ment in late April and early May. A diplomatic report from Kabul was cited as having ‘‘detected a note of desperation” Vors. No doubt a good many refugees reached Kabul, and no doubt some of them were desperate. Yet when I Passed along the main north-south - infiltration paths through the Shomali on April 16-17 and April 27-28, I did not see anything resembling a stream of refugees.

In Deh Bavy, 100 men, women and children were killed in mid-April by the Russian bombardment, guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud told me.

Here, in the second of a series, he examines the ground war being waged between the commu- nists and U.S.-backed insurgents. sometimes backed by helicopter gunships and fighter- bombers. The Russian objective in this region is to eradicate See AFGHANISTAN, Page 6-A Among farmers, and guerhas living in the Shormali, I ound an amalgam of pride, Islamic religious fervor, defiance and fatalis-— tic optimism. “The only thing they have is heli- copters, tanks and guns,’ said Haya- tullah Sharifi, 35. a rebel leader. ““They don’t have the support of the people.’”’ The several dozen Shomrmali guerril- las I met were under the impression that the Russian enemies were taking heavy losses. They may have been claiming more downed planes and blown-up tanks than were actually destroyed. Wet they clearly were per- suaded by their claims. In Baltu Khel, a village in the cer - ter of a main Shomali wheat-growing valley, guerrilla commando Abdul Mubin ran to fetch me his M-72 rocket launcher. Mubin said he per- sonally knocked out two Soviet tanks with it the day before.

He said he hoped to kill five more Russians before the day was over. In the~half-dozen Shomali villages through which I trekked, the villagers were quick to provide my guerrilla guides with food, shelter and safe passage. My guides made no secret of the fact that I was an American journal- ist. There was never any indication that word of my unauthorized jour- mey had reached Afghan or Soviet au- thorities. Even with an estimated 105,000 troops, the Russians cannot physi- cally occupy all the villages of Af- ghanistan, where perhaps 80 percent of Afghans live. Village society remains largely in- tact throughout much of the country, not because of any tender-hearted- mess by the Russians, but because village life is so primitive. Shells and bombs punch holes in mud houses, but the walls seldom col- lapse. Few houses have glass windows. None of the villages ever had elec- tricity, telephones, running water or sewer lines that could be smashed. Typically, a village is a self-con- tained unit of a few extended fami- lies, with its own wheat fields, small granaries and a place to draw water. A village can be decimated without having much direct effect on another village only 10 miles away. Nevertheless, there are large stretches of Afghanistan, such as Logar province, south of Kabul, where Soviet bombs have driven virtually everyone away. What is remarkable is that so many other Afghans have remained in their home villages. They hide in caves when the bombs are falling and otherwise live a near-normal life. By State Department estimates, 20 percent of the pre-war Afghan popu- lation has fled abroad to refugee camps In Pakistan and Iran. The other 80 percent have stayed in Af- ghanistan. Some have escaped the bombs by moving to Kabul or to other cities controlled, with Soviet help, by the government. The communists’ Shomali cam- Paign began in early April when a column of some 100 tanks started north from Kabul. After traveling 30 miles, the tanks were ambushed by local guerrillas near the Bagram Air Force Base, ac- cording to Massoud and other rebels. The guerrillas planted captured land mines in the road and fired shoulder-launched RPG-7 anti-tank rockets. Three days of sustained fighting ensued before the tanks slug- ged northward toward the Salang Tunnel — which leads through the Hindu Kush toward the Soviet border. As the tanks returned south past the Bagram Air Base about 10 ys later, guerrillas launched a second ambush. it counterattack against the second am- bush that I had heard on April 15.

The guerrillas specialize in bushwhacking tank columns, raiding Afghan army garrisons, blowing up power lines and assassinating agents of KhAD, the Afghan se- cret police.

A few SA-7s have been fired by the guerrillas in the past. I saw none. Western diplomats in Islamabad hint that the United States has re- frained from supplying heavier, more modern equipment out of deference for Pakistan’s desire to limit the Af- ghan fighting. Among the most effective guerrilla weapons are land mines. I saw no evidence that any were being im- ported. Rather, the guerrillas use wooden pitchforks to dig up mines the Soviet forces plant around the pe- es of Soviet and Afghan army jases. In the Panjshir Valley, guerrillas destroyed at least a dozen tanks or armored personnel carriers last year by planting captured mines in their paths at night. “We destroy their tanks in such a way that they cannot find the pieces,” crowed insurgent strategist Mohammed Es’Haq — saying guer- BAGHLAN ———— Province Boundary All Weather Rood 25 + 1 Kilometers rilla demolition squads often wrap 100 pounds of dynamite around a mine to make sure a tank that runs over it is demolished. “It has a good psychological ef- fect,” Es’'Haq noted.

After six Soviet campaigns against Massoud’s soldiers since 1980, the narrow, 75-mile-long Panjshir is littered with the wrecks of at least 17 Soviet tanks, 29 trucks and a dozen planes and helicopters. The guerrillas claim more than 1,000 Soviets died trying to seize the Panjshir. Green Islamic flags mark the graves of 180 dead guerrillas, Another roughly 1,400 Panjshir Valley villagers also have been killed. Twenty-two Afghans have had limbs amputated after stepping on mines. Throughout the carnage, Massoud has stayed to fight while the nominal heads of the six Afghan resistance groups based their activities in Pakistan. He has mobilized virtually all the 100,000 men, women and children in the Panjshir to the anti-Soviet resistance, collecting his own taxes and running his own schools and food-rationing sys- tem. Using captured Soviet trucks, he has even organized daily bus service in the valley. In March, Massoud took his most con- troversial step: He completed a private cease-fire agreement with the Soviet mili- tary command in Kabul. Soviet tanks and soldiers withdrew from their base at Rokha, in the central Panjshir. Massoud agreed that the Soviets could temporarily keep a similar base at Anowa, in the lower Panjshir, so long as they and their Afghan army allies re- frained from contact with Panjshir people. Some Western diplomats in India have called Massoud’s deal a political and mili- tary victory for Moscow. Massoud says it is a guerrilla victory. In either case, the cease-fire was ‘‘temporary” and fighting may well resume in midsummer, after the Islamic feast of Ramadan.

Guerrilla Abdul Halik, 13, was among the lucky ones. When I passed through his village in the Shomali re- Zion, he was on guard duty _ carrying a rmuzzle- loader. The guerrillas often use boys to carry messages or procure supplies. Experience has shown that boys and old men are seldom stopped at Russian checkpoints as long as they are unarmed. Boys are not required to carry identity cards. But males from 15 to 45 risk being shot or drafted into the Afghan army whenever they venture across Russian lines.

The feud around Trelay, like others that have spattered the Afghan landscape since the Red Army marched in, are symptoms of a -major weakness in the Afghan resistance move- ment. Instead of joining hands, the guerrillas fight as hundreds of independent village-scale units. Guerrillas within Afghanistan maintain merely loose affiliations with the six major re- sistance factions headquartered across the bor- der in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province. As a result, the Russians have never had to confront a disciplined force, such as the North Vietnamese who fought so well against Ameri- can troops in Vietnam. In Pakistan, Afghan AFGHANISTAN: THE TINO FACES OF WAR two rival guerrilla factions over control of an infiltration route, Sadly for the resistance movement, the Soviet inva: iam sion has thrown gasoline on centuries-old feuds that set tribe against tribe, village against village, ethnic Tajiks i against ethnic Pashtuns, Shiite Moslems against Sunni Moslems, and even pro-Lranian Shiites against independent Shiites, Reconciliation won't come easily. Afghans by the resistance leaders periodically announce forma- tion of common fronts. But so far none of these efforts has succeeded in quelling the factional bloodshed. Hawani, about 30, was commander of a vil- lage guerrilla unit loyal to the Afghan Islamic Party, or Hezb-i-Islami Afghanistan. His nomi- nal leader was a Pushtun engineer named Gul- buddin Hekmatyar, who lives in Pakistan, beyond radio or telephone contact with the unit. The other guerrilla, about 17, was a foot soldier in a unit affiliated with the Afghan Islamic Society, or Jamiat-i-Islami Afghanistan. Jamiat's leader, a Tajik professor named Syed Burhanuddin Rabbani, is also based in Pakistan and also has no daily control of events here. “I don’t know whether Jamiat or Hezb started it (the fighting around Trelay), but whichever started it, it is bad for Islam,” said SEE Afghan 144 ® ba at) JOSEPH ALBRIGHT/Special thousands now have Kalashnikovs instead of muzzle load: \\EBEL INFIGHTING: Town ‘Jamiat' leader, Atlanta Journal- Constitution June 19, 1983 \fMohammed Anwar, a Jamiat regional com- mander whose turf lies 35 miles to the south. “It is not helping the jihad (holy war).” Anwar says: “I think some of the Hezbi commanders belong to the KGB: I think they take money. Gulbeddin is a good Moslem, but some of his commanders are not trustworthy.” At the Hezb headquarters on a back street in Peshawar, Pakistan, Hezbi guerrillas make contrary claims. “You know that Massoud (a major Jamiat commander) is close to the enemy,” said Mutawaza, 33, a Hezb spokesman. “I think some agents from the government of Afghanistan have been sneaking into Jamiat.” Bothassertions may be accurate. Western intelligence analysts say the brightest graduates of the Afghan army military academy are sometimes sent back to guerrilla-held villages, claiming to be deserters, to spy and cause dis- sention among insurgents. Throughout Afghanistan, Hezb and Jamiat are thought to rank first and second in numbers of armed guerrilla fighters. Both factions are composed of fundamentalist Sunni Moslems. Members of both pray to Mecca five times daily. They are ardent anti-communists and hope to convert Afghanistan into an Islamic republic. Yet such is their mutual mistrust that even in regions where they are not killing each other, they seldom form local alliances to fight the Russians. Anwar is one of the exceptions, since he has reached a working arrangement to fight alongside the neighboring Hezb unit. Struggle for strategic post The two guerrillas in Trelay were shot in the latest skirmish of a two-year struggle to control a 10-mile stretch of footpath leading north toward the Panjshir Valley, a guerrilla stronghold dominated by Jamiat forces. To guerrillas operating in the Panjshir, the path has the relative strategic importance that the Panama Canal has to the United States. It is the means by which they smuggle in guns and ammunition from Pakistan. Jamiat forces in the Panjshir were nearly wiped out last fall when a Hezb unit north of Trelay successfully blockaded the infiltration When a Jamiat ammunition caravan at- tempted to sneak through, Hezbi soldiers contfis- cated all the ammunition, refusing to allow any- thing to reach the besieged forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the Jamiat commander in the Panjshir. “Yes, we did that,” said Mutawaza, 33, the Hezbi Islami administrator for Parwan Prov- ince. In an interview at his backstreet headquar- ters in Peshawar, Pakistan, Mutawaza offered this explanation: ‘At that time, Massoud’s peo- ple were fighting with us, and that ammunition was very dangerous for us, actually.” Shortage of ammunition, food During the Hezb blockade Massoud’s guer- rillas were battling a column of Soviet and Af- ghan army tanks which had invaded the Panjshir last September. “We had a shortage of ammunition,” Mas- soud told me. “We had the enemy surrounded but the mujahideen could not attack. The Rus- sians were able to dig themselves into fixed positions.” Massoud also found his main food supply route choked off by Hezbi bands to the north, who controlled a vital pass leading to the grain- growing region around Andarab. At one point last fall, Panjshir guerrillas fought for a week on rations of one-half kilo- gram of potatoes a day. Later, when the snow got deep in Decem- ber, the Russians began a de facto cease-fire in the Panjshir. In a few days, Massoud ordered his soldiers to also stop shooting. The Panjshir cease-fire has continued through the spring, bolstered in March by a ne- gotiated truce between Massoud and a Soviet official — which included a partial withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Panjshir. Truce linked to Russian ties Hezbi officials took the truce as proof that Massoud is “close to the Russians,” as Muta- waza put it. Even some of Massoud’s admirers believe Massoud hurt the guerrilla cause when he agreed to the truce. “If there is no fighting in the Panjshir, it is bad for all Afghanistan,” Anwar, his fellow commander, said. “It means there are more Russian soldiers free to go elsewhere.” With the Russians quiet for the moment, Massoud and his Jamiat allies have used the cease-fire to settle scores and consolidate thei supply routes. To the north, his guerrillas have killed o driven out the Hezb units that pinched off his food supplies from Anderab last winter while to the south, his ammunition caravans have bee passing through the Trelay region with onl occasional resistance from Hezb units. Toll in factional rivalry In the village of Basir Khel, about 10 miles north of Trelay, Mahamad Managol, the Jamia commander, ticked off the names of eight Hezb unit commanders he said have been killed i Hezbi-Jamiat fighting since January. One Jamiat commander has also been killed, he said. Managol displayed a pad of Hezb statio ery with a reddish-brown bloodstain on one side He said he found it in the pocket of a deac Hezbi commander named Asap three week: earlier. Managol said he or someone else in hi unit fired the Kalashnikov bullet that fellec Asap. rap 22-year-old Hezbi guerrilla, Ahmac Shapoor, claimed in a subsequent interview i Pakistan that Jamiat soldiers broke into hi unit’s camp and gunned down seven Hezbi guer: rillas. He said the ambush happened in Janua or February at 11 in the morning in a village he called Bako Khan, which he said was near the southern entrance to the Panjshir. “They linec them up and shot them,” said Shapoor, who saic he escaped in the confusion. Massoud hoped much of the factiona rivalry could be settled peacefully through ne gotiations, saying: “The root of most of the difficulties comes from tribal and personal con flicts among local people which later took the form of party conflicts.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 19, 1983 (Continued) \f"

In the center of town, several hundred yards away, is an open marketplace the size of several football fields. On Sunday, when the journalists ar- rived, it was the weekly shopping and swapping day, and the market was packed with several thousand Chadians, along with camels, goats, chickens, motorbikes and Japanese-made pickup trucks, Mohammad M’Boudou, an 18-year-old student, was asked near the dried food stalls whether he expected the Libyans to Atlanta Constitution - reach Massakori. “T hope it will not be,” he said.

In the town of Massaguet, 49 miles north of N'Djamena, there is a small bri- gade headquarters where a few soldiers were serving as policemen.

        "ocr_text": "to go ashore By Joseph Albright Cox News Service WITH THE U.S. NAVY OFF BEIRUT — If an order came from Washington, another 2,000 Marines could begin landing in Beirut within two hours, Marine officers said Tuesday. Even as the Marines encamped near the Beirut airport were paying tribute to two com- rades killed in shelling attacks last week, their potential reinforcements were getting their weapons ready aboard ships five miles off the Lebanese coast. Aboard the amphibious ship U.S.S. Tarawa, Marine Major Robert Beaudoin, 35, of Acton, Mass., told visiting reporters: “If they tell us to go, we can go within a matter of hours.” He said it would take as little as two hours to land the first wave of Marine reinforcements and another three hours to put all 2,000 extra Marines ashore. The Tarawa and two sister ships, the Du- luth and the Frederick, were rushed here last week’ from their normal assignment in the Pacific Ocean because the Navy had no Marines to spare in the Atlantic Fleet. Navy officers could not recall the last time the Navy had to dig “ deeply into its Pacific Fleet in response to a flareup in the Mediterranean.

Aboard the Tarawa are six Marine short- takeoff-and-landing jets called Harriers equip- ped with Zuni air-to-ground missiles. The Harriers are similar to the Royal Air Force model Harriers that Britain used successfully in the Falklands War with Argentina. Marine offi- cers said the Marine Harriers could be launched on five minutes’ notice and sent to knock out artillery batteries in the mountains overlooking Beirut. One Harrier pilot, Marine Ist Lt. Brian Merritt, 25, said a Zuni is a “highly” accurate missile. A typical pilot can blast a target no more than 10 feet wide 80 percent of the time. At a press conference aboard the Tarawa, Vice Admiral Edward H. Martin, commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, de- clined to specify the conditions under which American forces might strike again in support of the beleaguered Marine outpost on shore. “We do have the right of self defense and we will exercise it to whatever degree is neces- sary to protect the Marines,” he said. Under repeated questioning, Navy officers acknowledged that the United States did not ob- tain any permission from the Lebanese govern- ment before a Navy ship opened fire and de- stroyed an artillery post in the mountains from which the Marines had been shelled.

John “Red” Anderson, 21, of Superior, is. “Shoot his head off,” said another Marine. Sniper bullets were flying directly overhead, some of them so near that you could hear the whiz. The Marines had one sniper in their sights and were itching to unload on him with an M-60 machine gun. And now they had to wait for head- quarters higher-ups to decide if they should hunker down or blast away. The grunts never fired. When the green light came from headquarters, the sniper had vanished. What happened Thursday afternoon at Out- post 69 on the southeast outskirts of Beirut will not influence the future of the Middle East. Nor will it pin battle ribbons on the Marines who were sniped at. But the 30-minute episode tells a lot about how blessed it is to be a peacekeeper between the Lebanese army and Moslem Druse neighborhoods. Anderson put it this way: “If we could take the offensive and fight, we wouldn’t care if we'd be ; F iring line Lebanese army troops try to save their hearing Thursday as they fire an 81mm mortar round at Druse positions. Lebanese army troops and Druse ¢ We don’t want to get killed sitting around here like this. 9 get killed in Lebanon. But we don’t want to get killed sitting around here like this. Change our mission or get us out of here.” After the incident, Marine 2nd Lt. Steve Sekellick, 24, of Seymour, Conn., wondered out loud whether he should have ordered his men to shoot without bucking the decision up to his su- periors. “Maybe I made a mistake,” he mused to his men. The shooting started about 1 p.m. as Marines were listening to pop music on a tape deck, talk- ing with two visiting reporters or eating field ra- tions in plastic packs labeled “meal, ready to eat, individual.” A reporter had just asked Cpl. Israel Crespo, 21, of Brooklyn, N.Y., how he passes the time in Outpost 69’s sandbagged bunker, which is about the size of a baseball diamond. “If they ain’t sniping, we play cards, talk, ¥ 3 on -; The Associated Press militiamen exchanged fire near Kabr Chmoun, located nine miles southeast of Beirut in Leba- non’s Shouf Mountains. Atlanta Constitution work out,” he said. After five minutes, the shots started sounding close. Marines ducked, and those without them put on their helmets and flak jackets. Sekellick, commander of the 30 Marines at vee 69, grabbed a ea spotter scope scanned apartment buildings on a hillside five hundred yards away. 69 is about two miles east of the run- ways at Beirut International Airport, where most of the 1,200 Marines in the multinational peace- keeping force are deployed. So far, none of the four Marines killed or 32 injured in the last month have been hunkered down at Outpost 69. Yet this is one of the most ex- posed of all the Marine units. For it is directly in the line of fire between a Lebanese army post and a jumble of suburban apartment buildings that Druse militiamen have used as sniper posts. “It’s dangerous, you know, kind of, but that’s what we are getting paid for,” said Lance Cpl. Thomas Duncan, 22, of Mansfield, Ohio. “That is the reason we are Marines.” Under the rules of their peacekeeping assign- ment, the Marines cannot fire until they have posi- tively identified a “target” and determined that no civilians are in the way. It took Sekellick about 10 minutes to spot the sniper’s muzzle flash through the spotter scope. A Marine from Louisiana started talking about going home when his tour in Lebanon is up in November. “I didn’t come over here just to get killed,” he said. Anderson’s reply was to call out the names and ranks of the four dead Marines. “They never thought they’d be dead,” he said. After a while, Sekellick put the spotter scope on a sandbag and headed for his communications hut. He had located a sniper wearing civilian clothes and crouching in the window of an apart- ment block about 600 yards away. If Sekellick had judged that the firing posed an immediate danger to his men, he could have given the firing order himself. He decided not to give that order. Instead, he called an officer at the headquar- ters of the company about half a mile away. The officer at Bravo Company demanded the sniper’s exact position so he could check it himself. Then Bravo Company bucked the question to “battal- ion,” which is part of the main Marine headquar- ters at the airport. Only about 20 bullets were fired by the sniper in the whole incident. But that was enough firing to make the Marines boil. At roughly 1:30 p.m., after waiting for 10 minutes, Sekellick got his answer and told the men, “It went all the way up to battalion, and they came back down and told me, ‘It’s your decision,’ ” the lieutenant said. He ordered his best marksman to fire a burst of six machine gun bullets the next time the sniper fired. And then the firing stopped. “They must have figured lunch hour is over, we better not snipe at the Marines anymore,” said one frustrated grunt. - September 16, 1983 \f"

Marine finds the defensive role tough one to play By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BEIRUT — For four hours, heavy artillery shells and rockets cascaded down on his 40-man platoon while officials high in the Pentagon deliberated whether to strike back. _ Marine 2nd Lt. Bill Harris, 24, of LaGrange, Ga., couldn’t do anything to stop the long-range artillery bombardment. But he had the authority to deal with the Moslem Druse snipers and machine-gunners who were simultaneously peppering his position at the southern edge of Beirut International Airport. . Harris gave the order to return fire. “My radio man killed one,” he said. “My machine-gunner killed two others.” When the shooting died down, he called his company commander and told him about the fire- fight. It was the last few days of August, the most sus- tained, devastating attack to hit the Marine contingent of the four-nation peacekeeping force. Two Marines in a different unit died during the same barrage. The artillery fire began hitting Harris’ first pla- toon of Charley Company when the Lebanese army units moved along the airport runway close to Marine positions to occupy outposts south of Beirut that had just been vacated by the withdrawing Israeli army. Eighty to 100 heavy shells have struck in and around the sandbagged bunkers occupied by Harris’ platoon in the last three weeks, most of them in the first barrage. Two Marines in his >!atoon have been injured, and the toll would have been higher if Harris had not insisted the men sta} below ground in bunkers when the alerts sounded. “The thing about an artillery attack is that an individual can’t do much about it,” said Harris. “It’s scary as hell.” In the first weeks, the decision to respond to artillery fire from Druse and other militias was bucked automatically to Washington. In recent days, The Associated Press Marine 2nd Lt. Bill Harris, 24, of LaGrange President Reagan has given the Beirut Marine com- mander, Col.

The shells include a high-powered 122 mil- limeter Katyusha rocket and a  130-millimeter . sean cise Howitzer that has a range of up to 12 es. “It is hard for a Marine to be in a defensive posi- tion, it really is,” he said.

        "ocr_text": "Syrians, top Libyan general confer By Joseph Albright Washington Bureau DAMASCUS, Syria — The commander in chief of the Libyan armed forces has spent the last two days in Damascus reviewing the mili- tary situation in Lebanon with Syrian President Hafez Assad and ranking PLO and Lebanese op- position leaders. The Libyan mission to Damascus, coming on the eve of Friday’s scheduled talks in Wash- ington between Secretary of State George Shultz and Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam, emphasized that the United — States and Syria are still bitterly at odds over the future of Lebanon. The visit by Libyan Commander in Chief Brig, Gen. Abou Bakr Yunis Jaber raised the preget that Libya may resume its once-gener- ous financing of Syrian military purchases from the Soviet Union. Libya in 1978 provided Syria with between $500 million and $1 billion to pay for purchases of Soviet weaponry, according to U.S. govern- ment reports. Libya also reportedly lent some of its advanced Russian MiG-25 jets to the Syr- ian air force. But for the last year or so, according to in- formed sources, Libya has fallen behind on its pledges to finance Syrian military purchases. Contributions from Saudi Arabia for mili- tary equipment and various civilian purchases are also down, according to both Syrian and Western sources, “Our treasury is a little bit pressed right now,” one Syrian official said Thursday. “The Saudis are using their contribu- tion as pressure.” Western military sources in Beirut have said Syrja faces the need to buy millions of dol- lars worth of artillery shells to replace rounds Shultz Khaddam fired by Syrian-supported Druse militias during the recent three-week surge of fighting near Beirut. After flying from Libya Wednesday, Jaber met President Assad and Syrian Defense Minis- ter Mustafa Tlass to discuss “the situation in the Middle East region and cooperation between the two sisterly countries,” according to the official Syrian news agency Sana. The government announcement said noth- ing about meetings between the Libyan military delegation and various factions that took part in recent Lebanese fighting. But Walid Jumblatt, chief of the leftist Druse militias that fought against the Lehanese army near Beirut, was seen coming out of a meeting with Jaber in a suite at the ornate Sheraton Damascus Hotel. Jumblatt would say only that he held two long meetings with Jaber and other Libyan officers, one Wednesday night and the other Thursday. As many as half a dozen ranking PLO offi- cials also met with the Libyans, The senior PLO ee Khaled Fahoum, said he spent two ours with Jaber talking about the recent fight- ing in Lebanon, including the role of the U.S. 6th Fleet. “We (Lebanese opposition groups, the PLO, Syria and Libya) are going to cooperate very much in the future,” Fahoum said in a tele- phone interview. Fahoum, who lives in Damas- cus and is considered pro-Syrian within PLO circles, is chairman of the Palestine National Congress, an umbrella group composed of the factions within the PLO. Another PLO official who met with the Libyans was Nimir Saleh, one of the leaders of the Abu Mousa Brigade, a part of the anti-Ara- fat faction within Fatah, the largest of the PLO factions. The Abu Mousa Brigade was reportedly one of the PLO units that fought alongside Druse militias in the Shouf Mountains of Leba- non. Jaber and the dozen or so uniformed Libyan officers accompanying him declined to be interviewed. “We are professional military men,” said one officer. “We are not authorized to speak.” In August 1977, Khaddam said, the Syrian troops then stationed in Lebanon were costing the Syrian government the equivalent of $75 million to $80 million a month. Since then, Syria has more than doubled its troop strength in Lebanon, from fewer than 30,- 000 to roughly 60,000. Last year, the cost of Syria’s venture in Lebanon increased drastically during fighting against Israeli units that invaded Lebanon from the south. Syria lost an estimated 89 jets in air battles and a large number of tanks. Atlanta Constitution - September 30, 1983 \f"

The Israeli information dovetailed with other indica- tions picked up in the Syrian capital of Damascus last month by a senior diplomat of a country that does not have close relations with Israel. The diplomat, interviewed two weeks ago in Damas- cus, said he had reason to believe a high-level Egyptian emissary had recently visited Syria. Asked about this, David Kimche, director-general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said in an interview Tuesday, “We have had several reports that there are contacts now between the Syrians and the Egyptians, Kimche, a former official of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, said he believes the contacts have been “on the intelligence service level,” rather than between diplomats of the two countries. While scarcely pleased, the Israeli Foreign Ministry is not interpreting the Syrian-Egyptian contact as a move toward the breakdown of the Camp David accords or a prelude to resumption of full diplomatic relations between Rather, the unofficial talks are seen as part of a gradual campaign by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to end Egypt’s isolation in the Arab world while continu- ing to observe the peace treaty Israel signed with Sadat in September 1978. Thousands of Israeli tourists visit ‘Egypt without har- assment, and Israel maintains both an embassy and an ambassador in Cairo. . “Obviously, we are not happy with the existing situa- tion,” Kimche said. “We would like to have seen a much warmer peace than the cold peace we now have.

The Iranians fought alongside the Druse militias and units of the Pales- tine Liberation Organization loyal to the Syrians. But if it turns out that Iranian guards carried out the terrorist assault, further questions will arise: How were they able to pass through Syrian checkpoints to enter Bei- rut? Where did they obtain trucks and heavy loads of high explosives? Who gave them their orders? Until now, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut has not re garded the Druse as potential terrorists, even though they are tough fighters. An intelligence report completed at the ‘| embassy last summer said the Druse had not been impli- cated in any of the bloody terrorist episodes in Beirut over the last few years, Still other potential are the Shiite Moslem gunmen whose sniper fire killed two Marines a week ago. Amal, the main Shiite militia group, has dozens of checkpoints that control the back roads leading from the Shouf mountains above Beirut to the Beirut airport, where the terrorist bombing took place. The Amal-controlled neighbhorhoods are the only large sector of Beirut where a truck could pass without being repeatedly stopped by Lebanese Army checkpoints. \f"

Speaking at the White House to a group of visiting journalists, Reagan said enlarging the 1,600-member Marine contin- gent might be warranted “if it would help the mission they’re performing.” But the president rejected any combat role for the U.S. troops, saying to do so would risk “the start of overall conflict and world war.” Copyright © 1983 The Atlanta Constitution TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1983 Marines’ death toll now 191 By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BEIRUT, Lebanon — One by one, the bodies of American Marines were pulled from their shattered Beirut command post Monday, pushing the toll to at least 191 killed in the bloodiest attack against the US. military since Vietnam. As a convoy of about 20 jee trucks Kelley flew to Beirut Monday to as- sess the situation and make recommenda- tions in the wake of bomb blasts Sunday that caused heavy casualties among American and French peacekeeping forces in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Secretary of State George Shultz said he will go to Europe by the end of this week to consult with leaders of other nations participating in the multina- tional peacekeeping force in Lebanon. standing by hope it’s the replacements.” Earlier in the day, military officials eran Lojemee NG. kad.renched Gencunay pt Lejeune, N.C., had reached German y trans-Atlantic hop in three C-141 transport plas planes. the night was pitch black, the wescked Marine Marine command pest was lit up like a movie set. ! “There’s nobody alive in there now,” said Maj. Robert Jordan, 45, of Shenan- doah, Ga. “No, it would be a miracle.” Thirty-six hours after an unidentified driver detonated his 2,000-pound truckload of dynamite inside their main command post, the Marines still had no complete list of who was killed and who. ived.

Timothy Geraghty (left), Commodore Morgan France at post’s ruins Shultz did not disclose the place or date of the meetings. Shultz also announced the administra- tion is sending a high-level mission to Is- rael next week to review the situation in Lebanon “as well as broader issues of Mid- dle East security.” He said the administration is also sending the acting U.S. mediator in the Middle East, Richard Fairbanks, to Geneva to try to help the negotiations on a national reconciliation between the various warring factions in Lebanon. The White House, apparently seeking to counter growing criticism that the mis- sion of the troops in Lebanon is poorly de- fined, allowed the president’s remarks to the journalists to be televised live to a na- tional audience. Associated Press Coffins containing bodies of Marines are loaded on U.S. plane in Beirut for trip home Continued From Page 1-A The Pentagon said 191 servicemen were confirmed dead and unofficial Marine reports in Beirut listed 32 Marines as missing. Eighteen of 75 Marines wounded in the attack were in criti- cal or serious condition in military hospitals in Italy, Cyprus and West Germany. At least 23 French paratroopers also were killed in a similar, almost simultaneous attack at their command post, one mile from the Ma- rine base. In the first horrible half hour Sunday, gravely wounded Marines were rushed by ambulance to perhaps a half dozen hospitals scattered around Beirut. Such was the confu- sion, some reporters were asked by surviving Marines whether they had found any wounded in outlying hospitals who were still unaccounted Reagan said attaining peace in Leba- non is the key to stability in the region and See REAGAN, Page 7-A Marines for. As the dead and injured were being air- lifted out of Beirut, US. officials still had offered no full explanation of why a dynamite- laden truck was able to penetrate the security of the Marine command post, where up to 300 American Marines and other Navy personnel had been sleeping. Marine Commander Col. Timothy Geraghty said at a press conference, “We took every reasonable precaution to prevent terrorist acts such as this.” Yet despite an earlier suicide car bombing of the American Embassy here in April, the Marine headquarters has never been heavily barricaded. There were, for instance, no 7-foot-tall fences made of piled rocks like those the Israe- lis have built at their checkpoint bordering Syria in the Golan Heights. Nor had the Marines called in bulldozers to dig barrier trenches around the perimeter of their headquarters. One difference, of course, is that the Israe- lis built their Golan Heights checkpoints at permanent installations. Since the Marines have always been treated as temporary peacekeep- ers, the U.S. government has not seen fit to send in military engineers to build steel and concrete barricades — at least not so far. The terrorist driver of the truck had the good luck — or perhaps the inside information — that allowed him to strike the Marine post Sunday morning, the one day of the week when the Marines in Lebanon are allowed to “sleep in,” as spokesman Jordan put it on a calmer occasion three weeks ago.

Soviet sources confirmed Monday that the 74th session of the Strate- gic Arms Reduction talks will go forward as scheduled on Tuesday.

Each side would “build-down” its current inventory of roughly 8,000 long- range ballistic missile warheads at the rate of 5 percent a year until each side had about 5,000 war- heads. During this “build down” period, both countries could introduce new, more accurate missiles such as the American MX, provided that over- all warhead inventories kept declin- ing by 5 percent a year. Pravda, in an _ authoritative commentary, called the plan ‘‘a cover for the U.S. arms build-up” and said it would unfairly constrain Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles.

        "ocr_text": "Bush again makes bid for U.S.-Soviet talks By Joseph Albright Cox News Service GENEVA — Vice Presi- dent George Bush made a new bid to the Soviet Union Saturday for a “carefully prepared” summit confer- ence between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet turned out surprisingly well for him so far — Bush told a televised press confer- ence: “‘We want a peace race, not an arms race.” Bush made clear that even if the two superpow- ers cannot conclude an agreement on nuclear mis- siles in Europe, Reagan would still be willing to meet Andropov for a “well prepared, well thought out” summit. The Bush _ suggestion went beyond Reagan’s proposal last Monday, al- ready rejected in Moscow, for a ‘“‘wherever-whenever” summit meeting to sign a European intermediate- range missile ban. Bush also said that if Russian negotiators bring Stposal a ne sensible P \" for an interim missile agreement, Reagan might set aside his insist- ence on a total ban on intermediate range missiles in Europe. He said the United States will remain open to con- cluding a European missile agreement even after the first American Pershing II and cruise missiles are de- ployed in four NATO coun- tries starting in December. “What goes in can come out,” he said. Bush did acknowledge that his private meeting the day before with Ambas- sador Yuli Kvitsinskiy, the Russian intermediate mis- sile negotiator, was nothing more than a chance for both sides to reiterate their fixed positions. “I hoped that the meet- ings might produce a little give, and that we might hear something from them,” said Bush. As he put it, the session was valuable, “if nothing else,” as a means of con- veying to Moscow his assurances that Reagan sincerely does want an intermediate-range missile ment. “I know he is. I see him every day. I know what his heartbeat is,” said the vice president. He went on to describe Reagan as having “a real opportunity to be the peace president.” What Bush has mainly been trying to achieve dur- ing his 12-day, six-nation foray is to show — one month before a_ critical West German election — that the American nuclear missile posture can be flex- ible without being spine- less. With no really new American negotiating oor tions to merchandise, Bush has stressed the morality and flexibility of the American “zero option” missile proposal, under which the United States would refrain from install- ing new medium-range Pershing Ii and cruise mis- siles in Europe and the Soviet Union would dis- mantle its existing force of medium-range SS-20s. In affixing his seal of ap- proval on a_ possible interim-missile Bush was evidently trying to toss a life-jacket to West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose tiny Free Demo- cratic Party faces extinc- tion in the March 6 Ger- man election if it fails to attract 5 percent of the electorate. In Washington, one key Reagan official remarked a week ago that Genscher ap- peared “desperate,” with German public opinion polls indicating only 3 = cent to 4 percent of man voters behind the.Free Democrats. This week, however, West German public opin- ion polls reported the Free Democrats staging a possi- ble comeback. And it is understood that Genscher told officials in the visiting Bush entourage three days ago that he now thought his party would make the 5 percent electoral cutoff for representation in the Ger- man parliament. With the same polls showing West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s Christian Democrats falling a few percentage points short of an outright major- ity, Kohl may well need the Free Democrats if he is to form a solid government that remains committed to deployment of the Pershing II and cruise missiles. At least for one week, the Bush visit has suc- ceeded in keeping An- dropov from dominating the European headlines with his own peace initia- tives. The Bush itinerary has also helped convey the sense that for once, the Western allies have their diplomatic act together at a time when the Russians don’t. On Friday, Bush told delegates to the U.N. Disar- mament Committee here that the American zero-op- tion proposal was not a ee ene at proposi- on.” Within an hour, Kohl and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher used exactly the same phrase in their statement after a working lunch in London. The vice presiddent bat- tled a fierce German snow- storm to fly on to Rome Saturday night where he reiterated in an arrival statement at Chigi Palace, the official residence of Italian Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani: “Ours is not a_ take-it-or-leave-it proposition. We are not, however, going to give up on principles.” In Moscow, meanwhile, Press Internatio IN GENEVA: Bush greets Soviet ambassador. Col. Gen. Nikolai Chernov, a leading Soviet military spokesman, was quoted as saying the Soviet SS-20 missiles are not negotiable against new American medium-range missiles such as the Pershing 2. Divergent assessments of the Bush trip came from among those who heard him address the U.N. Disarmament Committee in the old League of Na- tions headquarters. Sen. John Tower (R- Texas), who stopped here to observe reaction to the Bush speech during a nine- day European trip of his >» own, said: “I can’t help but believe it (the Bush trip) will have a salubrious ef- fect — it may even blunt the propaganda offensive the Soviets have mounted.” The only woman dele- gate on the 42-member U.N. Disarmament Com- mittee, Sweden’s Maj. Britt Theorin, said: “The people of Europe are really scared of nuclear war, realizing that they might be the bat- tlefield. I had hoped for more from Mr. Bush, par- ticularly in terms of a proposal for a limitation on nuclear testing. I am very disappointed.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution February 6, 1983 \f"

Mrs. Khaled, who was 20 when she and a male com- rade pulled off one of the most publicized hijackings in history, says she now spends time doing “social work dealing with children who lost their parents in the wars we have fought.” In August 1969, the two PLO members took over a Trans World Airways jet that was carrying 213 pas- sengers and crew from Rome to Athens. They forced the plane to land in Damascus, Syria, where it was heavily damaged by a terrorist bomb. Four pas- sengers were injured in the incident. At Friday’s session of the Palestine National Council, Mrs. Khaled jumped to her feet as PLO leader Arafat was pushing through his own slate of members. Demanding recognition among the predominantly male council members sur- rounding her, she called for inclusion of 12 new women members. new council Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 20, 1983 “Any achievement. of women is an achievement to the revolution,” she told Arafat. Arafat politely turned her down. He said the women applicants had not followed the proper proce- dure. Mrs. Khaled, followed into a corridor for an im- promptu interview, talked freely about her work as a PLO women’s activist, but refused to say where she lives now. “‘The Mossad is expand- ing,”’ she said, referring to the Israeli intelligence agency. She said she had been living among the PLO com- mandoes in Beirut, Leba- non, until after the Israeli invasion. Asked whether she per- sonally fought against the Israelis in Beirut, she said, “I, myself, no, because I Was pregnant.” Would you have, other- wise? she was asked. She replied, ““Yes, of course.” She and her _ husband, also a PLO activist, called their first child Beder, meaning ‘Full Moon.” The boy was born after her forced departure from Bei- rut. Mrs. Khaled, one of 37 women on the 355-member council, did not sound angry at Arafat over defeat of the move to boost the ranks of women represen- tatives. “Even though he is not beside us in our struggle in this sense (increasing fe- male membership), in general he is with us,” she said. \f"

Clues emerge but No final answer yet By Joseph Albright Cox News Service ALGIERS, Algeria — Exhausted after meeting all night with the would-be heroes Of a would-be Palestinian revolution, one Of the Palestine Liberation Organization theoreticians was overcome by an attack of reality about where the PLO is heading. Mahmoud Labadi, confidant and chief spokesman for PLO leader Yasser Arafat, scanned his eyes across the conference room full of 355 delegates to the PLO’s temporary floating parliament-in-exile, Yet another orator was gesticulating from the podium, saying the PLO must fight to carve out an independent nation for Palestinians in what is now the Israeli- occupied West Bank and Gaza, Once again applause resonated throughout the chamber, Labadi, for one, found it sad. “They are victims, incapable of liber- ating even one inch of their own territory,” he said. “So they hold meetings and talk and hope to convince world opinion of the justice of their cause.” Lebanon is the reality that dominated this 10-day political happening in a marble meeting palace in socialist Algeria, The PLO’s forced exodus from its de facto capital last year had one set of implications for moderates like Labadi in the PLO. It meant something chillingly differ: ent to the PLO's radical rejectionist fac- tions, led by George Habbash and Nayif Hawatmah.

The PLO was a power unto it. self in Lebanon, with its own port, its own ammunition dumps, its own safe houses, No longer. How, then, would the PLO change it. self to adapt to the loss of Lebanon?

        "ocr_text": "West German election could change ali Europe By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BONN — The most important election campaign on the European continent in a generation has ended in a blaze of slogans intended to awaken the apparently high number of undecided voters in Sunday’s balloting throughout West Germany. Opinion polls issued in the final week ‘suggest that conservative Chancellor Hel- mut Kohl will win a full four-year term, five months after he slid into power through a split in the old center-left coali- tion. The polls also suggest that the leftist ecology-peace movement known as the Green Party will win a place in Parlia- ment for the first time. The X-factor is the undecided voters. The respected newspaper Die Ziet has re- ported that 17 percent of eligible voters had not made up their minds going into the campaign’s final week. Kohl has appealed to voters for a dou- ble “‘mandate’’ — to produce another eco- nomic boom ending the current recession, and to stick with the 1979 NATO decision to deploy new nuclear missiles if disarma- ment talks with the Soviet Union are unproductive. In the headquarters of Hans-Jochen Vogel, the Social Democratic Party’s left- of-center challenger, disappointing polls have elicited notes of defeatism. Some aides acknowledged an impending loss of support on economic issues among workers in the party’s heartland, the industrial Ruhr. Kohl, an affable, long-winded bear of a man, closed his campaign Friday before 5,000 well-fed, middle-class supporters in the domed sports arena in his horne city of Ludwigshafen. Kohl, 52, was born in this regional steel and chemical center near the Rhine. It is where he got his start, at 23, in Chris- tian Democratic Party politics and later held his only non-political job: A depart- FROM 25A missiles issue to stitch to- gether his divided party, closed his campaign by promising to initiate a gov- ernment jobs program within his first 100 days if he is elected chancellor. In a speech before 8,000 in Essen on Friday, Vogel also returned to his ambig- uously dovish theme on NATO missile deployments, saying: “‘I will immediately begin pushing for a con- structive agreement” in the continuing U.S.-Soviet E:uromissile talks in Geneva. Vogel, in a final tele- vised debate at mid-week, ducked a direct question by Kohl on whether he would allow the missile deploy- ments to go forward in late 1983 if the U.S.-Soviet mis- sile reduction bargaining fails. What has made this elec- tion critical is’ the prospect that West Germany, the strategic frontier between West and East, might be governed by ae coalition with ao neutralist-leaning foreign policy. There have been Social Democratic Party-led gov- ernments before under Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. But they invari- ably espoused hard-line anti-Soviet foreign policies along with their left-of-cen- ter economic prog It was Schmidt who ap-— pealed to. then-President Jimmy Carter in 1979 for the missiles that Kohl is now defending. The 204 Pershing II and cruise missiles, due to start arriving at existing missile bases in Germany late this year, have never been con- sidered vital by the West- ern alliance for purely military reasons. But their abandonment, at a time when the Soviet Union continued its SS-20 buildup, could well unravel NATO in a few years, and in a decade could perhaps bring about the Russian goal of a neutralized West- ern Europe devoid of American troops. For all its external sig- nificance, the campaign has been fought mainly on economic issues. Judging from one late poll, the recession-plagued economy is the prime issue for 83 percent of the voters. Three days before the election, the government announced that a record 10.4 percent of German men and women were unemployed. Kohl, as a short-timer in office, has used every chance to blame the German recession on his socialist predecessors — a tactic Vogel has not 1 ounteracted. Late polls show Kohl leading Vogel by between one and eight percentage points. Even so, the incum- bent chancellor will prob- ably not poll an absolute majority, according to most pollsters and even Kohl’s own party spokes- man, Wolter von Tesen- hausen. What Germany’s 43 mil- lion voters are likely to do, therefore, is decide which minor party or parties will tip the balance between the conservatives and Social Democrats in the Bunde- Stag. The 3-year-old leftist Green Party, which longs for a simpler, cleaner Germany devoid of all things nuclear, seems on the verge of clearing the minimum five percent hur- dle of votor support neces- sary to claim Bundestag seats for the first time.

On the hometown podium decked out in white daisies and tulips, Kohl stood foresquare for German participation in NATO, calling the 200,000 American troops in Germany “defenders of peace and freedom.” Chants of “Helmut, Helmut, Helmut” greeted him when he said: ““‘We must de- cide whether we want to remain part of the Western werld.” Kohl maintained that the Social Democrats under Vogel could not be trusted to experiment with the German economy since he said they are moving “closer and closer to the Marxist principle of expropriation.” Vogel, a brilliant and nimble-tongued lawyer who has tried to use the NATO SEE Germany 29A »> Atlanta Journal-Constituition - March 6, 1983 \f"

These were capable of torture.” In the transcript, Barbie rejected accusa- tions by his French captors that he was respon- sible for deporting 650 Jews and other prisoners from Lyons to the Auschwitz and Ravensbruck death camps, beginning in August 1944. “My specific function was the fight against the (French) Resistance,” he said. “Personally, I never had anything to do with the deportation of Jews to Germany.” Pressed by the French examining magis- trate, Judge Christian Riss, Barbie said he had nothing to do with a special three-member Nazi unit that, by his account, was assigned to handle “everything that concerned the Jewish ques- tion” in Lyons, He insisted that “all questions of transportation of people” were handled by the French police and the German army's field po- lice units. . “I simply knew that the Jews were being taken to a concentration camp, but I never saw it with my own eyes,” he said. “In fact, I did not know what happened in the concentration ‘I simply knew that the Jews were being taken to a concentration camp, but | never saw it with my own eyes. In fact, | did not know what happened in the concentration camps. You know that many people returned (from the camps).’ — Klaus Barbie ALTE LE EET TT A CE SE LE SL OER ET EE car, WE NT ORI camps. You know that many people returned (from the camps).” This first disclosure of Barbie’s answer to the charges came from the Lyons daily, Le Progres. Risking possible legal sanctions, it published a 1,200-word partial transcript of his interrogation Feb. 24, taken within St. Joseph Prison. State prosecutor Jean Berthier quickly is- sued a statement saying the purported quota- tions had not been been furnished to the news- paper by court officials. While Berthier did not comment on the story’s authenticity, other sources close to the case confirmed the sub- stance of the report. The leak from a secret interrogation was a highly unusual development in the French judi- cial system and raised the possibility of a full- scale inquiry to find and punish the newspaper’s sources. There was some speculation in Lyons that the trial of Barbie, now expected sometime next year, may have to be delayed or shifted to another city. Barbie, known as the “Butcher of Lyons”, was Nazi security police chief in this southern France city from 1942 to 1944. Last month he was extradited from Bolivia and jailed here to face trial for alleged crimes against humanity, “It is certainly possible that I myself inter- rogated people,” Barbie said, according to the transcript. “That was my job when it involved important members of the Resistance. I do not remember having personally tortured the prisoners,” Several former Resistance fighters have been quoted in recent weeks as recalling that Barbie appeared to derive pleasure from tortur- ing them. These survivors said Barbie some- times plunged a bound prisoner head-first into an ice-cold tub of water, pulling him out just before he drowned and then dunking him again. Asked about this by Riss, Barbie said the local Gestapo headquarters in Lyons was fur- nished with “bathtubs in all the rooms because ‘it was a hotel. But I never used them to torture people who were being questioned.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 13 1983 \f"

        "ocr_text": " United Press International Bonn’s first lady of protest Ex-Army brat from Columbus _ learned to hate U.S. missiles By Joseph Albright 0 Cox News Service, BONN here she is, Petra Kelly, a wiry wisp of a woman, one of the original street radicals of the Greens movement, and now the most charismatic of its 27 new members of the West German Bundestag. Ms. Kelly, 35, is telling the world press that the Greens may go on a hunger strike inside the Bundestag this summer to block deployment of the American nuclear missiles in rapid-fire American. She is bilingual — a clue to the roundabout life she lived before she helped put this first anti-NATO, anti-nuclear party into the West Germany Parliament. Such has be- come her visibility, the leading Frankfurt newspaper remarked Tuesday, that she is the closest Germany has to a first lady. Oddly enough, she traces the ori- gins of her radicalism to her early teenage years in Columbus, Ga., Germany at Guenzburg two years after World War II, the child of a German woman and an American. While she was very young, her mother married a U.S. Army offi- cer named John E. Kelly, who is now a retired lieutenant colonel liv- ing in Newport News, Va. Petra took her stepfather’s name. Her anti-military feelings arose, she says, when her stepfather brought her from Germany to live near his new base in Georgia. “It was from this that I have my resentment to all military things,” she said in an interview. “IT was about 13 or 14 years old. ... The impression I have with me (about Columbus) is strong racism, strong exploitation of women, of black women, exploita- tion of workers, and a _ very WE WON: Petra Kelly embraces party member. that she hates. Her words burst out in volleys, first in German and then She was where she was an Army brat. born in SEE Bonn 23A »> southern Bonn ghettoed military, the military living in one ghetto and the civilians living in another, and a society that was not at all peaceful.” In Germany, Petra had gone for six years to a Catholic convent school, expecting to be- come a nun. In Georgia, she went to public school. After two years in Columbus, her father was transferred from Fort Benning to a base in Virginia. She finished high school there and went on to graduate from American University in Washington, D.C. As a young woman of 20 she worked in the presidential campaigns of Robert F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey in 1968. By some accounts, she was once invited to the Kennedy compound at Hyannisport, Mass., after she wrote a letter to Kennedy decrying the treatment of foreign students in the United States. She also has told friends in Germany that she got to know Humphrey personally. In 1970, she was emotionally crushed by the death of her 10-year-old sister, Grace, from cancer. She became convinced that Grace was killed by excessive doses of radiation used to treat her. By Petra Kelly’s account, the death of her sister made her into a passionate enemy of nuclear power. Also in 1970, Petra Kelly moved back to Germany. She set out on a campaign against nuclear plants, toxic substances, polluters, and finally the American military establishment. In the last few years, she has been called a sex symbol of the Greens because of her frosty blonde hair, her China doll fragility. The magazine Stern reported that she is FROM 1A the kind of woman “to whom every man would like to offer a warm jacket or some nourishing soup, but never a dirty joke.” That image misses the zealot in her, the feminist, the defender of the handicapped, the poor, the forests, the rivers. At first, she found her outlet as a young activist in Germany’s establishment left-of-cen- ter Social Democratic Party. She left the Social Democrats in 1979 to help found the Greens, an offs‘\\oot of a counterculture Alternatives move- ment. She worked so frenetically and slept so lit- tle that she may have harmed her health. At least twice in the last year she was hospitalized for exhaustion and heart arrhythmia. At one point last Sunday night, it appeared from preliminary tallies that the the Greens might not make it to the Bundestag. Petra Kelly appeared in one television interview to be on the point of hysteria. Saying she was shocked that the bigger parties were gaining, she charged that their support was “based on lies.” Petra Kelly has never been married. For a time some years ago, her name was linked in print to that of the much older Sicco Mansholt, a Common Market commissioner. In the last year, she has been seen fre- quently with a fellow Greens luminary, retired West German Army general Gird Bastian. Bastian — described by pro-military ob- servers as having been a brilliant and innova- tive Panzer division commander — quit the German Army several years ago after a disa- greement with a civilian superior. Bastian, a tall and striking figure in his 50s, soon began speaking out against stationing of U.S. missiles in Europe. Last Sunday, he, too, was elected to the Bundestag as a Green. PETRA IN 198 1: Speaking in Washington. Petra Kelly’s last big media happening be- fore the election was holding a ‘‘Nuremberg Trial” to detail purported war crimes by the United States through its nuclear deployments. Bastian, with his military background, was her star witness. Petra Kelly was asked after the election how she plans to use her spot in the Bundestag. First, she says, she wants to convince the Social Democrats to join the Greens in fighting the missiles in Germany. She would like the Social Democrats to en- dorse common sit-ins, lie-ins and other acts of non-violent civil disobedience. “I would like to find out how far they will go on actions on the streets, even a general strike perhaps,” she says.

        "ocr_text": " A painful memory: Barbie sending children to die By Joseph Albright Gox News Service IZIEU, France ulien Favet says he remembers the day Nazi Gestapo agent Klaus Barbie and a French collaborator chugged up to his mountain village to haul off the 43 Jewish school children. Favet, then a 25-year-old French farm- hand, was climbing the rocky slope from the vineyards when he saw two trucks parked in front of the little stone school. Uniformed German soldiers were prod- ding the Jewish children into the trucks with rifle butts, Favet recalls. He said the chil- dren were “crying, chanting, singing.” The scene was an out-of-the-way boarding school where Jewish families from the commercial center of Lyon, 50 miles west, had sent their children so they might live out the war. Off to one side of the schoolyard, Favet saw two men in civilian clothes, One was a Frenchman, the one he says was an informer who guided the Germans up the winding back roads to the school. To this day Favet is convinced the man took money from the Ger- mans for the information. The other was a man Favet now recog- nizes as Klaus Barbie. Most of the children were eating break- fast when the Nazis knocked on the door that April 6, 1944. In a 45-minute roundup, 43 children, from age 5 to teenagers, were caught and shipped away to the gas chamber at Auschwitz, according to French post-war accounts, That day, Barbie was the German to whom all the others in the schoolyard defer- red. Now, 39 years later, Barbie is lodged in the dank Saint-Joseph Prison in Lyon, preparing his defenses on charges of crimes against humanity. Barbie “should have his throat slit,” Favet says. But with a peasant cynicism, he doubts that Barbie will ever come to trial. He questions what a Barbie trial would prove, and is not alone in that sentiment. Many Frenchmen celebrated when the gov- ernment reclaimed the alleged “Butcher of Lyon” for trial after Barbie was expelled from Bolivia in February, But some have suffered second thoughts as the main lines of the charges and of Barbie's prospective de- fense have begun to gel in the last few weeks. How, they wonder, can Barbie be tried for crimes against humanity without spatter- ing some of the blame — perhaps unjustly, perhaps not — on French people he says 40 years later were his accomplices? Is all this worth it just to mete out a life sentence to a 69-year-old ex-Nazi, since France has no death penalty? And what about the $400,000 it sup- posedly costs the French taxpayers for se- curity preparations when the gendarmes have to transport Barbie back and forth to court? What about overcrowding in the al- ready overcrowded jail, caused by setting aside a whole floor for Barbie? Frederic Dugoujon, the mayor of the Lyon suburb of Caluire-et-Cuire, who was jailed by the Nazis for supporting the Resist- ance, says; “I find it a pity to allow a Ger- man, an abject German, to be the judge and arbitrator of the rivalries in the Resistance 40 years ago. It is not moral. It is not good for France.” Sending 43 children to a death camp stands as the most bestial of the offenses for which Barbie is now awaiting trial — a trial that won't begin until next year at the earli- est. The list of his alleged deeds as the Gestapo’s obersturmfuehrer (overseer) in Lyon in 1943 and 1944 also involve murders, torture and deportations of another 893 Jews, gypsies and ordinary Frenchmen. French Judge Christian Riss has notified the former Gestapo functionary that his trial will revolve around eight narrowly drawn charges, among them the depopulation of the school at Izieu, Barbie, in a Feb. 24 jailhouse meeting with Riss, repeatedly denied responsibility for the Izieu affair and for the other alleged crimes. He said, according to a leaked tran- script: “Personally, I did not participate in the (Izieu) operation and J never saw a single child, It is possible that 1 had knowledge of the results and that I passed along a report to my superiors. But I never had personal re- sponsibility... .” Favet, 64 and wizened, still lives and tends grapes in Izieu, a town of 130 where chickens walk on the main street. He re- cently learned of Barbie's denials from a woman neighbor who had read of them in a Lyon newspaper. “He is a liar,” Favet said angrily. Favet says he recently picked out Barbie's photograph from a series of pictures shown to him by French police investigators. He says he would be willing, if he has to, to testify about what he saw that day: It was hot and Favet remembers sweat- ing even though it was only 9:30 a.m. As he walked up from the vineyard and rounded the corner of the schoolhouse, he saw about 15 uniformed Germans loading Jewish children on the trucks. Not all the children were crying. Some defied the Ger- mans by chanting a French patriotic slogan relating to the ancient border struggle over provinces separating the two countries. MARCIA KUNSTEL/Special ‘HE SHOULD HAVE HIS THROAT SLIT’: Now 64, Julien Favet recalls how Barbie sent 43 children to their deaths. “You will never have Alsace-Lorraine,” some children sang. As Favet watched the roundup, he was grabbed by a German soldier who shouted “terrorist, terrorist” in his face. The soldier accused him of having jumped out the back window of the schoolhouse to escape arrest. , The French collaborator happened to know Favet and told Barbie he was not a terrorist. Favet was released on orders of Barbie. “Allez, allez (Go, go),” Barbie told him, meaning. And so, Favet survived. The same day, according to a document in the court files, Barbie dispatched a mes- sage to his Gestapo superior in Paris: “The activities of the Jewish children’s colony of Tzieu were put to an end this morning. A total of 41 children, ages 3 to 13 years, were arrested. The entire Jewish personnel of the school, 10 people including 5 women, were also arrested. No liquid assets nor other ob- jects of value were found. The shipment to- ward Drancy (near Paris) will take place 7 April 1944.” The Frenchman Favet calls a collabora- tor was tried shortly after World War II and acquitted on charges of helping the Germans. In a Barbie tribunal, the role of the al- leged collaborator will no doubt arise again. No matter how delicately the matter is han- dled by the prosecutor and defense lawyer, the French may have to confront some un- pleasant truths about French acquiescence in the Nazi occupation. It took only about 2,200 German Gestapo members in 1943 to keep France under control. People like Barbie succeeded because 40 million Frenchmen did not stop them. Only about 75,000 Frenchmen belonged to the Resistance, and even fewer actually fought. The Nazis had thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of active accomplices among the French police and militia. Perhaps the most serious of the eight accusations is that Barbie deported 650 per- sons, of which half were Jewish, to death camps at Ravensbruck and Auschwitz Aug. 11, 1944. Barbie has told Judge Riss that the French police and the German Army’s field police shared the responsibility for transport- ing Jews. In a trial, Barbie would presumably have a platform to name dozens of French policemen and petty bureaucrats who he claims helped collect the Jews for deporta- tion. “Personally, I had nothing to do with transporting Jews to Germany,” he told Riss. Rabbi Richard Wertenschlag, 36, a leader of the 30,000 Jews who remain in Lyon, has no doubts about the wisdom of pro- ceeding with the Barbie trial. “Tt is inadmissible,” he says, “that a war criminal who committed assassinations, deportations and tortures, who caused entire families to disappear, should be allowed to live out his life peacefully.” \f"

Meantime, Cox Washington Bureau chief Andrew Glass journeyed from Moscow to Kabul for a rare look by an American reporter at the war as it is being fought from the communist side. Cox special correspondent Marcia Kunstel also joined the reporting project, concentrating on how Afghan families cope with the war in a rebel- controlled village. Their inside reports begin with a dual look at the two faces of the Afghan war and continue Monday in both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. om, Joseph Albright (left) as rebel (right). Andrew Glass The Rebel Report & We will fight until our blood runs out — 10 years, 20 years, 100 years. 9 By Joseph Albright Cox News Service DASHT-E-RIVAT, Afghanistan hree nights after they es- caped into the mountains from the Russian fighter- bombers, the first of their children died. They were the survivors from this mud hut village that the Sovi- ets chose to pulverize in April and May 1982. There is compelling evidence that at least 13 and ibly as many as 50 of their children died of extreme cold, compounded by hun- ger and bomb injuries, in this hith- erto untold misfortune of war. “It was not possible to dig graves,” one of the survivors, Sefat Mir, 39, told the first American journalist to reach the village since the bombing. ‘‘Parents made walls with rocks in the back of the caves so the wild animals would not take the bodies.’’ Their deaths were byproducts of a deliberate strategic bombing campaign that continued this spring in other valleys of this battered na- tion. The objective of the Moscow-di- rected air war, carried out by Soviet and Afghan Air Force pilots, is to terrorize and depopulate Af- ighan villages that have nourished ‘Islamic guerrilla resistance. Only here and there can the bom- ,bardment be said to have suc- ceeded. Bombing has worked in Logar (province, 125 miles to the south. ‘Once a lush farming and sheep- _Yaising region, Logar is now a ghost province, its population mostly living in refugee camps in ' Pakistan. Gone too is any strong re- sistance. But nationwide, Afghanistan’s Islamic guerrillas, while sorely punished, have not been pacified. Their jihad, or holy war, sputters and smoulders in every region, threatening to tie down a large Soviet occupation force for years to come. In my 500-mile journey through rebel-held territory north and east of Kabul this spring, I found no signs of panic or defeatism, no one starving, no guerrillas running out of ammunition. Only medicine and good combat boots were in short supply. “We will fight until our blood runs out — 10 years, 20 years, 100 years,” guerrilla radioman Miroja- deen, 25, told me in the ravaged village of Jonanjoye, where it is said 24 civilians died from bombing last year. Heavy bombing resumed in Af- ghanistan in March. Last month, the State Department said the Soviet and Soviet-mandated raids have caused hundreds, perhaps thousands, of civil- ian casualties. : But in April and early May, few families could be seen heading along the infiltration trails in the direction of refugee camps beyond the Afghan border. Most travelers I saw were Afghans smuggling guns and ammu- nition from rebel base camps along the frontier within Pakistan. In Pakistan, refugee camp author- ities said they were processing only about about 8,000 new refugees a month by early May. That is sharply down from a flow that at times reached 120,000 refugees a month in 1981 and 1982. SEE Rebels 1SA > Atlanta Journal-Constitution June 12, 1983 \fRebels For the Soviets, the bombing of Dasht-e-Rivat in May 1982 can be logged as a partial success. For the 1,800 Afghans who used to live in the village and its immediate environs, it was an atrocity. Dasht-e-Rivat, formerly a medium- sized farm community and trading post at the head of the Panjshir Val- ley, was about half vacant when I reached it on April 22. Dozens of one-story mud-walled houses were unoccupied, their walls and roofs still ripped open by bombs. But, for some people, a semblance of normal life was sprouting along with the wild poppies and apple blos- soms. Farmers could be seen working their one-and two-acre wheat fields with wooden plows pulled by teams of cows. Young men were mixing straw and mud to patch bomb holes. On the dirt main street, an unex- ploded Russian bomb had been tipped upright as a column to shore up a sagging roof. Over many glasses of heavily sweetened tea, a half-dozen village leaders, including the local guerrilla commander, Muhammed Aman, related what happened after the bombing started a year ago. Trapped between Russian planes and Russian tanks, most of the men, women and children fled up a goat path into 14,000-foot mountains along the southern edge of the Hindu Kush range. Every night it snowed. Every day, jets bombed and strafed the val- ley, blocking them from _ returning home for provisions. FROM 1A Children were dying For up to 40 days, men, women and children hid in mountain caves or in the shadow of boulders. It was viciously cold for spring- time. One child and then another died, sometimes two in one night. Most families had stuck it out in the village through the first two days of bombing. On the second day, according to the villagers, eight civilians were killed b Single bomb in Fhinjoye, a small village about six miles from Dasht-e- Rivat. A report, which could not be verified, told of a cluster bomb that burst in the air, showering lethal fragments on Khinjoye. : The following day, many of Dasht- e-Rivat’s families fled on short no- tice, carrying only thin clothes and a little bread and dried mulberry flour. Mir, an English- ee clerk to the local Islamic judge, told me that during a lull in the bombing last sum- mer, village elders consulted with the heads of every family to count the casualties. Mir and the others said the elders calculated that 70 children had died — 20 of bomb injuries in Dasht-e- Rivat and another 50 of cold and hun- ger in the mountains. Another 40 adults also died of bomb and rocket injuries, the villag- ers said. Of these, six were guerrillas who had been manning a captured Russian ZPU-1 anti-aircraft gun posi- - tioned in the mountains above the vil- lage. No precise count These insurgent gunners’. had knocked down a swooping jet soon after the bombing started. A Soviet helicopter gunship then came along and blasted the anti-aircraft position with a rocket, killing the six guerrilla gunners. The Russians then bombed the wreckage of their own plane. Mir and the other village leaders agreed the casualties were not counted with any precision. One rea- son, they said, was that many survi- vors never returned to Dasht-e-Rivat, fleeing instead to a refugee camp be- yond the mountains in Pakistan. Three weeks later, after leaving Afghanistan, I found 1,200 survivors of this bitter trek. They were living in tents in the Doomshoghor refugee camp near Chitral, Pakistan, about 100 air miles to the east. They had walked for 27 days across Afghanistan’s forbidding Nuristan mountains, climbing seven high mountain ridges and passes be- fore finally reaching safety. _ No Westerner had visited their 150- tent refugee camp, they said. Squeezing into a headquarters tent, Dasht-e-Rivat refugees took turns for two houP telling of the cold and hun- ger. With no prompting, they also spoke of children dying in caves. ‘““We buried them in the Islamic way, ex- cept we had no clean cloth in which to wrap them,” Hagi Abdul Habib, 47, said. “Sometimes we carried them on our backs for one or two days until we found a safe place.” Muhammad Sahee, 30, a farmer whose 2-year-old niece, Frishta, died in Nuristan, said, “There was nothing for the children to eat.” Through interviews with parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts at Doomshoghor, I compiled a list of 13 children, aged 2 through 12, who had died in the mountains. ‘Clouds of gas’ The relatives said some seemed to die of ‘‘coldness” and others of “hun- gry.” Of the 13, four had been injured during the bombing, but none of the wounds seemed serious. Habib said two of his grandchil- dren, Abdul Maroof, 2, and Abdul Mobin, 3, died after episodes of retch- ing. Habib claimed they were sick- ened from having inhaled ‘‘clouds of gas” emitted by a bomb in Dasht-e- Rivat. But there was no confirmation of this claim. Habib was the sole Dasht- e Rivat survivor who spoke of Rus- sian poison gas. To reach Dasht-e-Rivat, I zigzag- ged about 250 miles north into Af- ghanistan from the Pakistan border, traveling mostly on foot, but some- times riding on a pack horse or in a captured Russian truck. y guides and protectors were guerrillas from the Jamiat-i-Islami rebel faction, one of the two strong- est among the six main Afghan guer- rilla groups. We crossed one 11,000- foot, snow-clogged mountain pass but stayed well south of Nuristan. Later, ng leaving Afghanistan, I joined a Jamiat packhorse caravan that carried 13 wounded rebel sol- diers toward a hospital in Pakistan. Again, we avoided Nuristan by head- ing southward. Once across the border into Pakis- tan, I traveled another 350 miles by truck and airplane to locate the survivors at the Doomshoghor refu- gee camp. MONDAY: The Ground War.

I deduced that I Was supposed to rest here until the others crossed the river, not to sleep. * In a state of clammy bewilder- ment, I repacked and rushed after the others — up another riverbed into the mountains. Three hours later, we reached a mud hut which the guerrillas used as a safe house. “Sleep, sleep,” said Dost. This time he meant it. My most frustrating problem in Afghanistan was the language gap. Only about half the time was I with someone who could speak any Eng- lish or. French. The rest of the time, I had to get by on my 35 words of Dari, a variant of Persian. This meant that for days I would not comprehend why we were rush- ing, why we were stopping, or when we were about to approach a Rus- sian outpost. — Sign language was not always reliable. The Afghan gesture that means “‘come here” looks a lot like the American hand sign for “stop.” An American thumbs up gesture meaning “A-OK,” is a gross sexual insult to an Afghan. Getting into Afghanistan was the easy part. The guerrillas seek pub- licity for their cause. One of their agents in Paris had given me a let- ter to the younger brother of one of the major Afghan guerrilla leaders fighting inside Afghanistan. I found the brother in Peshawar, Pakistan, the Wild West border town where the six main Afghan guerrilla groups are headquartered. We drank tea on the lawn of a fading British-style colonial hotel. Three days later, I was walking across a mountain pass into Af- ghanistan dressed as an Afghan peasant. My companions were guerrillas whose main mission was to smuggle guns and bullets. Their secondary task was to smuggle me. Keeping up with the guerrillas for 15 to 30 miles a day put heavier demands on me than I had ex- pected. Even popping vitamin pills and chocolate bars, I lost 20 pounds in a month. When the path was flat and we were traveling by daylight, I got to ride on top of a packhorse. At night and on the steeper stretches, I walked. My first packhorse kept getting stuck in the belly-deep snow and had to be sold to a traveler who was heading back to Pakistan. A few days later, when we had passed the snow-covered stretch, I rented a second horse. Two nights later, the hapless beast was washed away by a swift river current. We mourned the horse and walked on. One night later, the horse’s 16-year- old owner rushed into camp with a surprise. He was proudly leading the same horse, who had survived the dousing and had been found half a mile down the stream. The hospitable Afghans always presented their guest with the best of the food in each village we entered. Since it was a special occasion, my hosts sometimes stewed a piece of chicken or mut- ton. Once, I was even served a tan- gerine. But for the most part, like. the Afghans, I ate rice, bread, tea, soup made of potatoes or stringy meat — and more rice. Silverware and individual plates play no role in Afghan dining. Be- fore long, I learned to dip my hand into a communal rice platter, wad up a ball of rice and lift it into my mouth using my thumb as a pusher. If there was any meat or potatoes, it was also eaten by hand. Eluding the Russians or the Af- ghan army was not the trickiest part of leaving Afghanistan. The guerrillas know their way around their enemies; the problem is with their friends, the Pakistanis. The Pakistani government’s bor- der police operates checkpoints within a 50-mile buffer zone. West- ern journalists leaving Afghanistan have been known to spend several unpleasant days trying to persuade Pakistani jailers that their govern- ment backs the guerrillas. ; As I approached the border, my guerrilla guides fitted me out in a dirty turban. Then they made me take off my glasses, laining that Afghans do not wear 6 mn I walked across the border in a line of guerrillas, the guards stopped and questioned the Afghan behind me. I kept walking. SN Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 12, 1983 (Sidebar) \f"

        "ocr_text": "talian girl's abduction another mystery surrounding papal shooting By Joseph Albright Cox News Service ROME — Add the kidnapping of a 15- year-old girl who lived in Vatican City to the mysteries surrounding the shooting of Pope John Paul II by a Turkish terrorist last year. Emanuela Orlandi, daughter of a papal messenger, disappeared in downtown Rome on June 22 after she finished a flute lesson at inside Vatican City, a few minutes’ walk from St. Peter’s Square, where the pope was shot. Both Emanuela and her father hold dual citizenship in Italy and Vatican City, the tiny enclave in Rome that serves as the seat of government for the papal state. Vatican City, as of 1982, had only 410 citizens, including 73 lay persons and 86 Swiss guards. The rest are cardinals, bishops and other clerics. ' \" Agca deepened the mystery Friday by disavowing the | kidnappers and asking publicly for her release. “I am with the innocent girl, with the family in its sadness,” said Agca. “I am on the side of the Vatican and Italy, and I am against this criminal action.” The convicted gunman, serving a life sentence in Ascoli Picero prison northeast of Rome, was interviewed in the corridor of a police station, where he had been transferred for questioning about the kidnapping, “The KGB has organized everything,” Agca said, in- | |. sisting that his only accomplice in the papal assassination attempt was.Serghej Ivonov Antonov, the Bulgarian air- line official who has been held for trial by Italian author- the Vatican's conservatory of holy music. Then, Wednesday evening, a male caller telephoned the Italian news agency ANSA with an ultimatum. Speaking in Italian in hesitant tones, the voice said Emanuela would be freed only when the pope’s convicted as- sailant, Mehmet Ali Agca, is released from prison. She will die, the caller implied, unless Italian authorities free Agca by July 20. Investigators have good reason to believe the case is not a hoax. When the caller first The call set off a wide-ranging investiga- tion, involving both the Italian state police and secret service. But so far, there have been no results. “It is a most sad action but also one that is most dangerous,” said the semiofficial Vati- can newspaper in its Sunday edition.

        "ocr_text": " But Comiso townspeople also cool toward pacifists By Joseph Albright Cox News Service COMISO, Italy — Inside a rusting fence, a yellow bulldozer moved dirt to build the nuclear weapons storage site that will hold the 112 NATO cruise missiles expected here by next spring. At the gates, as many as 200 visiting pacifists sat in sweaty, futile protest. They were attracting almost zero local support in this farming and marble-cutting region of southern Sicily. Although many in Comiso fear the mis- siles, they are madder about having young, free-living demonstrators walking their streets and sometimes wad- ing in town fountains. Inside the gates, the first 230 Americans from the US. Air Force unit assigned to operate the missiles are setting up shop in temporary buildings called portacabins. Wearing camouflage combat fatigues, they staff a command post and a fire department and talk on walkie- talkies, Off-duty, they buy magazines and even French perfume in a post exchange. They watch videocassettes of American TV soap operas or movies such as “Firefox” and “Urban Cowboy.” Air Force Sgt. Christine Gomez, 29, from Browns- ville, Texas, arrived three months ago at this former Ital- ian air force base that has been scarcely used since World War II. Parts of the old crumbling air base still had bomb holes from the time it was attacked by American planes during the U.S. invasion of Sicily in 1943. “T've opened new sections before, but I thought there were going to be buildings,” she said. “But now, you are seeing things grow,” Turning this into a base for hi-tech nuclear missiles is costing an estimated $218 million, according to U.S. con- gressional testimony. Of this, about $175 million is coming from the American defense budget and the rest from other NATO allies. Recently, base officials allowed a Cox News Service reporter to tour parts of the base, affording perhaps the first public glimpse of the inside of one of the proposed NATO European missile sites. Other, unofficial, glimpses came in a drive around the lonely public roads surrounding the base’s 10-mile perime- ter fence and in talks with townspeople and protesters. With its gray-brown terrain and relentless sun, this place could be mistaken for an oil camp in the American [ Southwest. office of the Air Force colonel who commands this 487th Tactical Missile Wing. The pictures show cruise missiles in various phases of blastoff. One photograph is inscribed “Good Luck” and autographed by about a dozen of the colonel's former col- leagues at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The colonel, who declines to release his name out of me concern about terrorists, was transferred to Comiso after overseeing test flights of the cruise missiles at Dugway. He said some of his former subordinates there will join him at Comiso later. The site is also distinguished as a missile base by the group of blockhouses, security lights and warehouses that the Italian contractors are erecting in a remote part of the base. This complex is being built as the base’s nuclear war- head storage bin. It is visible from roads outside the base, but no American officials will talk about it, Unlike the Minuteman nuclear missiles based in the United States, the cruises are designed to ride on trucks called transporter erecter launchers. In a future nuclear crisis, the cruises at Comiso could be dispersed along the narrow Sicilian roads to pre-planned launch sites in the surrounding countryside. The Americans — about 214 men and 16 women — work, eat and sleep in a cluster of white portacabins in the middle of the former air base. Eventually, there will je ® be permanent barracks and all the other accoutrements for up to 1,900 Americans and an Italian contingent. degrees this summer, But inside the portacabins, powerful air conditioners keep the air almost chilly.

Barring a U.S.Soviet agreement in Geneva missile reduction talks, bases for cruise and Per- Shing 2 missiles will begin operating within the next year in Britain, West Germany and here in Comiso to counter Soviet SS-20 missiles aimed at Western Europe. News reports from Washington have said that be- cause of construction delays at Comiso, the cruise missiles destined for Italy cannot become operational until next April, three months behind schedule. The Comiso base will not be fully built for several years. But the pace of construction has picked up sharply in the last few months, according to both Italian and American onlookers, Work goes on from 6 a.m. until about 6 p.m., six days a week. The work proceeds despite the so-far feeble efforts to blockade the base entrances by a cadre of pacifists who have taken up residence in an orchard near the base. Another group of about 20 anarchist protesters, sporting pink Mohawk haircuts and punk clothes, live in tents in a park in the center of Comiso. After one widely advertised base blockade that drew fewer than 200 demonstrators, pacifist protester Gandolfo Sausa, 23, a student from Palermo, Sicily, said dejectedly: “In Italy, we don't really have a peace movement because the Italian people still very much follow the lead of the parties.” Only the Italian Communist Party has mounted protests, and even these have sometimes appeared half- hearted. A recent poll by a respected Italian polling company found that 64 percent of the people in south Italy and in Sicily oppose the installation of cruise missiles here. In Comiso, a town of 28,000 four miles from the base, the missiles are definitely not popular. “Everything that means war is bad for mankind,” Said the Rev. Antonio Garzieri, assistant pastor of the Mother of Comiso Catholic Church. Even less popular are the young, sometimes scantily dressed and bizarrely coiffed youths who have come to demonstrate against the missiles. “The people of Comiso don’t like and don’t want these people,” said Salvatore Catalano, the Socialist mayor. “What is strange is that even though they are dirty and dress strangely, they have a lot of money.” Carmela Picarella, proprietor of a dress store, says, “I am afraid there will be no more peace in Comiso any more,” She fears that the missiles will make Comiso a prime target for Soviet attack. And she doubts the town’s mer- chants will sell much to the American servicemen, who have so far done nearly all their shopping at the base ex- change, But demonstrating at the gates of the missile base is far from her thoughts. “Tt is useless to fight against a decision taken by the highest levels,” she said, echoing a sentiment heard from VUE OWNSpdeODIe The Rev. Giuseppe Iacono, pastor of the Mother of Comiso Church, is apprehensive that the base may bring harmful changes, possibly even including drugs and prosti- tution, although he has detected no harmful influences so far. “When there is a change in tradition and culture, there is always a change in religious behavior, and I am afraid about that,” he said. Iacono has spoken in church against the growing arms race, but he has not moved to support specific pro- tests against the Comiso base led by visiting pacifists. “Even if I am against the idea of armed life, I cannot support the pacifists’ way of demonstrating,” he said. ‘PEACE CAMP’: Gandolfo Sausa (right) with other protesters.

        "ocr_text": "Assassinated judge knew Mafia secrets By Joseph Albright Cox News Service ROME — The late judge Rocco Chinnici, chief prosecutor in the Mafia-dominated city of Palermo, knew as much as any outsider about the “Sicilian connection.” He had traced how Mafia clans in Palermo buy refined heroin in wholesale lots from Asia, enough for millions of “hits” a month for American drug addicts. He knew how freighters carry the bulk her- oin to Palermo and other Italian ports. And how it is repackaged in Italy to be sneaked into the United States inside espresso coffeemakers or lamp bottoms. Two months ago, authorities in Egypt stop- ped one Sicily-bound freighter as it passed through the Suez Canal. Inside, officials found 457 pounds of pure heroin, enough to make seven million separate heroin doses, Chinnici also had picked up the money trail, following how American drug profits are being recycled into Sicily’s booming real estate market. One success story he traced was how one Sicilian drug smuggler rose from train station porter to owner of 28 Palermo apartment build- ings in the last nine years. No one will ever know how much of this Chinnici could prove in court. On July 28, the judge was blown up outside his front door by a radio-detonated car bomb powerful enough to damage buildings in a 500- yard radius. It was, as one investigator put it, “a Mafia job.” Chinnici was the third judicial authority assassinated in Palermo in four years, His pre- decessor, Cesare Terranova, also was killed by the Mafia, as was Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, head of Italy’s anti-Mafia commission. Under the Italian judicial system, Chinnici and Terranova were called judges, but their jobs were parallel to those of American district attorneys. In the 10 days since the Chinnici murder, Italian investigators have been working to reconstruct exactly what he knew about Mafia drug smuggling. Assembling the picture has not been easy, because Chinnici believed he could not leave sensitive papers in his office for fear of Mafia informants. “Tt is hard, it is hard,” Chinnici told a Sicil- ian journalist not long before he died. “There is not an angle of public administration that has not been infiltrated by the Mafia.” The sheer size of the enterprise has been another obstacle. Indeed, one official estimated privately last week that Sicilian Mafia clans earn between $5 billion and $20 billion in annual profits just from smuggling heroin to the United States. By contrast, Italy spends roughly $10 bil- lion a year to operate its entire defense estab- lishment, including a 370,000-member armed force. Some lines of the inquiry being pursued by Chinnici and a core of other anti-Mafia investi- gators have become evident as his former col- leagues have begun talking to the press. It is known, for instance, that Chinnici re- cently had assembled dossiers on 162 suspected Mafia figures, possibly in preparation for a fresh Mafia crackdown. Chinnici especially was interested in pin- ning down the drug interests of Rosario Ricco- bono, head of the Riccobono clan. Until three years ago, Mafia drug entrepre- neurs used to refine semi-processed opium into heroin at clandestine chemical laboratories in Sicily. But after a series of raids on heroin refineries, the Sicilian smugglers had to find other trusted locations for refineries. Chinnici was convinced that some in the Riccobono clan had formed a heroin-refining partnership in the Far East with a reputed drug smuggler, Koh Bak Kin, who has operated in Thailand. Several weeks before his death, Chinnici learned that Bak Kin was being detained by immigration authorities in Thailand on charges of crossing the Thai border secretly. On Chinnici’s orders, an Italian investigator flew to Bangkok to question Bak Kin, only to find that he could not be extradited to Italy be- cause the two countries lack an extradition treaty. Another target of Chinnici’s inquiries was the Greco clan, said to be the strongest among so-called “emerging” Mafia families. Its leader and elder statesman, Toto “The Engineer” Greco, was a friend of the late American mob- ster Lucky Luciano. In recent years, he has left family affairs to his cousins, Michele “Papa” Greco and Salva- tore “The Senator” Greco. But they, too, have ostensibly retired to a life of growing citrus fruit. The Mafia traces its origins back to the 19th century, when Sicily was ruled by corrupt absentee landlords from France. Under Mussolini, the bandit gangs virtually were wiped out in Sicily, although their Ameri- can affiliates prospered during prohibition. Shortly after the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, some American mafiosi returned to their old Sicilian villages and soon the Mafia control led political, business and social life on much of the island.

        "ocr_text": " For people of Chad, the latest scourge comes from Libya O FRENCH MOVE IN CLOSER 18A By Joseph Albright Cox News Service N'DJAMENA, Chad — In this poorest country in Africa, the great scourges always seem to descend from the north. f For centuries, even as late as the 1920s, Arab traders raided Chadian villages and carried off black slaves to work in what is now Libya, From the north also has come the country’s great ecological misfortune, the gradual expansion of the Sahara Desert. Half of Chad's 4 million people live in the drought-ravaged Sahel region, a 300-mile-wide dust bowl in the middle of Chad. The latest scourge is Libya’s leader, Col. Moammar Khadafy, who in the last few days has routed the Chadian army of President Hissene Habre with bombs and napalm. The defeat has left Chadians in the capital feeling angry and impotent. The continuing war has left the coun- try in even worse shape for coping with its abysmal poverty. “One thing is for sure, even if it takes 100 years, we will fight on,” said Djibrine Souleyman, 40, one of the few economists in Chad. “How can you fight when you are being bombed all day? It is impossible,” he said dejectedly. For Khadafy, the battle of Faya-Largeau, fought last week, was a watershed. Khadafy clearly has won far more than one sun- drenched oasis. For the first time in his tempestuous ca- reer he risked an all-out invasion of another country and pulled it off without being slapped down, His main previous military adventure in Africa was sending troops in support of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin against Tanzania in 1977 and 1978. For the most part, the See CHAD 18A & Chad Libyan troops took a beating. But this time, by driving Habre’s forces from Faya-Largeau, Khadafy has humiliated the strongly nationalistic Cha- dian president — in part because Faya- Largeau is the ancestral home of the Go- rane tribe to which Habre belongs. For one thing, Khadafy commands the only road through Chad toward Sudan, whose  Western-oriented government Khadafy has long sought to destabilize. France has dispatched 120 crack para- troopers to Abeche, the-most important Chadian town close to the Sudanese border. But if the Libyans choose, they could go into Sudan along a route 50 miles north of Abeche without risking a direct encoun- ter with the French. From Sudan they would be positioned to strike against south- ern Egypt. Second, Khadafy has reinforced his control of the Aouzou Strip, a piece of northern Chad that Libya has forcibly occupied since 1973. To Khadafy this strip may be the most valuable patch of the Sahara, for it contains deposits of uranium, which is essential for Khadafy’s nuclear ambitions. Habre had been determined to win it back. Third, Khadafy dominates the 588- mile road through the desert to Chad's capital. If he cannot pressure Habre out of office by diplomatic means, he can try to take the capital by force. Finally, he has demonstrated that he is able to stand up to the great powers in a military showdown. Faya-Largeau fits into Khadafy’s long-range objective of unifying the splin- tered Islamic world — around him. FROM IA In the 1970s, he often told Western interviewers about Bismarck's success in pulling together the weaker German states around Prussia. He has envisioned himself as the Bismarck of the Islamic world. Habre pleaded almost pitifully for the United States and France to rescue him from the long-foreseen attack. All he re- ceived was an empty show of force — 500 French paratroopers and 40 American anti-aircraft missiles that apparently did not work. Chadian armed factions have been warring on and off for 18 years, and al- most non-stop since 1979. The war has worsened the plight of the average Chadian by disrupting har- vests and delaying development of Chad’s promising oil reserves, Chad — which is the size of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico combined — is a polyglot mixture of blacks and Arabs who practice local variants of Islam, Christianity and spirit worship. The annual income of an average Cha- dian is $140 a year, the U.S. government estimated in 1982. Of all the nations in the world, only Bangladesh was ranked as low in per capita income. Two months ago, a survey by French doctors found that 35 percent of the people in N'Djamena suffer from malnutrition. But things are better this year than last. Eleven months ago, Chad was approaching widespread starvation because the war had disrupted spring planting. Hunger goes hand in hand with dis- ease. The mortality rate among infants treated at N’Djamena’s central hospital has been 23 percent this year, doctors say. Measles is a major child killer. Tuberculo- sis, polio, leprosy, tetanus and malaria are widespread also. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 14, 1983 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Affluent in war-torn Chad we tes fea te have meager enjoyments By Joseph Albright Cox News Service * N’DJAMENA, Chad — It is nighttime and we are careening at 40 miles an hour along a pair of winding ruts through the sand. There is a loud thump against the radiator. We screech to a stop. There is excited chatter between Abdel, 23, who is driving, and his three young apprentices sitting in the back of the blue Peugeot pickup truck. One of the apprentices jumps out to look for something on the road. He returns in a few minutes with a graceful white bird a little bigger than a pigeon. The bird is stunned but alive. For several minutes the Chadians examine it in front of the headlights. One apprentice lovingly strokes its feathers. I asked Abdel what would happen to the bird. “We will take it home and eat it,” he said. In this poorest country in Africa, even these relatively affluent Chadians could not afford to waste a few ounces of pro- tein. It was a glimpse at the other Chad — not a piece of strategic territory but a place where people live. Abdel lives fairly close to the top of the economic scalg¢ in Chad. He owns a truck. With it he earns a cash income. He runs what amounts to a gypsy cab service between N’Djamena and towns in the desert up to several hundred miles north. For 95 percent of the population, the only source of survival is subsistence farming, fishing and food handouts from Western foreign aid agencies. . Abdel has gotten ahead because he went to school and learned French. In high school, he earned a diploma as a car me- chanic. Abdel, who was born in a village in the desert, now lives in a two-room mud brick house in N’Djamena along with half a dozen relatives. Most sleep on straw mats on the floor. The only furniture in the house is one single bed. Although Abdel is well-off, he is not at the top of the heap. The real upper crust are the Chadians with university educa- tions from abroad. When France gave Chad its independence in 1960, there were no Chadian doctors and only a few engi- neers. One of the new government’s first REPORTER'S | NOTEBOOK steps was sending virtually all of the country’s 600 teach- ers abroad to universities. When they came back, they became the country’s civil service. __ Even now, nearly all university-trained Chadians are either working for the government or living in exile. Souleyman Djibrine, 40, is among the exceptions. He is the assistant to the director of Conoco Oil Co's office in N'Djamena. In the 1960s he and Chadian President Hissene Habre were both part of the Front de Liberation Nationale du Tschad, a vaguely Marxist underground movement di- rected against the government of then President Francois Tombalbaye, a French-backed moderate, Goukouni Oued- dei, the current Libyan-backed opposition leader, was then one of their conferees in the underground. Like many of the underground fighters, Djibrine went into exile after France sent troops in to prop up Tombal- baye’s government in 1968. For five years during the early 1970s, he studied economics and learned English at Albany State College in New York. For those like Djibrine who have salaries, N’Djamena is not without its amenities. There are two discotheques where well-dressed Cha- dians dance and drink until 3 or 4 am. There is a reasonably good French restaurant, said to be run by President Habre’s sister. There is even a butcher shop — the meat is reputedly flown in once a week from aris. The newest migrants to Chad are the roughly 150 for- eign reporters, photographers and TV technicians who have flocked here since Libya sent warplanes to bomb the oasis town of Faya-Largeau in northern Chad July 30, In N’Djamena’s two Western-style hotels, rooms with a fan are especially prized. By training the fan directly on the bed, it is possible to keep the mosquitos at bay crews of French and American transport planes ferrying oe to the Chadian army, It is also home to some of the recently arrived Zairian combat troops, who can be seen walking down the corridors with combat knapsacks on their backs, | Finding first-hand information here is even harder than finding a room, All the fighting took place 500 miles from here, The only direct testimony on what happened at the front came from a captured Libyan pilot and some ict = soldiers brought back to N'Djamena for The best information about the Libyan buildup and then the fall of Faya-Largeau came from the two Western embassies, Under the rules of the background briefings, reporters have to attribute any information in the brief- ings to Western diplomatic sources, This doesn't fool anyone. There are only three West. ern embassies here, representing France, the United States and West Germany, And it is well known that the West Germans are not holding briefings, Of the other two, the American embassy is under- stood to receive nightly cables from Washington with one- day-old satellite metre from the front, The French embassy often reportedly has had more up-to-the-minute information since the French apparently had access to Chadian military telegraphic messages from the Chadian garrison at Faya-Largeau. Reporters heard almost daily pleas from Chadian officials for more American military assistance, But they were not told whether the U.S, government was sending back any direct responses to President Habre. But one night, a few hours after Soumaila broadcast a particularly fervent plea for arms, the Telex machine in the country's central post office began pecking out a mes- sage from Washington, Across thousands of miles of communications circuits came a message from the U.S. government. Not from President Reagan, it turned out. It was the U.S. Census Bureau offering to pay $1,000 in expenses so a Chadian official could fly to the United States for a conference.

        "ocr_text": "%, Ws, By Joseph Albright Cox News Service SALERNO BEACH, Italy hree days after the Gls landed, the senior American ground commander, Maj. Gen. Ernest Dawley, was so battle-weary that his — hands shook. His landing force of some 70,000 Americans — many of them untested kids from the Texas National Guard — was in imminent danger of being driven into the Mediterranean. Dawley telephoned his superior, 5th Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mark Clark, to say a column of German tanks had broken through a gap in his defenses and were fanning out behind his lines. “Well, Mike, what are you going to do about it?” asked Clark, the ®vérall commander of American and h invasion forces. “Nothing,” Dawley replied. “I have no reserves. All I've got is a prayer.” “That’s OK, but you better“do something else besides,” Clark said. It was 40 years ago this month that American and British troops landed near Salerno to establish the first Allied clawhold on the Nazi-occupied European mainland in World War II. No monument marks the spot at Paestum, 20 miles south of Salerno, where the first Americans waded But this Sept. 9, town officials of Paestum will award Clark an wousual medal. It honors him not as a military genius but for the care exercised-by his troops in sparing Paestum’s.tem- ples and other archaeological: fréas- ures. Clark, 87 and ailing, wiffpot travel to Italy for the ceremony. In- stead he will be nted by his son, William D. Clark, himself. a deputy assistant secretary of the Army. The Salerno landing, code-named Operation Avalanche, marked: the first full-scale attack by American troops against Hitler’s main forces in Europe. It was the beginning of a slow, blood-drenched march north through Italy — a campaign that would take the lives of 32,000 Americans and 42,- 000 British troops before the final German surrender in May 1945. “It was an unglamorous mission,” Gen. Clark said in a recent telephone ‘interview from his home in Charles- ton, S.C. “We were like guards and tackles on a football team making a hole for the fleet-footed running of Eisenhower.” ed Yet the Salerno landing was,-as Clark put it in his memoirs, “a néar disaster.\" a _ashore at 3:30 a.m..on Sent. 9. 1948: Because it was such a near thing. it emerges in retrospect as one of the turning points in the war. For if the heavily outnumbered Germans could have repulsed an Allied landing on the gentle shores of southern Italy, who would have risked ordering the even riskier land- ing at Normandy, France, in June 1944? And if Allied armies had been delayed in reaching France, how long could Stalin have held out against the Germans? Clark was never able to drive the German armies out of Italy. What the Italian campaign accomplished was to force Hitler to fight the Allies on three fronts: In France, Italy and Russia. When Eisenhower's Normandy invasion forces rolled into Germany in 1945, Clark was still fighting 30 German divisions — forces that could have served as Hitler’s reserves, Leonard Wilkerson, now 58 and liv- ing in Dallas, remembers the fear and confusion among the Texas Na- tional Guardsmen of the 36th Divi- sion who hit Salerno beach first. “We landed at 6 a.m, and the Ger- mans were waiting. We thought we would land and not have any pos tion, but we were surprised. I was scared to death, In my company alone, we probably lost 25 percent of our men.” The Americans bellied up =q. the beach, threading through barbed s| wire and land mines, German ma- F) chine gun nests and a few tanks ‘Special to The Journal-Constitution AT ANZIO: Flowers mark the grave of Sgt.

At that point, the British forces to the north, also part of Clark’s 5th Army, were up _— more concentrated German ire, Over the first three days, the Allies slogged inland several miles and established a semi-circular defense line on the flat plains below the mountains. By then, the Italian armies were bystanders. Two months earlier, Mus- solini, Hitler’s Fascist ally, had fallen from power in Rome. And on the eve of the Salerno landing, an Italian caretaker government surrendered to KSeNnOWE? S envoys. On Sept. 12, Dawley, the American ground commander, made a tactical blunder. Clark, his superior, did not wake up to it until after the German commander jumped Atlanta Journal- Constitution Tey Cl l=) ae 1983 (Continued next page) \f Dawley, trying to strengthen forces on the south end of his lines, pulled out some units from the north end. That left a gap several miles long in his defrsive perimeter, That evening, German troops started infiltrating through the gap toward the sea. No one stopped them. The German 10th Army com- mander recognized the startling opportunity. Noticing that the Allies had “split themselves in two sec- tions,” Gen. Heiarich von Vietinghoff genannt Scheel ordered his tanks to pour through the gap to strike Daw- ley’s forces from the rear, It was then that Dawley telephoned Clark to say he had no reserves and could do nothing but pray. Desperate for reinforcements, Clark on Sept. 13 sent a fighter pilot to Sicily with a letter addressed to Maj. Gen. Matthew Ridgeway, com- mander of the 82nd Airborne Divi- sion. “I realize the time normally needed to prepare for a drop,” wrote Clark. “But this is an exception, | want von ta make a dron within 0 pg , anc you to make it tonight. This is a must.” The 82nd Airborne was technically under Clark's command. But on Eisenhower's orders it had been preparing for a parachute drop in ome to rescue the Italian royal family from the Germans, At the last moment, that mission was scrubbed a Eisenhower, The 82nd was avail- able, Clark remembers receiving a reply later that day from Ridgeway: “Your message received. Can do. Matt.” Late in the evening of Sept. 13, within 15 hours of Clark's request, 1,300 paratroopers had drifted out of the sky to reinforce the American lines, The paratroopers were almost too late. That afternoon, no more than a few thousand of Dawley’s rear eche- lon soldiers stood between the Ger- mans and the sea. Two American artillery officers, Lt. Col. Hal L. Mulclow Jr. and Lt. Col.

        "ocr_text": "} Marine exposure to Druse attacks is chillingly evident By Joseph Albright Cox News Service | _. CHOUEIFAT, Lebanon — From the hillside dotted with fig orchards, the com- mander of one of the largest Druse mili- tias peered down through field glasses at a half-dozen U.S. Marine units in exposed positions on the flatlands below his town. . “It would not be difficult for us to kill 300 or 400 Marines in one night,” Com- mander Haytham Jurdi said softly. To which his friend and adviser, Abdul Baki, a retired employee of the U.S. Agri- culture Department, added: “If 300 are killed tonight, Congress will pull them out tomorrow. But we do not want to kill them.” A recent visit to Druse country in the foothills of the Shouf Mountains provided a chilling reminder of the vulnerability of the Marines in Lebanon should the Druse leadership ever decide it wants to force them to leave. The Marines, or at least their com- manders, know this. Asked whether an all- out Druse bombardment could really wipe out 300 Marines in one night, Marine spokesman Maj. Robert Jordan replied: “They probably could if they wanted.” Of course, the Druse would suffer. American sources said simultaneous shell- ing from many artillery batteries is the worst-case contingency that would trigger massive air strikes by planes aboard the American carrier Eisenhower. Jurdi, 30, bespectacled and wearing camouflage fatigues, said, however, that the Marines have nothing to fear ‘‘as long as we have patience.” He said Druse leader Walid Jumblatt has ordered all Druse militias to refrain from attacking three targets: the Marine encampment, the Lebanese Ministry of Na- tional Defense and the presidential palace. ‘“‘We will raise our voices to the American people,” said Jurdi. “I think they will hear us. But if they are deaf and we lose patience, we will shoot them all.” The Druse of Choueifat, a war-scarred town three miles east of the Beirut airport, led a reporter on a half-day tour of their sand-bagged bomb shelters, their bomb- pocked residential areas, their secondary school whose wing is now a heap of rubble. They pointed out one house whose plaster roof had been made into Swiss Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 18, 1983 cheese by what they insisted was an American-made cluster bomb that made its way into the hands of their enemies, the Christian Phalangists and the Lebanese army. At another house, residents said a 7- year-old boy was killed by shells fired by an American ship off the Lebanese coast on Aug. 28. They were not mollified to hear that, according to American spokes- men, the shelling by a Navy ship took place several days later. Their aim in allowing a reporter to pass into the town was to convey to for- eign readers their view that the Marines are no longer acting as peacekeepers, but rather are serving as an arm of their enemies. : For what were described as security reasons, the Druse would not show their main gun positions on a ridge above the town. But they did allow photographs of one forward observation post manned by three teenage Druse soldiers 500 yards from the nearest Marine outpost. All the Druse insisted that so far none of their shells has harmed a single Marine. In the past two weeks, four U.S. Marines have died. But the Druse said the culprits were, in fact, the Phalangists firing at the Marines from beyond the hills to trick the United States into launching air strikes on the Druse positions. “The Marines are our friends,” said Abu Kifah, 27, the deputy commander of the town Druse militia. “The thing that makes trouble for us is the Lebanese army. They establish their bases close to the Marines and then they fire on us. So we reply to the place where the shot has come from.” When a reporter asked whether some of these ‘“‘reply”’ shots might have accidentally killed or wounded some Marines, he said he was sure they had not. The view of the Marines is different. Although Marine headquarters has tried to avoid pointing fingers at any of Lebanon’s warring factions, officers firmly believe that in at least some instances Druse gun- ners have deliberately shelled Marine posi- tions. U.S. sources said military intelligence analysts have spotted 600 to 700 gun posi- tions in the hills around Beirut that are close enough to bombard the Marine de- tachment. So far, sources said, only about six of these gun positions have fired shells that struck within the Marine perimeter. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Syrians have iron grip on Bekaa PLO faction By Albright Cox News Service BEKAA VALLEY, Lebanon ' QP alf a dozen PLO fighters were lounging around the front porch of their headquarters one day In the Shouf Mountains 15 miles away, a battle was dragging on that would deter- mine which anti-government groups, if any, would control the back roads into Bei- rut. But the Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion had no guns and no transportation to the front. So for the time being, these fighters were unemployed. Down the street, Syrian soldiers armed with rocket launchers checked the identity papers of everyone leaving the two-story house, which was decorated with a poster of PLO chief Yasser Arafat. Inside, Col. Ziad Al Atrash, com- mander of Arafat loyalists in eastern Lebanon, told a reporter, “If we are needed, we will go.” However, any orders to join the fight-. ing will not come from Arafat, he said. They must come instead from Walid Jum- blatt, the leader of the Syrian-supported Druse militias and the man to whom Ara- fat has thrown his unasked support. A taxi trip through the Syrian-control- led eastern portion of Lebanon offers a pqpoive on the Lebanese fighting that unavailable in the fly-infested Marine bunkers of Beirut. One impression that emerges vividly here is that the PLO in Lebanon is no longer the independent force it was before the Israelis drove it out of Beirut in Sep- tember 1982. The remnants of the PLO in this dusty valley are under the iron grip of the Syrians now, and the Syrians seem uneager for the PLO to re-establish a power base inside Beirut. The pro-Arafat PLO faction of Fatah is not the only PLO unit kept under tight control. Syrian troops also have check- ints outside a headquarters of the Abu ussa Brigade, an anti-Arafat force located a few miles away. - No one has determined how many PLO guerrillas fought alongside the Druse militias in last week’s struggle against the Lebanese army for the mountains over- last Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 25, 1983 looking Beirut. Some Western intelligence sources have estimated there were about 1,000, and even the Israelis have not greatly inflated that figure. There is no question, however, that Syria could have arranged a much larger PLO contingent in the battle for the ridge line above Beirut had it so chosen. For reasons that have not been spelled out, Syria decided to restrict PLO involvement. One has only to drive past frequent and entrenched Syrian tank units and pass through dozens of Syrian-manned check- ts to realize that nothing moves in the yrian-controlled chunk of eastern Leba- non without orders from Damascus. Some 50,000 to 60,000 Syrian troops are now stationed in Lebanon, according to intelligence sources. Some are brown-uni- formed regular army troops. Others wear the red-and-brown camouflage tiger stripes of Saraya al Difa, or Special De- fense Force, an elite unit commanded by President Hafez Al-Assad’s brother. Syria’s evident reluctance to recreate the PLO in Beirut is not surprising in light of its original reasons for sending troops into Lebanon seven years ago. That earlier phase of the Lebanese crisis began in April 1975 as a shootout be- tween right-wing Christian militiamen on one side and a collection of “rejectionist” Palestinian guerrillas and left-wing Mos- lem activists on the other. Syria feared that an _ outright Palestinian-Moslem victory in the Leba- nese civil war could bring about a radical regime in Lebanon which it did not con- trol. To prevent that, and to keep Israel out, Syria sent in troops in 1976 on the side of the beleaguered Christians. Two American reporters got a look behind Syrian lines a few days ago when they hired a taxi to drive from Beirut to Damascus. The driver pursued a northern back road that avoided the combat area south and west of Beirut. Syrian soldiers seemed genial and relaxed about having American reporters in their sector. And at the border between Syria and Lebanon, reporters who had visas issued in advance by the Syrian Embassy had to wait for only a perfunc- tory rubber stamp in the passport and a baggage search before crossing into Syria. \f"

Lebanon. _ It's an idea that appeals to the Israelis. It also appeals to Syria's main ally in Lebanon, Druse leader Walid Jumblatt. From President Reagan's perspective, it just might offer a chance to whisk the Marines out of Lebanon with flags flying and American credibility intact before the next election. The idea is to forget about trying to make Lebanon into a unified country with a strong president and a professional army. Instead, decentralize it. Make it a loose federation of mini-states, resembling the Swiss cantons, «Let each of the warring Lebanese minorities domi- nate a canton or two. Each faction could even retain its armed militia within its canton boundaries. There might, for instance, be a canton just north of the Lebanese-Israeli border run by Christan militia leader Maj. Saad Haddad, a longtime ally of Israel, Other can- tons in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley along the Syrian border might be run by surrogates of Syria. “Cantonization” — the catchword Lebanese politi- ciafs ‘use to describe this idea ~ would not end all the killing between the 16 religious factions in Lebanon. What it might do is localize the blood feuds and allow the United States, Syria, and Israel to disengage from each other's throats. “Speaking as an Israeli and not a Lebanese, I would say that cantonization seems to be a very attractive and logical way to solve the Lebanese problem,” said David Kimohe, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, in an interview. “Whether mt attainable of ‘“ I don't Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 16, 1983 * Jumblatt, while in Damascus two weeks ago, tol some journalists that cantonization offers the best way t end the eight-year Lebanese civil war.

Another reason is that after two decades of rule by Assad and his fellow Ba’athists, life is more comfortahle, in economic terms, than it used to be in the semi-feudal times before the 1963 Ba’athist revolution. Apartment buildings are the most vis- ible syinbol of widespread well-being. Most of Damascus, the Syrian capital, no longer looks like a quaint old city with tiny ser- pentine streets. The newer neighborhoods are a forest of blocky apartment towers. “In nearly every home you can find a television set,” claims Information Minis- try official Constantine Hammadeh. “Nearly every home has two radios.” le this may be an exaggeration, most Syrians live quite well by Middle East standards. The desperate poverty seen in Egypt is not evident here. Damascus shoppers find meat, cloth- ing, cigarettes, stereo casettes and most supply, so people take the bus 25 miles and banon. “i em in Le! Along one block of middle class stores in Damascus, a window shopper can see Bayer aspirin, Black and Decker drills, Yale locks, Rayovac batteries, Miss Clairol hair dye, and marble cleaner carrying the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. The main streets are often crowded with privately owned cars, even though a new compact car from Europe or Japan carries a $20,000 price tag because of huge import taxes to the government. Urban working class Syrians and small farmers — groups that might have buy been the most receptive to Moslem funda- mentalism — have fared best under the Ba’athists. n uneducated laborer now can earn $18 a day, roughly three times what he needs to feed his family. Small farmers get low-interest loans and dis-— counts on machinery, fertilizer and seeds. The government has built sewer and water systems and electrical grids for hundreds of villages. For all S education is free through high school. University is free for the smartest 15 t of high school stu- dents, and relatively inexpensive for others admitted to universities. All medical care is free and low-cost housing is subsidized. Under Assad, the early Ba’athist rush toward socialization has slowed somewhat, leaving lucrative opportunities in small business. Merchants, small factory owners and other small time entrepreneurs have managed to carve a comfortable capitalist niche in this largely state-owned economy, where 80 percent of the investment is in public enterprises. Government employees, both civilians and military, are underpaid. To compen- sate, Army officers and government em- ployees live on bribes — a custom that, according to some analysts here, helps so- lidify Assad’s loyalty within the army. Rubble, bullet scars reminders of Assad’s iron fis “To get anything done, you have to know somebody, and then you have to pay,” said Mohammad, 23, a Syrian cloth- ing merchant. “You find that somebody is a 10 pound ($1.90) man and somebody is a 10,000 pound man ($1,900) man.” Mohammad, who served as a sergeant in the Syrian air force until last year, claimed he was the “agent” for his com- manding officer in a regular scheme to sell weekend passes to enlisted men. “There were times when I got $5,000 a month for him,” Mohammed claimed. One of the most prevalent and lucra- tive forms of corruption is paying army border units to close their eyes to smug- gling. i eee according to one for- eigner lent in Damascus, is for smug- glers to buy “border crossings” for truckloads of Marlboro cigarettes and other highly prized commodities. Syria has only modest oil resources and little other natural resources of its own. But it bene- fitted indirectly from the Gulf oi] boom of the 1970s. The 1978 Arab summit in Baghdad voted Syria $1.85 billion a year to support its armies, the equivalent of nearly 20 per- cent of the Syrian budget. In addition, thousands of Syrians got high-paying jobs in Saudi Arabia and other oil states, then re-invested their earnings in Damascus real estate and other Syrian ventures. The cooling of the oil boom has pinched the Syrian treasury as other Arab States fell behind in their Baghdad pledges noe fewer Syrians could find jobs along the Western companies complain that some Syrian enterprises are now months late in paying bills, and some suppliers have stopped shipping spare here. “Our treasury is a little bit right now,” acknowledged Dr. Nabih al Akel, vice rector of Damascus University. “Saudi contributions are down. They are using it as a bit of pressure.” To keep his economy running, and as- sure his own longevity, Assad must at- tempt a delicate balancing act. He must not only satisfy the Saudis and pay off his Western creditors but also stay on good terms with his external protector, the Soviet Union, to which Syria is billions of dollars in debt under long-term loans for missiles, jet planes and other moderns weapons.

Jacobs said the sentry told him that “he saw the truck and went to put a magazine in his rifle, and he turned around and it (the truck) was Oe eee blown into the bunker.” Marines figure the truck was hur- tling at 50 miles an hour when it unched through the knee-high coil of bed wire. m there, the driver had an easy 150-yard run to the south door of the building. Only three barriers were in his way. All were eepontially symbolic. first was an old, chest-hi metal gate that probably could not have sto a jeep. After the truck burst through the gate, the driver skirted a sewer pipe about 10 inches in diameter that was meant as a security barrier. This pipe caused the driver to swerve, but only slightly. If it had been placed crosswise to his path, he wom have had to jolt over it at 50 miles per hour. That almost certainly would not have stopped the Mercedes. Just in front of the south door, next to a flagpole, the second length of sewer pipe was across his path.

        "ocr_text": "Allies doubt U.S. military postures after Grenada By Joseph Albright Cox News Service + ROME — Grenada struck Western “European nerves like a runaway den- tist’s drill. Now that the pain and anger have dulled a bit, it appears the American invasion of Grenada did no visible in- jury to American interests in Europe. . There were no embassies burned, ‘no boycotts of American airlines or ‘Coca-Cola — and no break in NATO’s determination to deploy American ‘nuclear missiles in Europe next month unless U.S. and Soviet negotia- ‘tors reach a breakthrough. : But below the surface, Grenada has ‘contributed to a sense of malaise in Europe about the value of all mili- tary alliances. People worried that the crises are popping up too fast, in too many places — and that events could spiral out of control. . Many who are not pacifists are afraid of war these days. They fear Ronald Reagan as much as Yuri An- dropov. Lebanon, with an inset showing Presi- dent Reagan grinning malevclently in the background The magazine's lead article rolled together the violence in Grenada and Lebanon and asked how Italy can stand beside an ally that is “too strong, too aggressive and too de- manding.” - w In West Germany, the cover of Der Stern, the largest German news magazine, showed a helmeted Ronald Reagan aiming down a machine-gun barrel from behind rows of cartridge belts. Der Stern labels .its 13-page story on the Grenada invasion “Af- ghanistan West.” Der Stern said the United States “pounced on the Caribbean midget” because it felt a threat to its national security. “In 1979, Moscow occupied a neighbor (Afghanistan) using the same pretext,” the magazine said. @ In England, a poll taken after the Grenada invasion for the Sunday Times asked voters whether they be- lieved the United States would fire its Some of the queasiness resulted from Reagan’s decision to keep the leaders of the Western alliance in the dark about his invasion plans. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was the only Allied leader given advance warning. Reagan sent her a teleprinter message 12 hours in advance that he was considering sending Marines into Grenada, a Brit- ish Commonwealth nation whose chief of state is Queen Elizabeth. Mrs. Thatcher objected vehemently in a teleprinter reply followed by a trans-Atlantic telephone call. But the invasion went ahead. A few days later, Mrs. Thatcher delivered one of the strongest re- bukes a British prime minister has ever directed at an American presi- dent. She said in a radio interview: “I am totally and ctterly opposed to communism and terrorism... But if ou are going to pronounce a new aw that wherever there is commu- nism imposed against the will of the people then the U‘S. shall enter, then we are going to have really terrible nuclear missiles stationed on British territory even if the British govern- ment objected. Seventy-three percent answered that the Americans would fire despite British objections. Only 20 percent disagreed and 7 percent had no opin- ion. The issue of whether America could be trusted took the form last Monday of a debate in Britain's House of Commons on whether to de- mand a “dual key” mechanism to give Britain absolute physical control over the launching of American cruise missiles from British territory. Since 1951, British governments have been satisfied with a written agreement that the use of American nuclear weapons from G&ritish soil would be “a matter of joint decision.” In the end, the House of Commons voted overwhelmingly to retain this formula, which implies that resolute British objections could -block a launch from British soil. The margin against the proposed ‘‘dual key” ar- rangement was 360-22, with some 200 wars in the world.” Symptoms of post-Grenada anger appeared all over the map: @ Italy’s widely circulated news magazine Panorama headlined its latest issue: “‘To Die For Reagan?” Its cover featured a heartsick Ital- ian mother sending her soldier son to Labor Party members abstaining bDe- cause they are against cruise missiles under any circumstances. In the debate, members of all parties expressed the same doubts about American trustworthiness that British voters expressed in the Sun- day Times poll. “After Grenada, I think this coun- try can no longer be satisfied with the present arrangement,” said Denis Healey, leading foreign policy spokes- man of the opposition Labor Party. German leftist opposition leaders quickly picked up the nuclear control issue as their last chance to block the arrival of the first missiles. Social Democratic Party spokes- men in Bonn insisted that the United States must at least grant West Germany the kind of nuclear veto im- plicit in the 1951 “joint decision” agreement between Britain and the United States. Until now West Germany has been satisfied with a vaguer American pledge to “consult” Bonn before firing German-based American missiles. ; \f"

The nuclear warriors of the Army’s 56th Field Artillery are about to receive their first shipment of new Pershing 2 mis- siles, perhaps as early as Wednesday. This will be the second step in the U.S. deploy- ment that began last week with the basing of cruise missiles at Greenham Common in Great Britain. At a local center downtown, graduate student Karin Schwenk, 26, talks about the need to keep demonstrating even after the missiles arrive. But she concedes: “It is really difficult for people to see how to gain influence.” The final political barriers in the way of stationing new _ transcontinental Pe 2 missiles in Germany will al- most certainly be lifted Tuesday afternoon in Bonn. The Bundestag, West Germany’s lower house of parliament, is expected to ap- e the deployment of the new missiles a margin of about 60 votes in the 496- vote assembly. It will be a bitter party-line vote, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl carrying virtually every deputy in his ruling conservative coalition. Germany's second largest party, the Social Democrets, will vote almost unani- mously against the missiles, even though this will mean repudiating the pro-NATO defense policy the party championed for 13 Aga it fell from power in Septem- 1 One of the few Social Democrats ex- to vote with Kohl is the last Social atic chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, who prevailed on NATO in 1979 to adopt its “double-track” decision of encouraging U.S.-Soviet disarmament talks but deploy- ing new missiles if negotiations failed. Over the last 10 months, Schmidt has been deserted by his own party members in their rush to embrace the German peace movement. The thick forests and neat towns in southern West Germany are an unlikely setting for this country’s nuclear trauma. For 20 years Schwaebisch Gmuend has existed unobtrusively inside a ring of 108 1 nuclear missiles. At least 18 are kept on 24-hour alert, ever ready to tear out of hidden woodland sites to blow up a piece of the enemy Warsaw Pact. The Germans here have learned to coexist peacefully with the Pershing 1s. Now the American Pershing 1s are about to be replaced with a longer-range, more accurate model, the Pershing 2. It is not a popular move in Schwaebisch Gmuend. A poll two months ago showed 56 per- cent of the people in Schwaebisch Gmuend did not want the new missiles deployed in West Germany even if arms control ne- gotiations failed. Throughout West Germany, the com- ing of the Pershings and the prospect of cruise missiles by 1985 have generated fierce oppasition. Some analysts have ques- tioned how long West Germany can remain committed to the Western alliance. Few people from this conservative, largely rural countryside have joined the protesters trying to stop the deployment of the Pershing 2s. When about 3,000 pacifists from around Germany blockaded the local Pershing 1 storage yard in September, their ranks included an estimated 50 to 100 local townspeople. There is little overt evidence of hos- tility as deployment day approaches. But See MISSILES 4D » the recent poll found 63 percent of the people surveyed supported the objectives of the peace movement. Seldom is an anti-nuke sign to be seen around this city of 60,000 people ing hamlets. Local in the town, which gave Christian Democrat Kohl a 60 per- cent majority in the last elections, do not oppose the missiles. The local newspaper, the Tages- post, has editorialized that the mis- siles are necessary. However, the editorial staff of eight journalists is divided 4-4 on the issue, according to staff member Kuno Strudammreal. Erich Roth, 28, is a native who as- cribes the lack of more active protest to the Germans’ propensity for order. He also believes the time for pro- test has passed. “T don't like the missiles in princi- ple, but there’s not much you can do about it,” said Roth, who works in his family’s paint and wall covering store. “If they were going to engage against the missiles, they should have done it five or six years ago, or when the cruise was invented. It’s too late now.” The poll showed 53 percent of the eae a here in September ously interested in making arms control talks successful. the East-West debate of the future. Roth gave voice to that attitude. “I think it would be helpful to drift a little more to neutral,” he said “I think it’s time the American govern- ment realizes Germany has grown independent again.” So far, all demonstrations around ence information say there could well be terrorist attempts in war ety Mae est ied as affili with the Piriiinex waebisch Gmuend is the head- uarters of the 56th Field Artillery Evanie the US Arms cll, Pe an wor z has five Per- shing sites within a 100-mile-long oval in southern Germany.

The Russian diplomat's words could well be a leading Indicator of themes Moscow plans to broadcast to the world on Monday at an unusual news conference by the military chief of the Russian staff, Marshal Nikolai V, Ogarkov, and two other ranking spokesmen, So it is worth noticing that the Russian here was insistent in saying that the Reagan administration is building an arsenal for a nuclear first-strike attack on the Soviet Union — something virtually all Americans dis- miss as unthinkable, THE PERSHING 2s, with thelr six-minute flight time to Russian command centers from West Germany, are only part of the American ‘irst-strike preparations, in his view, He also pointed to the pinpoint-accurate MX inter- continental missile due to be deployed in the United States next year, and to President Reagan's moves to develop a “Star Wars” anti-missile system in space de . signed to pick off Soviet missiles in flight.

It re ga rea aa es es Ve plan was to be rejected outright or that it was merely insufficient. The Palestinian leaders appeared to approve Arafat's contacts With Jordan's King Hussein while ruling out allowing Hussein to act asa spokesman for their cause, ' “After lengthy deliberations and heated arguments, the (PLO) executive committee agreed to givé Arafat the green light to pursue his Jordanian option,” a Palestinian officlal said, . “But the ‘green light’ is conditional. Arafat can continue talk- ing with King Hussein provided the Palestinian decision remains an independent one, There is no way the PLO will delegate Hussein to speak on its behalf,” A PLO spokesman, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, said that all the PLO leaders, including Arafat and hard-liners George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh, had accepted the principle of confederation, marking a turning point in the PLO’s history. The organization had previously insisted on complete independ- ence and sovereignty for a Palestinian state. Israel and the United States are opposed to the creation of such a state, In his peace ‘Haba initiative advanced last September, Reagan suggested a Palestinian “entity” linked with Jordan. The decision of the PLO executive committee, which includes representatives of the major Palestinian guerrilla groups, came on the eve of the meeting of the 360-member Palestine National Coun- cil — the Palestinian “parllament-in-exile” composed of PLO guer- rilla and political leaders, It has been called'to map strategy in the aftermath of the Lebanon war last summer. Palestinian officials sald the leaders had agreed to a PLO- Jordanian confederation “provided an Independent Palestinian state is established first.” The Reagan plan calls for a Palestinian entity on the Israeli- occupled West Bank under Jordanian supervision. Israel has re- jected the plan, “The meetings are being held in a domed conference center 20 miles outside Algiers. Approximately 180 delegates from the West Bank and Gaze Strip are absent because Israel refused to let the members attend the meeting, a's . _ With the military might of the PLO smashed by Israel and its guerrillas dispersed to eight Arab nations, Palestinian leaders are aware that they will have to play on the political clout in a world amy by the massacre of Palestinian refugees in camps south of t. Sources in the meeting said the PLO leaders also were prepared to accept the Arab peace plan laid down at a summit last year in Fez which included an implicit recognition of Israel, Arafat, who has headed the talks held by the executive com- mittee of the national council, was expected to receive a solid re- endorsement as the undisputed leader of the Palestinian movement, Arafat has conducted intensive consultations with Hussein in preparation for bringing the monarch into the negotiations with Washington, and thus indirectly with Israel. One problem, Arab observers said, was that the PLO cannot be seen as ylelding ground on its demands for an independent state, They algo said Israel would never deal with Hussein if he were publicly nominated as speaking for the PLO, The developments could be regarded as a victory for Arafat, who has been criticized by the hard-liners for his consultations with Hussein on possible peace talks, Abdel Rahman did not elaborate on the confederation decision, reached in private consultations by the PLO's executive committee before the Monday opening of a week-long session of the Palestin Natlonal Council, the PLO's parllament-in-exile, Dayton Journal-Herald - February 14, 1983 \f"

John Sexton of Dayton woke and started to shave the other day, he found that a piece of shrapnel had punched a hole in his shaving kit during the night. “We are taking quite a number of rounds up close,” said Sexton, 18. “But it ain’t been all that bad. It's what we get paid for.” The artillery shell that hit and frag- mented 30 yards from his tent harmed no one, The Marines of Alpha Company now spend most of their time in six-foot- deep bunkers covered with steel and sandbags. Sexton prides himself with having dug the safest, toughest bunker in all of Lebanon. He decorated it with an American flag and five centerfold pinups. Since shellfire from nearby hills began striking Marine positions on Aug. 28, Sexton has collected three shrapnel shreds that lodged in the dusty sand at the mouth of his sand- bagged hideout. Marines are trained to storm hills, not dig tunnels, But since four Marines were killed by mortar rounds and shellfire 800 yards from Sexton’s posi- tion a few weeks ago, he and the other 1,200 Marines have deepened their bunkers during every lull in the . Shelling. Sexton said that when the word came over the command radio that Marines in the next platoon had been killed, ‘‘It was like a dream. We didn’t know whether it really happened or not.” Like many of the Marines dug in near Beirut International Airport, Sex- ton wishes his superiors would allow him to shoot back more often. Sexton operates a 60mm mortar that is capable of shattering a building. He has been ordered to fire it once. Under Washington’s guidelines, the Marine units must respond “proportionally” to incoming fire. If a sniper sends bullets zinging overhead, the Marines are al- lowed to fire back with a rifle or ma- chine gun, but not with a mortar or cannon. “We have the Druse shooting at us, and from what they say, the Amal (Moslem Shiite militia), also,” he said. “It's little groups out there.” “I know one thing — this place sure makes you homesick,” he said. Staff Sgt. William Jones III, a Day- ton recruiter, said Sexton entered Par- ris Island, S.C., boot camp in April 1982. He had been a student at Wilbur Wright High School. Jones said Sexton listed 225 Linden Ave. as his Dayton address. According to Jones, Sexton's enlist- ment is up in 1986. Sexton said his tour in Lebanon would end Nov. 15. “I can’t wait to go home.” Dayton Journal-Herald - September 20, 1983 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Syria demands Marines leave By Joseph Albright Cox News Service DAMASCUS — Four hours after a cease-fire in Lebanon, Syria declared Monday that the 1,200 U.S. Marine peacekeepers “must depart immediately” for the sake of Lebanon's stability and for their own safety. Abdul Halim Khaddam, Syria’s foreign minister, said ‘the American citizen will pay a lot of blood for an issue which is none of his concern” if the Marines remain and become embroiled in further conflicts. He also called on Britain, France and Italy to pull out the rest of the 5,800-man multinational peace- keeping force and demanded that the four Western nations remove their warships from the coast of Lebanon. “In case of any involvement, these forces will find they are in a true war and not a picnic,” Khaddam said. Saudi Arabia, which played a lead role in arrang- ing the cease-fire and will take part in the reconcilia- tion dialogue between Lebanese factions, shares the Syrian view that the Marines must leave, according to Khaddam. “This matter was not raised during the discussions, although there is a common or joint conclusion be- tween us and the Saudis that the Marines must depart,” he said. The 51-year-old foreign minister, a tough and wily veteran of Syria’s difficult dealings with the United States over the last 13 years, made his remarks in a one-hour taped interview with a correspondent from Cox Newspapers and one other American reporter. Seated in a Syrian silk brocade arm chair in his office, Khaddam — who doubles as Syrian deputy prime minister — offered demitasses of thick, sweet coffee as the interview began. A slender man of about 5-foot-7 with a shock of black hair, he did not smile during the interview. He spoke in Arabic through a translator, occasionally amending a phrase in English he did not like. During the wide-ranging interview — the first by a ranking Syrian official with an American reporter since the Lebanese crisis began on Aug. 28 — Khad- dam said he thought “the present U.S. Marine contin- gent could be the first step toward the Vietnamiza- tion of Lebanon.” “If they are embroiled or involved ... the U.S. administration will be compelled to send 10,000 others and hence it (the administration) will sink in the region and the American citizen will pay a lot of blood for an issue which is none of his concern,” Khaddam said. Asked what Syria would do if the United States does not “depart immediately” as he demanded, Khaddam said Syria would “try to convince the, Americans of the necessity of making a sound decision.” Khaddam’s other key points: ®Troop withdrawal: Syria remains willing to withdraw all its troops from Lebanon provided Israel fulfills two conditions first — withdrawal of its troops from Lebanese territory, and cancellation the spring agreement between Israel and Lebanon end- ing their long state of war. Khaddam said that agree- ment was “imposed under the force of occupation” on Lebanon. © War casualties: No Syrian troops fought in the recent mountain battles near Beirut, “hence there are no casualties, neither killed nor wounded. Had the Americans shelled the Syrian positions, we would have immediately shelled the American positions, and certainly the casualties among the Marines would have been great because our soldiers are good at aiming at targets,” he said. « @Lebanese reconciliation dialogue: Syria expects that through these talks, due to open in Saudi Arabia, the Leba- opposition groups will achieve an equal footing with the Christian langist Party, which, according to dam, now holds a larger share of power than it should under Lebanon's long tradition of sharing power among the several Christian and Moslem fac- tions. ‘“The Board of the National Dia- logue (arranged during cease-fire talks) was chosen on the basis of such a balance,”’ he said. *® American guarantees: ““We did not ask for such guarantees (on observ- ance of cease-fire talxs),\"\"’ Khaddam said. *“‘We shall! not ask for them. And we shall not accept them.”’ The United States ‘“‘guaranteed for us” last year that Israel would withdraw all its forces from Lebanon and yet, “the Israelis never withdrew.”’ He also said Philip Habib, then the U.S. Middle East negotiator, guaran- teed to PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat that Lebanese Christian Phalangist forces would not enter West Beirut if the PLO withdrew. ‘““‘What happened is that the Israelis entered West Beirut and the Phalangists perpetrated the massacres of Sabra and Chatila under the supervision and cooperation of Israel.”’ ; ©The PLO: Last week’s move by Syrian troops to evict feuding PLO armed factions from the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon was ordered in Part in response ‘to the demands of the Lebanese inhabitants . . . to remove the irregular forces contributing confusion to their daily life.’” Another motive was to end confusion among Syrian armed forces caused when rival PLO factions erected roadblocks. © American-Syrian relations: Rela- tions will remain abnormal as long as the United States extends heavy finan- cial and military aid to Israel. Citing an unpublished study by the League of Arab States that claims Israel derives $10 billion a year in American govern- mental and private contributions, Khaddam said, ‘‘Isn’t that enough that relations between us and the U.S.A. be not normal?’ If the United States wants better relations, it must adopt a “balanced policy’’ toward Israel. ® Syrian relations with the Soviet Union: ‘‘Had it not been for this U.S.S.R. assistance, we would have seen the Israelis realize their expansio- nist plans of a state from the Nile to the Euphrates,’’ Khaddam said. Asked how many Soviet military advisers are now in Syria, he said, “‘I don’t have an accurate figure to give ou.” Dayton Journal-Herald - September 27, 1983 (Also Atlanta Journal) \f"

They are the lucky ones. They were airlifted out of the be- sieged oasis town of Faya-Largeau before their 2,000 comrades in Pres- ident Hissene Habre’s northern army were hit by a devastating Li- byan-spearheaded ground attack that began early yesterday. For 10 days their fellow Chadian soldiers had been trapped in the 50-mile-long palm grove and pounded by Libyan fighter-bom- bers, the prelude for yesterday’s as- sault by Chadian rebel ground forces and Libyan tank units. As of Tuesday, 100 wounded sol- diers were trapped in Faya-Largeau in an ill-equipped field clinic, ac- cording to medical sources. “They can’t treat them,” said Dr. Rene Jancovici, 34, a French navy surgeon who runs the hospital under a French government cooper- ation agreement with its former colony. “They have no medication, no fluid for transfusions, no blood.” He has noticed that none of the 138 wounded who have reached Ndjamena in recent weeks had bul- ~ Jet wounds in the stomach. “I don’t receive patients with ab- dominal wounds because they die in one or two days,” said Jancovici. Wounded soldiers told a reporter that the Libyan-led offensive began July 30 when four jets dropped bombs and fired air-to-ground mis- siles on their positions in the Faya- Largeau palm grove. Along with the planes came tanks and troops. Hamid Ouadougou, a 26-year-old soldier, said he counted seven tanks on the first day of the battle July 30. “They had green Libyan ban- ners on their antennas,’ he said. As he spoke, the battle of Faya- Largeau was being fought some 500 air miles to the north, where there are no neutral observers to report what is happening. In Paris, Abderraham Moussa, a spokesman for rebel leader Gouk- ouni Queddei, quickly claimed vic- tory, telling reporters, ‘‘We control the palm grove 100 per cent.” In N'djamena, government infor- mation minister Soumaila Mahamat said, “The situation is serious given the forces being used by the Li- byans.” If indeed Faya-Largeau falls to Libyan-backed rebels, President Habre will have suffered his worst defeat since he stormed into the capital and seized power from then-President Goukouni in June 1982. Even so, Habre still controls the capital as well as the southern half of Chad, where 90 per cent of the population lives. Geography and the rainy season combine to make it difficult for Ha- bre’s enemies to drive south to take N'djamena itself.

McCarthy said he told the Pope about the “great sacrifices” by the Miami community in accepting large numbers of Cuban and Haitian refugees. The archbishop said the Pope made little response except that he was “pleased.” “He’s a fine listener,\" McCarthy said. “‘He was more anxious to hear what we had to say than to talk to us.” At the larger audience with the Miamians, the Pope finished his prepared remarks and then waded through the audience, gripping out- stretched hands and saying a few words to each pilgrim. “It’s like a dream — something we never thought could happen.” said Mary Hayes, secretary of St. Helens parish in Fort Lauderdale, after the event. part,” McCarthy said.~’ “8 “We feel it is Fania likely he will visit Miami.” The Pope beamed and nodded noncommitally today when 200 South Florida Catholics, led by Mc- Carthy on a pilgrimage to Rome and the Holy Land, sang a Miami booster song: “It’s Miami, my Miami... my Miami for you.” The local pilgrims included about 25 priests and more than 150 pa- rishioners, mostly women. The Pope greeted the pilgrims from the Miami archdiocese by say- ing everyone lives in a desperate time ‘stemming from sin and evil,” and adding, ‘We have great faith in Christ, so we never lose faith. “Christ is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end,” the Pope told pilgrims gathered on wooden chairs in the marble-walled Sala Clementina, an ante-chamber near the Pope's private apartment three floors above St. Peter’s Square. ~ McCarthy said that in his private meeting with the Pope, he and two other bishops made a strong pitch about the advantages of visiting Miami. “He teased us a little bit about the temperature,” McCarthy said. “He knew it was very warm in the summer.” One well-placed source said the Pope is committed to visit Canada in 1984, and for protocol reasons is unable to visit the United States prior to the Canadian trip. The source said, however, that the Pope was likely to visit the United States in 1985. McCarthy’s one-hour private heeting with the Pope included the two Miami auxiliary bishops, John J. Nevins and Agustin Roman. The archbishop said he reported on the condition of the Miami archdiocese, as each archbishop is called on to do every five years.

DePaoli has worked ever since as one of the three private secretaries ; in this important office on the third floor of the Apostolic Palace, just outside the Pope’s apartments and three floors above St. Peter's square. DePaoli first served Cardi- nal Jean Villot and more recently the current Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Augostino Casse- role. “I see a little bit of everything that everyone (in the diplomatic service) is sending in,” said DePaoli of his job as private secretary. But major church decisions, such as Pope John Paul’s trip to Poland, were reached on a higher .level without his involvement. Casserole, his boss and mentor, is flying to Miami to officiate at De- Paoli’s consecration as bishop on Nov. 20. The Vatican secretary of state is making a cross-country American tour that will include a ' of chance. file photo major speech in San Francisco on “The Holy See and Efforts for Peace” on November 18. DePaoli's 88-year-old father, his mother and a sister — all still living in Miami — are expected to witness his consecration as a bishop. In fact, | he already holds the rank of titular archbishop, a title he was given Sept. 23 when he was designated as the Vatican's representative to Sri Lanka. ' DePaoli was born in Jeanette, Pa., on Aug. 19, 1934. He grew up hearing Italian and English because his parents had emigrated from the Piedmont region of Italy in 1931. At age nine he moved with his family to Miami. He was enrolled immediately in the St. Mary’s Ca- thedral School, even though it was more than 100 blocks from his house. His earliest memory of Miami during World War II: “There were more servicemen than civilians. They were living in all ihe hotels.” In school DePaoli worked as business manager of his high school yearbook and found time between his studies to serve as an altar boy entry into the Vatican diplomatic service was a matter After graduating from St. Mary’s Cathedral School in 1952 as the second-ranking student, DéePaoli went on to St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield, Conn., and Mt.

William Lehman (D- Fla.), a staunch Israel supporter who returned recently from a visit to Israel and Lebanon, thinks we ought to get our troops out of the mess. He says our mission there would uire thousands of addi- tional U.S. troops, and Congress would not make a commitment of that size. What is needed, obviously, is a negotiated political settlement, but that opportunity was dimin- ished when Washington failed to persuade Israel to keep its army in the areas of conflict. It is difficult to see how the diplomatic effort is much helped by the presence of U.S. troops who can’t even defend themselves, let alone impose peace on a half-doz- en warring factions. Lehman is right when he says Lebanon was a no-win situation for the Israelis and it is a no-win situation for us. \f"

        "ocr_text": " AFGHANISTAN Glimpses of a Holy War As the Soviets launch a spring offensive, the guerrillas hang tough Ever since Soviet tanks first rumbled across the border in December 1979, Af- ghanistan has been an isolated land of mystery and misery. Some 3.3 million Af- ghans—20% of the population—are in ex- tle, most of them in Pakistan. But little is known of the conditions they left behind. This spring Joseph Albright, chief foreign correspondent for Cox Newspapers, and Marcia Kunstel, a freelance reporter, spent six weeks between them in separate travels through the strife-ridden nation. Their Joint report for TIME: explosions boomed every five sec- onds across the Shomali region of northeast Afghanistan, as Soviet tanks and artillery fired more than 1,000 shells at suspected guerrilla hideouts. Every 15 minutes, in reply, came the resounding rattle of heavy machine-gun fire as the guerrillas aimed, in vain, at two helicopter gunships circling high above the green plains. That evening tanks could be heard clanking through the darkness. By morn- ing they were gone. Such were the sounds of the Soviet spring offensive, vintage 1983, perhaps the most savage assault since the invasion. There are, according to Western esti- mates, some 105,000 Soviet troops now in Afghanistan. Using tanks, helicopters and fighter-bombers, these forces pound- ed villages throughout the Shomali re- gion. Their objective, presumably, was to obliterate guerrilla strength around the crucial 50-mile stretch of highway leading from Kabul toward the Soviet border, along which the invaders transport their supplies. Meantime, according to West- ern intelligence reports, Soviet bombers were attacking targets near Herat in the west and around Kandahar in the south. They apparently hope that by demolish- ing villages they can devastate local agri- culture and drive the residents from areas that might otherwise lend support to the insurgents. As Abdul Haq, a guerrilla commander interviewed in Pakistan, points out, “Every kind of supply for the mujahedin [warriors] comes from the ci- vilian population. It makes trouble when the villages are empty.” Whatever its wider aims, the offensive failed to squelch the guerrillas, who num- ber anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000. Bolstered by their religious zeal—and, more practically, by a flow of arms and supplies from abroad—they are grimly determined to rid their homeland of the hated invader. “The Islamic faith is the force behind our jihad [holy warl,” says Rebel Unit Commander Mohammed An- war. “If we thought this was an ordinary battle, we could not fight the Soviets. 50 F or two hours after dawn, thunderous In the heat of battle: a guerrilla attack lights up the night sky over Kabul ay A! ¢ afi Along the sidelines: rebels scramble down arocky hillsi = ae a — ide toward a Severnment target Photographs for TIME by Aral/Flandrin/Reza—Sipa/Black Star TIME, JUNE 20, 1983 Time - June 20, 1983 \f through a camp established amid the rubble of a shattered Afghan village d destroy Afghanistan in two ee if we believe God has promised us victory because we are right, it becomes quite feasible.” That determination has won some battles. Only last week one Western analyst claimed that guerrillas killed some 200 government soldiers dur- ing a three-day battle, while forcing the rest of the unit to desert. Elsewhere, one young fighter claimed to have knocked out two Soviet tanks in a single day; an- other boasted that on the same day he had killed five enemy soldiers. Declared a errilla radio operator named Miroja- deca: “We will fight until our blood runs out—ten, 20, 100 years. the guerrillas also fight vehe- mently among themselves. The So- viet invasion has sparked friction between ethnic Tajiks and ethnic Push- s and thrown gasoline on centuries- tun. feuds between Shi‘ite Muslims and Sunni Muslims, and between pro-Iranian Shiites and independent Shi‘ites. The errilla movement is thus fragmented into hundreds of units organized along vil- lage lines, each loosely affiliated with one of the six major resistance groups. Based in Pakistan, the leaders of most of those groups are quite unable to control events at the front. The divisions are so deep, moreover, that in the absence of a foreign enemy, Afghanistan might be plunged j ivil war. aaa the moment, the Soviet strategy has tipped the scales in Moscow’s favor. Largely as a result of widespread devasta- tion—which has brought high prices in the wake of shortages of labor, fuel, fertil- izer and seed—Afghanistan’s agriculture +s fast deteriorating. According to one es- tcasite, wheat production was five times TIME, JUNE 20, 1983 greater in 1978 than it was last year. In the Logar province and in isolated vil- lages around the country, entire settle- ments have been reduced to ghost towns. One such tragedy took place in the medium-size farming community of Dasht-e-Rivat (pop. 1,800 in the past), many of whose inhabitants fled on the third day of bombing in April 1982. Scrambling up a goat path into the 14,000-ft. mountains along the southern edge of the Hindu Kush, the fugitives took nothing with them but thin clothing, a little bread © and some dried mulberry © flour. For 40 days they | hid behind boulders and in © mountain caves. Each night it snowed; each day they saw Soviet planes bomb and strafe the valley below. The fatalities included 40 adults and about 70 children—20 5 having died from the bomb- ings and as many as 50 from the cold or hunger. Perhaps 1,200 refugees trekked for 27 days over seven high mountain ranges before reaching safety in a Paki- stani refugee camp. Some semblance of normal life has now returned to Dasht-e-Rivat. Farmers can be seen working the fields with wood- en plows; young men mix straw and mud to patch bomb holes. One sagging roof is Propped up by an unexploded Soviet bomb. But in villages like Jakdalag, 30 miles east of Kabul, the relentless assault upon civilians has taken its toll on the guerrillas.

Since bombs first began tearing the community apart three years ago, all its farmers and all but one of its 400 families have left. Rebels now sleep in blankets on the dirt floors amid mangled stoves and the carcasses of homes. They are forced to spend less time on training than on tending scant wheat crops or washing clothes. “I’ve told the freedom fighters to start cultivating and doing farm work,” sighs Mohammed Anwar, while making bread. “But it is difficult _... when mujahedin must do “this too.” f Yet members of the only remaining family, that of the village’s Muslim law judge, are uncompromising. Says Shababubu, the judge’s wife: “When the [Afghan] army came, they said, ‘You belong in America or Pakj- stan.’ I said, ‘No. We are Muslims. We will stay. You belong in the Soviet Union.’” Her brother-in- law Lolgul held the depart- ed villagers in special con- tempt: “All the village js afraid of bombardment Only a few stayed. Dirty people, fright. ened people left.” The insurgents are fired by a religious conviction that is equally immovable Prayer is routine; liquor is forbidden. Communism is often disparagingly linked to atheism. One aged nomad confessed to liking Americans because “they have a book,” the Bible. Often a rebel will cradle prayer beads in his hand while toting a Kalashnikov on his shoulder. Even rela- tively sophisticated guerrillas remain qui- etly optimistic. According to Farouq \f/Azam, political director of an alliance of relatively moderate guerrilla groups, the , rebels’ tenacious resistance has altered the geopolitical balance of power in the region: “Before the war, Pakistan was not able to get $500,000 [in Western aid]. Now it is not happy with $500 million.” The appraisal of Commander Abdul Haq is equally hopeful: ““We do not say we will destroy the entire Soviet army. But we can make trouble for them. If outside nations really push them, and if we continue fighting for a very long time, maybe the Soviet Union will change its mind.” That kind of conviction has won the rebels widespread support among their compatriots. The war is a sporadic thing in most of the country, and the guerrillas spend much of their time chatting over tea or working in the fields. As soon as bombs explode in their region, however, they can usually mobilize every suitable male. Since nearly all schools in the rural areas are closed—the government claims that guerrillas were killing teachers, and the guerrillas contend that the Soviets bombed some schools and ordered the government to close others—many guer- rilla recruits are teen-agers motivated by TW) hatred for the Shuravi (Soviets). FN he youths can prove valuable, and occasionally dangerous. Some have been recruited by KhAD, the Af- ghan secret police, to provide information on guerrilla activities. More frequently, they serve the mujahedin. Since they are allowed to cross Soviet checkpoints if they are unarmed, they can carry messages, procure supplies and cause some damage. Last year one ten-year-old reportedly Stole across Soviet lines and planted a mine between two enemy camps, one So- viet and one Afghan. When a Soviet sol- dier stepped on it the following day, his foot was blown off. His outraged compan- ions blamed their allies.

Nevertheless, Western diplomats in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad believe that the U.S. Government has refused to provide heavy artillery in deference to Pakistan’s wish that the fighting be limited. Since the rebels lack transporta- tion, heavy equipment and medicine, they must rely on resilience and re- sourcefulness. Their principal aim is to stem the tide of refugees. Along the exit route in the Panjshir Valley, for example, they check the papers of every would-be emigrant, turning back those without appropriate mu- jahedin documentation. In battle, the rebels specialize in bushwhacking tank columns, raiding army garri- sons, blowing up power lines and as- sassinating members of the KhAD. #7 Using Soviet land mines fished out of } the ground with wooden pitchforks, they destroyed at least twelve enemy tanks in the Panjshir Valley last year. “We destroy their tanks in such a way that they cannot find the pieces,” gloats Insurgent Strategist Mohammed om “Tt has a good ological effect.” See ie of the Panjshir Valley is unquestionably the charismatic com- mander Ahmad Shah Massoud. A former engineering student, Massoud, 29, has re- mained in Afghanistan and worked tire- lessly to galvanize support. He has man- aged to mobilize virtually ‘ all 100,000 inhabitants of the valley, while collecting his own taxes, running his own schools and organizing his own food-rationing scheme. He has even used captured Soviet trucks to establish daily bus service in the valley. Massoud is also prudent enough to avoid needless risks. He travels with four gun-wielding bodyguards and packs a S-mm automatic under his jacket. In or- der to elude the KhAD, he sleeps in a dif- ferent house each night. : The 75-mile-long valley is a monu- to his efforts. Around it are strewn the remains of 17 Soviet tanks, 29 trucks, dozen helicopters and planes and, guer- miles claim, 1,000 Soviet soldiers. Green ment Guerrillas summarily IME, JUNE 20, 1983 execute a self-professed deserter who had been expose Mujahedin special commandos in training Islamic flags mark the graves of 180 slain rebels. In March, however, Massoud unexpectedly reached a private, tempo- rary cease-fire with the Soviet military command in Kabul. Soviet troops with- drew from Rokha in the central Panjshir; they were allowed to maintain a base in Anawa provided they did not come into contact with locals. The agreement alarmed even some of Massoud’s admir- ers. Says Mohammed Anwar: “If there is no fighting in the Panjshir, it is bad for all Afghanistan. It means that there are more Soviet soldiers to go elsewhere.” Such dissension is the last thing that the already faction-ridden guerrilla forces need. As it is, a bitter vendetta separates the two most powerful guerrilla groups, the Hizbe-Islami (Islamic Party) and the Jamiat-I-Islami (Islamic Associa- tion). Both are composed of fundamental- 3) \", as Time - June 20, 1983 (Continued) ist Sunni Muslims, yet neither will join with the other. Thus, while the rebels guarantee safe passage to most captured government defectors (10,000 a year by one estimate), they continue to foil one another. Last fall, for example, the Hizbe troops confis- cated ammunition belonging to the Jamiat forces. Each side also accuses the other of harboring collaborators, and both may be right. Western in- telligence analysts claim that the brightest graduates of the Afghan military academy are sometimes sent to infiltrate guerrilla-held villages disguised as deserters. Meanwhile, the flood of refugees continues, even though the monthly rate has shrunk from a high of 120,000 during the war’s early stages, to 8,000 this year. Most of those who have fled the country live in squalid Pakistani camps, but find that their basic needs are met. Cush- ioned by international aid totaling $1.5 million a day, they are assured of steady food, shelter, medicine and a monthly cash stipend of around $3.80 per person. In addition there are schools for children, a rare luxu- ry in Afghanistan. Pakistani President Mohammed Zia al-Haq has repeatedly declared that the camps are only a temporary haven. Repa- triation, however, would require a negoti- ated political settlement, and that possibil- ity seems remote. Meanwhile, to millions of Afghans, subsistence in the camps seems preferable to misery at home. In that sense the cause of the mujahedin has weakened, though not decisively. “The So- viets would have to double or triple their forces to crush the rebels,”’ says one West- ern analyst with access to intelligence re- ports. So the war drags on, making the de- termination of the insurgents seem as forlorn as it is fierce. Back in Jakdalag, Shababubu, the judge’s wife, innocently looks forward to seeing her departed friends. “After Afghanistan’s liberation,” she says, “‘all the people will come back.” She will have a long wait. ie im d, during interrogation, as a government spy \f"

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service ROME — Yup, it’s different from being a tourist, this new job they have given me as a foreign corre- spondent based in Rome. I still remember staying in Rome the first time. I was 17 and I hit town with a backpack and a guidebook. Stayed at a youth hostel. is time I had to rent a panel truck from Hertz to cart all the typewriters, files, books and other forget-me-nots that I managed to cram into the airplane by paying $67 a crate for overweight bags. Drove through the buzzing swarm of Fiats all the way downtown into the Piazza Venezia. Not a dent on the truck — until I tried to squeeze into a medieval via, around two parked Fiats, and to the little piazza where I share an office with the Associated Press. It was only a little scratch. In the last three weeks, I have had only one brush with the Italian legal system. That was when I went before a notary public as the final step in buying my new apartment. sing a notary public is a much bigger deal than back home. The are in effect public figures wi some of the powers and attributes of a judge. The notary functions as part tax-collector, part title- searcher, part mediator. The gov- ernment controls the number of notaries, meaning those who are lucky enough to get appointed can live well on the fees. At noon, I found myself in the notary’s office, eyeing his antique desk, his Oriental rugs, his three religious pictures and his smashing view of the Tiber River. Sitting beside me, facing the notary’s desk, was the apartment owner, whose name translates into English as Francis Strawberry- apple. Also my lawyer, the seller's lawyer and our joint real estate agent. We had no sooner sat down than the notary asked my lawyer for my investment number. With pride at having understood the system, I ulled out a green form from the talian government. No, wrong number. That was my new fiscal number, which means I am recorded on the computers of the Italian tax authorities. But what the notary needed was my invest- ment number, assigned by a bank to satisfy the requirements of still another bureaucracy, which applies the country’s labyrinthine currency exchange control rules. What is an investment number’? I asked. Oh, that’s the number given to your purchase of an apartment. Without it, you could not take your money back out of Italy should you later want to sell the apartment. Rush call to bank, which happens to be the Rome branch of an Ameri- can bank. Notary looks at me sternly. Tomasso, the main bank rson, is out to lunch. An assistant ooks up the right number. Problem resolved. For the next two hours, the notary reads the real estate contract line by line in Italian. My eyes wander out the window. Just below, someone is rowing in the Tiber. Off on the horizon I can see the slightly yellowing white marble of monuments that have been there since Augustus Caesar. I am struck by the horrifying fact that in my few weeks here, I have been rushing around so much that I have not even visited the Colos- seum, the Borghese Museum, the The notary’s voice startles me. At nearly 2 p.m., it is finally time to pay. I produce six certified checks, several of 1 million liras apiece and several more denominated in the tens of millions of liras. I also lay on the notary’s antique desk a wad of 500,000 liras in folding money from my wallet. That’s the way it goes when there are 1,383 liras to the dollar. The notary collects 10 percent of the purchase price from me: rec- ording taxes which go to the central government of Italy, not to the city of Rome. Then he collects another 10 percent or so from Strawberry- apple. That was Italian capital gains tax, a form of tax the govern- ment collects right away upon every real estate sale. One way they know they are getting their money. Another three-fourths of one percent went to the notary for his work, which had included the title search on the apartment. I walked out of there with the keys. Now all I have to do is get someone to install a refrigerator, a stove, a washing machine, kitchen cabinets, closets in the bedroom. It would also be nice to find someone to put in some light fixtures. Right now all I have are some bare wires hanging from the ceiling. Just a quaint Italian custom, I am told. When someone sells an apart- ment, he or she moves out with the works. Wilmington News-Journal March 6, 1983 \f"
