Unlike larger embassies, this one is not equipped to grant visas. Abd it has no Marine guards. ‘The new embassy, which the State ent rents from the Vatican, has been used by Wilson since last February in his capacity as Reagan's personal envoy to the Holy See. The six-room suite is sparsely deco- rated, with walls bearing a photo- graph of Reagan and a map of Vatican . There are no religious decora- tidns. But one U.S. diplomat tells a visjtor, “Perhaps we should put up a picture of the pope.” ‘With a minimum of fanfare, Presi- dent Reagan last week announced the resumption of full diplomatic rela- tions with the Vatican, 127 years after anti-papal fervor in America prompt- ed the departure of the last U.S. full- fledged minister to the Holy See. Since 1939 each American president has sent unofficial, parttime envoys to the Vatican who have operated in what one diplomat called “a nether- world.” By naming an ambassador to the Vatican, President Reagan has nour- ished the prospect that the pope may play a more ambitious role in at- tempting to mediate great world con- troversies involving nuclear weapons, poverty and the Middle East. At the same time, Reagan has rekin- dled a domestic controversy over sep- aration of church and state just three weeks before he is scheduled to an- nounce his candidacy for reelection. Many of America’s 52 million American Catholics were delighted. But disapproving statements arose from a chorus of other spectators, in- cluding the Moral Majority, the Amer- ican Jewish Congress, the Baptist Committee on Public Affairs, the Sev- enth-day Adventists and the National Council of Churches. Even some Cath- dlics, including writers in the Jesuit meet America, raised a note of cau- on. _ Although opponents have talked of thwarting Wilson’s confirmation, the issue has not fomented as much pas- sion as it did when President Harry Truman tried unsuccessfully to name Gen. Mark Clark as his Vatican am- bassador in 1951. Last fall, there was virtually no op- position, only yawns, while Congress was repealing a 116-year-old ban on funding an embassy to the Vatican. For Pope John Paul II, winning full diplomatic relations with Washington rates among the more tangible achievements in his bold and energet- ic five-year papacy. “A big conquest” for the pope, as the respected Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera put it. The Vatican has formal relations with 108 countries. England and the Scandinavian countries have an- nounced diplomatic ties to the Holy See in the past two years. The pope will have ambassadors from virtually every country with a Catholic or Prot- estant majority. He also has ambassadors from a respectable number of non-Christian states, including Iran, Syria, Japan and Albania. The only world powers not represented at Israel, the Soviet Union and China. The Vatican has the oldest and one of the most sophisticated diplomatic services in the world. As early as 1,000 AD., the Vatican was regularly re- ceiving dispatches from representa- tives detailed abroad for extended pe- riods. In the late 18th century the Papal States, which then governed most of what is now Italy, began trade relations with the fl United States of America by opening two sea- ports on the Italian to American ships. The Vatican also maintained consuls in the U.S. until 1895. Americans, impressed by the liberal leanings of Pope Pius IX, sent a minister to the Vatican in 1848. But formal diplomatic relations withered away in 1867, six months after Con- gress banned the use of public funds to * maintain a diplomatic mission to the Vatican. The decision was partly a reflection of the anti-Catholic preju- dice then in full bloom in the U.S. — and especially in the Bible-thumping South This sentiment, which gave rise to the anti-Catholic Know-Nothing party in the 1850s, was largely rooted in economic and social resentment against poor Catholic immigrants who had poured in from Ireland, Germany and elsewhere since the 1820s. Congress had more concrete rea- sons for closing the U.S. mission to the Holy See, however. For one thing, the new kingdom of Italy had by then captured most of the pope's worldly territory, reducing the Holy See to little but a religious domain. And for another, Protestant lobbyists were in- flamed over an incident in Rome in which a Presbyterian church was forced to close, presumably at the be- hest of the Vatican. Vatican are Shurch-State Controversy Rufus King, then the U.S. minister to the Vatican, remained in Rome for six months waiting for instructions. He sailed home without notifying the Vatican or formally breaking rela- tions. In 1939, President Franklin D. Roo- sevelt decided to circumvent the spirit of the ban when he announced he was sending a “personal representative,” Myron Taylor, to the Vatican to serve as his listening post in Mussolini’s Ita- ly. Taylor remained in Rome, living inside the Vatican, throughout World War II. Each succeeding president has sent unofficial representatives. In the last administration, President Jimmy Car- ter named Robert Wagner, the former mayor of New York, to visit the Vati- can from time to time. Ambassador-designate Wilson, a 69- year-old California real estate devel- oper and friend of Reagan, has devot- ed considerably more time to his duties as unofficial envoy than any of his predecessors since Taylor. Wilson has rented a house in Rome and spent roughly half of each year in Rome without a salary. He was in Los Angeles when Reagan announced the upgrading of Vatican relations. So far, Reagan and John Paul, who are among the world’s | extro- verts, have been remarkably low-key about their new diplomatic ties. But political realities on both sides of the Atlantic make an exchange of visits likely: Reagan to Rome in the spring of 1984, John Paul to the U.S. in , 1985. Palm Beach Post January 15 ,1984 \f"

Sheikh Abbas Harb, the religious leader of the 1,500 Shiite Moslems who make up this farming community, is being held at an undisclosed place for interrogation without formal charges, an Israeli military spokesman said. Two of Harb’s brothers and at least eight other young men in the town are also under arrest, according to Inter- Mational Red Cross sources. The Israeli spokesman, Maj. Zeev Natan, said at an Israeli headquarters near Sidon, Lebanon, that “large quan- tities’ of ammunition were seized in the town by Israeli soldiers. He said the soldiers surrounded the town last Saturday, then searched houses and rounded up a list of suspects prepared in advance by Israeli intelligence offi- cers. Since Jan. 1 one Israeli soldier has been killed and seven injured in 17 attempted assaults on Israeli soldiers Stationed in Southern Lebanon, ac- cording to Natan. The incident has provoked a local _ rebellion by Lebanese Shiites, symbol- ized by unsuccessful attempts Satur- _day to barricade the town to block Harb’s arrest, followed by a marathon prayer vigil for his release. The five-day continuing vigil has brought a stream of Shiite clerics and local Shiite political leaders from oth- er towns throughout Southern Leba- mon to join Harb’s wife, father and Palm Beach Post - January 27, 1984 neighbors in a mosque plastered with on of Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah eini. Israeli military sources said Harb is thought to have with talist Shiite groups based in Baalbeck, Lebanon, the reputed training ground of suicide bombers who last year struck American, French and Israeli military compounds in Lebanon. The sources provided no details or descrip- tion of evidence against the cleric. The Harb incident has complicated Israeli government efforts to work out a security agreement with Lebanese Shiites so that Israeli troops can be withdrawn from Southern Lebanese territory they sccopiee 19 months ago to drive out the PLO. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens said in an Israeli radio inter- view this week that Israel is seeking the same kind of agreement with the Shiites that it reached with Lebanon’s Druse community before the Israelis pulled out of the central Chouf Moun- tains on Sept. 4. “The Druse don’t kill Jews, the Druse don’t let guerrillas enter the Chouf and act against us,”’ Arens said. “We would like to repeat the same model with the Shiites.” But in the wake of the Harb arrest, Lebanese Shiites appear to be in an increasingly bitter mood. One sign came yesterday when a member of a pro-Israeli militia was found shot to death outside the pre- dominantly Shiite town of Nabatiyeh, about 15 miles northeast of Hallou- siyeh. As an indication of the depth of anti- Israeli feeling in Hallousiyeh, half a dozen residents insisted to a reporter that Israeli soldiers had ripped up Harb’s copy of the Koran, the Moslem holy book. \f"

The Marines are unquestionably safer now. They sleep beneath three to seven feet of dirt and steel in new underground bunkers. They have sniffer dogs to detect bombs and zig-zag barriers to keep out terrorists. They have better intelligence and more firepower. But they are still in low-lying, highly ex- posed positions which come under hostile fire more often than is announced. Their headquarters, instead of being crammed in a single building, is now dug into a network of buried, widely dispersed bunkers near the runway. A dedicated terrorist could still conceiv- ably evade Lebanese airport security and drive inside the Marine compound. But there is a good chance the driver would be stopped by Marine guards who now have clearly defined orders: They can shoot. Even if the driver gets through, the casualties from a truck bombing are likely to be far fewer now because the Marines have been scattered.

Lt. Col. Ray Smith, speaking three days be- fore the latest Marine casualties in Lebanon, said the Marines are now in “a good security position” in Beirut after three months of exhaus- tive work to deepen bunkers and install anti-ter- rorist barriers. “Given warning, and given time for every- one to get into their fighting positions, it would take very lucky hits or a real bombardment to inflict any casualties, any significant casualties,” Smith said in an interview with the Cox News- rs, on he made it clear that Marines don’t always have the luxury of advance warning, “As long as you are working outside, there is always the potential that you are going to take some casualties,” he said. | The only way to reach a point where there there is virtually no possibility of Marine casual- ies “is to completely live underground, like a great SAC (Strategic Air Command) command center,” he said. Smith said it would be “counterproductive” for the Marines to do that, explaining at one point that part of the mission of the Marings in i q Lebanon is to show their presence in Lebanon, He said the U.S. government has spent more than §$2 million since October on materials and equipment to reinforce bunkers and otherwise enhance the security of the compound where 1,600 Marines are stationed. Asked about whether the Marines would be safer if they slept aboard ships and shuttled to duty each day aboard helicopters, he replied: “I don’t believe, in all honesty, given what we have done here, that there’s a lot of sense in moving us to a different place.” Smith, 37, is widely viewed within the Ma- rine Corps as among its best field commanders, He led the battalion on its successful landing in Grenada last fall and then on to Beirut to re- place the Marine survivors of the Oct. 23 truck bombing of the Marine headquarters that killed 242 servicemen, « Smith was one of the most highly decorated Marines in the Vietnam War, winning two silver stars, a bronze star and a Navy cross.

The way to do so, he advised, is to bring about a “national coalition” involving all elements of the war-weary Lebanese society. He maintained that it would be “very easy” to achieve a national reconciliation in Lebanon, if only Syria did not interfere. He said Syria is attempting to dominate Lebanon as part of an eventual design to take © over Lebanon, Israel and Jordan. Shamir thus threw his weight be- hind President Reagan in the coming congressional debates in Washington on whether to withdraw the 1,600. American Marines in Beirut as part of a US.-French-Italian-British peacekeeping force. The United States sent the Marines to Beirut as part of a multinational force in 1982 in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The Ma- rines were initially dispatched to serve as a buffer between Israeli and PLO units during the PLO’s evacua- tion from Lebanon. Once the PLO left, the Marines were withdrawn. The subsequent assassination of Lebanese President Bashir Gemayel and the massacres at the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps led Reagan to order the Marines back to Beirut in September 1982, where they have been since. Shamir, ir. an interview in English with a group of American reporters and researchers, said Israel] is deter- mined to work out “security arrang- ments” of its own in Southern Leba- non. Their objective, he said, is to insure “forever” that terrorists will not harm Israelis living in Northern Israel. He said he hopes to achieve ade- quate security arrangements “very _ go thro soon” through unspecified forms of “cooperation” between the Israeli Army and various local Lebanese forces in Southern Lebanon. Other Israeli sources said Shamir was referrring, in part, to strengthen- ing the militia of the late Maj. Saad Haddad, now said to number about 2,000 fighters. Before Haddad’s re- cent death of cancer, the Israelis counted on him to screen out Pales- tinian and other terrorists bent on infiltrating across the border into Is- rael. But his death has led to a local leadership vacuum, with several mili- tia officers vying for leadership. Shamir refused to be pinned down on when the Israeli Army might pull out of Lebanon, underlining that Is- rael is determined to prevent “forever” the re- establishment of a “terrorist infrastructure” in Southern Lebanon. Shamir said Israel hopes President Amin Gemayel remains in power. But he said Israel believes the se- curity of its territory and citizens “does not depend on the fate of any Lebanese government.” He said he still hopes Lebanon will ugh with implementation of the May 17, 1983, Israel-Lebanon troop withdrawal agreement despite adamant Syrian objections and sec- ‘ond thoughts by Gemayel and others in the Lebanese government.

        "ocr_text": "Various sides in Lebanon agree 2 Israeli mistakes led to chaos By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Con Mews Service RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — In tracing what went wrong that led to the disin- tegration of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel'’s authority, it is instructive to see where the explanations of the Arabs, Israelis and Americans coin- cide. They disagree on almost everything. But one common thread emerges from two dozen interviews in Beirut, Tel Aviv, Amman and Riyadh over the last three weeks. It is this: In retrospect, the Israeli army made two mistakes after it com- pleted its military invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. Although they didn’t seem impor- tant at the time, they combined to pit religious faction against religious fac- tion in a vicious mountain war that eventually undercut Gemayel’s political consensus among Mosiems. THE FIRST mistake came when the Israeli occupation forces alldwed armed Christian militiamen to enter and take up positions within Druse- controlled territory in Lebanon's cen- tral Chouf Mountains in June 1982. Second, on Sept. 4, the Israeli troops suddenly pulled back from the Chouf to southern Lebanon without allowing Gemayel’s Lebanese army time to move into blocking positions to keep the Christians and Druse fighters from making war on each other. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Feisal, in an interview Wednesday, viewed these events through the standard prism of Saudi mistrust of the Israelis. As Saud saw it, Israel deliberately created havoc to persuade Americans that only Israeli occupation can bring order in the Middle East. Israeli army spokesman Col. Raanan Gissan, in an interview in Tel Aviv last weekend, said the Israeli army did make some mistakes after occupying central Lebanon in 1982. AS FOR WHY the Israelis pulled out of the Chouf before the Lebanese army was ready to replace them, Gissan said, ““We vacated because we wanted to put ourselves outside the factional warfare we could not control.” He did not comment on where the Christian and Druse militias obtained their arms. But Western diplomatic sources, interviewed in Beirut two weeks ago, said that beginning shortly after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982, the Israelis gave large quantities of artillery, small arms and ammunition to their Phalangist allies. These sources said the Israelis gradually underwent a change of heart about the Druse in the Chouf, partly in response to protests from Israel's Druse minority about favoritism to the Lebanese Phalangist forces. According to these Western diplo- mats, Israeli troops in the Chouf al- lowed the Druse militias to obtain weapons from a variety of sources — including the Syrians. THE ISRAELIS are not the only ones who bear responsibility for the erosion of Gemayel’s authority. Foremost among his problems, of course, were the Syrians, who never forgave him for signing the May 17, 1983, Lebanon-Israeli peace agreement that Syria viewed as another separate peace in the mode of the Camp David acord. Without weighing all the stones thrown in his path by his enemies, it is worth wondering whether Gemayeéel and his allies have not missed some critical opportunities to save them- selves. © Why didn’t Gemayel act more decisively a month ago to settle the squabble in the Lebanese army about whether 57 Druse officers could be put back on the promotion list even though they sat out the mountain war? IN EARLY January, Lebanese Druse leader Walid Jumblatt was ready to accept a Saudi-sponsored “security plan” for the redeployment of Leba- nese army and militia units throughout the country — if only Gemayel would accept his demand to reinstate the Druse officers. In the end, Gemayel refused to com- mit himself to the promotions, and Jumblatt jacked up his demands. © Why didn’t the United States begin its withdrawal of the Marines Sept. 26, when the factions agreed to a ceasefire and headed for Geneva for reconciliation talks? The Marines have become such a symbol of American resolve in the Middle East that Jordan’s Foreign Minister Taher Masri said last week that it would be a disaster and a Syr- ian victory if they were to be with- drawn anytime soon. In almost identical terms, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said last weekend that if the Marines pull out before the United States pieces to- gether a national political coalition in Lebanon, it would be a Syrian or Soviet victory that would have very great repercussions throughout the Middle East.

        "ocr_text": "Jordan king has proposal for province of Palestine By Joseph Albright Cox News Service AMMAN, Jordan — Imagine Yasser Arafat as governor of a land called Palestine covering most of oe is now the Israeli-occupied West ink. Arafat would have his own police but not an army. He would raise the flag of the Palestine Liberation ation over perhaps 700,000 Palestinian Arabs in an area no larger than Delaware. He could col- lect taxes, kiss babies and issue zoning permits. But the Palestinian West Bank would not be a nation. It would be a royal province within the kingdom of Jordan after Jordan has made peace with Israel. That, behind the thousand veils of Middle East diplomacyy is the es- sence of what King Hussein of Jordan has been trying to do in recent weeks, urged on by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Both Mubarak and Hussein are in Washington for meetings with Presi- dent Reagan and other administra- tion officials. Reagan, after a meeting with Hus- sein Monday, insisted that “opportunities for a broader peace are still present” in the region. Hussein is due back in Jordan in mid-February to receive a visit from Arafat. The state visit from the state- less PLO chairman is expected to begin sometime between Feb. 20 and March 1 and last severa Constitution February 14, abet er) Hussein is expected to give Arafat a signal any Southern politician could pick up. The royal message, adorned in flowery Arabic politeness, will amount to this: “Dear brother Yasser, the train is leaving. If you want to get aboard, now is the time. Because if you don’t, I very well might decide to make peace with the Israelis without you. And then the West Bank will be mine and not yours.” Whether Arafat will agree to put aside his dreams for an independent Palestinian nation is an open ques- tion. But already Hussein has begun to establish himself as a negotiator for the Palestinians, as if he intends to move ahead without Arafat. In a re- shuffle of the royal Cabinet, the king named Taher Masri, a Palestinian- born Jordanian banker, as his foreign minister. “We want land and they (the Israe- lis) want peace,” Masri said in an interview. “We are ready for peace, with all the implications of peace. When we say land, we mean sover- eignty over the land.” Hussein also summoned the Jorda- nian Parliament into session after a 10-year hiatus. The new Parliament promptly appointed seven West Bank alestinians, all Jordanian loyalists, to fill vacant seats in the lower house. Israeli officials have expressed skepticism that Hussein really wants ce talks. They have allowed the arliament members to travel rela- tively freely from the occupied West Bank to Amman. Hussein's recall of Parliament marked his most overt challenge in a decade to the stand on Palestine adopted at a 1974 Arab summit in Rabat, Morocco. A resolution at that summit recognized the PLO as the “sole legitimate representative” of Hussein, emboldened by the split in the PLO and Arafat’s recent eviction from Tripoli, Lebanon, did notify Arafat's entourage about his plans. Hussein, however, did not seek Ara- fat’s permission, and Arafat did not object. One school of thought contends that after forced out of Lebanon, Arafat will feel free to be pragmatic, and to allow Hussein to negotiate as his proxy. But most of Hussein’s advisers doubt that contention. “There is a strong feeling here that he will not change ... that he will remain a cha- meleon,” said one Westerner close to the royal family. Foreign Minister Masri put it a bit more gently: “Ara- fat is not a decisive man.” In his talks with Arafat, the king plans to argue that it is vital to strive for West Bank talks this year, before Israel covers the whole West Bank with Jewish settlers and converts the Jordan River into its de facto perma- nent boundary. After 1984, possibly as late as 1985, Hussein and his advisers believe there will be nothing left to negotiate. Rejecting that argument is Arafat loyalist Abu Jihad, the PLO military chief of staff. “We cannot be black- mailed by the slogan that the earth will soon be out of our hands,” he said in an interview. Jihad, while clinging to some hope for agreement between Arafat and the king, made clear that even the Arafat wing of the PLO hasn’t much expectation of early success with the Americans and Israelis. “We believe that in the coming two years nothing will happen,” he said. “In this year, you (Americans) will be involved in your election. Next ear, if a new one (president) comes, e will spend the year studying the issue.” Last April, Hussein thought he had Arafat persuaded to get on board to allow the king to negotiate on the basis of a plan that calls for “self- government by the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza in associa- tion with Jordan.” In short, it meant West Bankers. could run their local affairs as Jorda- ar subjects, not as citizens of an In April, Hussein and Arafat came very close to designating a joint Jordanian-Palestinian negotiatin team, along with a common set of princi for the negotiators to seek om the United States and Israel. On the brink of announcing a deal, Arafat flew to Kuwait to confer with the PLO leadershin. A few davs later he sent Jihad to tell Hussein the deal was off. “I told him we believe if we say yes to the Reagan plan, it will arm Syria to fight a war against us,” Jihad said, The Arafat wing fell back to its revious hard-line insistence on the udi-inspired Fez plan, which envi- sions an tnaepuedien West Bank Palestinian state, including East Je- rusalem, formerly part of Jordan.

The rub is that the Israelis are willing to deal with Hussein as well as with Arab Palestinian negotiators. But they won't under ‘any circum- stances deal with Arafat, who still holds .the allegiance of most West Bank Palestinians. — “Any participation of Arafat ... can only lead to failure of any peace rocess,” Israeli Prime Minister Yitz- jak Shamir said in an interview on the other side of Jerusalem. ° \f"

        "ocr_text": " Saudi Farmers Cashing In on Agribusiness Boom yf ‘By Joseph Albright Cox News Service AL KHARJ, Saudi Arabia — Saudi farmers are raising so much wheat vand so many eggs that the kingdom is on the verge of having to become a crop exporter to avoid a glut. anks to enormous government subsidies and huge underground water sources, agribusiness is the newest or in the world’s richest kingdom. om agricultural engineers to for- mef money changers to royal princes, thousands of Saudis are cashing in big on factory farming. Among the biggest farm owners is Deputy Interior Minister Prince Ah- mad bin Abdul Aziz, a brother of the king. A recent visitor to the Prince Ahmad Project, as it is called, says the prifice owns a herd of 20,000 dairy cows and more than 7,000 acres in wheat. Along the six-lane highway leading sonth from Riyadh, big lush circles of young wheat shimmer like emerald lakes in the dusty desert. Ip each field, a huge sprinkler that looks like an elongated Tinker Toy bridge sweeps in lazy circles on its rubber tractor tires. The wheat is as high as a man’s calf now, six months before harvest time. Most isa dry-climate strain developed for.Arizona. And just off the highway at the Ya4mama Farms interchange, an air- conditioned chicken farm is turning ort 22 million baby chicks and 3 mil- lion table eggs a year. It uses cheap foreign labor and the most modern poultry-raising techniques available in Europe. In the last five years, the growth in the Saudi chicken business “has been an explosion,” said Suliman Al Sanie, $2, the shrewd, ambitious Saudi agri- cultural engineer who has built Ya- mama Farms from scratch in eight years, His hatchery operation here, called Al Wadi Poultry Farms, is the core of his multimillion-dollar farm enter: prise. Al Wadi has 240 employees, of which Al Sanie and his brother, the business manager, are the only Saudis. Nearly all the workers are Indians, Egyptians and Filipinos whose start- ing wage is 90 cents an hour plus room and board. A visitor to Al Wadi finds rows of egg hatcher machines from Belgium. These artificial hens are essentially stant temperature and humidity for 18 days. Then the humidity is raised so the shells will soften and the chicks can hatch within three more days. Because no farmers come to buy chicks on the Moslem weekend, the hatches are scheduled so no chicks will be born on Thursday or Friday. At his other farms, Al Sanie raises 2 million broilers and 200,000 bushels of wheat. On the side, he sells farm _ equipment. His biggest problem in wheat grow- ing is “collecting our money” from his sole purchaser, the Saudi government. Of late, oil revenues are down and the government has been slow in paying bills. It has scarcely rained on his wheat for two years, and the temperature in the summer hovers around 120 de- No matter. “When it is very hot we irrigate in the evening,” he said. “We have no serious problems,” The water is not about to run out. Oil drilling has accidentally revealed some very large aquifers in northern and eastern Saudi Arabia. One called the Wasia aquifer is described by a U.S. government study as having “more water than the Persian Gulf.” In the preoil 1930s, Saudi Arabia was too poor to import food. People subsisted by scratching out a little wheat, millet and dates in scattered oases and by raising a few goats and camels for meat. With the skyrocketing oil prices of the 1970s, Saudis flocked into the cit- ies and acquired a taste for Western food. By 1975, two-thirds of the food had to be imported. In the 1970s, the Saudi government took heed of frequent talk by Ameri- can congressmen and editorial writers about how America’s “food weapon,” agricultural exports, might have to be used against the OPEC nations to off- set the power of the oil exporters. To enchance its national security, boost national pride and spread the wealth, Saudi Arabia set forth on an enormous crash program of agricul- tural subsidies, Wheat, which happens to be the main Western farm export, has al- ways enjoyed the highest priority. The Saudi wheat subsidies are so lucrative that one Westerner calls the program “a license to print money.” Desert land belonging to the king- dom was made available to farmers for almost nothing. The government also offers interest-free loans as well as outright grants for 45 percent of the cost of pumps and engines. Until re- cently, the government also paid 50 percent of the cost of fertilizer. On top of these indirect subsidies, the government buys the entire wheat crop from farmers at $27.25 a bushel. That’s about five times the cost of imported American wheat. This year, with new wheat fields opening all the time, the Saudis expect to grow more wheat than they con- sume. Like the Americans with their stra- tegic oil reserve in Louisiana, the Sau- dis plan to store some of the surplus wheat as a reserve against crop disas- ters or Western boycotts. The poultry business gets fewer sub- sidies, but as Al Sanie puts it, “It is profitable.” As a chicken raiser, he gets a 30 percent government grant for any poultry equipment and a 50 percent subsidy for chicken feed. On top of these, he can draw interest-free loans. The Planning Ministry says Saudi chickens laid 1,244,000 table eggs in 1982. It worked out to about 95 per- cent of all the eggs eaten in the king- dom. At last count back in 1982, Saudi farmers raised about 60 million broil- ers and imported another 95 million. Given the Saudis’ burgeoning taste for chicken, sales of imported broilers — especially from France — are rising almost as fast ‘as those of locally raised cluckers. The Finance Ministry made moves last year to cut back on farm subsi- dies, to the dismay of the Agriculture Ministry. The Finance Ministry, faced with an issue of national pride, has thrown in the towel for now. The subsidies were left in place, virtually guaranteeing a continuing boom in Saudi agriculture.

        "ocr_text": "Rich Contractor Fights To Cemen Peace Agreement By Joseph Albright Cox News Service RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — This kingdom has seen its share of hungry young expatriates who made it big. But none has made it as so big in so many ways as Lebanese-born builder Rafiq al Hariri. Hariri, 39, is “one of the four or five Saudi billionaires,” said an American with access to intelligence informa- tion, in a conversation elsewhere in the Middle East. -Hariri’s construction company, Sau- di Oger, builds all sorts of projects. It is best known for its ability to get contracts to build palaces for the roy- al family. ‘He also has served since last fall as Saudi Arabia's equivalent of Donald Rumsfeld. At the request of King Fahd and Foreign Minister Saud al Faisal, Hariri shuttles throughout the Middle East attempting to bring peace to Lebanon. . As it happens, he also owns Leba- non’s largest construction company, Oger Liban, which has 1,500 employ- ees. If peace ever did arrive in Leba- non, Hariri’s fleet of trucks would have years of work clearing the rubble and rebuilding the country. . Two weeks ago, Hariri was recalled to Riyadh from Damascus, where he had tried in vain to work out a security lan to extend the authority of the nese army beyond Beirut. A few days later, the Lebanese army disinte- grated and Beirut was cut in two by fighting. . Over the weekend, Hariri went back into action, slipping into Beirut for meetings with Foreign Minister Elie Salem and with Moslem religious leaders. His objective was a ceasefire and elimination of the “green line’ that divides Moslem West Beirut and the airport from Christian East Beirut and the presidential palace. One day later, the French soldiers opened a crossing point through the green line and fighting tapered off. For now, Hariri is about the only gasp of hope in Beirut. He is the only intermediary on the horizon with per- sonal friendships among all of the Lebanese factions as well as high-lev- €l access to Syria, France and the United States. “We (the Saudis) are always involved,” Hariri said before he left Riyadh. ‘Hariri has not spoken publicly about What he hopes to achieve in Lebanon. ~Sources close to the negotiations say he has a clear-cut idea of what must be done first — an idea that happens to diverge sharply from what both Israel and the United States have been trying to achieve. Hariri is known to believe that Leb- anon must get out of the agreement Gemayel signed with Israel last May Ti. It is probably no coincidence that Gemayel said he was ready to reeval- ‘tate and perhaps change the Israeli agreement the day after Hariri ar- rived. In Hariri's view, Lebanon cannot afford the agreement because of eco- ic consequences. He has let it be ‘kpown that both Syria and Saudi Ara- would immediately shut off trade Lebanon if the Lebanese govern- nt goes through with the accord in present form. As he views the agreement, nobody jects to the first section calling for aeli troop withdrawal. «*He believes the second section, con- ning provisions to assure the securi- of Israel's northern border, needs ifications. But he thinks some- ing can be worked out. \"Hariri is said to concede Israel’s for a cooperative military force | Southern Lebanon that would keep mt would-be terrorists. Instead of as- igning that role to the pro-Israeli mi- itias organized by the late Maj. Saad Haddad, Hariri has in the past advo- od moving the Lebanese army into Southern Lebanon. The Haddad mili- tias could then become part of the army. The third section of the May 17 pact must be forgotten entirely, Hariri has said. It contains what Israel wants most and Syria likes least: a timetable pointing toward normal trade and dip- lomatic relations between Israel and Lebanon. Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, was born in Sidon, in what is now Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon. He owns and still operates a 360-bed hospital near Si- don. But he hasn’t been back there since 1982, when he smuggled himself through Israeli lines to visit his father and mother. Like many Lebanese in search of their fortunes, he moved to Saudi Ara- bia at 21. Little is known abou! how he built his company and became an intimate of the royal family. By some published accounts, he married a relative of the king, but he denies this. Somehow, though, he was accorded the unusual privilege of becoming a Saudi citizen. Some American sources in the Mid- dle East speculate that the Saudi royal family used Oger Liban, his Lebanese construction company, to pump mon- ey into Beirut last year as part of a Saudi policy to restore stability in Lebanon.

Last year, at a time when almost nobody else was building, Oger Liban began putting up several tall office buildings in downtown Beirut. Other Oger Liban crews turned up to begin reconstruction of the Beirut port area and to clear garbage and rubble from the streets of Sidon.

Last April when a truck bomb de- stroyed the U.S, Embassy, Oger Liban trucks were immediately dispatched to clear the wreckage. And on Oct. 23 Oger Liban showed up within an hour to begin removing the rubble of the truck-bombed U.S. Marine headquarters.

Richard Grimm, 22, of Lan- caster, Ohio, was resting his haunches on a sandbag. waiting for a Navy barge to haul him out of The First Marine Combat Unit was | being boat-lifted out of Beirut on a sunny, fairly peaceful Saturday morn- ing. A few mortar and rocket rounds were thumping out mood music in the hills eight miles away — evidence that Beirut hangs in purgatory between war and ceasefire. Army Col. Ed McDonald, serving as chief Marine spokesman, said Satur- day morning that the Marines still do not know who will move into the $2 million sandbag complex the Marines are abandoning at the airport. Some Shiite Moslem militiamen of the Amal perty said they expected Moslem-led Lebanese Army units loyal to Amal leader Nabih Berri to take over the airport positions. But there remained the prospect of an armed free-for-all at the airport once the last Marines vacate their bunker flats. There were hints Satur- day of discord between the loosely allied Druse and Amal militias on who should move in when the Marines move out. Grimm said he was glad to go. ‘“‘The first time I was here (in 1982), I thought the government was going to get stable and we would be doing a good thing,” said the Marine com- munications man. ‘“*‘But now, you sit around and see all the fighting going on and it kind of makes me think the Lebanese people are afraid to have peace.”’ His last hours on Green Beach below After Old Glory had been strung down the pole and folded for posterity, Hotel Battery commander Capt. Brad Gates, 33. of Roaring Spring. Pa., ex- horted his flak-jacketed Marines not to foul up on their last day. **We’ve come too far, we’ve done too well, to take off the packs now,’’ he said, alluding to the glory days when this same bunch of Marines dropped in on Grenada and won. The battery’s executive officer, Capt. David Karcher, 26, of Miami, Fla., then let the men know they shouldn’t expect smiles and rose petals over here. ““There may be some Amal people coming down there with Khomeini posters,’” said Karcher. “Just don’t react to them.’’ As it turned out, no hecklers showed up. The first Marine combat unit barged away in the face of massive indifference. But as Grimm and a dozen others were about to board their barge, two hand grenades exploded in the water 100 yards away. No one ducked except me. it was down the sandy slope from the airport, across the highway, down the beach and onto the barges. Whenever the Marines opened the highway, the pent-up Lebanese traffic would pour past Green Beach, taking no apparent notice of this bitter mo- ment in Marine lore. Minutes after the first howitzers and their six-inch-diameter shells edged away from the shore on a barge, a jeep with a Druse pennant toodled up the highway carrying what looked like a black stopepipe. It was a 105 millime- ter recoilless rifle. In their three-month hitch here, the 175 Marine artillerymen of Hotel Bat- tery were allowed to fire 339 howitzer shells at targets up to 10 miles away that were adjudged by higherups to be guns deliberately firing at the Marines. Great Britain and Italy already have removed the troops they sent here as Part of the multinational peacekeeping effort. France, which has put forth a resolution at the United Nations to re- Placé the multinationals with U.N. troops, is the only multinational nation to keep its troops in Lebanon. In a day or two, the last of the re- maining 1,000-odd Marine combat troops will haul out of the airport, probably at night. A small Marine reconnaissance de- tachment has been handed the assign- ment of leaving Beirut International Airport last. For what it may be worth, its mem- bers are especiallly trained in knife- throwing, infiltration and long-dis- tance swimming. the airport could only have deepened the bizarre impressions he and his fel- low Marine artillerymen took away to their new quarters on a tub the Navy calls LST (landing ship tank) Barnsta- ble County, which will cruise some 30 miles off the Lebanese coast for two more months.

If there were any fish in this part of the Mediterranean, they were just as immune to shock as everyone else in Lebanon. Not a herring could be seen surfacing. All morning the coastal highway just above Green Beach was doing double duty.

        "ocr_text": "Khomeini Power Grows: Gemayel Control Slipping By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BEIRUT — A traveler returning to this sick, torment- ed city after three weeks outside Lebanon is struck with two changes: more Khomeini posters on the walls and fewer people walking around the streets with guns, A month ago, you could poke around all morning through the poor sections of this city and see few signs of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. But now you cannot drive to the Marine outpost at the met Without seeing Khomeini posters on almost every ding in the Shiite neighborhoods, Even in the ritsier Hamra district, where tew ohiitag live, Khomeini posters are pasted on an occasional office or apartment tower where there were none before. If this is somewhat eerie, it is downright jarring to cruise through 5 miles of West Beirut streets and run into only two or three armed militiamen or soldiers, A month ago, you passed perhaps a dozen Lebanese _ Army sentry posts, some armed with tanks and heavy machine guns, along the same route. Both changes in the street scene reflect the stunning collapse of President Amin Gemayel’s authority and the swift assumption of police powers in West Beirut by the mainstream Amal Movement, the Shiite Moslem party that is dedicated to pressuring Gemayel out of office. Since Gemayel’s army splintered and fled from its posts in Moslem West Beirut on Feb. 5, Nabih Berri, the relatively moderate leader of Amal, has largely restored order on the streets of West Beirut. And south of the airport, his allies, the Druse militias, have driven away a key Lebanese Army unit that was een 200 yards from the American Marines. A Druse g and a banner portraying Druse leader Walid Jumblatt now wave from the captured army flagpole. Inside the Marine compound, Marine 1st Lt. Randy Gibson, 28, of Atlanta, Ga., said the Druse victory has made life safer for his 52-man platoon because Druse gunners are no longer blasting away at the Lebanese | Army next to him. Gibson found himself in the “ironic” position of greet- ing Amal and Druse irregulars who had crushed the army the Marines were sent here, at least partly, to support. “Tt was kind of funny,” Gibson said. “One day they are shooting at us and the next day they are coming up to our checkpoint, telling us all Marines are friends and that we are great.” About a week ago, Gibson’s sentries stopped a big Mercedes truck — the kind used in the truck bombing Oct. 23 that killed more than 240 Marines — and found it loaded down with rockets, machineguns, rifles and grenade launchers. The weapons belonged to Amal, with whom the Marines had a truce. “‘We checked to see that it wasn’t also a car bomb,” he said. ““Then we let it through.”’ Berri restored a bit of calm in West Beirut well before the new Saudi-ne- gotiated ceasefire agreement. Berri did so, in large measure, by ordering all eager young gun-carrying militia- men on his side to the “front lines.”’ In Beirut that meant they had to either stash their rifles in the closet or rush across town to man the “Green Line,” that ugly free-fire zone that separates West Beirut from Christian East Bei- rut. For the moment, even pro-Iranian extremists in the Shiite community are respecting Berri’s lead. They aren’t smashing liquor bottles, de- manding that women be veiled or strutting around town with Kalashni- kovs. In Beirut, Khomeini has the stature of a major religious hero — “Like your pope,” as one Shiite put it. Khomeini’s spiritual appeal is not - yet translating into a political move- ment toward an Islarzic state in L2ba- non — someihing that would ho:rify Syria as much as it would scave the West. Among the reasons is the traditional ethnic tension between Arabs and Per- sians. The Lebanese Shiites — Leba- non’s largest minority — are predomi- nantly Arabs, not Persians like Khomeini. There are two ways a Western re- porter can reach Beirut these days. The first is a 10-hour ride in a sea- going ferry from Larnaca, rus, to the yacht basin harbor at Junieh,in Christian Lebanese territory 15 miles north of Beirut. If the seas are calm enough for the ferry to discharge passengers, you try to find a taxi driver who will take you across a relatively safe gap in the Green Line. Plan B is to walk north across the Israeli border into Lebanon and find a Lebanese taxi driver who knows the back roads to Beirut through the Chouf Mountains. I chose Plan B. Abdullah and his ancient Mercedes taxi were waiting for customers in an old rock quarry used as a parking lot a mile north of the Lebanese-Israeli in- ternally recognized frontier, in the belt of Southern Lebanon that Israeli soldiers are occupying. “Going Beirut? No problem,” Abd- ullah assured me. “I’m Shia (a Shiite).” We passed through perhaps 50 checkpoints manned by the Israeli Army or militiamen from Amal, the Druse’s Progressive Socialist Party. On the road to Beirut, we didn’t see one Lebanese government checkpoint. Abdullah’s route made an end run into the mountains around the continu- ing Christian-Druse fighting that has closed the superhighway to Beirut along the coast. From the Israeli border, we reached Beirut, less than 100 miles away, in five and a half hours of stop- and-careen traffic mostly on unpaved mountain roads. We passed dozens of straining se- dans packed to the roof with families and with mattreses, Oriental rugs, baby carriages and suitcases roped to the top. The exodus in cabs and family cars was a of how devastating the last three weeks of fighting have been in both Christian and Moslem neighbor- Palm Beach Post February 26, 1984 \f"

Meanwhile, at the former Marine headquarters across the airstrip, two all-Moslem units of the Lebanese army, the 6th Brigade and the 33d Battalion, took up positions the Marines had abandoned moments earlier. Both units take their guidance from Amal leader Nabih Berri and not from Gemayel.

Contempt at the army’s ineptitué against Moslem militias was compound by resentment among some Marines about an unpublicized racial incident about three weeks earlier.

President Gaafar Nimeiry, the wily but troubled leader of this largest African nation, was rallying his loyalists from a small village up the Nile in an attempt to expunge the psychological stain many Sudanese feel he suffered from last week’s unavenged bomb- Stacked in the trucks were piles of bricks and bags of sand, symbols of Nimeiry’s hopes to shore up the shaky foundations of his 15- year-old military regime. One of the great survivors of African politics, and now staring at his most perilous challenge, Nimeiry is relying on appeals to patriotism, displays of Western aid and his native political a to keep his foes off balance — or in jail. . Although the bomber missed the trans- mitters and killed only five people, the bold raid into the heart of the Sudanese capital re- gion has weakened Nimeiry in his U.S.-backed struggle against internal and external foes. Such is the climate of rumor, intrigue and cynicism that a good many Sudanese flatly refuse to accept the official story that the bomber was a Russian-made Tupelov TU- 22 bomber flown by two Libyan military pilots. _ One ironic exception is a young Sudanese English-speaking professional worker who volunteered to a reporter that he hopes the Libyans send the plane back soon in a further demonstration of Nimeiry’s impotence. “I know of a woman who was so happy last Friday that she named her new bab Tupelov,” the man said, declining to named for fear of jail. | no : c fe man ne itness r the bombing site even those with no political involvements, like | 18-year-old student Zenab (Zizi) Shawgi, have |; had their confidence shaken. . “It was very far from our minds to think ‘we would be bombarded,” she said, adding that her family is moving from the bombed neighborhood for fear of a repeat air strike. Some Sudanese dissenters claim the’ plane was flown by a defecting Sudanese pilot while others say Nimeiry personally ordered the raid on his own transmitters in a desper- ate bid to gather more Western and Egyptian . aid. . As far as an outsider can tell from the sketchy evidence, Nimeiry is probably. justi- fied in accusing Libya of launching the at- tack. But that scarcely matters in terms of the dim outlook for stability in a nation four times the size of Texas which has never really been unified since attaining independ- ence from Britain and Egypt in 1956. Except as an intimidator and arms sup- | plier for Sudanese rebels, Libya is not a mili- tary threat to Nimei ry. His northernmost ; towns along the Nile are 600 miles across the Nubian Desert from the nearest Libyan mili- ; tary base. Nimeiry’s biggest problem is at home. He has met with a devastating series of reverses since last September, when he moved to unrest among majority Arabic-speaking, Mos- lem, blatks in the north by imposing Islamic law nationwide. : move rekindled a simmering revolt against him in the southern third of Sudan, uell : where the Dinkas, Nuers, Shilluks and other non-Arabic-speaking, non-Islamic blacks be- lieve in spirit-worship or Christianity. ‘Al- though Islamic law was never strictly applied .dn, the south, the southerners were more incensed-than Nimeiry anticipated. These southern.-blacks — who make up about 6 million of the 22 million Sudanese in- habitants — have hated northern Sudanese Arabs for more than 200 years. Traditionally, northern Arabic-speaking blacks have re- garded the south as a place to capture slaves, a practice that continued on a widescale basis well into the 19th century. In recent decades, southern Sudanese have complained that their region has been shortchanged economically by the northern-dominated central govern- - ment. This year the southern rebels of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement have struck back with devastating effectiveness at Sudan’s economy. In early February, the rebels, who are led by John Gorang, a former Sudanese army officer who studied agricultural economics in _the United States, attacked the Chevron Oil Co. operations base in southern Sudan, where exploratory drillers had struck enough oil in 1980 and 1981 to justify hopes that Sudan Atlanta Journal-Constitution March 23, 1984 -. Sudan's. —. best hope for survival. , Sudanese leader Gaafar Nimeiry might become a modest oil exporter. Three foreigners were killed. Chevron began cutting back operations the next day, and a week later the company and Nimeiry agreed to halt oil exploration until “political stability” is restored. ~-On Feb. 10, southern insurgents hit an army camp near Malakai, imperiling foreign workers for a French company, CCI, which was constructing the ambitious Jonglei Canal : project. - ithe government claims its killed 400 insurgents in a major triumph that has weakened the whole rebel movement. But CCI’s operations were forced to a halt when 40 foreign workers were evacuated. The Sudanese army has made little head- way in suppressing the rebellion, even though the army estimates southern rebel strength at only about 1,000 to 2,000 trained fighters and no more than 20,000 untrained helpers. The army numbers about 60,000 troops. Maj. Gen. Babiker Abdel Rahim Babiker, a senior army general, acknowledged in an interview that military campaigns in the south cannot destroy the rebels. “Problems like that will not go away,” he ' said. But in the view of Nimeiry’s Egyptian and American backers, a negotiated political settlement with the south is Nimeiry’s — and e \f"

Y Abba Eban Asked if a new Labor government would be willing to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Eban told Western reporters: “On the Labor side, we say (we would negotiate with) anyone who would accept the legitimacy and sovereignty of Israel, which does not yet include the PLO.” Egypt, like other moderate Arab states, has argued that no Middle East breakthroughs are possible until Israel agrees to talk with the PLO, which Arab nations regard as the sole legitimate representative of Palestin- ians in and out of the West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister Itzak Shamir and other members of his govern- ment say they will never talk to the PLO because it is “a terrorist organ- ization.” Eban told reporters that, regard- less of the July election’s outcome, Israel will move vigorously to with- draw remaining Israeli troops from Lebanon next year, after first reach- ing “security arrangments” with un- specified organizations in southern Lebanon. Eban said he had earlier made similar comments in a closed semi- nar for more than 100 Egyptian diplomats, to which he was invited by Dr. Butros Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs. Ghali gave a lavish dinner in Eban’s honor on the | top floor of the Nile Hilton Hotel | Wednesday evening. Eban said he is scheduled to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday. Such a meeting with an Israeli opposition leader, four months before Israel's election, is a clear sig- nal of Egyptian exasperation with the hard-line policies of the Israeli gov- ernment under Shamir. Few Egyptians knew Eban was here, even though his arrival from the airport was heralded by scream- ing police sirens. The government- controlled press made no mention of the visit. For nearly two years, relations be- tween Cairo and Tel Aviv have re- mained under what the Egyptians call “a cold peace.” Following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Egypt withdrew its ambassador from Israel and froze economic relation- ships between the two countries.

An hour later, the two emerged from behind the giant blue plastic screens that blocked streets around the embassy. They , refused to talk to reporters. _ The British government was enraged by the shooting. “There is no pretext for this outra- geous, murderous onslaught,” declared Home Secretary Leon Brittan. He told interviewers that the govern- ment’s objective was to cause everyone in the building to leave “so police can go in and search for weapons and explosives.” The Libyan news agency said the shooting in London was an act of self de- fense provoked by a “horrible terroristic attack” by British police. ‘Under international law, the embassy is Libyan territory and cannot be entered without the express permission of the Libyan government. But in a telephone interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Libya’s foreign minister, Ali Abdel Salaam Tureiki, said from Tripoli, “We will never allow anyone to go inside our embassy.” - Police could storm the building in violation of the 1949 Vienna Convention establishing the principle of diplomatic im- munity.

Tuesday night, Tureiki issued a state- ment in Tripoli warning Britain against taking the embassy by force. “An act of this magnitude,” he said, “will not go unanswered by the Libyan people, who know how to avenge them- selves while they are in the position of de- fending their dignity and their existence.” Opposition Social Democratic leader David Owen warned that moves to search the Libyan Embassy could jeopardize the 8,000 Britons living in Libya.

Kassah and his men killed eight “criminals” holed up in an apart- ment building: during the morning- ~ long shoot-cut. \\ Seven plotters were killed outright in the shooting Tuesday morning, the most violent outburst aimed at Khadafy’s rule since he and 11 other military officers ousted the U.S.- backed King Idris in a 1969 coup.

Hundreds of shots were fired into ‘the four-story, state-owned apart- Photos of the three, all Libyan students in their early 20s, were dis- played on the front page of Thurs- day’s official newspaper, looking like wanted posters in an old Ameri- can Western.

The plotters, blasting away from windows, held out for about three hours, according to Kassah. Then they were shot and their bodies dragged out into a_ neighboring street to be photographed.

        "ocr_text": "Libyans vel for death of leader's foes By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Con News Service TRIPOLI, Libya — With clenched right fists thrust upward in unison, 2,000 Libyans chanted defiance Satur- day of Tunisia and Great Britain for allegedly aiding plotters against their revolutionary leader, Col. Moammar Khadafy. “Leader, leader, we are going to kill them,” the mostly male delegates yelled in unison inside a marble-deco- rated popular congress hall. A contingent of 60 women delegates in the balcony stood up together and yelled: “We are ready to fight them. Although we are women, we are ready to do a lot of things.” A MEMBER OF the seven-man secretariat on the dais said three of the plotters have still not been captured. _ The trio, whose names and photos ~ have been publicized widely, escapec sclosed fashion on Tuesday, the day seven of their co-conspirators were killed and about six taken prisoner. Appealing for help in tracking them down, he said, “They are somewhere. Someone else has been hiding them.” It was the Libyan version of a New England town meeting, in which more than 2,000 Libyans from the Tripoli suburbs gathered in plush seats to par- ticipate in Khadafy-style direct democracy. The emergency popular congress was called to decide how Libya should respond to the “crisis” brought about by the roughly 15 heavily armed young Libyan plotters who were killed or scattered in a downtown Tripoli shootout Tuesday. TUNISIA, WHICH exchanged high- level delegations with Libya until a few weeks ago, emerged as a major villain in speech after speech by Libyan delegates. The meeting came on the eve of a huge mass demonstration scheduled for today by Khadafy to further ex- coriate Tunisia for allegedly helping the plotters to slip over Libya’s little- guarded western border.

        "ocr_text": "Libyans Try To Bury Si By Joseph Albright Cox News Service TRIPOLI, Libya — With a great thud and a billow of dust, the bullet-riddled apartment building that served as a lair for anti-Qaddafi plotters crumbled under the pound- ing of big Caterpillar earthmovers. The state-owned apartment block — big enough to house perhaps a hundred people — was demolished to make way for a day-care center to educate children in revolutionary values. “We want to give a lesson to anyone who is going to try to do this again,” said pipe-smoking Peoples Revolu- tionary Committee member Hassan Al Kassah, 36. Although Kassah's militia unit succeeded Tuesday in wiping out this one terrorist cell, Libyan authorities could not root out all the plotters — nor could they bury ques- tions about what actually happened in the most serious internal uprising Muammar Qaddafi has ever faced. The main puzzle was whether the conspirators actual- ly mounted an assault on Libyan strongman Qaddafi's tightly guarded compound in Tripoli’s Bab al Aziziyah section. The Libyan government still categorically denies that such an assault happened. And there have been no ac- counts from witnesses or other solid evidence to the contrary. dent for Le Monde who later interviewed Qaddafi inside the compound, said he saw no evidence of a shootout. Kassah, the Libyan security chief on the scene, said he had information for perhaps a week that “criminals” were occupying the apartment. But Kassah said the siege did not begin until about 8 a.m., just after the “criminals” drove up in a trash truck. The men immediately rushed inside the building and the siege began. The trash truck was a seemingly telling detail. It was a factual thread that seemed to link the two conflicting versions, although the rest of the facts remained at odds. Shrugging his shoulders, Kassah said he didn’t know whether anything had happened at Qaddafi’s quarters, which are outside his neighborhood district. The building is in a modest neighborhood of block- shaped apartment buildings resembling old-style Ameri- can public housing — complete with TV antennas on the roofs. Negotiations followed, by all accounts. Shortly the women and children in the building were allowed by the plotters to leave. According to Qaddafi’s confidant, security forces then sent a plotter who had been captured into the building to convince the others to surrender. “They shot him and dropped his body out of a third floor window,” said the Qaddafi adviser. And then, he said, the shooting began. Two days later, bloodstains still marked the pave- ment where the bodies were laid out to be photographed. And nobody had removed three running shoes the dead plotters had been wearing in the photographs. The Qaddafi adviser said the conspiracy was cracked because a leading anti-Qaddafi exile was caught and shot Sunday night as he sneaked by night across the Tunisia- Libyan border, about 300 miles west of Tripoli. Libyan authorities have identified the slain leader as former Libyan army Lt. Col. Ahmad Awas, who headed the military wing of the Europe-based National Front for the Salvation of Libya. According to the Qaddafi adviser, One of Qaddafi’s closest advisers insisted that he drove by Bab al Aziziyah about 7:45 a.m. Tuesday and heard no shooting until firing broke out later near the apartment. The adviser, who frequently travels abroad, would not allow his name to be published for fear of being assassinat- ed. However, an experienced European diplomat gave a different version. The diplomat said he is “99 percent certain” that a 15-member squad of heavily armed plot- ters actually penetrated the compound Tuesday morning. The diplomat said the commandos sprayed Qaddafi’s sleeping tent with bullets and also killed a number of Red Berets, the ultraloyal army troops from Qaddafi’s home region of Sirte in eastern Libya. By this version — which could not be independently checked — Qaddafi escaped because he was not in the tent where he often sleeps. The plotters are said to have surprised guards at the compound by driving up in a garbage truck. The diplomat’s version is that three plotters were quickly gunned down at the Qaddafi compound and the rest fled, holing up inside the now demolished apartment building. The building is two-thirds of a mile from the outer walls of Qaddafi’s compound and perhaps 14 miles from his usual sleeping quarters. Awas left the army in 1969 or 1970 — shortly after Qaddafi, a fellow army colonel, came to power. After leaving the army, Awas was dispatched abroad as a Libyan ambassador to several countries, including Guyana, before going into exile several years ago. By the adviser’s account, border police spotted foot- prints in the dirt near the border and these led them to Awas 5 miles inside Libya. Awas then was reportedly killed in a gunbattle. According to Libyan authorities, the exile leader was carryinng a Sudanese diplomatic pass- port indicating he entered Tunisia on May 2 — four days before he crossed into Libya. The Qaddafi adviser said Awas was carrying a list of “more than 10” high-ranking Libyan officials to be assassi- nated, including Qaddafi. His personal effects also report- edly included a list of key Libyan installations to be destroyed, some guns and explosives — and the address of the apartment in Tripoli where the other plotters were subsequently shot. There was no explanation, however, of why the Liby- an authorities — if they had such evidence — waited 36 hours before trying to round up the plotters in the apart- ment. Still another puzzle was who died in the Tripoli shoot- out. By Friday, the government newspapers still had not published identities of the slain plotters even though close- ups of their bloody corpses were run and rerun on Libyan news broadcasts. Although there have been conflicting rumors, the latest version came from the Qaddafi adviser, who said the dead plotters were members of Libya’s underground Moslem Brotherhood organization — a generations-old secret society with links to anti-mod <n, anti-establish- ment undergrounds in Syria, Egypt and other Arab coun- tries. Although Awas is a former army officer, the Qaddafi adviser said he had not heard that any of the plotters had army ties. However, this seemed curious in that all were Libyans in their early 20s and Libya has compulsory ons of Unrest The diplomat said he obtained his version from con- tacts in the Libyan undercover police, known as the Taw- riya. \" In Libya, key security officials maintain discreet contacts with foreign embassies that could grant them visas in a pinch. But diplomats are never certain whether their informants are lying to curry favor. Judging by all versions, there was a morning-long shootout at the apartment building in which seven plotters were killed and six others were arrested and interrogated. One of those captured reportedly died later. A European who works nearby has reported seeing tanks sealing off nearby streets that morning. Another European with military experience told of hearing tank or other heavy weapon fire. But when a few Western reporters were bused to the apartment building two days later, the more than 100 bullet marks appeared to have been caused by machine- guns or rifles. Only one or two holes appeared big enough to have been punched by a tank or artillery round. French correspon- Eric Rouleau, the distinguished military service. Kassah, the local security commander, said most of the slain plotters had studied in Britain or Greece. He said the plotters had “many” firearms in the apartment, including Kalashnikov automatic rifles, Bel- gian-made Fabrique National assault rifles, handguns and hand grenades. In what seemed another curious omission, the govern- ment has never issued photographs of.the weapons. or published any serial numbers. Kalashnikovs, at least, are common in Libyan army and militia units but they are also widely available on the international black market. So it is unclear whether the plotters used Libyan army weapons. * It would be no surprise if the answers to the puzzles stayed buried, along with the demolished apartment build- ing. In wiping out this embarrassing symbol of opposition, Qaddafi was taking a page from the book of his nemesis, Gen. Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli defense minister. For except in Israeli-occupied territories, nowhere else in this part of the world are, dwellings smashed to terrorism. unk’ Whatever the effects on the several dozen neighbor- hood children gawking at the enormous bulldozers, this bit of symbolism is likely to have no effect on the anti-Qaddafi underground. By the week’s end, the three plotters identified by the Libyan press as having escaped Tuesday were still free despite the largest security crackdown in memory and all- out interrogations of at least six prisoners, This could onh: Suggest that the conspirators had unknown allies in places who are willing to hide and feed them despite obvious consequences if they are caught. « It now looks as though Qaddafi will face his moment of maximum danger in the month of Ramadhan, during which Moslems everywhere will be free to take to the — at night to celebrate after they have fasted during e day. ‘ Ramadhan, when plotters will be most free to gate without police interference, begins May 31.

It was the Moslem equivalent of sending me a free drink. My week in Libya was abundant with surprises, most of them out- side the main story about Col. Moammar Khadafy crushing some armed conspirators who tried to overthrow him. All in all, I was struck by how different Libya is from the rest of the Arab world. Where else do they have women chanting “We are ready to break our enemies’ noses” at political ral- lies? For that matter, who besides Khadafy has women soldiers serv- ing as bodyguards? And where in the Middle East — besides Israel, where all able-bodied citizens serve in the reserves — does the government give guns to civilians? Khadafy has entrusted Kalashni- kov rifles to scores of neighborhood revolutionary committees which he regards as the ramrods of his revo- luticn. “Do not depend on the armed forces to protect the Libyan lands,” he said in a celebrated speech nine years ago. “Hundreds of thousands of Libyans should become arms bearers to stand in the face of any country intending to attack Libya.” Libya would be expected to dif- fer from conservative Saudi Arabia, battle-sad Lebanon or hopelessly bureaucratized Egypt. But who would have expected such a jarring contrast with Syria? Both Khadafy and Syrian Presi- dent Hafaz al Assad came to power through leftist military coups, Kha- dafy’s in 1969 and Assad’s in 1970. Yet the streets of Damascus in the 1980s seem calm and bourgeois in contrast to Khadafy’s cauldron of radical upheaval. Both Libya and Syria are ruled by one leader backed by a powerful se- curity apparatus. Khadafy uses his to foment continual mass upheaval while Assad employs his to keep so- ciety calm. Assad nationalized banks, insur- ance companies and large indus- tries. But he has left in private hands most farming and retailing and much of the tourist, fabric- making and construction trades. Khadafy is the only Arab leader who is trying to wipe out private enterprise entirely. Yet he sounds like Ronald Rea- gan when he castigates Soviet-style Miami News May 26, 1984 (Continued on next page) \fUnder Khadafy It’s pure socialism collective farms and state-owned enterprises. “The most dangerous situation is to have society’s ownership in the hands of government because the government owns power in addi- tion to owning wealth and thus it becomes an instrument of dictator- ship against society,’’ Khadafy said in what is considered a fundamental speech in 1975. A Khadafy-approved book, “Commentary on the Green Book,” declared in 1983: *“* ... We still re- ject Marxism because it creates an eternal dictatorship of the popular masses. the only role of which. under a Marxist regime, is to pro- duce exactly like worker bees for their queen.” Instead of capitalism and Marx- ism, Khadafy envisions pure social- ism under the precepts of his “Third Universal Theory.”’ As he explained eight years ago in his tract “The Green Book.” his revolution will lead to a society in which all wealth will be equally divided, money will disappear and the masses will de- cide everything through popular as- semblies resembling New England town meetings. What all this has meant lately is that the government has shut down a oma pastry shops, beauty shops and bar- ber shops. The few remaining pri- vate restaurants are rumored to be shut soon, although there has been no mention of closing the many Italian-style cafes where men sit for hours drinking coffee. If there are still private grocery markets, I did not see them. Li- byans now generally buy their food at state grocery stores, which are noted for temporary shortages of butter, cheese and other staples. Otherwise, they drive their Fiats to the edge of Tripoli and buy di- rectly from the farmers or farm co- operatives. A walk through Tripoli’s old souks (markets) and newer shop- ping streets revealed two-thirds of the small shops closed. Those still in private hands ap- peared to be selling off old invento- ry. They had empty shelves and no new merchandise. One state-owned appliance store had its front win- dow stocked with blenders, stereos and cameras. I waited to buy some oe Associated Pres 10,000 Libyans thronged in Tripoli’s Green Square last week to celebrate unsuccessful attack on Khadafy’s quarters Miami News - May 26, 1984 (Continued) flashlight batteries but found a line of about 50 Libyans extending from the cash register out into the street. At another state-owned depart- ment store I picked out some bDall- point-type pens and waited in line for 10 minutes while a sales clerk sauntered from the cash register to another department to get change. After all the economic scram- bling, Libyans on the streets look well fed, well dressed and healthy. No one I saw was barefoot or wear- ing torn shoes. Most men wear Western-style open shirts with slacks, often blue jeans. A common accessory was an expensive-looking watch with a metal band. I saw one organizer leading anti-imperialist chants in Green Square with a Rolex watch on his wrist. Older women can often be seen in tradititional white cotton cloaks that envelop their bodies and cover their lower faces. But many youn- fer women wear form-fitting skirts and blouses. A good many Libyans, both men and women, drove cars. But I saw no one in a green BMW — until re- cently the status symbol of officers in the Libyan army. In a recent un- written order, called a tam-tam, Khadafy has threatened to confis- cate green BMWs and other luxury cars as signs of *‘parasitism.”” The recent bloody shootout in downtown Tripoli is evidence thata well-organized, daring group is try- ing to overthrow Khadafy. For better or worse, it is also worth noting that Khadafy has a genuine mass following. Khadafy has gone out of his way to spread Libya’s oil wealth, which currently amounts to $11 billion a year, far and wide. Most of the 3.5 million Libyans are materially better off than before Khadafy. Salaries for the legions of gov- ernment employees run about $125 a week or more. Apartments in government housing projects are heavily subsidized. Education, even at foreign universities, is free, so there are thousands of perpetual students even if there aren’t many jobs for them. Esso and Occidental Petroleum, two of the larger capi- talist enterprises in the United States, found most of the oil in Libya in the late 1950s and 1960s, while Khadafy was a young army officer. Since Khadafy came to power in 1969, oil has been his magic potion, for it brings in revenues that allow him to try out his *“‘Third Universal * experimert without going \f"

Moammar Khadafy hope: will demonstrate his Green Book phi- losophy about socialist farming an¢ turn this arid country into an agricul- tural mecca. Khadafy’s “Great Man-made River Project,” as it is called, will create twc jumbo pipelines that will transport water from 270 deep wells in the Sahara Desert some 600 miles north tc Libya’s Mediterranean coast. If carried to completion over the next decade, the $5 billion irrigation project will create what amounts to artificial rivers with a capacity of up to one-third as much water as flows in the Nile. IT IS AMONG the largest construc- tion schemes in the Middle East and, according to European diplomats, it could become one of the most contro- versial. The neighboring pro-western governments of Egypt and Sudan are deeply suspicious of Khadafy’s river, claiming that Libya plans to draw underground water from natura! reservoirs that belong partly to them. Within the last two months, a man- agement team of about 30 employees of the Houston-based Brown & Root construction company set up shop in Benghazi, Libya, to begin overseeing the project, according to U.S. Chong, the Korean construction company executive who is the overall construc- Carmen Goldthwaite, a spokes- woman for Brown & Root in Houston. said most of the company’s employees there are British and only two are American. THE OTHER MAIN American con- tractor, the Price Brothers Co. of Dayton, Ohio, does not yet have any employees working in Libya. But its chairman, Gayle Price Jr., said the company hopes to send between 10 and 15 employees — “primarily Brits and Canadians” — there later this year. Price Brothers has been awarded a subcontract valued at about $100 mil- lion to provide machinery and equip- ment to make pre-stressed concrete pipe for the project. Price said the company additionally expects to do “more than $50 miilion’’ of business in consulting fees and technical services for the project. Chong said his company, Interna- tional Dong Ah Construction Company of Seoul, already has 700 Korean workers in Benghazi who are building headquarters facilities and base camps. Dong Ah, the prime contractor, signed Price Brothers as the main subcontrac- tor last November. THE WATER IS due to be tapped from a huge underground reservoir of pure water near the Al Kufra Oasis in southeastern Libya. The oasis is about 100 miles west of the Egyptian border and 150 miles northwest of Sudan. Water experts in both countries have contended the Libyans will drain water from under their territory, eventually lowering their water tables. But Libya proceeded to award initial Dayton Daily News - construction contracts totaling $3.5 billion last Nov. 10. Mohammed Al Mangoush, the Libyan former housing minister assigned by Khadafy to over- see the project, called it “one of the greatest challenges that the Libyan people have taken on.” European diplomats said they +have heard estimates that there is enough water under southeastern Libya to fill the pipeline for 50 years. However, ex- perts have said the water table will ultimately fall because the subterra- nean reservoirs won't be replenished. THE REAGAN administration has not blocked American participation in the project even though it broke rela- tions with Libya in 1981, and has blamed Khadafy for financing world- wide terrorism. The United States is still enforcing its 3-year-old export controls on ship- ments of “strategic” technology to Libya. But these have not been inter- preted to ban the transfer of water- pipeline technology, even though the administration tried to prevent Euro- pean subsidiaries of American firms from selling gas pipeline equipment to the Soviet Union. Americans are officially discouraged from traveling or making business deais in Libya primarily because the two countries have no diplomatic rela- tions and because the administration does not wish to have Khadafy as- sisted in any endeavors. BOTH PRICE and Goldthwaite said the U.S. government did not try to dis- suade their companies from getting in- volved with the project. The water was discovered by the American-owned Occidental Petroleum Co. in 1968, the year before Khadafy took power by ousting King Idris. As part of its 1966 oil concession agreement, Occidental had agreed to May 27, 1984 \fdevote 5 percent of its Libyan oil profits to developing agriculture and water. The company found the water still a pro-Western outpost American and British airbases. After finding water, grow wheat and fodder for sheep. Subsequently, Khadafy envisioned the concrete pipe 13 feet in diameter. Price said the pipe — in sections 24.5 feet long, each weighing 80 tons — will be manufactured at two huge plants to be built in Libya. Once the artificial river is com- pleted, the water will be piped from Al Khufra northward — flowing pretty much by gravity but also assisted by a network of pumping stations if they are needed — until it reaches a large man-made reservoir inland from Libya’s northern coast. From there it will split, with one branch going up to near the northern city of Benghazi and the other branch going along the coast west to the small town of Sirte. THIS FIRST PHASE is due to be completed in five years. The next two phases are supposed to add another 1,000 miles of pipeline westward from Benghazi through Sirte and on to the Tripoli region. For Khadafy, who regards himself as the philosopher-teacher of the Libyan revolution, the artificial river is a chance to test his oft-repeated theories of socialist land ownership. In The Green Book, which he pub- work, without exploiting else's interests,” the Green Book com- mentary declared. Diplomats who have studied the project express doubt that many of Libya’s 3.5 million inhabitants will voluntarily leave the cities to farm ing crops if irrigated. KHADAFY HAS SOUGHT loans from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to help finance the project, but they have re- portedly turned him down. Diplomats said Khadafy intends in- stead to finance the project out of Libya’s own oil revenues, which have shrunk to about $10 billion a year. The pipeline will cost an average of $350 million a year for the first seven years. If completed, the ptpeline would have a capacity to move 20 billion cubic feet of water a year, according to European diplomats. The Nile’s flow varies from 45 to 150 billion cubic feet annually.

When Allied units suffered heavy casualties, they were often pulled obit of combat. {A post-war American military study shows that for every two casu- aities the Germans suffered from Allied ground forces at Normandy, they inflicted three on the British Americans. + Long after Normandy, U.S. Air Force Gen. Elwood “Pete” Quesada told author Max Hastings: ‘“One’s imagination boggled at what the rman army might have done to us without Hitler working so effec- tively for our side.” For it was Hitler and the Army High Command in Germany who made the fatal error that lost Nor- mandy. They kept their battlefield generals from slashing forward with the Panzer (armored) divisions to destroy the Allies near the beaches. At about 5 a.m. on D-day, news of the paratrooper landings convinced Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the ranking general on the Western front, to commit the 350 tanks and 50 assault guns of the 12th SS “Hi- tler Jugend” and the Panzer Lehr divisions. He gave the order, and then asked the High Command head- rters in Germany for permission to do so. -Gen. Alfred Jodl, Hitler’s chief operations officer, was outraged when he found out. Hitler had issued orders that the Panzers could not move without his personal permis- on. Jodl had a subordinate tele- plone Rundstedt and order the anzers to stop moving until Hitler decided. » Admiral Karl Jesko von Putt- kamer, Hitler’s naval aide-de-camp, chose not to wake Hitler from his drugged sleep until later in the aitier ai At his morning conference tler got so agitated over the con- fused situation in Normandy ‘that he thrned heel and left the room with- qut even. considering Rundstedt’s re- est for the Panzers. ; Hitler delayed and _ delayed. Finally, around 2 p.m.,; Hitler burst out of’ luncheon and sent word to Runsted that he could deploy the Hi- tler Jugend and Panzer Lehr divi- sions. But under no circumstances should Rundstedt touch the more than 1,000 other smaller Panzer units throughout Europe that were ’ already fueled and ready to move toward Normandy. Some odd-looking tanks A month before ‘D-Day, British farmer Sydney Cripps. noticed some odd-looking tanks in his meadow. A bull in the meadow noticed, too. The bull charged one tank broadside. The tank collapsed like a big balloon — which in fact it was. The rubber tanks — more than a brigade of them — were deployed far from the actual landing troops. This was one of thousands of strategems woven together by Allied counterintelligence to give the Nor- mandy landing troops the vital edge of surprise. So fully did they deceive Hitler that at midnight on June 9 — about 40 hours after the invasion started — the Fuehrer canceled plans to reinforce his Normandy defenders because he was certain the main at- tack would hit 50 miles northward near Pas de Calais. The weavers of this scintillating web were the XX-Committee of MI- 5, the British counterintelligence agency, and the X2 branch of the ne 6, 1944. American OSS, the wartime pre- decessor of today’s CIA. Thanks to the skill of British code- breakers, the Allies could also read German military messages through Ultra, a device that duplicated the internal wiring of the German encoding machine. Ultra was the bobber that sig- naled the Allies when Hitler was taking their bait. The central fiction was Eisenhow- er’s order to Gen, George S. Patton to head a non-existent million-man army that supposedly stayed behind in southern England after D-day. To deceive German reconnais- sance planes, the British put 400 fake landing ships in the Thames Estuary made out of oil drums and canvas. Fake fuel dumps, barracks, | pipelines, hospitals were all fabri- cated from wood and cardboard. The props were meant to supply confirmation for phony intelligence reports being fed to Germany by double-agents “Garbo” and “Brutus.” To widen the confusion, Allied planes bombed 26 of the 42 coastal radar stations in Belgium and France. Some stations were left deliberately operational so they could be spoofed on D-day. As the actual invasion fleet ap- \fNormandy proached Normandy, a Royal Air Force spoofer squadron scattered bales of tin foil off Pas de Calais, } image‘of a> massive “invasion ee! ‘When the ghost’ fleets reached 10 miles from Calais, a few small launches switched on recordings of ‘chains rattling, commanders talking over loudspeakers, bosuns piping. Two days after D-day, Brutus radioed his German controller in Paris that he had seen “with my own eyes the Army Group Patton preparing to embark.” He reported that “General (George) Marshall of the American Army comes here from Washington on the 9th or 10th ne to see Patton and his troops off.” The next day Garbo radioed a similar account to his German con- troller in Madrid. The controller, Gen. Erich Kuhlenthal, cabled Hi- tler’s headquarters that he was con- vinced Normandy was just a “maneuver” to entice the Germans into a trap. On the morning of June 10, an Ultra intercept confirmed to- the Allies that Hitler was still hooked.

They would probably have failed without the sledgeham- mering of occupied France by the Allied air forces. “Without air superiority, we couldn’t have made the landing at all,” says retired Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay, who com- manded 200 B-17 heavy bombers as a two-star general. during Nor- mandy. Ejisenhower’s staff had devised a plan code-named “Transportation” for the bombing of 80 railroad cen- ters in France and Belgium to hin- der the Nazis in sending reinforce- ments. i When “Transportation” came - before the British war cabinet, it de- clared its “adverse view’’ after hearing that the plan might kill 20,- 000 _~—s civilians. Even = Churchill worried about creating such hatred in France that it would poison Anglo-French relations for years. But President Franklin D. Roose- velt prevailed, on grounds that the bombing would save lives among Allied troops. : .. By June the Allies- had dropped 66,000 tons. of bombs on scores of railyard centers — the explosive equivalent of four Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs. By D-day, rail traffic had fallen to 13 percent of its Janu- ary level, creating what Churchill called a “railway desert around the German troops at Normandy.” Forty years later, one of the few remaining battle relics is the great Gothic cathedral at Rouen, France, whose stained glass windows. are still being repaired. The cathedral: was accidentally bombed because it: happened to stand.a few blocks from. a rail yard. In May the bombers added Ger- man synthetic fuel plants to their hit list. Aviation fuel available to the Luftwaffe fell from 180,000 tons in April to 50,000 tons in June to 10,- 000 tons in August. One of the critical inventions that further weakened the Luftwaffe was _ the American P-51 Mustang fighter. Since early 1944, the. long-range Mustangs had shot down more Ger- man pilots than could be trained. On D-dav. the Allies filled the skv with 9,000 planes, including hundreds of bombers with orders to knock out beach defenses. On Omaha, the bombing failed.. The clouds were so thick that the bombers were forced to unload up to three miles inland. ‘The Allies had expected the Ger- mans to strafe the beaches, but nothing happened. The Luftwaffe could only manage to get 319 planes in the air all day. Field Marshal Rommel wrote to Hitler on June 10: “Practically our entire traffic ... is pinned down by powerful fighter-bomber and bomber formations ... The move- ment of our troops on the battlefield is- almost paralyzed, while the enemy can maneuver freely.” =The climax came in mid-August when half a million German soldiers were encircled in the Falaise “pocket” 30 miles inland, Day after day, Allied fighter-bombers would seal off German columns on con- . gested roads, then strafe and bomb the columns in what Spitfire pilots called “the killing ground.” ~Eisenhower, after visiting Falaise | in late August, said, ‘It was literally possible to walk for hundreds of ' yards at a time stepping on nothing but dead and decaying flesh.” ! Another route to Berlin “Our chiefs are convinced of one . thing,” President Roosevelt confided . to his son Elliott in 1943. “The way to kill the most Ger- mans, with the least loss of Ameri- ° can soldiers, is to mount one great big invasion and then slam ’em with everything we've got. It makes sense to me. It makes sense to Uncle Joe , (Stalin) ... : “Trouble is, the P.M. (Churchill) , is thinking too much of the postwar, — where England will be. ... He's scared of letting the Russians get too strong in E Churchill had favored another route toward Berlin: a up- ward through the Balkans into Hun- gary. But Stalin balked, and the Ameri- can joint chiefs worried that their troops would bog down in the moun- tain passes through Y via. Reluctantly, the Allies agreed on a slash into northern France. In April 1943, about 40 British and American officers under British Lt. Gen. Frederick Morgan began the planning. They had to find miles of flat, wide beach close enough to British airfields to be covered by the Spit- fire fighter. The beach had to have natural exits so vehicles could move ee and dry fighting terrain be- yond. The Pas de Calais, closest to Brit- ain, looked good. But Morgan’s staff dismissed it because of massive Ger- man defenses. Hence Normandy. Planners had to correlate millions of details: Would landing vehicles travel on the right side of the road in France, as in Britain? No. What about mail? Postal units must operate from the day after D- day. What about water? Transport half a gallon a day for each healthy sol- dier, two gallons for the wounded. There were fears of a German nerve gas attack. So the planners set aside a 60-day supply of gas shells | ‘in Britain. LeMay became cult figure After Normandy, people went their own ways. LeMay, now 77, was assigned to the Pacilic, where he directed the incendiary bombing of Tokyo. Later, as US. Air Force chief of staff in the nuclear age, he would become a cult figure with his reputed remark: “Bomb ’em back to the Stone Age.” LeMay recalls how frustrated he felt on D-day because he had to stay in his operations center. “IT wanted to get out there over the beaches to see what was happen- ing,” he says. And Pfc. Harry Garton? After his jeep hit a mine, he came to and noticed his boot had been blown across the road. In it was part of his leg. “I think it helped that I had been a boxer,” Garton says. “I knew how to take a little pain.” Interviewed during his first visit to Normandy in 40 years, he said he fashioned a tourniquet by twisting a knife in his pantleg. A medical vehi- cle happened by and took him to a field hospital. A Red Cross attendant wrote a letter to his teenage girlfriend, Anna, in Pennsylvania. It said that he had been hurt but he was OK. Anna telephoned Garton’s mother, who had heard nothing. His mother said it was probably frostbite. Four years after the war, he and Anna were married. They have a son and a daughter. With a ninth-grade education and artificial legs, Garton could find no job back home. aston he used the GI bill to fin- high school in an accelerated program at Temple University in hiladelphia. He went back to Temple and earned a bachelor’s degree, a mas- ter’s and a doctorate in education. Garton was a teacher and curricu- lum coordinator at the Council Rock School District in Bucks County, Pa., until he retired two years ago. Since then he has taken on an avocation: lecturing to high school students about war and peace. “T tell them what it was like on D- day,” he says. “That there weren’t any heroes, that sooner or later you are going to get hit or killed.” He tells them they should think about war — and about how they must work to avoid it. “It’s become almost a crusade for me,” he said.

Botha on Mon- day capped his n diplomatic debut by receiving a plaudit from ‘the Vatican about “a positive step forward” in South Africa's relations with its black African neighbors. It was one of the less chilly recep- tions Botha has received on the eight-nation European tour he is undertaking to symbolize South Afri- ca’s acceptance into the mainstream of world politics. Pope John Paul II met for 28 minutes Monday with Botha in his private study while several hundred demonstrators gathered in front of the South African Embassy to de- nounce Botha’s visit and South Afri- ca’s apartheid system of racial seg- regation. A Vatican statement issued afterward placed heavy stress on the pope’s desire for the independ- ence of Namibia, the territory in Southwest Africa being ruled by South Africa in defiance of United Nations resolutions. The statement reiterated the Catholic Church's opposition to South African racial policies of apartheid — but ina carefully couched paragraph that omitted any reference to the pope’s own views or to Botha’s regime. , A top South “Mi African black church leader, Anglican Bishop De- smond = Tutu, had said in Johannesburg that the pope’s ee faa meeting with Botha would P.W. Botha amount to “a slap in the face for all the victims of apartheid.” The Vatican said the Roman Cath- olic bishops of South Africa have publicly demonstrated their “con- cerns and reservations” about apar- theid several times, adding that apartheid “is considered as contrary to the Christian principle of the equal dignity of all men.” The only justification, Tutu said, would be if Botha is told in no uncertain terms “just how unaccept- able and horrendous apartheid is.” In recent decades, there has been no known instance of a pope refus- ing to see a head of state or govern- ment who sought an audience, But there have been at least two cases when a papal meeting has re- sulted in stinging criticism. In 1973, Israeli Prime Minister . Golda Meir sought and received an audience with the late Pope Paul VL The Vatican later issued a commu- nique expressing concern with the plight of “weak and defenseless” Palestinians. And during his visit to Latin America last year, Pope John Paul embarrassed Haitian leader Jean- Claude Duvalier by proclaiming the need for Haiti's “privileged class” to grant “justice” to other Haitians. Since June 29, Botha has been re- ceived with varying degrees of cor- diality in Portugal, Switzerland, England, France, Belgium, West Germany and Austria. Botha found the climate most con- genial in Portugal, where socialist Prime Minister Mario Soares re- marked publicly that segregation in South Africa was an internal matter.

By Joseph Albright Cox News Service ROME — The Kremlin's up-and- coming No, 2 leader, Mikhail Gorba- chov, on Wednesday boldly signaled Moscow's desire to bury the hatchet with balky Communist parties in Western Europe but passed up a chance to make a conciliatory nod toward China. Gorbachov, the chief Soviet repre- sentative at the funeral of Italian Communist Party leader Enrico Herlinguer, said Soviet Communists “have the same aims and follow the “game lines” as Italian Communists, “Every Communist Party has its own autonomy and its own tactics,” Gorbachov told Italian reporters, “There are bonds of decades be- tween us Italian and Soviet Commu: nists,” Gorbachov sat 10 seats away from Chinese Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang on the funeral platform in St. John Latern Square, rallying point ‘in Rome, Reporters observed no exchange of words or gestures between the delegates of the feuding communist superpowers. fe Little seemed to have changed since the funeral of Yugoslavian leader Josi the traditional leftist Pe At that ceremony, Soviet leader Leo- nid Brezhnev and Chinese leader Hua Guofeng were positioned close to each other but did not exchange greetings. Moscow surprised a good many European Kremlin watchers by sending such a high-ranking mourner as Gorbachov to Rome. Berlinguer had openly criticized Soviet moves in crushing Polish dissidents and was a foremost roponent of the pesky notion of mmunism — communism free of Soviet control. In 1982 Berlinguer went so far as to accuse the Soviets of the sin of “hege- mony.” .

Western oil sources, here for the OPEC meeting, said Iran has deen selling oil for about $25 a barrel — $4 a barrel below the official OPEC price. Japanese oil company sources said the Iranian discounts have run as high as $7 a barrel.

Perhaps that is why Piero Squeglia, the conservative Christian Democratic may- or, is organizing a campaign to help the fa- vorite daughter of the town. “We shall help her by getting in touch with all the people we know in the United States to help her candidacy,” said Squeg- lia, a high school Latin and Italian teacher when he is not presiding at the town hall. Should Ferraro get elected, it would not be the first time Marcianise has enjoyed some great, inexplicable event. Miracles are a tradition here. IN THE LAST 15 years the town has benefited from an economic miracle. If nominee Ferraro ever gets back here, she will find a much more prosperous place than the agricultural backwater her father left to emigrate to the United States in 1920. People still dry tobacco in their back yards, and the wail of itinerant vegetable peddlers is heard in the streets. But the outskirts of this town of 35,000 abound with light industry, including an Olivetti ma- chine tool plant and a Kodak film factory. People still speak of miracles of the reli- gious variety, however. Exactly 100 years ago, or so it is said, the whole region from Naples inland suffered from a cholera epidemic. Fear grew every week in Marchianise as the infection spread from one village to another. ACCORDING TO LEGEND, priests in the church of St. Michael the Archangel came to the rescue. In the nick of time, they pulled back the red draperies that co- vered their statue of Christ on the cross. “Not one died of cholera,” says a history of the town published in 1953 by Gaetano Andrisani, one of Ferraro’s cousins.

Once again the priests decided to pull the drapes hiding the crucifix. After one hour, according to the legend, the skies cleared, the fields dried, and the worms disappeared. IN 1906, MOUNT Vesuvius erupted 12 miles away and rained an inch of ashes on. the town and adjacent fields. A strong wind blew open the doors and windows of the church. Yet, according to legend, as soon as someone removed the._crucifix from its co- vered niche, the wind changed and the ashes blew toward the Mediterranean. Ferraro’s grandfather, Carlo, residents. He and his wife, Lener Maria, lived ina two-story stone house on the main street, 200 yards from the church. Theirs was one of the few residences with carved stone gargoyles below the roof.

When he was 20, his sister, Amalia, died in an influenza epidemic that ravaged southern Italy after World War I. IN 1920, FERRARO’S father, who was 22, left by boat for the United States, where other relatives were already living. In New York, the father married Anton- etta, an American girl whose parents had emigrated from Salerno province, 30 miles south of Marcianise. Ferraro has come back to Marcianise only once, in 1957, a year after she gradu- ated from college. “We couldn’t speak the same language, but we understood each other,” said Carlo Andrisani. “She spent a day with each of the relatives.” In 1980 she came to Italy on a congres- sional mission to preside over the distribu- tion of relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Naples region. did not stop to see her relatives.

        "ocr_text": "2 d p Nuclear weapons spread still stifled By Joseph Albright Cox News Service VIENNA — The United States and the Soviet Union are still working hand in glove here toward keeping atomic bombs away from smaller countries. This is one of the rare cases where cooperation between the atomic Big Two has endured or even increased despite their venomous haranguing in almost every other world forum. Like the two proverbial scorpions in a bottle, they are condemned to agree to one objective: keeping oth- er scorpions out. “It is true that our relations are on their worst level in 10 or 15 or 20 years,”’ says Oleg Khlestov, the So- viet ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency. But ‘‘our national interests more or less coincide”’’ on controlling the worldwide proliferation of nuclear weapons technology. Khlestov said in a recent interview. As a result, he said, Soviet-U.S. dealings remain ‘‘not bad but even good’”” within the Vienna-based, UN- affiliated agency that monitors the worldwide spread of nuclear technology. American ambassador’ Richard Williamson, President Reagan’s en- voy to the agency. seconds the motion. “-In my 13 months there has been no interruption in the cooperation between the United States and the U.S.S.R. on nonproliferation issues,”’ he said.*‘If anything, it has become closer.

Vir- tually all the world’s potential joi- ners of the nuclear club are mem- bers of the agency. From the lowest staff level to the board of governors, the agency de- pends on Russian nuclear bureau- crats working with American nucle- ar bureaucrats, along with those of France, Britain, Japan and other ad- vanced nuclear nations. A recent agency phone book pro- vides clues to the way the super- power rivals have their experts intertwined. Raymond Parsick, an American, heads the sensitive unit which checks up on the agency’s field in- spectors. A Russian, Vladimir Forta- Kkov,. is one of Parsick’s chief deputies. But Issaev Lev, a Russian, is the director of the communications of-, fice where inspection reports are re- ceived and routed. An American, Jo- seph Nardi, is a principle aide. ' Despite some rubs, a surprising measure of cohesion exists among the multi-national nuclear staffers.' **There is sort of a scientific commu- nity. says agency spokesman Georges Delcoigne. “‘These people, have Known each other for 20 years.” ' Any staff reports suggesting pos-: + bes ti beer, “NOW THE KINDLING” sible nuclear proliferation — say an agency inspector found broken seals on a nuclear storage vault in Pakis- tan, or 10 kilograms of enriched ura- nium was unaccounted for in Argen- tina — is first considered by the agency’s director general, Hans Blix. a former foreign minister of Sweden. It is his job to seek a sufficent ex- planation from the suspected coun- try by asking its ambassador in Vienna. Blix bucks any unsettled questions in strict confidence to the agency’s board of governors, consisting of representatives from the agency's more than 110 member nations. As representatives of the main nu- clear “‘have”’ nations, Khiestov and Williamson frequently find them- selves trying to hold the safeguards system intact in the face of criticism from the nuclear “*have-nots.”’ One recurring complaint is that the superpowers have continued to multiply their arsenals despite their commitments under the Non-Pro- liferation Treaty to cut back on atomic weaponry. Informed sources said the two am- bassadors talk privately, sometimes several times a week. Most of their encounters happen on Vienna’s live- ly diplomatic cocktail circuit. The two also play tennis and meet in each other's offices. Informed sources said Khliestov and Williamson don’t exchange high- ly sensitive intelligence information on countries suspected of developing bombs. Instead. their cooperation report- edly consists of trying to contain big- power controversies that could para- lyze the agency’s safeguards sys- tem. They also have worked in par- allel to hold down agency spending for nuclear tecnical assistance to Third World world countries. Despite their region of coinciding interests, their relations on a public plane are far from buddy-buddy. Talking with a reporter.

And besides, why did Jimmy Carter boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics? Millions of Soviet sports fans have heard the bare bones results of the Los Angeles Olympic Games through government television and news- papers. But — save for the rela- tively small number who live or are taking vacations near the Finnish border and can pick up Finnish tele- vision — the Soviet people have been unable to watch the competi- tion. The account that the Russians are receiving is one of smog threatening the health and performance, and perhaps the lives, of the athletes, and even of horses; of outrageous prices and half-filled stands; of se- curity guards arrested for drug use; of American athletes spurning the poorly-constructed Olympic village dormitories. “The Death of the Eagle” was the headline over the sports page in the Olympics wrapup in Pravda one day last week. To the writer, G. Vasilev, the death of the American eagle, “Bomber,” while training to partici- pate in Olympic opening ceremonies was symbolic of the failings of American foreign policy of trying to become the “world’s policeman.” And it also symbolized the sorry state of the Games. Besides the eagle’s sad state, the The Associated Press BACKUP BIRD: Samantha on arm of Californian Steve Hoddy. story said the Brazilian equestrian team had been forced to withdraw from competition because one of the Brazilian horses was “stabbed in the neck with a knife.” The story, based on a Tass dispatch from Los An- geles, said one Olympic staff mem- ber “claimed” the horse had cut it- self on a metal tag in the stall. “But aren’t the ‘accidents’ happening in Los Angeles too many?” the Tass writer asked. Judging from the official press, In this sports-minded nation, where the first US-Soviet track meets were an i event in the thaw, the level of vitriol over the Games was a further evidence of the icy state of relations between the masters of the Kremlin press coverage is that Reagan has politicited the Olympics for elec- toral advantage in November. - Western diplomatic sources seemed willing to join the fray over the Olympics, telling reporters that one factor behind the Russian with- drawal may be a fear that Soviet athletes would have flunked this year’s more stringent Olympic tests for steroids and stimulant drugs. Other Western analysts speculated that the Soviet cancellation resulted primarily from Foreign Minister An- drei Gromyko’s desire to “get even” after the administration can- celed American participation in the 1980 Moscow Games. \f"

In what sounded like an episode from “Battlestar Galactica,’’ the Soviet group reported that one way of knocking out American space-based anti-missile stations Continued From Page 1-A nents of the Star Wars approach, who have likewise contended that countermeasures would be easily available. Copies of the unpublished report were given last week to several American scholars and journalists attending a conference on disarma- ment in Moscow with a group of Soviet academicians. Western diplomatic sources, asked by the Cox Newspapers to comment on the report, said its most enlight- ening section was that outlining possible Soviet countermeasures to a space-based ABM network. The sources, who had not previ- ously seen the report, said it ap- peared to be the most comprehen- sive Soviet public description of where Russian scientists believe tiie possible U.S. system might be vul- nerable.

Page 7-A. would be to hurl “clouds” of heavy balls in their paths. Another potential countermeas- ure, the Soviet scientists said, would be to camouflage Soviet missile launchings by using “all kinds of smoke screens.”’ The report indicated that their on how an American Star Wars sys- tem might work, how much it would cost, and how it could be defeated. Ostensibly, the information on U.S. plans was pieced together by Soviet government researchers from articles in Western technical publi- cations describing the space-based missile defense network outlined by President Reagan in his March 1983 Star Wars speech. The report said it may well be technically possible for the United States to deploy a space-based ABM network for about $20 billion in eight to 10 years. But according to the report, such a system could knock down only about 15 incoming Soviet missiles during a quick-fire Soviet missile at- tack — an insignificant fraction of the Soviet missile arsenal. To take out 1,000 Soviet missiles and thereby spare the United States massive nuclear destruction would require much larger, more powerful lasers that lie ‘‘beyond present-day technological possibilities,” the Soviet report said. Then, operating on the premise that all technological obstacles could be overcome, the report said an effective 1,000-missile space shield purpose would be to prevent the huge laser guns envisioned for American space stations from locking onto a Soviet missile as it rises from the ground. The report — in and laden with mathematical formulas — appeared aimed at persuading Western scientists to oppose fur- ther development of an American space-based anti-ballistic missile network. Its appearance now is clearly part of a Soviet campaign to obtain a moratorium on the testing of military space weapons and to counter the Reagan admin- istration’s resistance. In many respects, the report echoes arguments made in the United States by American oppo- See STAR WARS, Page 7-A would consist of 18 giant space sta- tions weighing 800 tons each. A Soviet calculation in the docu- ment said deploying the 18 stations would cost the United States $400 billion and require 1,440 round trips by a space shuttle. The report then outlined a series of countermeasures it said the Sovi- ets could successfully adopt to coun- ter a large space-based ABM net- work. Aside from camouflaged launchings and clouds of ‘‘big balls,” the report mentioned these other potential countersteps: w The space stations could be shot down with small ground-based missiles similar to the U.S. Sprint missile developed in the 1960s for the now-defunct U.S. land-based ABM system. @ Soviet ‘space mines” armed with short-range missiles could be orbited close to American space sta- tions, to be fired off when necessary. @ Large Soviet laser guns could be aimed at the space stations from the ground. @ The Soviets could force the space stations to use up precious stocks of fuel for the lasers by means of “false missile launchings.” Atlanta Constitution - August 8, 1984 \f"

Olga Medvedkova has decorated her little kitchen with dozens of peace buttons given-to her by Western peace groups. Ten days ago, she went to the store to buy .curtains. On her way home she found three black cars of plainclothesmen ‘following her. She was surprised: Teams of: plainclo- thesmen tailed her almost every day last winter, but they -had left’ he alone since March. Her friend Maria Fleishgakker planted flower seeds in the shape of a peace emblem this spring near her apartment.

These two women are members of Moscow's tiny, cautious band of independent peace advocates who call themselves’ the “Group to Establish Trust Between the U.S.S.R. and the United States.” They have had the audacity to call on the lead- ets of both countries to avoid a com- plete deterioration of detente. - Taking care to avoid outright criticism of the Soviet s stem, most have thus far managed to dissent without getting sent to Siberia. Their lives are a day-to-day gam- ble. Only last Wednesday, Western news bureaus here got a furtive call from one leader asserting that 50 members of the group had been de- tained for up to four hours after ing to hold a meeting in Mrs. Fleishgakker’s apartment. The caller said two participants faced further consequences, but there was no mention of charges against Mrs. Fleishgakker, Mrs. ‘Medvedkova or their husbands. The te Olga Medvedkove report of such a large gathering was greeted with some skepticism be- cause resident Western correspond- ents believe the group had only about a dozen core members. Leading members say that Soviet authorities have not cracked down harder for two reasons: first, be- cause the peace activists have not attacked the state; and second, be- cause their cause has been publi- cized in the West. They feel that, having gone this far, more publicity can only help them. “It is a difficult thing to stop when you are once involved,” Mrs. Medvedkova, 35, told a reporter who knocked on the door of her sixth- floor walk-up flat. “When you begin, you don’t expect such harassment.” She is the group’s most publicized member, having recently received a suspended sentence after being tried for punching a policeman. A re- searcher with a Ph.D., she has an 8- year-old son and expects a second child in a few months. Like most of the half-dozen or so Soviet citizens willing to say they are members, Mrs. Medvedkova hopes to. emigrate to Israel. Indeed, Soviet academicians close to the: government say she is making trou-~ ble in hopes of getting expelled. She applied for an exit visa four years ago but was turned down for’ what has been described by pro- Soviet journalists as “complicated family reasons.” Two years later, in June 1982, fc and her husband, Yuri, 53, also a. “refusenik,” decided to sign the first’ unofficial peace petition, which- called for a worldwide freeze in the deployment of nuclear weapons. In official Soviet eyes, the group’s members strayed from acceptable: behavior not only because they im-.- plicitly blamed the arms race on both superpowers but also because they announced their petition to Western journalists. ! See PEACE 28A » Atlanta Journal-Constitution August 12, 1984 \f€ace Yuri Medvedkov, in a late-night interview in his apartment, said 900 Soviet citizens in Moscow, Leningrad and Riga signed the 1982 petition. “Very suddenly arrests and house searches began,” he said. But there have been no mass prison sentences. Of the group’s 11 founding mem- FROM 25A bers, he said five, including himself, — have been jailed and three others have been placed under temporary house arrest.

Mrs. Medved- kova believes that this foreign inter- est in her case was partly responsi- ble for her suspended sentence. The group’s exhilaration faded somewhat in April when Radzinskiy — who was apparently at a labor. camp in Siberia — issued a state- ment denouncing their activities as “political maneuvering.” The state- ment also attacked President Rea- gan, who had that Radzin- skiy was a victim of politicial perse- cution. Since then, a total of eight members have. stood on downtown Moscow streets twice — four on May 18, four others on June 3 — soliciting signatures for a new peti- tion asking Soviet and American leaders to hold a summit confer- der Shatravka, whom they described as a 27-year-old seasonal worker, is now serving a three-year term in a labor camp in Kazakstan. Unlike the others, who have been active in Moscow, Shatravka was ar- rested in Siberia, where he was working. Shatravka was convicted of anti-Soviet activities for circulating a peace petition which Medvedkov Says is identical to the one he helped circulate in Moscow two years ago. Another member, Oleg Radzin- skiy, was tried and sentenced in Moscow last October to one year in jail and five years in internal Soviet exile. His trial featured evidence that he had some years ago written a novel and a play critical of the Soviet state — evidence that may have been taken from his apart- ence. They collected about 300 signa- tures. As a result of this activity, au- thorities sent several group members to jail for 15-day stints. After that, the group decided to suspend public activities until November to avoid being accused of taking political stands during the American election. The Medvedkovs are the only de- clared members of the group who still hold professional jobs. Others lost theirs upon applying to emi- grate to Israel and have since be- come laborers.

It was while waiting at the court- house during Radzinskiy’s trial that Olga Medvedkova was taken to a po- lice station, arrested and charged with having punched a policeman. She could have gone to a labor camp for five years. Instead, the Soviet judge found her guilty and gave her a suspended sentence of 2% years. The judge said he was treating her leniently because she was a mother and had a clean record. “I was lucky,” she said. “It was a big victory.” During her trial, some British fe- male peace activists staged a sit-in at the Soviet Embassy in London after they had unsuccessfully sought visas to go to Moscow and attend cause she is under a suspended sen- tence, her employer is obligated under Soviet law to rehabilitate her. Her husband is a junior re- searcher at the same institute. He used to hold a more prestigious job, heading an ecology laboratory there and representing the Soviet Union at the World Health Organization in Switzerland. He was demoted four years ago when he applied for an exit visa to Israel. Maria Fleishgakker said she has decided to stop planting more peace emblems in Moscow for now. Instead, she has been giving flower seeds to her friends in other Soviet cities in hopes that a thou- sand peace symbols will bloom. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 12, 1984 (Continued) \f"

SUEZ, Egypt — At 6 p.m. July 6, a Libyan car ferry named the Ghat glided out of the southern end of the Suez Canal and headed south toward the Red Sea. Although there is nothing ap- proaching positive proof yet, the Ghat is emerging as one of the prime suspects in one of the strang- est Middle East whodunits in years. At the heart of the mystery is this question: What country, or what parties, have caused shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez to be struck by mines at least 16 times during the last five weeks? - But the immediate challenge for ‘Egyptian and Western mine-warfare experts is to find and disable the mines — and.to do it so that clues to their origin are not destroyed in the - Continued From Page 1=A ping Intelligence Department, was also a Soviet ship, the 633-ton fish carrier Bastion, which was struck Au Fhe” Libyan vessel is clearly not the only suspected mine-planter.

Just then, about 200 miles behind us, British navy mine-hunters were about to begin searching for sus- pected mines in the northern Gulf of Suez waters, which El] Tor had passed over safely during the night. After a glance into his radarscope, el-Gayar adjusted the ship's auto- matic steering mechanism and the big ferry executed a gentle turn eastward toward Saudi Arabia.

To a Cox Newspapers reporter who was One of the two Westerners aboard, El Tor seemed to be a ship of benign disdain. “Bombs under the water? No problem,” said a university-educated Egyptian microfilm expert named Fouad, who was traveling with his wife and 3-year-old daughter to his job in Kuwait. “Our government has taken care of it,” he said confidently. “The Americans and French have already cleared the mines. I am sure of it.” Fouad was on deck scanning the dark outlines of the mountainous desert under the stars. “Black moun- tains are not good,” he said. When asked why, he said the mountains reminded him that he would soon have to drive a dangerous mountain road from Iraq to Kuwait. Inside, in the first-class lounge about 20 Saudi and Egyptian passen- gers watched a color TV set as it showed an American congressman talking about mine sweeping in the waters we were plying.

It was a typical night, Souka said, and another 25 ships were steaming southbound directly ahead of the cargo ship. Even so, Souka has doubled the number of fire and lifeboat drills for the crew. He also has tried to instill extra vigilance among the lookouts Atlanta Journal - August 16, 1984 See RED SEA, Page 12-A who have always been stationed by the bridge to scan the horizon. Although Souka does not think striking a mine is at all likely, he cannot help worrying about what would happen if he did. . “Of course I am worried about. the ship and passengers — because of the panic if we met a mine,” he said. “Most of the passengers are laborers and are not well-educated.” The ship has eight big lifeboats and 34 inflatable rubber rafts. Theo- retically, the crafts would take care of all 1,100-odd passengers who make up a typical daily voyage. But if the rush to line up for good places on the deck was any indication, a call for the lifeboats could become an unmanageable crush. Every trip for the last few weeks, El Tor has received a Morse code safety message from one of the two radio stations in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that are coordinating efforts to keep ships informed of possible floating mines. When the familiar T-T-T signal (three dashes in Morse code) is re- ceived by the ship’s radio operator, an officer immediately plots the sus- pected danger zone on a nautical chart kept on the bridge. .

Bazaar is a col- lection of stalls where country people come to sell the produce of their own little plots. As ee meander dowti the aisles, the stall keepers hawk their caer sometimes offering to cut the ice, ‘ A government-owned stand under the same roof also sells fruit, vegeta- bles and meat. Here you don’t bargain because the prices are state-controlled. On a cool August mid-afternoon when a Soviet acquaintance took me shopping, it seemed the private stalls were overstocked and begging for cus- tomers. But at the state-owned counters, shoppers were lined up and had to wait 10 minutes to reach the cashier, who was toting the prices on a wooden aba- cus. The state counters offered roughly the same range of produce as the pri- vate stalls. When I looked puzzled, my ac- 4 — let's call him Boris — pointed to the prices: Tomatoes at the private stalls selling for up to $2.20 a pound at the official dollar exchange rate. “They are are just waiting to catch their one or two customers who are looking for something special,” said Boris, At the state-owned counter, you could buy tomatoes for $1.10 a pound. You wouldn't mind eating them, but the more expensive ones at the private stalls looked like vine-ripened Big Boys from a gardener’s back yard. (It isn't simple trying to translate ruble prices into dollars: At black mar- ket dollar-ruble rates, those state-sold tomatoes cost something like 10 cents a pound.) Boris took me to a state-owned su- permarket down the street. In the re- frigerated meat counters, stacks of bony short ribs were available but cus- tomers were not interested. But at the next counter a line of about 20 people were. waiting while a butcher was The Miami News - RICARDO MARTINEZ stuffing and passing out sausages. Boris, a loyal communist and an economist, told me there is enough meat to go around now, especially in the big cities. But he said people still line up for steaks, roasts, sausages and other choice cuts. Boris said the government sets the price of all meat in state-owned stores at $1.10 a pound — whether it is a shank or a sirloin. He said the govern- ment budgets millions of rubles a year in subsidies to keep meat prices this low. To get the good cuts, you have to stand in a lot of lines — or you have to know butcher. Boris, who is part of the Soviet establishment, said he doesn’t stand in line. “I know the butcher in my neighborhood,” said Bo- ris. “He likes me.” Shopping in Moscow can be irritat- ing not only because of the lines but al- so because you never know what you will find. Miami News - One day there may be lamb. And then there won't be lamb for months. In the spring you can almost always find cabbage — until you plan to serve guests meat rolled in cabbage. That's the day you will find the cabbage is sold out. Soviet livestock growers last year sent to market 16 million tons of meat — enough to supply every Soviet man, woman and child 5.6 ounces of meat a day, judging by official statistics. Americans farmers grow more — 7.2 ounces of meat a day for every Ameri- can, judging by U'S. figures. Still, for Muscovites who lived through deep hunger in and after World War II, protein is becoming less of a luxury. Only 15 years ago, the farmers here produced enough livestock to supply each Soviet 4.4 ounces of meat a day. Soviet chickniks are helping too. Last year Soviet chickens laid 5.3 eggs a week for every Soviet citizen. Fifteen years ago, there were only 2.7 eggs a week per capita, according to Soviet Statistics. In Moscow, there is seldom fresh or even frozen fish in the stores. For all the 20,000 or so Soviet ocean trawlers fishing around the world, not much fish gets to the capital. To Boris’ eye, the gradual trend from a starch-laden diet to one more rich in protein has effects which are al- ready obvious on the street. “Just look,” he said. “The older peo- ple are all overweight and the younger generation is slimmer and taller.\" Boris maintained that buying good meat is easier than buying a good pop- ular novel. At the government-run book stores you can buy technical volumes galore, he said, but public demand for the lat- est books by modern Soviet novelists and poets seems to be outrunning the printing presses. “People are buying books for status, whether they read them or not,” he complained. He also said that Moscow doesn't have enough good restaurants to meet demand. From other residents, I learned that if you want to go to a pop- ular restaurant like the Baku, you must stand in line for a few hours or else have an “in” with the doorkeeper. Having an “in” can mean anything from knowing someone from school to giving him a bottle of cognac. August 17, 1984 \f"

The Americans are trying to unravel one of the weirder aspects of the mining mystery: Why did three ships report being rocked by explosions in one small stretch of water off Ras Shukheir in the space of a single day, and why are no other ships known to have been hit there before or since? » ; The three ships — two Panama- nian and one Cypriot — suffered only minor damage when they were hit July 28. American mine have examined two of the ships in port and have ruled out the possibil- ity of damage from explosions inside the ships. “There was definitely something exploding in the water,” one Ameri- can military source said. Navy investigators who examined the ships believe they hit mines lying on the sea bed, not floating mines or mines attached to cables, the American sources said. Another military source in Cairo said the pattern of the 22 explosions suggests that the mines may well have been armed with delayed-ac- tion timing devices. These would have “ordered” the mines to sit in the water for a certain number of days before their triggers became activated to explode upon encounter- ing a ship. | i Two shipping channels, each about _ tainly have been ship that has been hunting mines in the gulf since Aug. 4.

A close examination of the seven ships reportedly damaged in the gulf showed that some of the mines ex- ploded in the northbound channel and some in the southbound.

One. ship that has come under suspicion as the possible minelayer, the Libyan car ferry Ghat, steamed south th the Gulf of Suez on July 6, three days before the first explosion. There have been indications that the Ghat turned back northward after reaching the southern end of the Red Sea. But no record has sur- faced indicating whether or not the Ghat passed through the Suez Canal on its northbound course. Although Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has directly blamed Libya for laying the mines, the evi- dence remains inconclusive. The Libyans have denied the charge.

Since the first Soviet ship hit an un- known explosive a few miles south of the Suez Canal on July 9, the mines have re- mained as elusive as the Loch Ness monster.

Although the documents prove nothing by themselves, they do give a plausible explanation of how one “hit ship” could have planted mines in both the northbound and south- bound ship channels without being Continued From Page 1-A raised a number of questions con- cerning. the Ghat, ps the most intriguing was this: If the Libyan ship’s master knew his ship was about to be used to plant mines, why would he tell Egyptian authorities that “‘arms and ammunition” were included in his 1,500-ton cargo? His declaration to authorities, as the ship entered the canal for its southbound passage at 4 a.m. July 6, was that the ship was en route to Aseb, an Ethiopian port on the southern Red Sea. The Egyptian records do not show. whether the ship actually reached Aseb, or how much of the cargo may have been unloaded there. However, it is highly possible that Libya was shipping arms to Aseb, since Marx- ist Ethiopia has enjoyed generally friendly relations with Col. Moam- mar Kha , the Libyan leader. It also happens that Aseb is within 100 miles or so of a cluster of 11 Two weeks after the Ghat traveled south through the canal, it steamed north through the canal on its return passage to the Mediterra- nean and its home port of Tripoli, the Libyan capital. Its reappearance followed what the Suez Canal records indicate was a 2,800-mile round trip along all the sea lanes where 22 mine explosions have subsequently been reported. When the ship headed home caught zigzagging by coastal radar stations. Egyptian maritime sources said the Ghat is a 6,000-ton, “roll-on-roll- off” cargo carrier owned by the Libyan government. Before July, it had made only one other trip through the Suez Canal, the sources said. Military sources theorize that the mines placed in the water were equipped with delayed-action timing mine explosions that have damaged ships in the southern Red Sea. If the Ghat traveled at the 15-knot cruising speed that is standard in these waters, it should have reached Aseb about July 10. If it followed a straight course back to the Suez Canal at the normal speed, it must have left Aseb about July 17. The first mine explosion in the re- cent series hit the Russian ship Knud Jespersen on July 9, as the ship steamed south in a congested stretch of the Gulf of Suez a few miles from the canals southern mouth. LLoyd’s Shipping In > Unit outside London te dicates that the next explosion hit the Meyo Maiu, a Japanese ship, in the northbound channel of the Gulf of Suez on July 27. That was five days after the Libyan ship had followed the same northbound route on its return voy- age. Then, on July 28, another five ships wore ne both the north- boound i a0 nels of through the canal at 9 a.m. July 22, its Libyan master, who gave his name as Sadek Mohammed, listed the ship’s cargo as “‘ballast,” accord- ing to the records. “That means it was empty,” ex- plained an Egyptian -maritime source who examined the docu- ments.

These sources said ‘“‘roll-on- roll-off’? ships — which have large bow or stern doors that permit vehi- cles in the hold to be driven directly onto a dock when the ship reaches port — are particularly well suited for clandestine mining, although such a mission could also be carried out by other types of vessels.

        "ocr_text": "Paper: Libya probably obtained. mines used in Red Sea from Ital By Joseph Albright Cox News Service CAIRO — The semiofficial Egyp- tian newspaper Al Ahram charged Tuesday that Libya “in all probabil- ity” used mines it obtained from Italy to mine the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea. The “fingers of suspicion” strongly suggest that the Libyan cargo ship Ghat planted the mines during a two-week voyage that began shortly before the mines started exploding July 9, the news- paper said. The accusation came as the Ital- ian Parliament met in Rome to de- bate and give final approval to sending Italian mine sweepers to join other nations in efforts to find and disarm the mysterious mines that have damaged 18 ships in the last six weeks. In Rome, a spokesman for the Italian Foreign Ministry declined to comment on whether Libya had ob- tained mines from Italian compa- nies, Last week Francesco Rutelli, an Italian Parliament member from the opposition fringe Radical Party, charged that a number of Italian firms had sold mines to Libya. But his accusation fell flat in Italy when the companies issued denials and the Foreign Ministry and Defense Minis- try declined comment. On Tuesday, a senior Egyptian official said the Egyptian navy had detected five suspected mines deep in the Gulf of Suez and brought in special equipment to investigate. “No mines have been found until now, but five suspect objects have been located at great depths in the southern sector of the Gulf of Suez,” the official said. The official also confirmed that the Soviet Union has begun a sepa- rate sweep for mines in the southern Red Sea near the Strait of Bab El- Mandab. The Italian mine sweepers were due to leave a base near Genoa this week to join a force of Egyptian, American, British and French mine hunters working separate sectors of the Gulf of Suez and northern Red Sea. Two Russian mine sweepers passed southward through the Suez Canal several days ago, apparenfly bound for the southern Red Sea that struck a Soviet ship. Cox Newspapers reported Monday that the civilian master of the Ghat declared to Egyptian authorities that his cargo included “arms ahd ammunition” when the 6,000-ton Pp Suez Canal on July 6. Al Ahram reported another bi- zarre detail Tuesday. It said that while the Ghat was making its pas- sage through the canal, its civilian crew was replaced by another crew from the Libyan navy. Egyptian security officials had their suspicions aroused immedi- ately but they did not block the Ghat’s passage, canal records show. A log of ships passing southbound July 6 contains an unusual notation indicating that a Suez Canal Author- ity launch escorted the Ghat some distance beyond the canal’s southern, terminus into the Gulf of Suez. +, Atlanta Constitution - August 22, 1984 \f"

He called on Israel to do some: thing to improve the lot of Palestin. tans on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. But, interestingly, he, took care to avoid saying that a freeze on Israeli settlements on the West Bank was a precondition to improved Egyptian-Israeli relations, Ghali also called on the United States - after the US, elections - to help resolve a 2-year-old bound: ary question that is the only remain- ing territorial dispute between Egypt and Israel.

A‘ Libyan flag waved in the humid breeze from the;top floor. of the five-story building, three blocks frqm the Tripofi port. ¢ The building’s nS ground floor was open to foreign visi- tors and no armed guard was in sight. The Ghat was one.of 22 commercial ships-in the company’s fleet:that were displayed on a promotional poster on the front window. Green and white posters proclaimed the. slogans, “Partners, not Wage-Earners” and “Blacks wil} Prevail.” The ship with Ghat written in English on its bow is a cargo vessel with a chopped-off stern that allows it to back up directly to a dock for roll-off unloading. It was impossible to learn when or where the Ghat was built. One maritime source said Lybia obtained the ship from the Soviet Union. Another source said it. came a from somewhere in Western Europe. The maritime sources — who refused to be identi- fied for safety reasons — said the company owning the ship and its captain have had close ties with two Libyan government power centers which, ironically, have some- times been at odds. One is Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy him- self and the other is the Libyan navy. The sources said the Libyan shipping company has’ for some months been under the direct guidance of a Libyan ‘‘people’s revolutionary committee” led by Khadafy’s distant cousins.

Egypt, Chad, Senegal, Mali, N r, Gambia, Somalia, and Gheia __He has been accused of sendi assassination squads in attempts to kill four presidents: Ronald Rea- gan of the United States, Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, Anwar Sadat of Egypt, and Jaafar Nimeri of Su- dan — as well as King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan II of Morocco. ALTHOUGH DECLINING oil revenues have crimped his activi- ties in the last three years, Khada- fy has been the most dependable ary effect on the rest of the world, particularly when one considers that Libya’s population — 3.5 mil- lion — is about the same as that of Kansas Although he is best known for his revolutionary activities, Khadafy’s most far-reaching effect on the world has not been on the barri- cades. It has been a the gas pump. FAR MORE than than any other world figure, he pushed through the gigantic leap in world oil prices in the 1970s. Oil prices were hovering near $2 a barrel when Khadafy and his fel- low officers seized power. After discoveries by Western oil compa- nies in the 1950s and 1960s, Libya was up to about 2 million barrels a day in oil exports. But the roads, housing, and gen- eral living standards had not pro- gressed much from 1951, when a United Nations study character- Analysis financier in the world for out-of- power revolutionaries. His benefi- ciaries, in financial or moral support, have included movements in the Canary Islands, Chad, Cor- sica, Iran, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Morocco, Mozambique, Northern Ireland, Panama, the Philippines, Sardinia, Scotland, South Africa, Thailand, and Wales. Libya has also been accused of financing the 1972 Munich Olym- pics massacre of 11 Israeli athe- letes, the 1975 kidnapping of Saudi oil minister Sheikh Ahmad Zaki Yamani, and an attempt to sink the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II car- rying Jewish passengers to Israel. In the last few years, Khadafy’s revolutionary zeal has tended to obscure the circumstances of his rise to power and his extraordin- ized Libya as among the poorest countries in the world. Khadafy, full of revolutionary zeal, learned from Algeria how to demand state participation in for- eign oil companies. Occidental, an indepenent that lacked the worldwide strength of a major oil company, gave in to the Libyan demands in September 1970. And a decade-long spiral of nationalizations and oil price in- creases began. LIBYA NOW collects about $29 a barrel for its oil, but it has cut back to 1.1 million barrels a day under a quota. As a result, Libya earns $12 billion a year for its oil. A mystical Arab populist, Kha- dafy has lived frugally while see- ing to it that his disciples spend oil revenue on his two chief passions.

Throughout the populated north- ern strip of Libya, one sees new apartment blocks, Western-style state department stores, highways with cloverleafs. Private enter- prise is gradually being squeezed out, with barbers and beauticians among the latest to be nationalized. One sees no slums, no mansions, no beggars. But Khadafy has seen scarcely any progress on his other objective of unifying the Middle East and north Africa into one “Arab na- tion” that would eliminate Israel and live happily ever after, sharing Saudi oil, Sudanese soil, Egyptian laborers, and Libyan philosophical inspiration.

The legality of American participation is not the only potential source of contro- versy in a project of such magnitude | beginning 180 miles from the border of Egypt, one of America’s closest Middle Eastern friends. Another potential source of embar- rassment arose late Saturday, when Khadafy hinted in a speech to the Libyan General People’s Congress that some Liby- ans may be forced to leave the cities and take up farming on the 800,000 acres of land that will eventually be irrigated by water piped from the desert. Without mentioning the project di- rectly, Khadafy told the assembled revolu- i committee chairmen from around bya that it is now necessary to recon- pnw 9 a. \" that uses telephones, streets and rm urban public services without producing. : “Those who we do not need to stay in the cities should not stay in,the cities,” said Khadafy, in a phrase reminiscent of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, when city dewellers were forced to the countryside. Under the “Great Man Made River Project,” Khadafy intends to irrigate 37,- 000 new farms, mostly along the green strip near Libya's Mediterranean coast. The average size of the farms will be 25 acres. They will be made available free to would-be farmers under the tenets of Khadafy’s “third international theory” as in his “Green Book.” - Despite the availability of free land and water, some outside experts have ex- ‘pressed doubts that many Libyans will take up farming voluntarily, partly be- cause of their reluctance to relinquish the free public services, apartments and education available in the increasingly congested cities of Tripoli and Benghazi. Another tial problem is how Egypt and Sudan are likely to react over the next several years. The two countries are among America’s close collaborators on most Middle Eastern problems. Al- Egypt and Sudan have not made an issue of the Libyan project, Khadafy used his speech at the dedication ceremony to advocate the overthrow of both President Hosni Mubarek of Egypt and Gaafar Ni- meiry of Sudan.

The mines, called “Manta” by their Italian manufacturer, are so » small that four would fit in a large trash can. They were introduced into | the world arms market in 1980 as devices suitable for blowing up land- ing craft and other small ships in shallow water. Luciano Bellaro, marketing man- ager of MISAR SpA of Brescia, | Italy, said in a telephone interview . that he strongly doubts his compa- ny’s mines were used in the Red Sea. “Iam sure that none of our cus- tomers are playing this sort of - game,” Bellaro said, adding that he hag. not been contacted by American agents, He said MISAR has exported .Manta mines to “fewer than 10” for- eign countries, and only after ob- taining Italian government: permis- sion. He said MISAR has never sold any mines to Libya, which has been accused by Egypt of planting the mines. Western authorities, including the CIA; now assume the Italian mines - wpe dropped in the water from the ‘0 door of the Libyan com- mitcial ip Ghat, which made a circuit through the Red Sea between | July 6 and July 22 to deliver carte to Ethiopia. Libya has denied dumping any- thing — even dirty water — and Western diplomatic seprees — ac- knowledge there is no evidence “that would stand up in om to to impl- cate Libya. The CIA conclusion sparetty is based on tracing sales of the Manta mines to Libya through Undisclosed \"intermediaries. The Manta came under suspicion » because it is one of the few models of modern mines that has an explo- , Sive charge small to cause ‘the relatively mild danfage reported by the 18 ships, Military experts in Cairo, Egypt, said last month that a modern ocean to sink ships carries a 50 to 1,100 pounds of explosive can be either 306 pounds of or 396 pounds of the explosive HBX:3, ac- cording to figures issued by the ‘company at a'naval trade show in _ in mid-May. from the show's catalog dane a Manta mine shaped like an inverted, -off ice cream cone.

MISAR introduced the Manta mine to world arms buyers at a similar Jtalian naval. trade show in 1980. At this year’s show, the outer plastic shell of the Manta was dis- . played along with six larger models. “saying the mines “are e in shallow water.” He downplayed said one Manta costs $10,000 to $20,- of MISAR-made mines. In what could be a lucky bit of commercial puffery, it turns out that a catalog of the Genoa show cota technical data that mips an unsophisticated purchaser to believe the mines are powerful ‘. enough destroy ships at the water exist-in the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea. ‘The brochure says the “laying depth of the mine” can vary from 3 meters to 100 meters, or 9.3 feet to 310 feet. Most of the 18 ships were traveling in water depths of about 150 feet when hit. In an interview, however, Bellaro issued ‘an important gpalficatin, fective only the figures in the brochure as having been “for commercial The brochure clearly says the Manta “is particularly suitable for use in shallow water against ‘medium-sized and small ships such as landing craft.” The brochure says its shape is “suitable to be planted in waters where there is a strong current, such as rivers and channels.” Western sources said the only mine found so far was an old unex- ploded one that had been in the Gulf of Suez since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. - When the British mine hunters found it, they destroyed it for safety reasons, the sources said. State Department officials said ‘this week that the US. Navy mine hunters will probably complete their work in about 10 days and leave the Red Sea area whether they find a ‘mine or not. i Egyptian, American, British, French, Italian and Soviet ‘mine hunting vessels have been searching without success since Aug. 4. ~ Western sources ‘say it now ap-. gre unlikely that any mines will ., The sources theorized the mines had a self-destruct mech. _ causing them to detonate if. no ships passed within a_ certain time. Bellaro ‘would ‘hot say if the Manta comes equipped with such a device but noted that any mine could be made to self-destruct with ani appropriate timer. Western sonar gear theoretically can find a plastic mine, but plastic is much harder tg detect than metal. Finding a Manta would be especially challenging because it is small and would tend to, look like a gentle bump on the sea bottom. Atlanta Constitution - September 7, 1984 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Khadafy urges harsh ‘progress’ as Libyan rule marks 15 years By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service TRIPOLI, Libya — Restless and convinced that his citizens are too soft, Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy appears to have begun a more Draconian stage of his Arab populist revolution. Western journalists who got a chance to travel outside Tripoli 10 days ago found clues that Khada- fy’s revolutionary cadres are al- ready starting to impose a “voluntary” labor system to over- come the perennial reluctance of Libyans to live in the desert and work on rigidly structured farms. Fifty miles south of Tripoli, Mo- hammmad Mussa, head of the Rev- olutionary People’s Committee in the town of Ghariyan, told a report- er that students, soldiers, and fac- tory workers are required to work in the local 200,000-tree experi- mental apple orchard in addition “WE BELIEVE that in projects that don’t need specialized train- ing, all the people must do it,” said Mussa, 32. The theme of forced progress re- curred like an ominous oboe throughout six hours of speeches by Khadafy last weekend, the 15th anniversary of his overthrow of King Idris I on Sept. 1, 1969. Khadafy revealed that he in- tends to take personal charge of a revolutionary force that will move every day to a different place in Libya to “‘mobilize the masses.” ONCE INDOCTRINATED, the people will be “transferred to an- other place according to a specific . ficiency need for Clearly, Khadafy was trying to recreate the fervor of his Cultural Revolution that began in 1973. program we will set up for them,” he said Sept. 1. Among his observations to the People’s Congress: © There is a frightening num- ber of new hospitals under con- struction. The numbers of people staying in hospitals should be lim- ited and healthy people should be treated at home. ® The congress needs to review the best way to remove the bour- geoisie in the big cities. People who are using roads, telephones, and other public services without producing for society should not remain in the cities. ® Libyans must accept late- shift jobs now performed by for- eign workers. ® Libyans must refrain from luxuries such as cars and imported meat. They must temporarily give up their present style of life in or- der that Libya can achieve self-suf- by cutting down on the Then, Khadafy began crushing small businesses, installed an Isla- mic legal code, and created the first revolutionary committees to manage Libyan enterprises. In his dashing, erratic way, Kha- dafy has maintained an undenia- ble popularity among vast numbers of the 3.9 million Libyans and millions of other Arabs. “IT IS A PITY he is not on our side,” a Western diplomat said recently. At the same time, many Libyans are sullen and irritated by short- ages of such things as fresh vegeta bles, meat, and toilet paper. But most diplomats and Weste residents think the daily irritatior level in the streets makes very lit tle difference in assessing Khada fy’s longevity as Libya’s leader. The critical factor, they say, how long Khadafy can continue to withstand assassination and coup attempts by Islamic fundamental- ists who are either inside or close to the Libyan military. SEVEN ARMED plotters were killed and five more arrested ina shootout with militiamen May 8 af- ter the plotters made an abortive raid on the barracks in Tripoli where Khadafy often sleeps. Diplomatic sources who main- tain contacts with the Libyan se- cret police say that Khadafy’s loyalists arrested as many as 600 regular military men and militia- men after the coup attempt. Five thousand civilians were said to have been arrested. In June, a number of the arrest ed plotters were executed in a gris ly televised hanging. ““They have been strangled, like cats,”’ Khadaf said afterward. KHADAFY HAS dismissed the plot as a misguided attempt b youthful Moslem fanatics educat- ed in the United States and Britain. But diplomats in Libya say Khada- fy is convinced that high-ranking Libyans in the military were involved. Since he came to power in 1969, Khadafy has survived at least six coup or assassination attempts, al- most all involving dissident ele- ments in the military or the paramilitary militias.

        "ocr_text": "Catholics seeking 4 missionaries kidnapped by guerrillas in Sudan By Joseph Albright Cox News Service KHARTOUM, Sudan — Roman Catholic officials have dispatched a runner through swampy guerrilla- controlled back country to seek information on four kidnapped mis- sionaries, including an American and a Briton, who were abducted several days ago by anti-government rebels. “We are waiting desperately for information,” said one Catholic cleric in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, about 500 miles north of the kidnap site. Another Catholic source speculated that the mission- aries may be released shortly, as soon as the guerrillas can elude Sudanese army defenders and leave the missionaries in some nearby set- tled area. Catholic sources disclosed, mean- while, that one of the missionaries, the Rev. Peter Curtin Major, 45, of Syracuse, N.Y., had disregarded strong warnings from the nearest Sudanese Catholic bishop that he should abandon the remote mud hut settlement for his own safety. “He didn’t think an would bappe . said the . Daniel Adwok. “John felt that when you Open your life to these people, it would be a betrayal to leave them.” Adwok said he personally sent two written messages on a Sudanese army helicopter to Major in July ‘and August saying he had arranged for Major to leave aboard the heli- copter on its return trip. The heli- copter was carrying the payroll to the small Sudanese army garrison in Bentiu, the river town of 10,000 in- habitants in which Major was a mis- sionary of the Catholic Mill Hill order. “John didn’t come out,” said Adwok, then the second-ranking Catholic official in the Diocese of Malakal, which included Bentiu, 125 miles away. “There wasn’t any explanation.” Adwok, interviewed in Khartoum, where he is awaiting transfer to an assignment at the Vatican, said that before he left Malakal in mid-Au- gust, his superior, Bishop Vincent Mojwok, several times ‘‘made it very clear” to Major that he should leave Bentiu to avoid getting caught in a crossfire between the army and guerrilla forces. Over the last year, southern Sudan has been the scene of continuing bloody clashes between black, pre- dominantly Christian guerrillas and the army of U.S.-backed Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiry, who is trying to turn Sudan into an Islamic state over widespread objections from the 40 percent non-Islamic minority. Intelligence reports say that in the latest outbreak of violence, heavily armed guerrillas overran the government-held town of Bentiu — site of a now abandoned Chevron oil drilling camp — during the first week of September. Reports say the guerrillas, evidently fearing govern- ment air strikes if they stayed in Bentiu, fled quickly into the bush with a star-studded cast of hostages, including the two leading town administrators, the deputy town po- lice commissioner and the four mis- sionaries. It is not clear whether the raid occurred on Sept. 4 or Sept. 8. On Sept. 11, someone at a mission- ary outpost about 80 miles away sent word to Khartoum through a shortwave radio message to the Sudanese Council of Churches. The radio message said the miss- ing churchmen were Major; the Rev. John Ashworth, a Catholic mission- ary from’ Britain; the Rev. Zachariah Chatin, a Catholic mis- sionary who grew up in southern Sudan; and Pastor John Kong, a Sudanese-born Presbyterian thought to have been educated in the United States. The Khartoum churchmen radioed back and asked permission to send a runner to talk to the guerrillas. There was no word of the runner’s progress by late Saturday. ' Major has been working to make Catholic converts among the Dinka and Nuer tribesmen in southern Sudan since his transfer from Malaysia in 1982, according to his friends here. | Major was among 11 missionaries operating the small church, school and infirmary in Bentiu. Trouble in Bentiu started 11 months ago when 40 armed rebels killed one Chevron bulldozer opera- tor and captured two others from a Chevron seismic exploration crew. The rebels released the two Chev- ron employees two days later after a “trial” in the hut where they were being hidden. Atlanta Constitution - September 16, 1984 \f"

Nimeiry, a general who effec- tively controls the Sudanese army, said voices overheard on guerril radios and information from Suda- nese tribesmen traveling back and forth across the Ethiopian border have persuaded him that a few Cu- bans as well as Ethiopian advisers have entered his country along with contingents of southern Su- danese guerrillas. He said Cuban advisers have probably been operating along the Sobat River in southeastern Sudan and may have been present when a guerrilla unit blasted a riverboat on the Sobat in August, killing 274 government troops with guns and rocket-propelled grenades, accord- ing to guerrilla claims.

Cutting off hands and feet is justi- fiable because “it has _ been prescribed by God in the Koran,” said Fouad el] Amin, the Cornell University-trained chief judge of Khartoum Emergency Court 2. “God has created human beings, and he knows better than anyone else that the only thing that can limit the some of theft is to cut off one’s hand.” A compilation on Cox News- papers reporter’ w was allowed to Sudan eight days ago shows that 42 convicted thieves have had limbs amputated during Nimeiri’s five- month state of emergency, which will continue for at least another month. Only two other amputations have been performed since Nimeiri intro- duced the 7th-century Sharia A which is based on Allah’s revelations to the prophet Mohammed, as Sudan’s fundamental code of punish- ments on Sept. 8, 1983. This brings the total of announced amputations to 44. About 25 others have been sentenced to amputations and are awaiting appeals or petitions for mercy. Fadlullah acknowledged in court prosecution case, but he had to con- duct the cross-examination himself. His lawyer could suggest a general line of questions but was not allowed to conduct cross-examina- tions because it was an emergency court. The lawyer, Abdel Rahim Eissa, sat in silence as Fuad and the two other judges — a Sudanese air force brigadier general and a Khartoum police commander — took turns ask- ing questions of the prosecution wit- nesses and then the defendant. Eissa did not make a final statement, as the judge asked the defendant to summarize his case. Under emer court rules, are not allowed to enter objections, according to one attorney in the courtroom. Eissa was clearly chafing to jump into the cross-examination, but he was not free to do so under the emergency court rules. “I can shoot some questions at him and get —— his lies,” he remarked dur. ing a short break. that he had failed to turn over $12,- 000 worth of personal belongings en- trusted to him by a fellow Sudanese worker while they were both work- ing in Saudi Arabia in 1982. After rejecting his contention that all his witnesses were in Saudi Ara- bia, the judges deliberated for 15 minutes. Then they unanimously sent him to prison for three aiaethe wi him he would stay in jail for ten years if he doesn’t repay the money. Fadlullah, a_ crinkled receipt trembling in his hands, ap peared re- lieved when Fuad told him he would not face an Islamic sentence since the case began before introduction of Sharia law. Eissa, the lawyer, said there would be no appeal because the decisive justice court of appeals might increase the punishment. The defendant's relief was under- standable to anyone who reads the account by the Suna news agency of In this polyglot nation where Mos- lems and non-Moslems can be identi- fied by their names, a review of am- utation announcements by the udan news agency over the last year indicates that 38 or 39 of the _ 44 amputees were nominally Mos- lems. At least five of the 44 had names ble as belonging to Chris- -tians or spirit worshipers from tribes of non-Arabic, non-Moslem blacks from the southern provinces. The five were convicted by Islamic courts here for thefts in Khartoum province, a predominantly Moslem area of about 3 million people. Twelve of the 44 had both their left feet and right hands amputated, according to the news agency files. These “cross limb” amputations, as they are described in Sudan news agency dispatches, are imposed by judges on criminals who have been found guilty of what the Sharia code calls “haraba,” or big theft. Islamic courts here have interpreted “hara- bas” as mea armed robbery or robbery by gangs of thieves. In addition to their amputations, most of the amputees also:were sen- tenced to receive between 25 and 100 lashes, which normally were administered by a policeman in one of Sudan’s new “decisive justice courts” within minutes after the three-judge emergency trial panels the first public amputation at the Kober Prison in North Khartoum on passed sentence. On one point there is broad agree- ment. Everyone from Western diplo- mats to Sudanese taxi drivers to Sudanese defense lawyers to Nimeiri himself says Khartoum has experi- enced a dramatic drop in the crime rate over the last year. The drop followed a four-year rise in crimes vttributed by police to liq- uor, which was banned last Septem- ber by Nimeiri, and to the continuing influx of poor desert dwellers and refugees from Ethio- pian and Chadian droughts. On May 1, in one of his first steps under the emergency, Nim created a network of emergency courts, later renamed decisive jus- tice courts. Each of the dozen courts in the capital region are staffed by a professional judge, a police officer and a military officer. They decide by majority vote, and if there are disagreements, the case is sent to an emergency court of appeals.

        "ocr_text": "$12 billion oil pipeline only awaits funding By Joseph Albright Cox News Service KHARTOUM, Sudan — Promoters of a controversial oil pipeline say they hope to begin construction in three years and to begin transport- ing up to four million barrels a day of Middle East oil across Africa for customers in the United States and Europe in 1990. “The project is a godsend for Sudan, and I think it is important for the world,” said former Suda- nese finance minister Bashir Ishag, who has been retained by the Trans- Africa Pipeline Co. as its represen: tative in Sudan. But whether the $12 billion pipe- line ever gets off the drawing board depends on whether Greek financier Basil A. Tsakos, the company presi- dent, can get financing for the project. Ishag said all necessary right-of- way agreements for the 2,200-mile pipeline were signed as of two months ago. The next step, he said, will be to commission a detailed economic and engineering study that can be used in presentations by Tsakos to potential financial partici- pants. Before laying pipes, Ishag said the company must also reach agree- ments guaranteeing the use of the pipeline by the Western oil compa- nies and by Middle East oil produc- ing states, including Saudi Arabia. The pipeline, as now envisioned, would transport the equivalent of one-third of American oil imports. Once the oil reached an Atlantic Coast port in Cameroon, it would be shipped to the United States and Eu- rope in supertankers of the same sort that now transport Middle East oil through the Persian Gulf and down around South Africa. Ishag said Sudan stands to earn at least $60 million a year in royalties if the pi carries its proposed load of 4 million barrels a day. At least 5,000 Sudanese workers will be needed in the construction phase, he said, and others will be needed in- definitely to operate pumping sta- tions. Under present company timeta- bles, construction is supposed to begin in about 1987 and finish in 1990, he said. The twin 36-inch diameter pipeline would run 2,200 miles through Sudan, the Central African Republic and Cameroon, crossing mountain passes, desert and jungle. Sudan, which is receiving $250 million this year in economic and military aid, is the second largest US. aid recipient in Africa, after BYPt. ween ae DAVE WINK/Staft Ishag, the local pipeline represen- tative, said the company first asked permission for a right of way across Sudan from the Sudanese Ministry of Energy and Mining in September signed 1983. Discussions were still under way in the energy ministry in December, when Sudanese President Gaafar Ni- meiry flew to Washington for meet- ings with U.S. officials and a medi- cal checkup at Walter Reed Army Hospital. “They (ministry officials) were very cooperative, but this is not a run-of-the-mill project,” Ishag said. The right-of-way agreement was finally signed on July 18, 10 months after discussions began, by Sudanese Energy and Mining Minister Sharif Al-Tuhami. Tsakos flew to Khar- toum to take part in the signing ceremony, according to Ishag. Pr AFRICA REPUBLIC AFRICA agreement was a critical step in getting the project under way since the Central African Republic and Cameroon had already right-of-way agreements. Ishag said that in addition to Middle East oil toward the Atlantic, the pipeline also would deliver oil to remote parts of Sudan that now suffer chronic gasoline shortages, “We would love to be able to open the tap and get oil in Darfur,” said Ishag, referring to a western Suda- nese province whose farmers have been devastated by drought and un- able to afford fuel to run water wells. The pipeline could serve as an outlet for exporting any oil the Chevron Oil Co. finds at its drilling site at El Muglad in southwestern Sudan, Ishag said.

The four men were freed last Thursday and flown the next day to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, where they are now reported rest- ing at a Catholic boys’ school. ‘They are safe and in good spirits,” said the Rev. Tony Agreiter, secretary general of the St. Joseph’s Missionary Society of Mill Hill. “No ransom was paid.” Agreiter, reached at the London headquar- ters of the 800-member Catholic missionary order, said Mill Hill missionaries will “most definitely” continue to work in Sudan despite recurrent armed clashes near their missions between government troops and guerrilla bands He said the two freed Mill Hill missionaries — the Rev. Peter Curtin Major, 45, of Syracuse, and the Rev. John Ashworth of Great Britain — have been instructed by members of the Catho- lic hierarchy in Sudan to fly home to visit their families. However, Agreiter expressed doubt that Ma- jor would agree to leave Sudan, where he has worked since 1982. Soon after his capture, Cath- olic sources revealed that Major had disregard- ed strong admonitions from a Sudanese Catho- lie bishop to abandon the remote mud-hut 6g kare gg ee as \"Rasen to ‘ Syracuse, s brother Charles, a law- yer, said this account squared with his under- Palm Beach Post - October 24, 1984 standing of the events in Sudan. He added that his brother’s refusal to leave Sudan was due to “a fear that once he gets out of the country he could have a hard time getting back in.” Charles Major said his brother, who had pre- viously served for 10 years in Borneo, took intensive Arabic language training in Beirut before he went to Sudan two years ago.

The statement by Judge llario Martella came as he formally announced that three Bulgarians and five Turks would be tried on charges of complicity in the attempt to kil the pope May 13, 1981, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union quichly res sponded by denouncing the indictment as part of a political conspiracy om Comn- munist nations, Based on interrogations of Agca, vt serving a life sentence, Martella sald he be lieved the second gunman was Agca's — Oral Celik, 25, a fellow Turk. Celik i at large. MARTELLA SAID his charges were hased partly on a film that shows two gun men in St. Peter's Square, He also sald that testimony by witnesses and a reconstruction of the paths of various bullets support the theory of two gunmen, Martella said that Cellk’s bullet was tl recovered after it ripped into the pope's In- dex finger and left shoulder. An Italian report in June said Ce- lik probably escaped from Italy by riding inside a Bulgarian diploma- tic truck. In the next step in the proceed- ings, an Italian tribunal of two judges and six Italian civilian ju- rors will be summoned next year to weigh evidence. AFTER A TRIAL that is likely to gain wide attention for months, the votes of five of the eight tribu- nal members will be sufficient to find a defendant guilty — and thus render an official finding on the truth or falsity of the so-called Bul- garian connection. The theory that Bulgaria was in- volved in the plot rests on the sup- position that the Soviets wanted to get rid of the Polish-born pontiff because he was seen as a symbol of the political ing Poland at the time, Of the three Bulgarians indicted Friday, only Sergei Antonov, the former head of the Bulgarian air- lines office in Rome, is in Italian custody. The other two, Todor Ai- vasov and Maj. Zhelyo Vasilev, both former Bulgarian Embassy officials, are in Bulgaria. TWO OF THE Turks indicted, Omer Bagci and Musa Serdar Ce- libi, are in Italian custody. Bekir Celenk, another Turk who was in- dicted, is in Bulgaria, Agca will stand trial again, this time on charges of complicity in {l- in legally importing the weapon used rest that was shak- to shoot the pope. The indictment formally dropped charges that Agca and some of the other accused conspir- ators plotted to assassinate Lech Walesa, the Polish Solidarity union leader, when he visited Rome to see the pope in January 1981. According to Magistrate Antonio Albano, Agca had confessed to the second plot, but retracted the testi- mony, Albano said there was not sufficient evidence to proceed with the charge. Giuseppe Consolo, the defense attorney for Antonov, predicted Friday that his client would be freed. “My conviction is the same as before. I'm sure that he is inno- cent,” Consolo said. AS HE HAS in the past, Consolo questioned Agca’s credibility and said: “All the file is based on Acga’s testimony. There’s nothing changed on that point.” He sought to play down the im- portance of Martella’s decision to name Celik as a second gunman, saying it was based only on “an in- terpretation of old documents.” After the pope was shot, there was confusion over the number of shots fired. Despite statements from witnesses that they heard three shots, a third bullet was nev- er found, Celik was identified from a pho- tograph taken by an American man with his back to the camera running out of St. Peter’s Square after the shooting. Acga changed his testimony on the identity of the man, eventually identifying him as Celik. NEWTON TOLD. investigators the man he photographed was car- rying a gun.

Investigating Italian magistrate Tlario Martella has alleged that the second gunman is a. long-missing Turkish terrorist, Oral Celik, 22, a man whom Agca has called a friend ‘| who was “closer than a brother.” A comparison of newly disclosed investigative findings with what came out in Agca’s original 1981 trial suggests that the second gun- | man hypothesis is plausible in some | res pects, Mainly, the new theory offers a way out of a lingering mystery over many wounds to the pope and two American tourists with only the two bullets police say he fired. Yet the new hypothesis is also sus- ceptible to fresh doubts which may be difficult to resolve even when a “papal conspiracy” case comes to trial in Italy next year against three a and four Turks, including As the case unfolds, these are among the questions authorities must address if their two-gunman theory is to survive as something more than just another conspiracy tale: @ Is it conceivable that a second gunman could have fired in the mid- dle of a jam of pilgrims at an out: door papal audience without anyone seeing or grabbing him? Aga, the first gunman, was bumped, knocked down and handcuffed seconds after he began shooting on May 13, 1981, Why wasn’t the second gunman? Bi If there was a second gunman, was he Celik or someone else? New: - ton and a fellow American tourist have given Italian authorities sworn depositions that the gun-toting run- ner they saw looked a lot like a nightclub photograph of a man be- lieved to be Celik. However, Newton says he cannot be more than “90 to 95 percent sure,” Even if there was a second gunman, no proof that he actually pulled a trigger has come to light. @ Did Celik have a line of fire that would have allowed a single left forefinger and then his right arm — the trajectory Martella has described? Judging from Agca’s ac- count, it appears Celik must have been facing the pope from the rear — not from the front or the left side — just before the shooting. Newton, news editor of WXYZ-TV in Detroit, says he was standing on a stone platform surrounding a 16th century fountain in St. Peter's Square when he heard three shots — crack, crack, crack. The pope was 100 yards away, standing in the rear of a small jeep- like vehicle that has been called the “Popemobile,” The pontiff was fac- ing a crowd of pilgrims who reached out to touch him from the right side of the slowly moving vehicle, After hearing the shots, Newton said he saw the pope slump down into the seat of the jeep. Newton remembers jumping off the fountain platform and starting to run toward the shots, carrying his camera, After 10 or 15 feet, Newton says he froze. That is when he saw the man he thinks was Celik bearing down on him, gun in hand. “My eyes were focused on him and I kept looking at that gun and I saw him all the time until he passed me,” said Newton. He said the man, who within four feet of him, had a shock of longish dark hair and was wearing a shiny black jacket, See POPE 50A ® United Press international how Agea could have caused so bullet from his gun to hit the pope’s Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 4, 1984 \fPope FROM 45A possibly leather or vinyl, and skin- tight khaki pants, At first the man was running southeast, from the crowd, toward NeWton.

Agca says he was on the right side of St. Peter's Square facing the basilica and leaning against a police barricade, Celik was off to his left in the crowd, according to Agea’s version. The two had stationed themselves so that the pope would pass “in a position between me and Celik” as the jeep made its pass through an aisle of wooden barricades through the pilgrims, Agea said. As the jeep made its second cir- cuit through the crowd, Agca says he gave Celik a final go-ahead sig- nal; he raised a camera and pre- tended to snap a photograph, He said he then looked at Celik, who nodded back in apparent acknowl- egement, Then, Agca says, he “rapidly” unfastened the camera, threw it to the ground, and pulled his pistol from the left side of his belt. Their plan, according to Agca’s latest confession, was that “‘in case I found it impossible to fire five shots, Celik was to shoot.” Agea says he fired “two or three shots against the person of the pope” before he was restrained by the crowd, Agca told Martella he never ne Celik fire, but he assumes that he did. | More than one angle? When the case comes to trial, Martella’s ballistics experts will at- tempt to reconstruct the trajectories of the bullets, Martella, in a press conference and a subsequent interview, con- tended that his ballistics evidence and photographs strongly suggest that the pope was shot from more than one angle. Part of the new evidence will con- sist of films that, according to Mar- tella, will demonstrate Agca fired only twice. And part will be a scien- tific analysis of the pope’s various wounds, This will be designed to demonstrate that at least three bul- lets must have been fired to cause all the injuries to the pope and to two American tourists who were hit while standing on chairs, During Agca’s three-day trial in a Rome court in July 1981, not a sin- gle ballistics expert was called, ac: cording to Pietro D’Ovidio, who was - Agea’s court-appointed —_ lawyer. ‘Agea, who testified then that he was the lone gunman, was sentenced to prison for life.

Court documents show that Judge Ilario Martella told Agca 11 months ago that if he sticks to the truth and corrects his past misstate- ments, “such conduct could be, at the opportune time, evaluated positively” toward his obtaining an Italian presidential pardon. Martella made the remark Jan. 27 while interrogating Agca in a closed judicial proceeding carried penalties of up to 20 years in prison. Such an extra sentence would not “change your present status as a person condemned to life imprison- ment,” the judge said. “But having made yourself re- sponsible for such an_ infamous crime as that of calumny, it would be exceedingly difficult for any seat of government to acknowledge your right of asking and especially of ob- taining the good offices which might allow you to reacquire your liberty, benefits which in some manner you might appear to merit.” Agca, replying under oath, said he was “perfectly aware” that false ac- cusations would preclude “any possi- bility” of a presidential pardon. At the time, Agca already was facing a calumny charge filed by Martella in 1983. It grew out of his claim, later retracted, that he and four Bulgarians conspired to kill comparable to an American grand jury session. The official transcript became public last week as part of a voluminous criminal indictment that Martella filed against three Bulgarians and ‘four Turks accused of plotting with Agca to kill ee Paul II in St. Peter’s Square May 13, It was the first indication that any Italian Official has talked to Agca about the bility that he might eventually be pardoned if his testi- mony stands up in next year's “Bulgarian connec- tion” trial here. Reached by telephone, Martella said Agca is not in a position to make a request for executive clemency until after next year’s trial, “and after a decision on whether Agca is telling the truth.” Asked to assess the likelihood of Agca even- tually going free, Martella replied, “I have no thoughts about it, nor could I say,” See AGCA, Page 20-A Polish labor leader Lech Walesa four months before the pope was shot. Last month, Martella declared there was “insufficient proof” to prosecute Agca for calumny in the case. At the same time, he dismissed charges in the Walesa case against the four Bulgarians. Agca, now 26, faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in an Italian prison unless he can convince President Sandro Pertini or a successor to shorten his term through a pardon. The Italian penal code says a life sentence means staying in prison “in perpetuity,” and there is no parole provision. In part of his analysis of evidence in the case, Martella said Agca’s de- sire for freedom was a strong moti- vating factor in making him talk. Atlanta Constitution - November 9, 1984 \f"

But when Italian investigating magistrate Ilario Martella studied the document, he saw what looked like smudgy hints of a cover-up. -. Someone apparently had erased a . “6” in the date — a digit that stood for. June. In its place, someone had _ inserted a7” — meaning July. ’ The “anomoly” was visible to the naked eye, Martella reported two months ago in his voluminous indictment that accuses three Bul- garians and four Turks of attempt- ing with Agca to kill Pope John Paul II on May 13, 1981. This was a critical erasure. For now the alleged Turkish middle- man, Bekir Celenk, had been fur- nished a legitimate reason for lolling around the capital city of Sofia in the month when Agca arrived in Bulgaria. The reason: Celenk was there to buy a ship. The seemingly doctored note is a crucial item in the Italian prosecu- tion dossier. By traditional European and American standards of evidence, Italy has a thin case against the Bulgarian defendants: Sergei_ I. Antonov, a former Bulgarian airline official now under house arrest in iRome, and Todor Aivazov and : Zhelio Vassilev, two former diplo- mats at the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome who are now in Bulgaria. Agca, the sole accuser, has turned out to be a presto-chango witness. ever saw Agca with any Bulgarian. But what Martella has come upon is an intriguing pattern of attempts by Bulgaria to feed him false information. For the most part, these apparently false tidbits were strewn in his path in July 1983, when he accepted a Bulgarian government invitation to fly to Sofia to complete his investigation. When a Rome criminal court hears the Bulgarian Connection case — probably late next year — prosecutors will be trying to forge a chain of logic that harkens back to the American Watergate hearings of the early 1970s. _.A vital prosecution question will inevitably be: If the Bulgarians had nothing to hide, why then did they concoct a cover story? Martella’s investigative records —- the result of his three-year probe and containing Agca’s final version of the story — are on file in a Rome court as part of the indictment. They zoom in on the three critical months in the alleged Bulgarian Connection: July and August 1980 and May 1981. JULY 1980: Agca’s Tale _Agea, fleeing a Turkish death sentence for murdering an Istanbul newspaperman, entered Bulgaria from Turkey early in July. He was traveling on a false Indian passport, calling himself Joginder Singh. After arriving in Sofia, Agca looked up a contact furnished to him earlier by a leader of Turkish organized crime, Abuzer Ugurlu. Agcea found the contact, Omer Mersan, at Sofia’s finest hostelry, the Vitosha. Mersan found Agca a room at the same hotel... After checking by phone with Ugurlu in Istanbul, Mersan also gave Agca 3,000 to $4,000 in spending money. Agca claims he was introduced to Celenk by Mersan at the Vitosha. Agea says he spoke twice in July with Celenk: once about July 10 at the Vitosha and once about July 15 ata restaurant. ‘Agca says that at their second meeting, Celenk ‘tasked me whether I would be available for terrorist actions in Europe,” among which could be an attack on the pope. ~ Agca — who had made headlines in Turkey eight months earlier by threatening to kill the pope in a letter to a Turkish newspaper — made clear he was interested. Celenk told him he would shortly meet a member of the Bulgarian Secret Service “‘to study the possi- bility of an attempt on the life of the pope of which I would be the executioner.” How much checks out? @ Mersan, a Turkish export-im- port dealer and _ reputed arms smuggler who still lives in West Germany, has acknowledged to Martella that he did meet Agca in Bulgaria in July 1980. @ Mersan also has admitted that he gave Agca some money on Ugurlu’s say-so. And Mersan ac- knowledged that he has known Celenk since 1979. ,  @The encounter with Mersan could have been in early July, Agca says. Stamps in Mersan’s Turkish Passport show that he arrived in ‘Bulgaria on July 4, 1980, and stayed at the Vitosha until July 5. Arizona Republic - December 9, 1984 (Shortened version in Atlanta) \fPope © Celenk insists he has never seen Agca in his life. But there is evidence stamped in Celenk’s pass- port that he was in Sofia from July 11 through July 15 — just when Agca claims he saw him. After that, Celenk’s passport indicates, he left Bulgaria for two weeks, returning for a few days at the end of the month. j @ Because Agca has destroyed the Singh passport, there is no way of proving exactly when he entered Bulgaria or where he stayed. Bul- garian authorities claim he did not show up until after July 23 — which would have made the alleged mid-July meeting with Celenk im- possible. @ Mersan returned to Sofia on July 22, his passport shows. If this is when he met Agca, Agca’s story doesn’t ring true. For Celenk no longer would have been in Bulgaria to be introduced to Agca. Martella’s indictment names Ce- lenk among those who allegedly plotted to kill the pope. Mersan has been cleared in the case. Has Bulgaria tried to hide any- thing? The one clear-cut instance was the seemingly altered memo. The document purported to be a copy of a page from Bulgarian maritime executive Georgi Petrov’s desk note pad. On it were notes summarizing a full day of negotia- tions between Petrov and Celenk about a Bulgarian freighter, the Chadzi Dimitar, which Celenk was trying to buy from the Bulgarian government. Bulgarian judicial authorities not only gave Martella the photocopy but produced Petrov for question- ing when Martella was in Sofia last © year. Yes, Petrov swore, he was certain he saw Celenk on both the morning and the afternoon of July 14, 1980. And again on July 28 to conclude the sale. As far as is known, Martella did not ask Petrov’s explanation of why the “6” was changed to a “7.” AUGUST 1980: Agca’s Tale Celenk introduced him about Aug. 5 to a Bulgarian secret agent who called himself Sotir Kolev. ‘Agca later would identify him from ’a photograph as Todor Aivazov, then the cashier at Bulgaria’s embassy in Rome. Agca says he, Celenk and Aivazov ‘met three times in August, always ‘at the Vitosha. At the meetings, Agca claims, the three of them evaluated “the possibility of using the Gray Wolves (a loosely affili- ated gang of Turkish neo-Nazi toughs, among them Agca) in a of Soviet area countries including Bulgaria.” By the third meeting with Aiva- zov — around Aug. 20 — all plans had been “finalized” to kill the terrorist campaign to the advantage as- he, Celik and other members of a-Gray Wolves hit team were to s 3 million German marks — roughly $1.25 million — a reward Celenk would transmit to them frgm the coffers of the Bulgarian Sgret Service. ’ “Ten days later, it was time for to leave Bulgaria. But first he to shed his Singh passport, which presumably contained stamps evidencing exactly where he stayed in Bulgaria. the night of Aug. 30, Agca sare, he slipped across the border to rkey and picked up a new fake Tiirkish passport from Celik, who was waiting near the frontier. “After re-entering Bulgaria a few mimutes later, Agca says, he stayed in«the country less than a day. He left through Yugoslavia on Aug. 31. H@w Much Checks Out? =@ Aivazov, the alleged Bulgarian agent from Rome, turns out to have been in Bulgaria in August. He was os there, he says, from y 21 to Aug. 29, and his passport canfirms his presence. Z@ But there is not a wisp of eVidence, other than Agca’s word, that he ever saw Agca. Aivazov swears he did not know Agca, Celik or Celenk. -«® Celenk’s passport shows he was in“ Sofia only through the night of 1. During the coldblooded Aiigust meetings described by Agca, Celenk’s passport indicates he was im Turkey. If he came back to Bulgaria under another name, Mar- tella could not prove it.

YY 1981:Agca’s Tale “On May 9 — after a well-fi- nanced nine-month odyssey through Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Tunisia — Agca turned up in Italy at the Milan railroad station. 2A Turkish friend, Omer Bagci, was waiting with a package. In it was the Browning 9mm automatic t would make Agca infamous. n May 10, Agca claims, he met Kbazov and Celik in Rome at a coffee bar. From then on until the ape was shot on May 13, Agca insists he met 10 times in central Réme with one or more of the Bulgarian defendants. It was during one of those meetings, Agca says, that Aivazov told him the secret plan for his eScape from Italy. He and Celik would be driven out of the country inside a sealed Bulgarian diplo- matic truck called a TIR. “Agca says that on the afternoon of May 13, Aivazov and Antonov, the former Bulgarian airline offi- as a Turk Antonov was to wait in a Alfa 2000 getaway car, which was to drive them to the waiting TIR. How much checks out? @ The pope was shot at 5:25 p.m.' After ca fired twice, he was jarred by a Franciscan nun, knocked to the cobblestones by the’ crowd and handcuffed by a police- man. Another policeman found his Browning on the ground. @ Bagci has confessed delivering' the Browning to Agca in Milan. @ No Walther or blue Alfa 2000, was found. Nor could Italian inves- ' tigators find any proof Celik was ever in e. @ There is only one corroborating detail involving the Bulgarians: A, sealed TIR truck did drive away’ from the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome bound for Bulgaria about 6:30 p.m., roughly an hour after the. shooting. It seems this is either an astonishing coincidence or an indi-. cation Agca really had some sort of dealings with the Bulgarians. @ Bulgarian diplomatic trucks travel every few months from Rome to Sofia. But the arrangements for this trip turn out to have been atypical. Italian investigators found this was the one instance in two years when the embassy had asked Rome customs authorities to gi the truck a special pre-clearance on the embassy grounds, rather than having its contents checked at the «Yugoslavian frontier. Did the Bulgarians try to hide anything? Martella found puzzling inconsis-. tencies in the alibi provided by Antonov and his Bulgarian co- workers at the Balkan Air airline office in Rome. On Nov. 29, 1982 — four days after Antonov’s arrest — co-worker Svetlana Blagoeva Biagioni told Italian police she and Antonov were alone in the office all afternoon on the day the pope was shot. But two days later, Antonov named four co-workers who he said were with him. Later, all four, including Biagioni, testified they were together in Antonov’'s pres- ence on the critical afternoon. Their story was that they learned of the shooting when the mother of one Balkan Air employee telephoned to say she had seen a TV news bulletin that included footage showing the pope waving to pilgrims. ut Martella checked and dis- covered it was a full 90 minutes before any station carried ‘T'V ‘footage showing the pope waving. Earlier news accounts were simply bulletins read by announcers. The most abrupt alibi switch involved Antonov’s wife. Five days after his arrest, Anto- nov told interrogators that after the shooting, he went home to his apartment and watched television news on the shooting with his wife, Rossitza. In follow-up interroga- tions Dec. 17, 1982, and Jan. 8, 1983, Antonov repeated he was certain he watched the news that night with his wife. Two months later, Antonov told ‘Martella that Rossitza actually had driven to Bulgaria five days before the pope was shot. Arizona Republic - December 9, 1984 (Continued) \f"
