        "ocr_text": "Atomic probe stymied Nations won't bare data needed to trace plutonium ‘Nuclear fingerprints’: Technology exists to pinpoint the source of smuggled weapons material. { { (By Joseph Albright [starr CORRESPONDENT i ' oscow — A worldwide investigation aimed at tracing the bomb-grade plutonium ; found concealed in suitcases of passengers ‘from Russia has been blocked for seven months ‘because the Big Five atomic powers remain re- luctant to pool the “nuclear fingerprints” of their weapons factories. “We stand for setting up such a data bank,” said Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy spokes- man Georgi Kaurov on Wednesday. “But not on a unilateral basis. In other words, Russia will not give its data without having re- ceived full data from America, France, England, and China.” A Western diplomat, addressing American journalists at a background briefing, agreed that technology exists to pinpoint the history of when and where a sample of seized plutonium was man- ufactured. But he said the U.S. Atomic Energy Act pro- hibits the United States from transferring sam- ples of bomb-grade plutonium and uranium even to an international inspection agency. The other nuclear weapons states have similar laws, he said. “You might say this is counterproductive,” said the Western diplomat. “We are in negotia- tions to work out these sorts of problems. But you can’t fix this overnight.” “In the four years since nuclear materials be- gan seeping out of the former Soviet Union, there hasn’t been a single instance when material seized outside Russia has been successfully traced back to a laboratory here. A chief reason, the Russian and American ex- perts said Wednesday, is that none of the five ac- knowledged nuclear weapons states has submit- ted the necessary comparison samples — known as “fingerprints” — of the plutonium and bomb- grade uranium their countries manufacture. ~ As a result, investigators of the International Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 2, 1995 Atomic Energy Agency have no basis for telling whether a chunk of stolen plutonium was made, for example, in the K-reactor at America’s Savan- nah River Site in 1976 or the Russian secret city Tomsk-7 in 1992. Every gram of the man-made element plutoni- um has its unique “fingerprint.” By measuring the precise ratio of all the isotopes and other con- taminants in the plutonium, technicians can pin down the power level and profile — the identity — of the reactor that created the plutonium. They can also tell when it was made. Though Western intelligence agencies cannot prove it, they remain convinced that some un- identified Russian atomic facility must have been the source of the plutonium seized last Aug. 10 in Munich from two Spaniards and a Colombian ar- riving on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow. Mean- while, the Russians insist the 10 ounces of pluto- nium was of German origin. Of the four European seizures of bomb-grade materials in the last nine months, the Munich case is the most embarrassing to Moscow. Among the passengers on the flight was Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Sidorenko. Ger- man investigators said last August that the arrest- ed smugglers were intending to smuggle out an- other nine pounds of Russian plutonium — enough to make one Nagasaki-sized bomb — for a $250 million payoff. Russian spokesman Kaurov complained Wednesday that Russia cannot pursue its own in- vestigation of the episode because Germany has so far withheld a sample of the smuggled material that could be compared with the “fingerprints” of various Russian atomic factories on file at the Ministry of Atomic Energy. “We have highly qualified specialists here in Russia,” Kaurov said. “If they had given us sam- ples of these materials, we could have made a con- clusion of whether it is our materials or not, and which factory produced it.” Kaurov said Russia officially asked Germany for a sample of the recovered plutonium last fall _ when a worried German Chancellor Helmut Kohl dispatched his national security adviser Bernd Schmidbauer to Moscow for talks on how to tight- en controls on nuclear materials in Russia’s chaos-ridden scientific establishment. \f"

By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers _ MOSCOW — Millions of Rus- sians fixated Thursday on the murder of a popular television journalist, an act that crystallized national outrage not simply on growing crime but broader insta- bility. A somber President Boris Yeltsin promised a new crackdown on mobsters, then vowed to sack Moscow’s police chief and prose- cutor for allowing the crescendo of lawlessness that ended the life of Vladislav “Vlad” Listyev. The 38-year-old talk show host, who combined the gush of Phil Donahue and the probing mind of Larry King, was shot in the head in his apartment’s entry- way late Wednesday. “I bow my head as one of the leaders guilty of failing to ensure proper measures against crime and corruption,” Yeltsin said in a televised speech to Listyev’s co- workers at Ostankino television studios Thursday. It was a measure of the impact of the Listyev killing that Yeltsin felt compelled to assure the nation that he did not intend to suspend the constitution and declare emer- gency rule. “We are afraid of turning Rus- sia into a police state,” he said, while at the same time savaging his Interior Ministry and the Mos- cow police for “turning a blind eye” to organized crime’s penetra- tion of commerce and politics. Business executives, politi- cians and journalists all have been targeted by hit men in the “wild east” atmosphere in Russia after the 1991 collapse of communism and the Soviet empire. Political violence, too, has taken a toll, during the 1993 uprising and in today’s continuing battles in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. During a cathartic 90-minute round-table broadcast on all Rus- sian television channels Thursday night, speaker after speaker — journalists, political figures, citi- zens — wept in sadness and rag- ged anger over the slaying of a friend and the violence clutching their country. “I feel that the laws don’t work, the prosecutor doesn’t work and courts don’t work,” former Soviet President Mikhail Gorba- chev said on the program. But Gorbachev warned that despite continuing turmoil, Rus- sians must not “back out on” democracy. “I do not think we should be in a condition of panic,” he said. Authorities said two gunmen, one a “European-type” who could be a foreigner and the other an “Oriental,” fired one after the oth- er at Listyev using Browning auto- matic pistols. Then they escaped in a dark-colored European car, possibly a BMW. hey left behind $1,500 in THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Vladislav Listyev, one of Russia’s most popular television journal- ists, presided over his Prime Time talk show before he was killed. Western currency in Listyev’s pockets, an enormous sum by Russian standards. That was a particularly ominous detail to many Russians, for it suggested -that the killing was ordered by forces so powerful that their hit men could walk away from an amount equalling several years of the average salary in Russia. “I belteve that in the final analysis it is a political assassina- tion,” said Alexander Yakovlev, chairman of Ostankino Broadcast- ing. One widespread theory was that Listyev’s killing was linked to his plans to restrict commercial advertising on the network. After Yeltsin called for an end to liquor and cigarette ads on television this year, Listyev was instrumental in a decision to ban all advertising temporarily from the powerful network until new advertising guidelines are written. He also was reported to be work- ing on a plan to handle advertising in-house, which would have cut middlemen out of profits from ad- vertising that sells for up to $50,000 a minute.

        "ocr_text": "°30s athlete became atom spy An American now living in Moscow says he helped Stalin get the bomb. By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Paim Beach Post Staff Wnters MOSCOW — From Communist Party archives come remarkable details of how an American athlete at a Mississippi college turned into the Soviet spy who says he helped steal the secret of the atomic bomb. The story begins during the Great Depression when Morris Cohen, a football lineman from James Monroe High School in The Bronx, took an athletic scholarship in 1931 to Mississippi State College. After suffering a career-ending knee injury in Mississippi, Cohen turned to the drama club and newspaper reporting. From the segregated South he went on to set up a “cooperative restaurant for Negro & White students” in Illinois. And then on to the Communist underground. Six decades later, after a lifetime as a Soviet secret agent, Cohen lives in lonely exile in Moscow's fashionable Patriarchy Pond dis- trict, six blocks from the American embassy. At 84, he suffers from heart disease and has become too ill to grant interviews, said Rus- sian Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Yuri Kobaladze. The service credits Cohen and his late wife, Lona Petka Cohen, with pulling off one of the 20th century’s great feats of interna- tional espionage: obtaining the se- cret of the atomic bomb from ‘‘Perseus,”” the cover name for a still-unidentified physicist who worked in the 1940s at the U.S. bomb laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M. The Russians say ‘Perseus” was no less important to Mos- cow’s atomic bomb program than the convicted Los Alamos atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, whose confes- sion that he furnished atomic bomb drawings caused a sensation in the 1950s. Morns Cohen was an athletic tramer at Mississippi State Col- tege m™ the early 1930s. “The information we received from Fuchs and ‘Perseus’ matched page to page,”’ said Col. Vladimir Barkovsky, a former spy chief in Britain and America still working in the agency as a senior consul- tant. “They both gave us the same report — the size, how much it (the bomb) weighed. They gave us the same drawing,” he said. Cohen is evidently playing one last cat-and-mouse game with the American FBI spy hunters he has eluded since the first atomic bomb was invented 50 years ago. Breaking half a century of si- lence about ‘‘Perseus,’’ Cohen was quoted in a Russian newspaper last fall as saying that the physicist he enlisted as a Soviet ‘‘mole’”’ may still be alive in the U1.!ted States. “‘T hope he is having a calm and peaceful life there now,’’ Cohen was quoted in Komsomolskaya Palm Beach Post - March 5, Pravda on Oct. 4. ‘“‘He has done something to be proud of.” Claims about the existence of ‘‘Perseus” emerged only four years ago in a Russian magazine article by a KGB colonel, which was later reported by the New Republic in mid-1991 and by The Washington Post in late 1992. Last fall, in his little-noticed Russian interview, Cohen dis- cussed his role in atomic espio- nage publicly for the first time. Confirmation that the interview was authentic came from the Rus- sian Foreign Intelligence Service, which assumed overseas activities of the KGB following its breakup. Asked about the Cohen inter- view, the U.S. government made its first acknowledgment that a serious inquiry is under way into the KGB story of a second Los Alamos “‘superspy.” “In the case of ‘Perseus,’ the 1 FBI has an open and ongoing cmminal investigation, of the U.S. Department of Ener- \" the head phed in a December letter.

In July 1942, six months after Pearl Harbor, Cohen was drafted into the U.S. Army, assigned as a cook and sent for three years to Alaska and Europe. During the war, his wife Lona posed as a health spa patient and managed at least two daring rendezvous with “Perseus m New Mexico, Cohen said. After the war the Cohens worked underground in New York with Soviet master spy Col. Rudolf Abel.

No accu- sation of Los Alamos spying came out during the London trial, and they have never been charged in the United States. They served eight years of 20-year terms, then were released in a London-Mos- Cow spy swap.

But the NASA people on the ground maintain faith that the U.S. share — $400 million over the next four years alone — won't be wasted. “The whole [Russian] infrastructure is falling apart as far as economics,” said Ken- neth Mitchell, manager of the NASA Space Station Liaison Office in Moscow. “But, his- torically, their military and space programs were their entry into the 20th century. They’re probably trying to ride that into the 21st century.”’ Russia did doggedly negotiate to keep control of Baikonur after the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, finally closing a deal last fall to lease the cosmodrome and Leninsk enclave for $115 million a year for the next 20 years. Bai- konur and the smaller launching site of Ple- setsk in northern Russia still manage to fire off an impressive average of 50 launches a year. But the technology that zoomed the now defunct Soviet Union into the forefront of space exploration — the first Sputnik, the first manned spaceflight, the first manned space station — rides these days more like a biplane buffeted by every gusty prairie wind. Last fall, the cosmonauts aboard Mir, the space station continuously manned since Associated Press A train carries a Soyuz rocket to the launching pad Sunday at Baikonur, the for- mer Soviet cosmodrome that Russia now leases from Kazakhstan.

Electrical power suddenly shut off in the main block, so for several alarming hours the cosmonauts had to ferry 220- pound batteries from other station modules. A month earlier, they ran perilously low on food after the supply rocket was delayed for several months, then almost failed to dock with Mir. When it achieved docking on the third try, the cosmonauts had been drinking water recycled from their breath and sweat. Space program ‘made them somebody’ Cutbacks have sliced through the pro- gram. The number of cosmonauts in training has been reduced by half. The work force at NPO Energia, the space design and produc- tion conglomerate, has dropped from 3,000 to 1,000, and the population of Leninsk has de- clined from nearly 100,000 to at most 60,000 today. The Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is ready to adopt a budget al- lotting the space program 1.3 trillion rubles ($295 million), about half of what was re- quested. Yuri Koptev, director of Russia’s space agency, warned last month that the alloca- tion would keep his manned space program running for only three to four months and that Thagard’s launching could well be the last.

        "ocr_text": "Like one of the family Traditions: A wild western, a unique quarantine, a last-minute break — it$ all part of the country’s history in space, By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Baikonur, Kazakhstan — Norman Tha- gard, the first American cosmonaut, stood be- hind a bacteria-proof shield and vowed to up- hold the traditions that have preceded the launching of every Russian spacecraft. That included even the most embarrassing one — a quick bathroom break near the launch pad. Thagard, 51, and two Russian colleagues were in the midst of last-minute preparations for a launch that will make the Florida physician the first American to lift off in something other than a U.S. spacecraft. Three days later, he is to become the first American to step aboard the Russian space sta- tion Mir. “The fact that the Soyuz rocket has been used for many year's gives me assurance rather than worries me, inasmuch as it has a long history of successful flight,” said Thagard, a veteran of four space shuttle flights. If all goes well, he will remain aboard the Mir for three months, con- ducting research possible only under conditions of weightlessness. Ready to go: American astronaut Norman Thagard (left) and his Russian eoleatiet Via- dimir Dezhurov (center) and Gennady Strekalov, discuss their joint mission Monday. The crew wore lightweight flight suits and stood behind a glass partition designed to pro- tect them from germs. Although cosmonauts spend several days in quarantine before liftoff, the efficacy is called into question on launch day, when they walk out to the spacecraft and — as tradition has it — re- ceive bear hugs and goodbye kisses from cosmo- drome colleagues. After the news conference, also attended by a backup crew that included American Bonnie Dunbar, the cosmonauts went to watch the same movie that Russian crews always watch before launch. “White Sun of the Desert” is akin to a Wild West shoot-’em-up in which a Russian version of John Wayne takes off to the central Asian steppe and saves a harem of young women about to be slaughtered by their pasha.

NASA officials at the Baikonur cosmo- drome acknowledged that plans for the space shuttle Atlantis to pluck Thagard and two Russian cosmonauts from the Mir space sta- tion in June remain shaky. Tommy Holloway, the NASA official overseeing the planned shuttle-Mir hookup, said Atlantis is scheduled to dock with the space station June 12. But he ticked off a long list of structural alterations the Russian cosmonauts must make to Mir before that will be possible, At- lantis would be the first non-Russian space- ship to link with Mir. “Tf the Russian integration takes longer, the date will have to be adjusted,” Holloway Said, refusing to estimate chances that the appointment will be kept, The uncertainty stems from disruptions . Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 15, 1995 in a Russian space program hungry for funds and still shaken by the breakup of the Soviet Union. The problem was complicated by Russian customs officials, who for still-unexplained reasons held up the U.S. equipment needed to reconfigure Mir for docking with the shut- tle. The shipment, which has been released, also contained scientific equipment Thagard will use aboard Mir. The equipment will be carried to Mir aboard a new, unmanned Russian space module called Spketr. It was supposed to have been launched in February but now will not be launched until May 10-11, according to NASA officials. The customs problem ap- parently contributed to the launch delay, That will give the two cosmonauts aboard Mir about a month to undertake extensive re- modeling — involving four separate space walks — to prepare the space station for At- lantis’ arrival. As a result, Thagard’s stay in space may exceed the planned three months, which in itself would set an American record for time in orbit. Even so, the Russians proved Tuesday that they still can stage a perfectly executed, precisely timed launch, The sleek white Soyuz rocket with one blue and one red stripe lifted off its launch pad on the frigid, windblown steppe of Cen- tral Asia at 11:11 a.m. (1:11 a.m. EST), send- ing Thagard and Russian cosmonauts Vladi- mir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov ipto orbit. Thagard, 51, a Florida physician and for- mer fighter pilot, was the first American launched into space by the Russians and Thursday he is due to become the first Amer- ican to set foot on Mir. “Our grandchildren will look at this in history books,” said NASA’s Holloway, pre- dicting that the developing U.S.-Russian pro- gram will “allow us to do bigger and better things in space.” Tuesday’s launch was the first of a series that will keep Russians and Americans work- ing together on the aging Russian space sta- tion through 1997, They will be preparing for and then con- structing in space a new international station that is supposed to be ready for its first occu- pants in 1998, It is expected to be used for more than a decade, and possibly for two, for scientific experimentation and research. One NASA official characterized the pro- gram as a means of testing the will of two for- mer Cold War enemies to cooperate. “If we can’t do this together, I think we're kidding ourselves that we can do anything together,” said Kenneth Mitchell, manager of the NASA Space Station Liaison Office in Moscow. However, the fact that some Russians are less enamored of the joint program was ham- mered home this week when Russia’s Inde- pendent Television Network broadcast a re- port from unnamed sources who claimed that Russia had expelled American astronaut Ken Cameron for espionage. The U.S. Embassy and NASA officials had denied the report was true, \f"

        "ocr_text": "New worries about Yeltsin’s health By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service MOSCOW — Russian President Boris Yeltsin aroused fresh worries about his health Sunday by failing to appear at two major Russian Easter pageants where he had been expected to be seen on TV with the Russian Orthodox church patri- arch, Just after midnight Sunday, Yelt- sin skipped the traditional mid- night mass at the Kremlin’s Epiph- any Cathedral and his place was taken by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin began attending this sol- emn pageant in 1991, while com- munism was close to collapse. He again took part in 1993 and 1994, turning the midnight Easter service at the Kremlin into a quasi-official religious rite. After skipping this year’s mid- night mass, the 64-year-old Yeltsin Santa Rosa (California) Press-Democrat - April 24, 1995 was absent once more Sunday afternoon when Patriarch Alexei II led an emotional outdoor Easter service at the site of Cathedral of Christ the Savior near the Kremlin. Russian Orthodox Easter normally falls later on the calendar than does the Easter celebration in the West. The Kremlin press office, which has been peppered with specula- tion in recent weeks that something new is wrong with Yeltsin, offered no explanation of why the presi- dent stayed away. On Friday, Kremlin press secre- tary Sergei Medvedev did issue a rare statement regarding the presi- dent’s health, maintaining his only problem is high blood pressure. Medvedev said this condition, which has dogged Yeltsin through- out his public life, “is being kept under control with the help of medication.” Rumors of failing health, said the ’ press secretary, “are beginning to be used very actively by political leaders who have begun their election campaigns for the presi- dential chair.” Curiosity about his condition re- vived in recent weeks when he prolonged his spring vacation by a week without explanation and can- celed a train trip across Russia. He also dropped tentative plans for a state visit to Ukraine. The next 10 days promise to be trying for Yeltsin, who will host two lengthy parades and a round of receptions marking the 50th anni- versary of the defeat of Hitler. Summit talks with visiting Presi- dent Clinton are due following the ceremonies, Besides high blood pressure, Yeltsin is known to suffer from back pain and was hospitalized for heart problems in 1987 and 1990. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Russians hail birthday of “Mad Vlad’ By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — Fireworks sprinkled the sky to celebrate the birthday of a leading Russian politician Tuesday, and devotees flocked to bestow on him everything from a hand-carved wooden throne to a Medieval crossbow. It was not a celebration for a I king — or even for President Boris J+ Yeltsin — but an ebullient party honoring the birth of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist Russian the West loves to hate. The fawning crowd eager to ' shake his beefy hand made it easy to believe Zhirinovsky, who turned Zhirlnovsky 49, is the politician listed as the No. 2 choice for president in many national polls. The brass band, resolute bodyguards, Russia’s top pop talent and a spread including roasted pigs and 3-foot-long baked sturgeon looked like the dress rehearsal for a presidential state dinner. Supporters such as Ivan Adamovich Vasilevsky, 50, who came nearly 900 miles from the town of Kuban for the event, openly bemoaned the loss of the Soviet empire and expressed confidence that Zhirin- ovsky is the leader to recoup it all, “I’m Russian by nature, and I'll tell you this perestroika was plotted by Uncle Sam,” he said, referring to the restructuring that brought down the Soviet system. The outrageous words and extremist characters that roll in Zhirinovsky’s wake seem to have cost him some popularity in 16 high-profile months as leader of the State Duma’s largest parliamentary faction. But anything may happen in Russia’s volatile political environment as the months peel off toward parliamentary elections in December, followed by presidential elections in mid-1996. “Mad Vlad,” as Zhirinovsky is labeled in the British tabloids, was dismissed by most Russian media as a buffoon and unwelcome extremist before 1993's parliamentary elections. Yet his inaptly named Liberal Democratic Party drew support than any other party — about a quarter of the popular vote. On Tuesday Prime Minister Victor Chernomyr- din announced the formation of a new centrist political movement aimed at combatting the kind of political extremism Zhirinovsky represents. Yeltsin praised the plan, indicating he will not repeat 1993, when he refused to support any party or faction in parliamentary elections. But political sentiments in Russia are even more sour today than in the last elections. Russians flailing in an unsettled world where rules still aren’t written and crime truly pays don’t much like any of their leaders. Palm Beach Post - April 26, 1995 \f"

But around the next bend, a team of Russians led by raw- boned Alaska oil spill fighters is laying sandbags atop an emer- gency dirt dam. It is part of a race against time to keep an esti- mated 30 million gallons of oil the consistency of heavy mayon- naise from reaching Russia’s northbound river network. ' Two weeks ago, the weather here along the Arctic Circle turned unexpectedly warm. _ The ice pack shattered in riv- ers. And that signaled an early Start to the month of maximum risk that foreign ecologists have been fearing: the time when ris- ing waters could spread a local disaster northward into the Ba- rents Sea and the Arctic Ocean beyond. Most startled by the early spring was a team of American oil spill professionals, who were just getting started on a contract to contain the oil in the spring, then remove it in the summer. “All spills are logistical nightmares, and this one is the grandmother of all logistical nightmares,” said A.E. “Bert” Hartley, 57, of Anchorage. His Alaska-based company, Hartec Management Consultants, has teamed up with an Australian business to take on the lion’s share of a $135 million World Bank project for the Russian it D work. So far, the Pechora, the Kolva and other big Arctic rivers are. not clogged with oil. The great mass of last summer’s oil pipe- line spill is still trapped inland in a low-lying swamp that, when iewed from a helicopter, looks ike a huge black rice paddy. A Visit to the mighty Pechora finds e river cleaner than it was when petroleum deposits were found along its banks six months ago. Over the next 10 days, though, oil could start migrating north toward the Arctic Ocean. Befpre May 7, melting snow is @xpected to make the river rise up to 15 feet. When that happens, watpr will back into this and a alf-dozen other oil-soaked ives, threatening to erode makeshift containment dams. Dams are best line of defense Cleanup manager Bill Still- ings, a veteran of the 1989 Exxon Valdez cleanup, says that a dam across oil-laden Bez-Imyoni (No- Name) Creek, 15 miles to the south, is in danger of collapsing. His team of 35 Americans and 500 Russians is buttressing the center of the dam. If that dam fails, it could re- lease 10 percent of the entire oil spill toward the Arctic river net- work, Stillings says. To head that off, he has won Russian approval for an emergency plan: setting fire to the oil trapped in the Bez- Imyoni to keep as much as possi- ble out of the larger rivers. What doesn’t burn is sup- posed to be trapped downstream on the Bez-Imyoni by having workers use modern high-capac- ity booms and skimmers. The problem is that until now, the Americans have made do with outmoded Russian pumps and with oil containment booms made from logs. The Americans were chosen by Moscow three months ago tions rather than risk a shutdown largely because they promised to’ bring in Western technology to fight the oil spill. But only this weekend is the first planeload of Western-made oil skimmers, pumps and booms due to fly into Usinsk, the biggest oil town in the region. The shortage of pumps is just one sign of how the cleanup has gotten bogged down in the past six months by Russian oil com- panies’ infighting, bureaucratic foulups in Moscow and Ameri- can contract haggling. ‘s Overall, the cleanup is months behind the schedul promised last November by Russ sian oil companies.

' “#Please do something to take us people out of here,’’ the 85- year-dld pleaded to a visitor. A World War II veteran who should be feted next week, she fears instead a repeat of last win- ter’s days of war. The nursing home staff fled.

Block after block of gutted buildings slump to the ground, and there is no wa- ter, gas or electricity. The war in the mountainous region near the Caspian Sea is al- ready a sore point between Rus- sia and the West. An escalation as Clinton and others arrive in Moscow on Tuesday, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, would embarrass Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Not that the killing — which caused Clinton initially to balk at going to Moscow — has stopped.

Reports that as many as 800 Chechen militia already have in- filtrated back into the capital of Grozny, coupled with new as- saults on Russian military posi- tions, show how tenuous Russia’s hold is even over the northern half of Chechnya that Russia claims to control. Many Grozny residents, most of them refugees only recently returned, are planning to flee again the broken remnants of the capital rather than endure new fighting. ; “In my area 120 people disap- peared on May 1 and 2,” said Chechen Police Lt. Magomed Magomadov, 32. “The OMON [special Russian Interior Minis- try troops] said the reasons are because fighters have infiltrated, so they are checking everybody.” Magomadov and other Che- chen police, who only a few weeks ago resumed efforts to bring order to Grozny, believe the threats of a Tuesday assault may be only a ruse by rebel forces to further destabilize Chechnya. . If that is so, it seems to be working, both by sparking a new exodus and provoking the Rus- sian crackdown. “If this doesn’t stop, there will be mass attacks,” said Mago- madov. But he was referring to assaults on Russian soldiers by the civilian population rather than by organized Chechen com- mandos. In Grozny and across the countryside, Chechens bitterly describe the tactics of some Rus- sian troops who they say detain and beat civilians, grab livestock and loot houses. Civilians say the soldiers committing the worst harass- ment often are drunk. On the streets of Grozny groups of sol- diers in uniform, sucking bottles of beer, are a common sight. One of the most destructive new tactics, in Grozny and in vil- lages, is the use of nighttime flares to illuminate areas where soldiers believe the Chechen en- emy may be hiding. Flare cas- ings, weighing nearly 50 pounds each, crash through houses when they separate from the flares. The flares themselves burn homes or schools after they float to the ground on parachutes. Grozny police said eight houses in a single district have been burned by flares in a week. In the village of Alkhozorovo, Marika Kaderova, 38, placidly cooked lunch in her kitchen this week and gazed at the verdant spring countryside through a jagged hole in the wall. : Last week her family of sev- en, including a grandmother and four daughters, was awakened in the night by a flare casing rip- ping through the house. ‘‘We just ran,” she said. ‘“‘The girls were screaming. We fled to the basement.” In the capital and throughout Chechnya, people express some faint hope that the summit next week may produce something. “We pin some hopes on Clin- ton’s visit,” said villager Aludy Gelagayev, 51. ‘‘Maybe he will ask Yeltsin to withdraw the troops or otherwise resolve this with negotiations and peaceful means.”’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 6, 1995 \f"

Frustrated by chaotic conditions of ¢rime, inflation, late paychecks and uncertainty over even the near future, Russians turn to a man who promises to put them back on the track, if not to great- ness, then at least to law and accountability. They choose Gen. Alexander Lebed to be Russia’s next presi- dent in the June 1996 elections. Sometime into Lebed’s four-year term, NATO ends an anguished debate and determines that Poland and the Czech Republic have . finally met the demands of NATO membership. Both countries are brought under the security net of the NATO military alliance. The problem? Here is what Lebed recently said would tran- spire should NATO push its bound- aries so close to the Russian bor- der: “World War III would start. First and Third World countries would be destroyed. All and every- thing would be destroyed.” Cotld Lebed or some other stri- dent Russian nationalist make such a scenario happen? Yes — the Rus- sian bear still has its paw over the nuclear button.

Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 7, 1995 > and a troubled Russian nation seems increasingly irrelevant on the international scene, Russia still matters to the United States. What happens in this central remnant of the former Soviet Union is crucial to American security and Ameri- can interests. Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin certainly will not be mulling aloud horrific prospects of nuclear war during their summit discussions this. week, as Europe and the United States commemo- rate the SOth anniversary of V-E Day, the end of World War II. But the possibilities for the use and abuse of nuclear weapons in Rus- sia drive America’s foreign policy here more than any other factor. “Our national self-interest in events in Russia must first and foremost be based on our national security,” U.S. Ambassador Tho- mas Pickering said in a recent interview. “And our national secu- rity in military terms and tradi- tional security terms is, of course, still very much tied up with the fact that Russia is a formidable nuclear power with perhaps 20,400 to 30,000 nuclear weapons still in its inventory.” Most Americans never heard of Lebed, the brash general who com- mands the 14th Army in a contro- versial “peacekeeping” role in the neighboring state of Moldova, once part of the Soviet empire. But many Russians applaud Lebed as a defender of Russians stranded in the newly emerged countries, and Russian bear ‘as an honest man bold enough to criticize Yeltsin repeatedly and the military specifically for its bungling of the war in Chechnya. Lebed is the kind of dynamic leader many Russians long to see in control as their country Strains to fill a series of power vacuums left by the breakup of the Soviet Union and the demise Economic issues, of course, steer votes in many countries. But the impact in Russia is com- pounded by a one-dimensional view of democracy as simply supplying freedom, without an understanding yet that it also requires responsibility. '.’°.“The Russian people aren’t -used to democracy,’’ Pickering said. ““They aren’t used to lead- ers with promises who can’t deliver. They are looking for also hopes to sell armaments, despite Western concerns that Sudan promotes religious extremism and even terrorism in the Arab world. Nor is General Lebed the only Russian figure warning against expansion of NATO. Determined opposition by the Yeltsin govern- ment is a major sore point that must be nursed in the upcoming summit. The most serious, immediate dispute that will figure in this week’s talks centers on Russia’s plans to sell a nuclear reactor to Iran. Russia discounts the fears of American officials that Iran could convert the technology to weapons use. None of these issues will lead to war, but they illustrate why Russia matters to the United States, even under the most friendly leadership. The two countries simply have different self-interests that they believe are in the world’s interests, or at least will not harm world inter- ests. As the two sides grope to establish new rules of engage- ment with each other — after decades of maintaining the more simple relationship of hos- tility —— both have been willing to work at unraveling the kinks. At least, that has been the case with the current Russian presi- dent and his government. ‘hope. They’ve been in a very ter- rible situation. ...They’re pre- pared in a naive way, I think, to listen to voices that are glib, catchy.”’ But if politicians like Lebed and Zhirinovsky attract follow- ers, they also draw high negative - ratings. Political sentiment is so * fluid and unfocused that any- - thing could happen between now and presidential elections next year. Even under the most optimis- tic of outcomes — the election of a°-democratically minded presi- dent as friendly to America as: Yeltsin has been — the United States still must work at nurtur- ae good relations with Russia. “The possibilities for the “United States to influence world . €vents are rapidly deteriorating.

        "ocr_text": "Russian veterans wear their medals with ease Decorated: The nation loves to display military honors, and plenty are on view during the V-E Day anniversary. By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — On this 50th anniversary of the end of the Great Patriotic War, the typi- cal Russian veteran marching in Red Square today will look a bit like Mark Spitz after his seventh gold medal. No other country in the world can match Russia when it comes to wearing war medals. It is a tradition that was started before Peter the Great and brought to its zenith in 1942, when Soviet dictator Josef Stalin minted red- and-silver medals for “honored cook” and “honored tractor driver.” Ordinary Russians see nothing corny about donning the hardware, particularly af- ter losing more than 20 million compatriots in World War II. Soviet military losses were appalling: 40 times greater than those of Britain and 70 times greater than those of the United States. Ata family birthday party at a restaurant, it is no surprise to see Grandpa wearing his campaign ribbons on his baggy suit. On the subway, a gray-haired woman with medals pinned to a tattered sweater elicits no more wonderment than would an American with a bumper sticker announcing his status as a Vietnam vet. Veteran Nikolai Ehrlich, 71, was 17 when he won his Za Otvagu (“For Heroism”) medal. “We stormed their stronghold,” he re- members, telling about the time in 1941 when his Soviet Navy squad had to assault a Associated Press A chestful of awards: Russian Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin stands at attention Monday as World War Il veteran Ivan Lyadov speaks at a Moscow ceremony. German-held typewriter factory near Len- ingrad. “We captured a Nazi officer and tied him to skis,” he said, “and dragged him across the Bay of Finland so he could be questioned by our intelligence.” Throughout the rest of World War II, through battle after battle, the silver-dollar- sized decoration hung from a ribbon over Ehrlich’s heart. This was typical. Many pho- tos at Moscow’s Army Museum show Soviet troops Pi into battle against the Nazi wearing glittering decorations on theit ’ chests. And so, on this day above all others, Ehr- lich will boast the Za Otvagu, along with a dozen glitzier but less coveted medals, as he and his formation of septuagenarian veter- ans march in triumphal cadence past the Kremlin and the assembled dignitaries, in- cluding President Clinton. Ehrlich was just a typical sailor. More decorated veterans will be weighted down with 30 to 40 medals. The real standouts, such as 75-year-old Anna Timofeyeva-Ye- gorova, one of the few Soviet women bomber pilots, will wear a red star marking them as a “hero of the Soviet Union.” - One reason that Russians treasure war medals, no doubt, is that their country has spilled so much blood in battle over the last 300 years. Yet there is also something in the Russian soul that seems to crave organized patriotism. For many, medal-wearing is comfortable because it is ordained from on high. When one wears a medal, one is follow- ing orders. + Ehrlich’s medal is a lineal descendant of aczarist decoration called the Imperial Mili- tary Order of the Holy Martyr and Hero St. George, which was first awarded in 1769. In czarist times, the St. George decora- tion was reserved for acts of heroism, such as capturing an enemy fortress or seizing an op- posing corps commander. “The order shall be worn always, at all times, for it has been justly merited,” said the decree creating the medal. After the 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks eliminated the St. George’s Order. But be- fore long they replaced it with the Za Otvagu, created by Stalin in 1938, for deeds like Ehr- lich’s. And the tradition of wearing it “al- ways, at all times,” hag stuck. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 9, 1995 \f"

Clinton and Yeltsin on Wednesday open a potentially divisive summit at the Kremlin amid disputes over Chechnya, whether Russia should sell nuclear reactors to Iran and the proposed expansion of NATO. As Clinton headed to Moscow the State Department Monday, said it was ‘“‘very deeply disturbed”’ by reports of human rights atrocities by Russian soldiers in the Chechen town of Samashki. Published reports said 3,000 Russian soldiers seized the town, burned houses and shot unarmed women, children and elderly people, killing more than 100 in a three-day rampage in April. The streets and buildings of central Moscow were cleaned, repaired and festooned with flags and banners for the gathering of more than 50 world leaders to mark one of the few achievements Russians have left to be proud of: victory in what is still called “the Great Patriotic War.” It will be the largest assemblage of foreign dignitaries in the capital since the coronation of the last czar in 1894. Yet in a reflection of Western angst over brutal Russian tactics in crushing rebels in Chechnya, Clinton will stay in his hotel room while Russia’s newest tanks and warplanes rumble past a colossal new World War II monument.

The -HRussian military headquarters reported Monday that 33 Chechen ‘militants’ had been killed by Russian forces in overnight clashes. Meanwhile, a Chechen rebel spokesman accused Russia of using chemical weapons, saying the Chechens had found an unspecified number of chemical munitions which had failed to explode. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said that based on information from Russian human rights group and the International Committee for the Red Cross, the Clinton administration believes the reports of April’s village rampage by Russian troops in Chechnya are correct.

Refusal to budge from that position would provoke heavy fallout in the U.S. Congress, including renewed calls for a cutoff of American aid to Russia.

Clinton acknowledged that he had not succeeded in persuading Yeltsin to cancel the entire $1 billion plan under which Rus- sia’s hard-pressed Atomic Ener- gy Ministry will sell four power- generating atomic reactors to Iran’s Islamic fundamentalist government. “T made the best arguments I could about why I thought the whole sale should not go for- ward,” Clinton told a joint news conference. The president flies to Ukraine today for a 24-hour state visit. Yeltsin explained that by pulling back from the centrifuge project, “the military component falls away, and what remains is a peaceful nuclear power station ... Which is designed to provide heat and energy.” This was the first summit held under the threat by U.S. congressional leaders to cut off foreign aid to Russia, which be- gan five years ago in the last cha- otic months of the Soviet Union and amounts to $700 million this year. House Speaker Newt Ging- rich and other Republicans have warned that Russian refusal to cancel the Iran reactor sale would lead to a cutoff of U.S. funding. Adding to the pressure, Secretary of State Warren Chris- topher cautioned that the Rus- sian reactor sale would endanger Russia's prospects of gaining full membership in Western-led in- ternational institutions such as the Group of Seven industrial de- mocracies. Clinton told the Kremlin news conference that he still backs foreign aid to Moscow on grounds that America benefits from democracy and private economy in Russia.

Despite the Clinton adminis- tration’s protests, Dole kept up the attack Thursday in a speech on the Senate floor. “If an agreement is_ not reached, history shows it is better to state the disagreements clearly rather than paper them over,” the Kansas Republican said. “In the case of the Moscow summit, it is clear that President Yeltsin was not in a position to address our concerns. We should admit that and respond appropriately. “Congress will respond by looking closely at all forms of aid to Russia, especially aid to the gov- ernment.” White House aides singled out Dole for what they characterized as GOP presidential politicking. “We very much regret the comments of Sen.

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — The murky war in Chechnya is the kind of situation in which disaster re- lief expert Fred Cuny excelled — a complex, multisided conflict victimizing thousands of innocent civilians. The burly, 50-year-old Texas business- man had worked in more than 30 countries, bringing aid to dying people in some of the world’s most precarious killing zones, from Bosnia to Somalia to northern Iraq. His 26-year track record had been a string of successes — until April 9, when Cuny disappeared with his Russian transla- tor and two Russian Red Cross doctors dur- ing his second mission to the Chechen war zone. On Monday, an official from neighboring Ingushetia reported that a mutilated body matching Cuny’s description had been found with two bullet wounds through the head. The body is to be brought today to Ingu- shetia, where Cuny’s brother and 29-year-old son have been leading a search for him since finding out he’d vanished, and his family has sent medical records. The corpse was discovered in a shallow grave in southeast Chechnya at Shali, about 50 miles from where Cuny was last seen, ac- cording to Pyotry Kosov, a state councilman in Ingushetia. The Itar-Tass and Interfax news agencies noted that the face was disfigured by hydro- chloric acid but that overall the body matched Cuny’s description. “It’s too early to make the final conclusion,” Kosov said, “but according to the descriptions we have, it’s Fred Cuny’s body. I’m 95 percent certain.” The injuries described by the news agen- cies would indicate an execution-style killing rather than an accident of war. The monthlong hunt for Cuny has includ- ed State Department diplomats and a person- al appeal by President Clinton to Russian President Boris Yeltsin last week. Some participating in the search said they were taking the report of the discovered body as just another rumor among scores of reports that have ended in blind alleys. Gene Cuny, the missing man’s father, said the family doesn’t believe the dead man is his son and is sending records to help with identification. “We feel very optimistic,” Cuny told The Associated Press from his home in the Dallas area. But The New York Times quoted uniden- tified U.S. Embassy officials who said that, given Cuny’s 6-foot-2 frame, an unusual height in the area, it seemed unlikely the vic- tim was anyone else. The Soros Foundation, a New York-based philanthropy organization, had contracted Cuny’s Dallas-based firm, Intertect Relief and Construction Corp., to bring aid to the rebel Chechen province, which has been pounded for five months by Russian troops. An engineer by training, Cuny first be- came involved in disaster relief during the 1969 effort in Biafra. He has been associated with many hu- manitarian efforts since, including those in Sri Lanka, Iraq, Bosnia, the slums of Calcut- ta, India, and along the Thai-Cambodian border. He was known for combining Texas blus- ter and charm with a rare ability to clear red tape and reach accommodation with compet- ing and often hostile forces. Relatives and friends groping for clues to Cuny’s whereabouts have been frustrated by heavy fighting in the foothills of the Cauca- su3 Mountains, prohibiting access to the body for days. Working on the assumption that Cuny had been kidnapped, they were visibly disap- pointed that no news materialized during last’ week’s Clinton-Yeltsin summit in Moscow. They also complained that Russian mili- tary authorities prevented searchers from investigating the body report, which sur- faced Friday. , Cuny’s brother Chris said, “We've heard: every possible scenario. We've been on a roller coaster.” He and Cuny’s son, Craig, who have worked with Cuny at Intertect, joined a search team that included experts from the company, the Soros Foundation and the U.S. Embassy. The team has been based in a spare hotel room in Ingushetia, just miles from the Chechen combat zone. The missing man was known for “ruffling feathers. That’s what he does,” said Craig Cuny. “There are reasons that either side might be disgruntled.’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 16, 1995 \f"

        "ocr_text": "6 MONTHS OF CIVIL WAR bullets becomes way of life in Grozny Still neighbors: Ethnic Russians and Chechens try to get along in the capital as troops and rebels fight it out. By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT rozny, Russia — By day Russian bulldozers begin clearing a provincial capi- tal bombed to rubble, and by night Russian cannons blast away at shadows to keep the re- silient Chechen rebels from tak- ing back the streets. In the six months since Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin sent in tanks to pacify 1 million Chechens in a province the size of Connecticut, this ethnic miniwar is proving to be just as violent and intractable as the United Nations’ struggle to control Bosnia. The main differ- ence: The rest of the world’s leaders have decided that Chech- nya is Russia’s internal problem, not theirs. And so, after half a year of a Russian civil war that has left be- tween 20,000 and 50,000 Che- chens and Russians dead, it falls to ordinary souls such as Che- chen bus driver Ilias Lokhaev, 31, to find their own solutions. Wounded in the shoulder by a bomb attack in January, he and his wife and two daughters, age 3 and 4, escaped from Grozny dur- Associated Prdss At the ready: A Russian soldier wielding a Kalashnikov rifle rides in a convoy through the ing the two worst months.

Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 10, 1995 > \fNow Lokhaev has no job and no money, and he is down to half a sack of wheat, half a bag of rice and some sugar. The family has holed up on the ninth floor of an apartment block that was built to withstand earthquakes. That is why his apartment wasn’t wrecked when a Russian rocket exploded two floors above him back in De- cember. Now he spends two hours a day hauling buckets of water from a source he prays is safe: a faucet in the basement of a near- by apartment. ’ Because the headquarters of the Russian-installed provisional government is just around the corner, Lokhaev was among the first of Grozny’s 100,000 or more returned residents to have gas and electricity restored. So he watches a lot of Moscow tele- vision. , One of his worst problems, Lokhaev said, is the noisy neigh- bor downstairs: a Russian light tank. | “They shoot all through the night and our children cannot sleep,” said Lokhaev. “They are just shooting because they are scared.” He wasn’t exaggerating. A re- | porter staying in an apartment’ across the hall heard at least 500 gunshots in two nights, many of them machine gun tracer rounds and heavy thuds from light tanks. Ores O DUNGS @mManatedc OT) G MONTHS OF CIVIL WAR the light tank barricaded inside a Russian command post on the first. floor of Lokhaev’s apart- ment block. Maj. Alexander Kuts, the Russian army spokesman, said troops assigned to enforce the all-night curfew have no choice but to shoot. Kuts said the official Russian estimate is that 2,000 Chechens who fought on the side of the elu- sive President Dzhokhar Du- dayev have slipped back into Grozny in the past two months. “Practically every day new people are coming back to Groz- ny, and among them are a lot of guys who fought for Dudayev,” said Kuts. “By day they sell in the market or teach in one of the schools that have been reopened. And at night he takes his ma- chine gun and shoots at us. Every night, we have wounded soldiers in the command posts. “The only way to stop this shooting is to send out our spe- cial units and if they spot some- body shooting, then hold a trial and execute him the next day.” In a city where virtually ev- ery house, apartment block and factory is pocked and scorched by the projectiles of war, it seems remarkable that a considerable degree of neighborliness persists between the former Chechen and Russian ethnic groups who have been intermixed throughout the city for generations. Chechnya Russian troops battle rebels Perhaps it is because, unlike Bosnia, the two local ethnic groups in Grozny had to share common suffering last winter from a fight that many blame on ambitious politicians, not on each other. “During the worst of the fighting last January, the Du- dayev people protected us from looting,” said Anatoly Imarov, a 56-year-old Russian engineer who has come back to Grozny to work on rebuilding the oil refin- ery. “Unfortunately, there has been a lot of looting from the Russian side after Dudayev’s people left.” A few blocks from the build- ing, a work team of 20 women with bandanas covering their faces was reattaching the old rot- REUBEN STERNI/S caft ting insulation that had fallen from damaged pipes of the city’s hot water distribution system. As it turned out, it was a work brigade from the city construc- tion department, with half of the workers Russians and half Chechens. “We have been working all our lives together,” said Zoya Dunayev, 53, a Chechen woman who was the brigade leader. ‘“‘We are just simple people. We don’t have time for fights between us.” The Russian deputy leader, Rita Livonenko, 53, said they had enough to worry about from pos- sible land mines along the pipe- line route and from the old insu- lation, which she hoped was not asbestos. “What can we do?” she said. “We have to eat.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 10, 1995 (Continued) \f"

Five Russian attempts to storm Bamut have been repulsed. Now the pace of air and artillery bom- bardment is increasing, and the rebels are convinced a sixth Russ- jan “storming” will come within days. The anticipated assault comes as Russian forces bear down on the rebel headquarters of Shatoi. which Russian NTV television said could tall as early as today. Russian forees over the weekend launched a major offensive against the remaining holdouts of lovalists to Chechen leader Dzhokhar Du- dayev. A Russian army spokesman said Bamut was one of only four re- maining centres of Chechen armed resistance, the Interfax news agency reported. Nlaj. Gen. Vladimir Bulgakov told the ITAR-Tass news agency his troops had to fight through dif- ficult mountain terrain for every vard they captured. The ITAR- Tass report spoke of Russian casu- alties. but gave no numbers. It also suid a Russian helicopter with four servicemen aboard had crashed in the mountains. There was no im- mediate word on their fate.

Between 20.000 and 50.000 peo- ple are believed to have been killed since Russian forces entered the Caucasus Mountains republic Dec. 11 to end a three-year Chechen in- dependence drive and oust the Du- dayev government. A visit to Bamut illustrates why Russian President Boris Yeltsin said last week that the “road to peace” in Chechnya will be diffi- cult. Here, as elsewhere in Chech- nya, tens of thousands of Chechens simply refuse to accept defeat. In an = interview with Echo Moscow radio Sunday, Dudayev said peace talks were pointless. “Three hundred thousand people have been left homeless. jobless and without any means for exis- tence. They all have witnessed Rus- sia’s cruelty.” the Chechen leader said from an undisclosed location. Montreal Gazette - June 13, 1995 \f"

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Staff Writers BUDYONNOVSK, Russia — Russian troops stormed a hospital where Chechen rebels were hold- ing more than 1,000 hostages and freed about a quarter of the cap- tives Saturday, but at least 100 people were reported killed in the bloody encounters. Fighting interrupted by truces continued into early this morning, when Russian news agencies re- ported that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and rebel com- mander Shamil Basayev had reached a tentative agreement by telephone to end the standoff. About 25 women and children were released. Talks on the de- tails were to take place later in the day. Shortly after Saturday’s fight- ing started around 5 a.m., female hostages organized a chorus and cried “Stop shooting! Don't shoot!’ from open hospital win- dows. Some of them draped white bed sheets as a signal that civilian prisoners were in the line of fire. But Russia’s elite Alpha Group commandos and regular troops backed by helicopters maintained their assault for about four hours Saturday morning, managing to take over the first floor of the hospital. The Chechen fighters were said to have put all the male hos- tages in the hospital basement, which they claimed to have mined. On the second and third floors, they allegedly used female hos- tages as human shields against the Russians. \fSnipers take aim at homes One hostage confirmed that, but most of them said the Che- chens treated them solicitously, even sharing their last bits of bread. ’ The Russians freed 60 hos- tages, and the Chechens then re- leased more than 160 others, ac- cording to NTV, the independent Russian television channel. Lines of dazed young women, some in the late stages of pregnan- cy and others carrying swaddled newborns, walked out in their nightgowns into brilliant sunshine. “They said more women died from Russian bullets than from the Chechens’, ” said Dr. Viktor Niki- tayev, 48, who examined 110 freed women Saturday and allowed all but three to return home. — ' However, the doctor said sev- eral of the babies born to pregnant women forced from their materni- ty ward had been stillborn or died during their mothers’ three-day gaptivity. ‘. Some hostages came out cry- ing and shouting at the Russians that they were exterminating their own people. .. “T am praying. I am asking.

The pictures on Russian levision of Yeltsin glad-handing well-wishers in Canada and at- tending a circus’ performance there as the troops were preparing to act only added to his problems. Yeltsin says attack OK’d The Russian parliament’s low- er house demanded that Yeltsin return to Russia to take charge, and legislators planned to debate a motion of no-confidence in his government on Wednesday. In Moscow, Russian govern- ment spokesman Valery Grishin tried to distance officials from the bloodshed in Budennovsk, sug- gesting that the attack was an unauthorized, emotional response to the shouts and pleas of hostages inside the hospital. However, Yelt- sin said the assault was agreed between him and Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin on Friday. Russia’s Democratic Choice Party, led by Yeltsin’s former prime minister and supporter, Ye- gor Gaidar, said Saturday that it will vote to bring down Yeltsin’s government if he does not replace the Cabinet ministers responsible for the tragedy in Budennovsk. Nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirin- ovsky and liberal faction leader Grigory Yavlinsky both said their parties also will vote against the government. A THE ASSOCIATED PRESS A woman freed by Chechen rebel captors shouts at Russian soldiers to stop firing at a hospital full of civilians. Two Russian commando units attacked the building where 1,000 hostages were held. ‘Tell this idiot president of ours to come here. He should stop these talks in Canada and come talk to these terrorists.’ ZINAIDA AZIMANOVA, criticizing Boris Yeltsin A vote of no-confidence would not dislodge Yeltsin, but it could bring down his prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and also possibly lead to new parliamentary elections. Judging by the mood among many voters, such elections might not bring positive results for Yelt- sin. The evening news on Russia’s most independent network, NTV, showed women in Budyonnovsk weeping and pleading with Rus- sian troops not to resume their shooting, which they said was only killing innocent hostages. “The president should be with us now,” one woman said. Yeltsin reportedly had jour- neyed to Halifax with hopes that the hostage taking would persuade G-7 leaders that the Russian gov- ernment had no choice but to continue fighting the six-month old Chechen conflict. Both factions chastised But the group still adopted a resolution at meeting’s end chas- tising both sides for continuing hostilities, urging a negotiated set- tlement. The Interfax news agency said the government was ready to sus- pend military action in Chechnya —a key rebel demand — in return for the hostages’ release, but re- jected new rebel demands. The ITAR-Tass news agency reported that the tentative pact would let most hostages go free, with some remaining to ensure the rebels’ safety. Neither report could be immediately confirmed. Speaking in Canada, Yeltsin claimed that rebel leader Gen. Dzhokhar Dudayev had sought and accepted asylum in Turkey. But rebel leaders denied that, and U.S. and Turkish officials could not confirm it. Accurate figures on the total number held captive and the total numbers killed since the Che- chens arrived Wednesday in a blaze of grenade explosions and automatic weapons fire were not available. In Moscow, Mayor Yuri Luzh- kov warned residents to remain vigilant, expressing fears that Chechen terrorist actions could be mounted in the capital.

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Paim Beach Post Staff Writers BUDYONNOVSK, Russia — Chechen rebels prepared to free most of about 1,500 hostages they held in a hospital after Russia declared a cease-fire Sunday night in Chechnya and granted the gun- men safe passage home. Late Sunday, talks continued over whether the Chechen gun- men would be allowed to take - hostages with them today to en- sure they would not be attacked by Russian troops, who unsuccessful- ly stormed the hospital Saturday. And it was unclear how long Russian forces had agreed to stop fighting in Chechnya, a southern republic they entered six months ago to put down a bid for indepen- dence. But the day of telephone nego- tiations between Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow and rebel leader Shamil Basayev did produce freedom for at least 400 more hostages, mostly women and children, in two separate groups. More than 225 were freed Sat- urday. ‘*The talks ended in such a way that all the demands of Basayev have been satisfied,’’ said Che- chen negotiator Ikhvan Gelik- hanov. “The rest will be released when they provide to Shamil Ba- sayev’s group transport for the trip to Chechnya,’” Gelikhanov said. Russian President Boris Yelt- sin returned to Moscow on Sun- day from an economic summit in Canada. Yeltsin had attended the meet- ing despite the hostage crisis, pro- voking significant popular anger. But other than making a tele- vised statement urging Russians to stay calm and united and to support the military men who had tried to free the hostages, Yeltsin was not an obvious participant in the crisis. A government spokesman said Basayev wanted six buses to take his men and accompanying hos- tages back to Chechnya, about 90 miles to the south. Chernomyrdin immediately honored a pledge to renew peace talks. He dispatched two high-level negotiators Sunday afternoon to the Chechen capital of Grozny. In one strange twist, Cherno- myrdin’s no-nonsense telephone talks with the Chechen leader were filmed and shown on televi- sion news programs throughout the evening. Gelikhanovy said the Chechens want to take about 100 ‘‘volun- teer’’ hostages with them back to the area of Vedeno, a rebel center in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains in Chechnya. As added insurance, they also would take several members of the Russian parliament, who have helped negotiate the crisis that began Wednesday with the Che- chens’ furious assault on this city | of 100,000 in southern Russia. , But by late Sunday Russian officials had not agreed to that demand.

        "ocr_text": "Russian hostages released By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS novsk, Russia — Chechen rebels re- leased most of an estimated 1,500 hostages Monday, then headed toward their homeland on buses carrying scores of voluntary “human shields” to guard against Russian attack. Military helicopters and police cars tracked the slow-moving convoy as it wound through the coun- tryside toward neighboring Chechnya 90 miles away, ending an embarrassing humiliation for both the Russian military and its government. . Many hostages were carried out of the hospital. where they had been held on stretchers to waiting ambulances. Others stumbled in the debilitating heat and brilliant sun, walking only with help after spending five days with little food or water. Russia assured the rebels of safe passage, but signs of mistrust were evident. The convoy of re- bels, which included six buses with blacked-out windows and a truck bearing the bodies of slain Chechen gunmen, changed its course several times. After nine hours, the buses were still closer to Budyonnovsk, site of the hospital siege, than to Chechnya after Russian troops sent the convoy on a circuitous route through remote back country. The rebels traveled with about 170 former hos- tages and Russian journalists, parliamentary depu- ties, medical personnel and local officials who agreed to accompany them. Definitive figures have been unavailable on the numbers of gunmen, hostages, dead and wounded since the Chechens burst into Budyonnovsk, spray- ing downtown with gunfire, burning houses and grabbing hostages in a bid to force Russian troops to withdraw from Chechnya. Russian TV reported Monday that 73 Chechen commandos got on the buses and that 764 hostages were released from the hospital. The Associated Press estimated around 1,500 hostages were freed. On Monday, relatives responded with shouts, tears and embraces when loved ones stepped from a bus or ambulance. But emotional discord also erupted when angry townspeople heard hostages praising their Chechen captors. “The most terrible moment was at 5 in the morning when [Russian troops] opened fire on the hospital. ... They killed four people right around me when they opened fire,” said Dmitri Kiriluk, 64, his head bandaged. ‘“‘The Chechens didn’t bother us.

Nen rebellion in Russian parkament: Yelts gets vote of no confidence ~ Moscow — Russian stability suf- fired another blow Wednesday as the parliament opened a new offensive against President Boris Yeltsin with a Vote no confidence in his government. Amid talk of impeachment — fueled pati by last weekend’s mishandled hostage crisis — half a dozen diverse factions of Russia’s State Duma joined to rebuke Yeltsin's government by a vote of 241-72. The Duma vote was the sharpest note of political discord since Yeltsin disbanded the old parliament in Sep- tember 1993, then sent tanks to rout in- surgents led by disgruntled deputies. The current parliament took office in January 1994, and relations have deteri- orated badly since the war in Chechnya started six months ago. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, a hard-line defender of Yeltsin and un- popular figure among deputies, dis- missed the vote with a statement that “the ultimate decision remains with the president.” Passage of the resolution Wednes- day does not require Yeltsin immediate- ly to disband his government, but it could force him into a difficult choice. If the lower house of parliament again passes a no-confidence measure vote within three months, Yeltsin either must dissolve his administration or dis- miss the parliament and call new “All the responsibility for the social and economic situation in the country, and mainly for the civil war in the Cau- casus, is borne by President Yeltsin,” said Grigory Yavlinsky, a Western-ori- ented economist who heads a major democratic faction. Yavlinskly said impeachment would be preferable to a no-confidence resolu- tion, but complained that it is too com- plicated to accomplish. That did not stop the Communist Party of Russia, which said Wednesday that it has collected 100 of the needed 150 deputies’ signatures on an impeachment petition. 5 Yavlinsky joined ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky as well as the Communists, the agrarians and the women’s party in voting no confidence, Yeltsin gave no sign he would bow to the deputies’ will. Prime Minister Victor Chernomyr: din said he would only leave office “if someone could prove that he can do better.” s Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 22, 1995 \f"

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — Our neighborhood bank has cast a new lure for potential customers: a flashy sign in the subway station beaming minute-by-minute changes in the ruble-dollar exchange rate. International economists may quarrel with the Russian government's seesaw efforts to switch to the free- market system. But principles of capitalism are penetrating the streets, even reaching down to the Moscow Metro, which has symbolized the ideals of communism since it opened in 1935. The electronic sign at the Academicheskaya stop in our neighborhood fs among the waves of change that I have watched drift across the former Soviet Union since I moved here two years ago. I’ve interviewed factory bosses struggling to retool their thinking and heard scientists ponder ways to secure the pristine clarity of Lake Baikal in Siberia. I’ve seen eruptions of political violence. But perhaps the most telling barometer of change is a walk through my neighborhood. It’s a district of trees and apartment blocks three subway stops south of the city center, not far from the park-like Lenin Hills embracing Moscow University. For much of the past year, every day brought something new. I’m not sure whether the most shocking GISCO CV Was a StO ( OTe (O for big and tall men or the 24-hour market that sells everything from loofah bath sponges to Tyson’s flash- frozen chicken breasts.

Striking contrasts This is exotic stuff in a city where just four years ago people lined up for | hours to buy a fatty hunk of meat and teenagers begged tourists to sell the jeans off their bodies. Several new commercial banks have located in our neighborhood, their doors guarded by guys who you know pack something lethal under their wide-shouldered sport coats. Usually a line of people waits outside to trade rubles for dollars. Young men in blue jeans and leather jackets, budding czars of commerce, carefully count 3-inch-thick wads of $100 bills. Other Russians come on payday, anxious to get rid of rubles that have plunged in value from about 900 rubles to the dollar when we arrived to nearly 5,000 today. They may have only enough to pry $20 from the teller, but that’s how people save money — changing rubles immediately to dollars, which they hide at home. The ruble has steadied and even bounced back slightly in recent days, but confidence in the ruble won’t take root quickly. Last fall a string of prefabricated kiosks went up a few blocks away, where neighbors can buy French cosmetics, Danish sausages or Japanese boomboxes. The small, self- contained stores suddenly appeared after Moscow’s ironhanded mayor tried to stabilize downtown commerce by prohibiting new kiosks there. Rules of the marketplace the neighborhood. Unfortunately, this includes my favorite Italian-run market, where they sold great Parmesan and good wine. Having lived in Italy for four years, I was awed to find this place.

Babushkas proffer homemade bread at a price inflated from 300 rubles when we arrived (then about 3 cents) to 2,000 rubles (40 cents) today. Others sell home-canned tomatoes or hawk the handful of carrots or bunch of cilantro they grew. Some are selling the family crystal. These are hard times, especially for the elderly.

        "ocr_text": "Exiled spy dies, takes secret to grave American intelligence ring enabled Russia to duplicate A-bomb By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF Moscow — Fulfilling his last wish, exiled American spy Morris Cohen went to his grave on Tuesday without ever un- masking a prominent U.S. sci- entist he says leaked atomic bomb blueprints to the Soviets in 1945. Cohen’s death was an- nounced by one of the successor agencies of the KGB, which guarded and pampered the na- tive New Yorker for the last 25 years. Once a football trainer in Mississippi and newspaper re- porter in Memphis, Cohen died late Friday at 84. He lived six blocks from the American Em- bassy. He is credited by Russian in- telligence with founding a nev- er-uncovered spy ring that stole atomic secrets from Los Alamos with the help of his lifelong spy partner and wife, Lona Petka Cohen. She died here in 1992. The Los Alamos ring’s most spectacular accomplishment came on July 4, 1945, when the New York headquarters of the NKVD, Josef Stalin’s infamous secret police agency, cabled Moscow that the United States was about to test the world’s first atomic weapon. Russian documents show that by the time the test bomb detonated in the New Mexico desert 12 days later, Soviet sci- entists already had a precise de- scription of the American “im- plosion weapon” made of nested layers of plutonium, aluminum, . beryllium and uranium. Under a crash program or- dered by Stalin, the Soviets stunned the world by setting off an exact duplicate of the Ameri- can bomb in 1949, spawning a nuclear spiral that cost trillions of dollars before the arms race finally bankrupted the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. Within months, American code-breakers identified and sent to prison one of the Soviet sources at Los Alamos, British physicist Klaus Fuchs. But it re- mained secret for five decades that the Soviets also may have recruited a second Los Alamos scientist who was an American. In Russian interviews before his death, Cohen said that he and his wife had secret dealings - with a young American scientist in the Manhattan Project. But he refused to identify the sci- entist. “I assume even in 100 years his last name won't be ex- posed,” Cohen said last fall. “I think that two or maybe three people remain in the [Russian Intelligence] Service who know his real name.” ~ The Cohens’ role in atomic espionage only surfaced in 1991 during a moment of intelligence openness. In a partly fictional- ized account, KGB Col. Vladi- mir Chikov wrote that the Co- hens had ferreted atomic se- crets from Los Alamos with the help of an “American physicist” whom Chikov called “Perseus.” The FBI has an ongoing in- vestigation into the existence of “Perseus” but has never lodged charges or acknowledged whether ‘it believes the Soviet allegations. “Their [the Cohens’] fate was very difficult, especially for Morris,” Chikov said recently. An acquaintance of the Cohens, Chikov is the author of a forth- coming book on the Soviet atom- ic bomb. An all-American beginning Cohen, the son of a New York immigrant fruit peddler, starred as a football lineman at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. He won an athletic scholarship to Mississippi State College in 1931, but after a knee injury he became the team trainer. After graduating in 1934, he worked for two years as a re- porter and advertising sales- man for the Memphis Press- Scimitar, according to FBI and Soviet Communist Party records. Infused with radical thoughts during the Great De- pression, he joined the Ameri- can Communist Party in 1935 and then enlisted to fight with the leftist Abraham Lincoln Bri- gade during the Spanish Civil War. Hit in both legs by machine gun fire during his first battle, Cohen spent four months in a hospital ward. While ing in spring 1938, he was oneal a handful of American volun- teers chosen by Soviet intelli- gence officers to return to America and become Soviet spies. After allegedly assembling a spy network that included “Per- seus,” Cohen was drafted into the U.S. Army in July 1942, leaving his bride Lona to carry out risky courier assignments near Los Alamos and elsewhere. In summer 1950, the Cohens were tipped off by a Soviet dip- lomat about a coming FBI crackdown and fled to Moscow through Mexico. Four years lat- er, after undergoing spy train- ing here and in Poland, they sur- faced again in England under the false names Peter and Helen Kroger of New Zealand. For six years Cohen led a double life as a London rare book dealer and secret radio op- erator for the Soviets. In 1961, he and his wife were trapped by British agents and convicted of conspiring to steal British sub- marine warfare secrets. They spent nine years in jail before the KGB managed to extract them in a spy swap for an im- prisoned Briton. The Cohens, who had no children, spent part of the last two decades training young Russians to be Soviet spies in the West. His funeral Tuesday was closed to outsiders so that his former colleagues could attend without fear of being identified. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 28, 1995 \f"

President Boris Yeltsin is threatening to toss out the parliament later this week, while deputies are making noises about impeaching Yeltsin. But while crisis is the capi- tal’s watchword, much of the rest of Russia is enjoying a summer of unaccustomed stability. Work- ers aren’t striking and there is plenty of food in the stores.

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Kaliningrad, Russia Heads of the American and Rus- sian manned space programs bear-hugged when Atlantis made its momentous embrace with Mir Thursday, then recounted just how bumpy was the course to the coupling. Sitting in front-row seats in the balcony of Mission Control in this north Moscow suburb, Rus- sian Yuri Koptev and American Daniel Goldin finally stopped fidgeting to watch the shuttle At- lantis pull up and sit squarely into the docking bay of the Rus- sian orbiting space station. “They touched,” said the an- nouncer in Russian. Then: “They made the mechanical grabbing.” Hundreds of space agency personnel, both Russian and American, who helped the linkup happen jumped to their feet with applause. Koptev, the stout di- rector of the Russian Space Agency, enveloped in his arms the dapper Goldin, administrator of NASA. Smiles. Photo flashes. Hugs for everybody. Russian Mission Control, where workers and jour- nalists mingle with the big guys even while they’re talking on the hotline to space, is a lot more in- formal than NASA’s. “Norm, I’m still saving a hot fudge sundae for you. I'll be wait- ing on the ground when you land,’”’ Goldin said via the satel- lite telephone link to American astronaut Norman Thagard, the Floridian who in March became the first American to set foot on the 10-year-old Russian space station. Two stalwarts of the space program, Russian Prime Minis- ter Victor Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President Al Gore, took a break from their meetings at a Moscow government hotel to watch the linkup on live televi- sion. Viewers of the space feat here could see Chernomyrdin and Gore watching the docking on a split-screen video presenta- tion covering a two-story wall of Mission Control. After only two years of coop- erative work, Goldin told Tha- gard and the two Russian cosmo- nauts with him on Mir that they are celebrating “the formal wed- ding of the United States and Russia in space.” Between the docking, which took place at 5 p.m., Moscow time, and the handshake of crew Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 30, commanders more than 90 min- utes later, Goldin and Koptev told reporters about the trouble getting to the church and the prospects ahead for this union. The shuttle and station will orbit together for five days, then uncouple so Atlantis can carry home Thagard and the crew that has been on Mir, having deposit- ed a new Russian team. Seven more such dockings will precede the 1997 start of construction on a new international space station. “The main thing in these last two years was the creation of trust,” said Koptev, when asked what was the biggest problem. “We have to let each other know that we can trust each other. And we are sure of our future. We are now riding on the same spaceship.” Goldin was more specific. “We had to learn each other’s languages and cultures. We had loads of problems. It was thou- sands of hours of people getting to know how to work with each other,” he said. He cited how the Russians keep personnel in positions over the long term, while the Ameri- cans frequently shift people around. The Americans finally realized their habit was causing the Russians huge frustrations, so they changed. “We do things differently.

And there was a lot of stress in the beginning,” Goldin said. “We vowed not to let emo- tion take over when good sense should prevail. And now we are working almost as one team.” The leaders of the space pro- grams that once were cutthroat competitors acknowledged that troubles remain, not only in fi- nancing but also in maintaining support from national leaders who don’t always approve of Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 30, 1995 (Continued) what the other side is doing polit- ically. “T don’t think our parliament is any kinder than the American.

        "ocr_text": " Yeltsin fires ‘power ministers’ Move expected to mean survival of government By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel COX NEWS SERVICE MOSCOW — President Boris Yeltsin on Friday kicked out three key ministers of the so- called “war party” within his Cabinet who have pressed to win the war in Chechnya by military force. The sudden cashiering of half of his innermost Kremlin circle almost certainly ensures Yeltsin's government will survive today’s scheduled vote of no-confidence in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. Tt was a heavy concession to democratic and women’s blocs that had insisted on the scalps of the ‘‘power ministers’ for botching the Budyonnovsk hos- tage crisis in June in which 70 Chechen fighters kept the nation paralyzed for a week, In one fell swoop, Yeltsin accepted the resignations from counterintelligence chief Sergei Stepashin, Interior Minister Vik- tor Yerin and deputy prime min- ister Nixolai Yegorov. Yeltsin made the “difficult” decision to oust them because of their ‘‘miscalculations and shortcomings,” explained presi- dential press secretary Sergei Medvedev. The sweeping and unexpected nature of the shakeup seemed to signal that Yeltsin has come down — temporarily at least — on the side of the Kremlin’s so- called “peace party,” which believes Chechnya cannot be pacified except through negotiations, The leader of this faction, Prime Minister Viktor Cherno- myrdin, said the “power minis- ters” had done right in tendering their resignations at Thursday's National Security Council meet- ing. “Those responsible for people’s lives must carry full responsibility,” he said. One architect of the Chechnya war who kept his job was Yeltsin's friend, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who contends he had nothing to do with the June 17 commando raid on the Budy- onnovsk hospital that failed to free more than 1,000 hostages. Chernomyrdin answered hard- line critics of his decision two weeks ago to make televised con- cessions to Chechen guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev to win freedom for the hostages. “It was probably the first time that Russia put the lives of its citizens above political considerations,” the prime minis- ter said, Chernomyrdin has hinted that he wants to preside over a peace conference in Moscow at which a spectrum of Chechen faction leaders would agree to end the war and install a new government through free elections this fall, Fired along with the three “power ministers” was Yevgeny Kuznetsov, the governor of Russia’s Stavropol region where at least 123 people died in the hostage crisis, Stepashin became head of the internal intelligence service in 1994, and bears responsibility for plunging Russia into a “covert” war in Chechnya last fall whose failure led Yeltsin to launch a full scale invasion in December. It was Stepashin’s agency that contracted Russian military offic- ers as mercenaries to join the Chechen opposition fighting Chechnya’s independence- minded president, Dzhokhar Dudayev.

At a news conference sched- uled in Washington today, the chiefs of the Central Intelli- gence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and National Security Agency are to release for the first time segments of the laboriously decoded Soviet spy messages that led to the conviction of atomic spy Klaus Fuchs in 1950 and eventually to the executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. -*~ Among the most closély guarded secrets of American.in- telligence, the decrypts - may shed new light on recent, contro- versial claims by one-time Rus- sian spy operatives that an array of U.S. scientists also passed. to the Soviets secrets on how they built the first atomic bomb.» _ “If they release this;» it could clear up everything,” said political scientist Harvey Klehr, a professor at Atlanta’s Emory University and co-au- thor of a new book detailing es- pionage activities within. the U.S. Communist Party. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 11, 1995 Whatever information. is made public, it will bring imto focus the fact that the Soviets maintained extensive and often successful spy rings that ex- tracted valuable data from the United States in the spheres of weaponry, aviation and ingys- trial development. This frigid chapter of” the Cold War is being reopened. at a time when anti-Russian senti- ment in Congress is growing and anti-American sentiment is on the rise in Russia, espe- cially in the State pune, or parliament. The topic of the press Se. ference, according to the CIA, involves encoded Soviet com- munications, which U.S. ifitel- ligence has termed the “Ven- ona”’ intercepts.

The Roosevelt administration ordered the code book returned to Moscow as a sign of goodwill toward the U.S. wartime ally. But the OSS kept a copy. The code book itself was not sufficient to read the messages, which were doubly coded.

By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — The Russian government and _ television Played down President Boris Yeltsin’s hospitalization for *‘acute”’ heart trouble Tuesday, with a presidential spokesman reporting he was speaking with aides by phone and signing pa- pers from his hospital bed. The normally thorough In- dependent Television (NTV) devoted less than three min- utes of its broadcast to Yelt- sin’s illness. It included no in- formation on Yeltsin’s spotty medical history or the wide- spread speculation over the last several years that the pres- ident has serious physical problems, including alco- holism. State-run television gave even less information. The approach was reminis- cent of Soviet-era containment of potentially damaging infor- mation, despite efforts since the fall of the Soviet Union to democratize and open up the workings of Russia’s gov- ernment. “‘He is working,’’ said Yelt- sin’s press secretary, Sergei Medvedev, in an interview with Russian Public Televi- sion, the government-con- trolled channel still broadcast throughout the former Soviet Union. He called Western media accounts of Yeltsin’s hospital- ization ‘‘too emotional,’’ sug- gesting that ‘‘sensationalism is desired, but sensationalism - isn’t to be found.”’ Medvedev said the presi- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 12, 1995 dent had not changed his platter, to make a state visit to Norway. next week with a stop in Mur- mansk, in the far northwestern. part of Russia.

        "ocr_text": "Russians long on optimism, short on Olympic funding By Marcia Kunstel COX NEWS SERVICE Moscow — Russia’s Olympic Com- mittee, straining to put together its first wholly Russian team for next year’s Summer Games in Atlanta, is virtually bankrupt. “Yesterday we didn’t have a single ruble, and just a couple thousand dol- lars,” Anatoly I. Kolesov, the “chief of mission” of the Russian Olympic Com- mittee in Atlanta, said at a news confer- ence Wednesday. Kolesov ticked off a string of accumu- lated problems, most of them left over from the breakup of the Soviet Union, but in the end he optimistically predicted enough funds somehow will be collected. “T think about $150 million would be enough to prepare our athletes from the present moment until the Olympics. That would be normal,” he said when asked how much he wants to raise. “But we can squeeze it out with half that much. Al- though we won't be able to develop the science and medicine, the things that are suffering most of all.” Kolesov said the Russian committee has agreements with the country’s lead- ing sports federations to conduct train- ing in the year leading up to the Summer Games, but at the moment it cannot pay the federations. “We are having a very serious pause in the organization of the training proc- ess,” he said. The Russian Olympic Committee is working with the National Sports Feder- ation to come up with funding, but Kole- sov would not say exactly what is planned and referred to remaining “technical problems.” In the Soviet era, the government fi-, nanced sports federations that ran pro- grams virtually down to the neighbor- hood level to recognize and train the best young athletes in the country. The disso- lution of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended that central funding as well as reduced the huge field from which Soviet athletes were plucked. However, the Russians linked re- sources with most of the other republics that split from the Soviet Union to send a unified team to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. This time, each country is go- ing it alone. Several times, Kolesov mentioned science and medicine as acute deficien- cies in overall training, saying Russia has advanced scientific training methods available, but no money for the equip- ment and personnel needed to imple- ment them. And the health of athletes generally is inferior to that of competitors in 1988 and 1992, he added, with young Russians today suffering twice the rate of Oe general illness and sports-related he problems. “We cannot carry out regular medi- cal checkups four or five times a year,” he lamented. “At best we conduct these medical checkups once a year,” The Russian committee has appealed for government financing to President Boris Yeltsin and to the cabinet led by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. “So far we haven’t gotten a ruble,” he said, citing other countries like France or Norway where, he said, the govern- ment supports 70 percent or more of Olympic preparation costs. “As I said, yesterday we had nothing. But there will be,” Kolesov said. “We are optimists,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 13, 1995 \f"

The combination of developments raised new doubts about the Russian president's physical condition after his emergency hos- pitalization Tuesday for treatment of a sud- denly worsened heart condition. Yeltsin’s wife made an extremely rare public appearance Friday, calling media ac- counts of his heart trouble “verbal sadism” and proclaiming the president to be in a nor- mal state of health, Despite Ms. Yeltsin’s assurances, the Kremlin announced that Yeltsin will not be released from the elite Central Clinical Hos- pital on Monday, as originally expected, and will probably remain hospitalized until the end of next week. Press Secretary Sergei Medvedev also said a trip scheduled for next week to Nor- way and to Murmansk in Russia’s far north was being postponed on the recommendation of Yeltsin’s doctors. Hours after Yeltsin was admitted to the hospital Tuesday, Medvedev had said the president was fine and that the trip would go ahead as planned. Comments from Yeltsin’s wife were sig- nificant because she seldom appears in pub- lic and even more rarely is quoted. On Fri- day, television cameras were permitted to follow her to a psychiatric hospital for chil- dren, where she delivered a composed de- fense of her husband and an attack on the media between comforting visits to the patients, Mrs. Yeltsin said her husband was work- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 15, 1995 ing when she saw him in the hospital Friday, and she accused the media of running “all Kinds of false reports on the president's health condition,” according to the indegen- dent news agency Interfax, Various government officials, including Prime Minister Victor Chermonyrdin, have told Russian media that they have consulted with Yeltsin about government affairs’ by telephone since his hospitalization and'that he is in full command of the presidency, ; Medvedev felt compelled to underscore Friday that Yeltsin is keeping up with world events and has control over the “nuclear but- ton,” the red alert communication system that has followed him into the huge hospital complex on the western outskirts of Moscow. One key bit of business to which Yeltsin tended Friday was signing a decree setting parliamentary elections for Dec, 17, \f"

Immediately after his hospitalization July 11, aides said he would be released within several days and would fulfill.a schedule that included a state visit to Norway. On Monday, the Kremlin said doctors wanted’ Yeltsin not only to stay until the end of this week, but then to enter a sanitarium for additional treatment of undeter- mined duration. Hig release was postponed again Friday until at least after the weekend. Yeltsin’s press sec- retary, Sergei Medvedev, told the official ITAR-Tass news agency that he would then go to a sanitarium outside Moscow. e president is recover- ing,” said Sergei Filatov, Yelt- sin *s chief of staff. “When curing heart attacks and preventing their consequences, physicians strictly abide by the treatment methods, which are rather com- plicated.” Yeltsin, 64, was hospitalized for what was described original- ly as “‘acute” heart ischemia, a condition in which narrowed ar- teries produce blood pressure fluctuations. In the West, such illnesses are sometimes treated by drugs and sometimes by sur- gical procedures. Though Yeltsin’s release has been put off, there was no indica- condition had worsened. Prime Minister Victor Cher- nomyrdin, who would take over immediately if Yeltsin were to die, spent the day campaigning and meeting local officials in the Siberian city of Tyumen, 1,200 miles east of Moscow. Filatov was 800 miles south of Moscow in the Stavropol region. “‘We must ensure full recov- ery of the president, bearing in mind we have a hard year ahead, a year of two election campaigns — that of the parliament and the president,” Filatov said. Filatov said part of Yeltsin’s problem is that he has been un- able to take a “‘complete vaca- tion” in recent months. “Every time his vacation has been broken by some political developments, and the president Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 22, 1995 has had to get down to work with- out having enough rest,” Filatov said. The Interfax news agency re- ported that during the day, Yelt- sin signed an order to “perfect” the Russian tax system. Aides said the purpose was to stimulate investment and streamline tax collections, but details were not released. As the president was recu- perating, the evening TV news reported that Russian and Che- chen peace negotiators meeting in the Chechen capital of Grozny were making progress in talks to end the Chechnya war. Mean- while, the Russian parliament was winding up a six-month ses- sion and preparing to leave Mos- cow for a two-month break. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Yeltsin released from hospital after days By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service writer MOSCOW - President Boris Yeltsin was released from a Moscow hospital Monday and promptly was taken by mo- torcade to recuperate in a sanitarium near here. Thirteen days after he was hospital- ized with a heart condition, Yeltsin, 64, was well enough to name the deputy chief of Kremlin’s security guards as di- rector of Russia’s internal intelligence agency, After arriving at the Barvikha sani- tarium west of the capital, Yeltsin met with his newly appointed chief of coun- terintelligence, Col. Gen. Mikhail Bar- sukov, television reports said. Aides said Yeltsin would recuperate under doctors’ supervision at the sprawl- ing sanitarium, once reserved for senior Communist Party officials. They gave no indication how long he planned to stay. Yeltsin was hospitalized July 11. Symp- toms described by the Kremlin suggested that Yeltsin had a form of heart disease called unstable angina, in which nar- rowing of arteries diminishes the blood supply to the heart, The Associated Press reported.The heart trouble renewed spec- ulation about Yeltsin's health. Sergei Medvedev, the president’s press secretary, again tried to calm those fears.‘‘The president is feeling well,”’ he said. Public Television showed Prime Min- ister Viktor Chernomyrdin presenting Yeltsin with flowers inside the Central Clinical Hospital, then Yeltsin's motor- cade speeding away through the hospital gate. The 48-year-old Barsukov will take over the largest branch of the former KGB, replacing the former boss Sergei Stepashin, who was fired on June 30 af- ter Yeltsin decided he bore a major share of the blame for mishandling last month's Speer hostage crisis in southern Rus- sia. The new head of the Federal Security Service has never worked in counterin- telligence, but Yeltsin regards him as brave, ruthless and utterly loyal. In his autobiography, Yeltsin praised Barsukov for managing to cajole the hesitant com- mandos of the Alpha and Vympel anti-ter- rorist squads to storm rebel parliamen- tarians in October 1993, thus narrowly al: lowing Yeltsin to cling to power. Barsukov will be in a position to wield great political leverage on Yeltsin's behalf by controlling what is released from KGB security files about candidates in the parliamentary and presidential elections due over the next 11 months. With the country heading into the tra ditional August vacation period and par liament beginning a two-month recess, Yeltsin has no demanding appearances on his calendar until late September, when he is due to fly to New York for cer: emonies marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations and then a meeting with President Clinton.

        "ocr_text": "Russia, Chechnya end hostilities Defiant region still demanding independence By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL © Cox News Service MOSCOW — Russia reached an unsteady peace yesterday with mili- tary chieftains of Chechnya, whom it has failed to conquer in seven months of bloodletting. The agreement, signed early yes- terday morning in the bomb-devas- tated Chechen capital of Grozny, provides for an immediate end to hostilities, disengagement of forces and a program of disarming by Che- chen fighters that would be matched by a gradual pullout by Russian troops. Within a week, all prisoners are supposed to be exchanged. Then within an unspecified period, Che- chen fighters are obligated to sur- render most of their weapons, and Russia is to withdraw all but two brigades of occupying troops. Negotiators are to reconvene on Thursday to tackle the bedrock po- litical issue of Chechnya’s claim of independence, though it is land- locked within Russia. Signaling political flexibility, dep- uty Russian negotiator Arkady Volsky publicly advocated putting Chechnya’s future status on hold until after Chechens elect a new government in free elections this fall. ‘Naturally, some sort of special status for Chechnya is possible,” Volsky said. Doubts remained in both Russian and Chechen negotiating teams about the durability of the military disengagement. “Disarmament and withdrawal of forces will go ahead with great diffi- culty, because there are powers on both sides interested in prolonging the conflict,” said Aslan Maskha- dov, the chief of the Chechen mili- tary general staff. Echoing him, Russian negotiator and Interior Minister Anatoly Kula- kov said, “the agreement on the block of military questions will not be met with delight either in Grozny, or in the mountains, or even in Moscow.” But Kulakov, who commanded Russian Interior and Army troops on the Chechen front until President Boris Yeltsin elevat- ed him to his cabinet last month, captured the mood on both sides when he said, “More than anyone else, the soldiers felt the senseless- ness of continuing the war.” If the new deal holds, it means Yeltsin will have achieved his key strategic objective in the war: Rus- sia has managed to reassert military control over the oil pipeline com- plex and railroad network centered in Grozny after driving the rebels into the hills. Yet Chechen nationalists will also regard the agreement as avoidance of Russian subjugation. On a symbolic level, Russia was forced to grant a measure of recog- nition to Chechnya’s claim to sover- eignty by having to make peace with a delegation that says it repre- sents the independent “Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.” Louisville Courier-Journal - July 31, 1995 \f"

Shevardnadze, 67, helped turn the Soviet Union away from communism as Soviet foreign minister in the late 1980s. He re- turned to lead his native Georgia, a former Soviet republic, in 1992 after its first elected president, the late Zwviad Gamsakhurdia, was ousted in a coup. Shevard- madze is chairman of the Geor- gian Parliament. He was shown sitting dazed in his undershirt after the explo- sion, his face bloodied by lacer- ations. He was leaving the Par- liament building and was cut by glass shards from the explosion mear a waiting motorcade. The explosion injured at least six other people, according to the independent Russian news ser- vice Interfax, but no deaths were reported. The blast destroyed a car in Shevardnadze’s motorcade and It also five other cars nearby. shattered all the windows on one side of the Parliament building, including those of Shevard- madze’s suite of offices. Russian television showed oily black smoke billowing from the center of Tbilisi and several vehicles in ames. Shevardnadze has been try- img to restore stability in Geor- gia, which has been torn apart by rising crime and a separatist re- bellion. Once Georgia’s Communist- era boss, Shevardnadze has made many enemies as he has tried to dilute the power of war- lords and secessionists. Im recent months, however, he ordered the country’s main Paramilitary group, the Mekhe- arioni, to disarm and pushed through a new constitution. He was en route to a ceremo- my to sign the new constitution, recently adopted by Parliament, when the bomb went off. The mew constitution will give who- ever is the new Geo presi- dent broad powers, and Shevard- madze is a expected to be a lead- ing presidential candidate in November elections.

The center hopes to open a shelter for battered women. Russian rape victims face uphill fight to gain help Most police are -reluctant to pursue eases against assailants. “By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT se £30 Moscow — Nina Alexan- _drovna took a rare and bold step for a Russian woman this sum- Mner: She called Moscow’s only -rape hotline and delivered an an- +guished description of being sex- ually assaulted. Unfortunately for Nina Alex- androvna, she now is 47 and was _ Faped at age 21. This was the first time she had ever told anyone about the crime, and even now she would not give her last name. --,.- **fAre you still afraid of men?’’ ‘gounselor Tatyana Yegorova asked. She talked to Nina Alexan- -drovna about nightmares and “fears, recovery and hope. *‘“Our main task is to make people talk. The sorrow must get out,’? Yegorova told a visitor af- ter hanging up. There isn’t much for a Rus- sian woman to do except talk if she has been raped or physicaHhy abused, especially if the attacker is someone she knows. Police usually discourage rape prosecu- tion, and even getting medical treatment is difficult. Russian women traditionally have been punching bags on which men vent their anger, as attested by the women seen on city streets with black eyes or bruised, puffy faces. Murder statistics reflect the depth of the problem. The Social Security Ministry in June report- ed that about 15,000 Russian women were murdered last year by their husbands or companions, an increase of about 1,000 over : 1993. That accounts for nearly half the murders nationwide. Syostri (Sisters), a grass- roots feminist group with no po- litical ties, started the Moscow Center For Victims of Sexual Abuse about a year ago. Syostri tries to reach women before they become part of the slaughter. The group received 2,000 calls in the first year. Women Phone not only about sexual as- saults but also batterings, sex ha- rassment at work and other ills that are crimes in the West, but not necessarily here. *“There is no law in Russia on Gomestic violence,’’ said Tatyana Lipowvskaya, 40, coordinator of the center. ; : The women at Syostri say there is no shelter for battered women in Russia, though they are hoping to open one here by year’s end. At this stage, howev- er, even their rape hotline is open only from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Their center is a one-room of- fice on the edge of town, furnished with one phone line, a fax ma- chine, five spindly plants and shelves filled with books on wom- en’s issues, almost all of them English editions sent by support- ers abroad or brought back from trips to the United States. Two lawyers and several gyne- cologists handle referrals for free. The center is opening a treatment offjce in a Moscow hospital, but it will be staffed by a paid physician only one day a week. The Ameri- can Medical Center, a western clinic, just agreed to provide free treatment for 60 referrals a year from Syostri. Lola Karimova, the center’s doctor, said a rape victim is de- nied medical follow-up treat- ment in a public clinic without a registration form. To get it she must report the rape to police and a doctor must find evidence of rape. “In only 3 percent of the cases have women been able to obtain [medical] help,’’ she said. She estimated that in 8 percent o rape victims end up pregnant and that 14 percent contract a sexually-transmitted disease. If the woman has changed clothes or showered since the as- sault, it is almost impossible to ob- tain the medical statement that will permit her to prosecute a case or be treated, Yegorova said.

It has nearly three times as many bears as inhabit Ameri- ca’s Yellowstone National Park ecosystem. But poachers and legal hunt- ers, especially rich foreigners who pay to bag the biggest bears, have Nikanorov worried about woodlands outside preserve boundaries that are now acces- sible. “These big fat guys come here in the spring,’’ he said. “There’s no way they could hunt a bear.

Nearly a dozen bears, including a sow with three cubs, could be seen running frantically from the chopper’s screech on a recent flight into the preserve.

Other- wise they will turn to politics.” Russian feminists are bearing out Komsomolskaya Pravda’s warning as they shoulder their way into male- . dominated terrain — legislative bod- ies, business and government offices — where satisfaction has not much been parceled out to women. Like women worldwide, Russians are struggling to grab power levers long wielded by men, trying to crack barriers denying them equal oppor- tunities for work, education and con- trol of their lives and bodies. But progress is slow. The percentage of women elected to national parliaments worldwide has dropped by nearly 25 percent in the past seven years, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, largely because former Soviet bloc countries have eliminated the com- munist system of quotas for women in their rubber-stamp parliaments. Women throughout the world hold just 14 percent of administrative and managerial jobs, according to the International Labor Organization. The timing in Russia is crucial as the country makes the transition to a free market democracy. “They said first we have to solve the issues of economic and political reform. Then we can solve the prob- lems of women,” said Elena Kotchki- na, a sociologist at the Moscow Cen- ter for Gender Studies. “But once that is done, it will be too late.” Two-thirds of the registered 2.5 million people left unemployed by economic restructuring are women.

Russia is one of the rare countries with a women’s political party, Women of Russia, which defied expectations in 1993 by winning 23 seats in the Duma and propelling its leader to deputy speaker. It ran for parliament on a socialist platform, but now pays more attention to spe- cifically women’s issues, such as writing an equal protection law. “The democratic society which we are trying to reach must be a society of equal rights, equality in opportu- nity and of partnership,” said Taty- ana Malutina, president of the Asso- ciation of Women Entrepreneurs, a founder of Women of Russia. She doesn’t expect much help from men. “They remember us on the 8th of March,” she said, referring to Women’s Day in Russia, “and they love us before elections.” Marcia Kunstel is a Cox News Service bondent based in Moscow. \f"

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oo Gold Mine, Russia — In one of the most remote valleys on earth, miners from the United States and Russia are teaming up for what could become a 2ist-century Klondike — a billion-dollar gold deposit buried beneath the Russian permafrost. The Americans here are trying hard to contain their excitement. The more they learn of previously secret Russian geological explorations in the area, the more convinced they become that this forbidding and fragile region could be the world’s frontier for natural riches over the next half-century. “Tt is like standing on the banks of the Mississippi in 1849 and looking west,” said Kenneth Puchlik, chief exploration geologist with Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. of Englewood, Colo. The difference, Puchlik added, is this time “you already know where everything is.” Cyprus Amax has a 50 percent stake in the Kubaka mine project and is the first foreign company since the 1917 Communist revolution to win permission to share in the mining of Russian gold, To get to Kubaka, you fly east from JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Staff Construction under way: A worker welds a joint on a pipeline at the site of a Russian-American gold mine in Kubaka, Russia.

Then you bump up- country on a bus for 13 hours, When the dirt road stops, you helicopter another 200 miles across an untracked moonscape of tundra mountains and shimmering swamps. When the Russian MI-8 helicopter sets down on the Western-built helipad, you step out into a strangely luxurious work camp, The 180 Russian workers ride enormous earth-moving machinery, overseen by six expatriate Americans and Canadians, When they aren’t working, the workers can enjoy hot showers and gourmet meals whipped up three times a day by a resident French chef. There’s even a billiard parlor. Once full-scale mining begins late next year, the mossy hillside above the camp will slowly vanish as giant excavators begin carving an open-pit mine 250 yards deep and 700 yards compared with the richest gold fields i the world,” said Russian mining engineer Ilya Rosenblum, head of the Russian-American concern developing the mine. ' Rosenblum estimates that over the . next 15 years, the hillside will yield 100 tons of pure gold — the equivalent, he said, to half the gold that has ever been mined in Alaska. At current world prices, 100 tons of gold is worth $1.2 billion. Getting it out of the permafrost zone, just 200 miles below the Arctic Circle, is not going to be easy. During the five coldest months, workers must travel a “winter road” of packed snow and ice to haul in food, diesel fuel and building supplies. In temperatures down to minus 67 Fahrenheit, a trip across the 250-mile winter road can take 22 hours. Transportation is even more difficult after the top layer of permafrost melts in May. Then, workers and supply crews must use helicopters through seasonal fog hanks that shroud the area.

The speaker of the lower house, Ivan Rybkin, called on the prosecutor general to investigate the conduct of Zhirinovsky, whose quaintly named Liberal Democratic Party of Russia won the second-largest bloc in the last parliamentary election two years ago. Slow-motion study of the videotape showed that Zhirinovsky grabbed the arm of Yevgenia Tish-kovskaya, a political moderate, and dragged her toward him. She responded with a left and a right to Zhirinovsky’s Ee chest, despite the im efforts of two im male colleagues to separate them. Zhirinovsky slipped behind the slim 47-year-old woman and put his arm around her neck. As hot words flew between them, Zhirinovsky released his grip and started walking away. But then after more words, Zhirinovsky grabbed a fistful of ZHIRINOVSKY Tishkovskaya’s hair and pulled her off balance. 7 It all started decorously enough on Saturday with an “emergency” session on NATO’s bombing in Bosnia. One of Zhirinovsky’s hot- tempered allies blew up when he saw a leading democratic deputy, former orthodox priest Gleb Yakunin, Ottawa Citizen - wearing his ankle-length cassock on the floor of the State Duma. Zhirinovsky ally Nikolai Lysenko shouted at Yakunin that he had no right to wear a cassock and a Russian Orthodox cross. Lysenko then seized Yakunin’s heavy silver cross and pulled it off Yakunin’s neck. Seeing the struggle from across the floor, Tishkovskaya and a few male delegates hurried to help Yakunin. Tishkovskaya pursued Lysenko down an aisle, grabbing at his arm in what appears an effort to reclaim Yakunin’s cross from Lysenko. Then Zhirinovsky can be seen striding up -behind Tishkovskaya and jerking her backwards by the arm. Next came her punches, his hammerlock and his hair-grab.

By paeet Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — A rocket-pro- pelled grenade fired by un- identified assailants slammed into the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday on the eve of a visit to Moscow by a senior Clinton administration official to tack- le a bitter Russian-American dispute over NATO air strikes in Bosnia. None of the scores of Amer- ican diplomats inside was hurt when the shoulder-launched projectile arced across 12 lanes of Moscow traffic and punched through the heavy exterior wall of the Stalin-era embassy building. The grenade wrecked a copying machine and smashed interior windows on the fifth and sixth floors, but nothing caught fire. A small band of U.S. Ma- rines donned combat helmets to guard the embassy in the wake of the attack. Moscow po- lice were put on red alert and Russian authorities promised they would move swiftly to ap- prehend those responsible. The episode cast a cloud over the planned visit Thurs- day of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. He is seeking to calm tempers in President Boris Yeltsin’s gov- ernment following two weeks of U.S.-inspired NATO bomb and missile attacks on Serb tar- gets in Bosnia. U.S. officials took pains to Praise Russian authorities for their handling of the investiga- tion and said there was no evi- dence to link the attack to Rus- Sian anger over the NATO bombing campaign. *“The Russian authorities --- responded immediately and have provided excellent coop- eration,’” embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said. ‘‘They have increased security for the American Embassy, and the embassy has taken its own measures.”’ In Washington, State De- partment spokesman Nicholas Burns added, ‘‘Whoever perpe- trated this crime was either sick or a zealot. And I certainly don’t believe that one ought to associate the Russian govern- ment with this act.’’ The daring attack occurred in daylight along one of central Moscow’s busiest avenues. No one claimed responsibility. Determined to show the Americans a_ get-tough re- sponse to the assault, Russian police and intelligence agen- cies announced a citywide se- curity crackdown. Under the red alert, called ‘‘Plan Sirena,”’’ police have a free hand to make warrantless searches of any house or car. “There is no kidding. with such things. This was an act of terror on an_interngational scale,’’ the Interfax news agen- cy quoted an official fram an unidentified secret service as saying.

But unlike Russia, those richer nations are not suffering a net population de- cline, because their people live longer. Antonov believes the Russian birthrate may drop to 1.0, based on polling of young adults. Most alarming is the dramat- ic increase in deaths of men ages 30 to 50, which has pulled down male life expectancy from the 1991 average of 63.5 years to an astonishing 57.7 last year. Problems aggravated Antonov blames alcohol and drug abuse, long-term problems newly exacerbated by stress. Deaths from alcohol poisoning increased by 24 percent last year. Suicides grew 10 percent. Murder is another cause, related again to alcohol but also to grow- ing crime. Smoking remains widely accepted. Women are affected, too. They have seen their life expec- tancy average drop by three years since 1991, from 74.3 to 71.3. As sanitation and health ser- vices deteriorate, diseases from measles to diphtheria to syphilis have re-emerged. The Russian Education Min- istry reported that 35 percent of last year’s arriving first-graders needed immediate medical treat- ment, and it predicted that by the year 2000 only 5 percent of the graduates will be considered healthy. Many will be candidates for early death. So far, the extent of the popu- lation decline has been masked by immigration, mostly of ethnic Russians from neighboring na- tions like Ukraine and Kazakh- stan that became independent when the Soviet Union dissolved. “At the moment we still have an opportunity to solve this prob- lem not within the framework of totalitarian methods, but on the basis of free democratic meth- ods, in which people have a choice,”’ Antonov said. “Unfortunately, neither busi- ness nor the government shows any interest, so in these terms, the situation is getting worse po- litically, and in 10 years I foresee a lot of complications.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 24, 1995 \f"

One of the revealing findings was that 52 percent said the Rus- sian economy should be returned to centralized state control. The more than 4,000 Rus- sians polled voiced clear disen- chantment with their political leaders and institutions, not just their living conditions, giving credence to the survey’s assess- ment that current officeholders are in trouble. If public sentiment remains so sour, December's parliamen- tary elections may well produce a large majority of deputies in opposition to President Boris Yeltsin and to the continuation of economic reform. Yeltsin himself drew disap- proval from 69 percent of those polled, and approval of only 21 percent. Eighty-three percent of the respondents said they believe official corruption is common- place, while 60 percent said elected officials are only inter- ested in helping themselves. Results showed 65 percent believe the political situation will be the same or worse in the next couple years, and 66 percent feel economic conditions will not improve, Commenting on the bleak pessimism, Anna Andreenkova of the Russian polling institute said, “It’s something that is so- cially desirable right now, to de- cide that you are dissatisfied with the situation in Russia.” The poll was conducted for the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a Washing- ton-based nonprofit foundation which has been advising Russia’s Central Election Commission. . In the face-to-face survey conducted across Russia in July, poll takers asked “Are you satis- fied with the situation in the Rus- sian Federation today?” Of ,re- spondents, 4 percent replied “very satisfied,” 4 percent said “somewhat satisfied, ” 12 percent said “somewhat dissatisfied,” and 75 percent said “very dissat- isfied.” The other 5 percent had no opinion.

His shoes were new, he wore an imported leather jacKet and these days he doesn’t have to wait in lines to buy food. “It isn’t just a matter of money,” he said. “Our whole sys- tem has been destroyed.” Markin typifies millions of dis- enchanted yet fairly well-off Rus- sians who are up for grabs in na- tionwide parliamentary elections due on Dec. 17 and then presiden- tial elections expected in June 1996. The extent of their frustration was reflected in a new nation- wide poll, financed by the U.S. Agency for International Devel- opment, which found that 75 per- cent of adults said they were “very dissatisfied” with the situation in Russia and another 12 percent said “somewhat dissatisfied.” Though almost nobody here saw a future for communism following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the same poll found that “a system where the state controls much of the economy” is now de- sired by 52 percent of Russians. “The electorate is drifting in a nos- talgic direction, generally toward the opposition,” contended Dmitry Olshansky, another Moscow-based public opinion analyst. Olshansky said a Communist- led coalition of left-wing and pa- triotic-nationalist factions could wind up occupying as many as two-thirds of the seats in the new State Duma. By his projections, the Communist Party alone might gain as many as 20 percent of the Duma seats — double its strength in the current parliament. Already there have been two sur- prise Communist victories in local elections in the so-called “Red Belt” — the string of depressed cities along Russia’s western and south- ern periphery where military and other factories have shut down. The most decisive came Sunday in Volgograd, an industrial city 600 miles to the west, when the Com- munists won 20 of the 24 seats in the city legislature. Despite its choking air pollution, Magnitogorsk is too well off eco- nomically to fit the “Red Belt” pro- file. But the Communists are show- ing modest signs of a revival. Two years ago, pro-Yeltsin re- formers swept Magnitogorsk in the State Duma elections and the Communists were too weak to field a candidate. This time, the Communists have a nominee — and the city’s incumbent Duma But now, mirroring the new image of the national Communist Party leadership in Moscow, the Commu- nist who runs the party in Magni- togorsk is a fresh figure who sounds like a moderate Swedish socialist. “We are not for the dictatorship of the proletariat, we are for a dic- tatorship of laws,” said the city’s party chief, Sergei Ivanov, 37, a welder at the steel mill and one of 140 leaders of the national Com- munist Party central committee. Ivanov said that if the Commu- nists manage to return to power, they will not try to confiscate the private property amassed by Rus- sians after the Soviet system col- lapsed in 1991. Instead, he said, Russia would return to a mixture of public and private ownership similar to what revolutionary Vladimir Lenjn ‘introduced be- tween 1922 and 1928 under the so- called New Economic Policy.

The company’s 14 security guards don’t just scout for terror- ists as they eyeball passengers, the ground crew and the aircraft itself whenever a Delta plane is on the tarmac at Sheremetyevo-2 air- port. They also watch for thieves with a penchant for looting airlin- ers and fancy foreign bags.

The Russians are under- staffed, underpaid and _ill- equipped, often leaving passen- gers cooling their heels an hour or longer in immigration and customs lines.

The travel agency, Atlantic Travel, sells tickets on any air- line, books hotels and reserves cars worldwide, services easily available through only a few other agencies in Moscow, such as American Express.

Perhaps the greatest service for Russians is an experiment in which travel agencies can apply to the U.S. Embassy for visas on behalf of their Russian clients.

        "ocr_text": ": <— HIGH-LEVEL TALKS -. Russia still ma buuld nuclear plant for Cuba Despite threats from the U.S. Congress to cut foreign aid, the pisiect> completion not been shelved. By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT » Mioscow — A high-level dele- gation left Moscow for Cuba on Tuesday to sign an agreement for completion of a Russian-built nu- clear power plant in Cuba’s Cien- fuegos province. The mission, led by First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets, Provides proof that the Russians have not decided to shelve the project, despite threats by the U.S. Congress to cut foreign aid to Russia if Moscow resumes work on the Cuban nuclear plant. Soskovets is to meet with Cu- ban leader Fidel Castro, armed forces minister Raul Castro and other officials for talks on the nu- clear plant as well as trade and debt issues, Russian news ser- vices reported. Soskovets’ itinerary includes a tour of the huge steel and con- crete skeleton of the Juragua plant, which has lain dormant and corroding since Moscow cut off funding following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The half-finished power station is 240 miles south of Miami. As envisioned, the plant would consist of two Russian- -made nuclear reactors that could go on line as early as 1999 and generate 15 percent of Cuba’s electricity. Soskovets, who is nominally the third-ranking figure in the Russian executive branch, has close ties to Russia’s big factory bosses and is a trusted ally of President Boris Yeltsin. By some recent published accounts, Yelt- sin is maneuvering to elevate Soskovets to prime minister. The Russian-Cuban talks are expected to center on how debt- plagued Cuba can pay to finish the plant. Moscow says Cuba al- ready owes Russia $18 billion, and cost estimates for getting the Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 11, 1995 power station working have ranged from $300 million to $800 million. Miooscow is prepared to supply a type of reactor known as the VVER-440, which has been de- scribed at U.S. Nuclear Regula- tory Commission hearings as in- herently safer than the Russian reactor type that exploded in 1986 at Chernobyl in the Ukraine. Even so, the State Depart- ment has voiced concern about “the absence of safeguards”? at the plant and complained that Cuba has not signed a binding commitment to accept interna- tional inspection. But when State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns was asked five months ago whether he thought Cuba was seeking a nuclear weapons capability, he replied, ‘“‘No, I’m not saying that.”” The Havana discussions are expected to include representa- tives of the German firm Sie- mens, which has proposed to supply a sophisticated $250 mil- lion computer system to help Cu- ban control room operators avoid accidents. : Neither Russia nor Cuba can afford to pay Siemens for the control system, acknowledged Eduard Akopyan, an official of Russia’s Ministry of Atomic En- ergy. But he expressed hope that Siemens and the German gov- ernment would team up to pro- vide ‘a convertible currency credit to supply this equipment.’’ At a Moscow briefing last month, Akopyan also disclosed that the Russian government was considering ‘‘credits’’ of its own to enable Cuba to pay for the Russian-made reactors and oth- er equipment. \f"

Alex- ander Lebed, a rising political star. dissatisfaction in the officers’ corps over lack of housing and the low status of the army in post-Soviet Russia. To Western ears, Lebed’s words sound like a newsreel of the 1950s. But to many Russians disillusioned after the pain of market reform and the shrinking of their empire, Lebed’s message is clear and soothing. **This is how the world is or- ganized: It was based, it is based and it will be based on force,’’ he said, clinching a hamlike fist for emphasis. To restore the Russian army, Lebed said he would sharply re- duce the number of Russia’s con- ventional ground force divisions, explaining that most units are understaffed and unready to fight. **Let’s have 10 times fewer,”’ he said. ‘‘We must have a small, mobile army under the protec- tion of the nuclear shield.”’ To rectify Moscow’s ‘“blun- der”’ of sending unprepared troops into the southern republic of Chechnya 11 months ago, he said he would “quickly with- draw’”’ Russian forces and the ethnic Russian minority living there. Then he would cut off all Russian money aimed at rebuild- ing war damage and let the Che- chens fend for themselves with ““economic independence.” On the domestic front, Lebed said the country must find “a third way, a Russian way’”’ to re- Place Soviet-style socialism and the disorienting market reforms of the Yeltsin era. He does not see much value in Western investments in Rus- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - Sia’s economy. “Will you show me a place that became better thanks to your investments?’”’ he asked. One school of thought holds that if the team of Lebed and Sko- kov scores well in the parliamen- tary election, Yeltsin will try to co-opt them, naming Skokov as prime minister and Lebed as de- femse minister. But others say Lebed has his sights on the Kremlin and will spend the ensu- | ing six months campaigning for. the presidency, regardless of overtures from Yeltsin. Lebed has never lacked am- bition. At 16 his attempt to enlist asa Soviet pilot was rejected because he had smashed his nose in ama- teur boxing competitions. After two nose operations, he entered Paratrooper school at 19. A barrel-chested 6-footer, he spent 23 of the next 26 years asa Paratroop officer. He was a rough-hewn soldier’s soldier, winning decorations for bravery while commanding a battalion in the Afghanistan war. He was first thrown into big- time politics as the Soviet regime was collapsing.

Yeltsin is trailing an even longer list of difficult disputes than the two leaders had to vent during their last, only marginally productive, summit in Moscow back in May. The NATO military alliance’s embrace of Moscow’s former Eastern European allies, coupled with deep divisions over Bosnia, are the main points of conten- tion. “It’s not a cold war yet, but the quantity of unresolved problems is escalating every month,” said military expert Pavel Felgen- hauer in a column in the Moscow Times. The mainline newspaper Jzves- tia warned that even though rela- tions are not “bad,” no “new friendship” cements the two nations, “The most unpleasant thing is that in both capitals there is a perception that one day, for some petty reason, everything could be — worse,” the newspaper That both governments still value the notion of working together will be demonstrated at Fort Riley, Kan., where U.S. and Russian troops will conduct rare joint military exercises as the two leaders meet 1,200 miles away. Joint force The most immediate hurdle Clinton and Yeltsin face is how to run a joint NATO-Russian peace- keeping force — which will include up to 25,000 Americans — that is supposed to hit the ground in Bosnia if a peace pact is signed. The Russians don’t want their troops subordinate to NATO command, but NATO is adamant that it will not share decision- making in the peacekeeping operation. That’s one piece of a bigger problem. A U.S.-dominated military alli- ance rumbling across Bosnia or anyplace else in Europe is anath- ema to the Russians. That is dou- bly so with NATO moving perilously close to Russia’s bor- ders by considering membership for Eastern European nations. Russia’s generals recently leaked the news that they are fig- uring coordinates to retarget their nuclear missiles on Poland and the Czech Republic should the two agree to allow North Atlantic Treaty Organization nuclear weapons to be based on Dayton Daily News - their soil as alliance members. At a Moscow news conference Thursday, Yeltsin declared Rus- sia would not allow NATO to deploy nuclear weapons in East- ern Europe, though he added he thought he could resolve the issue at his meeting with Clinton. A high-ranking Russian delega- tion traveled to Cuba last week to resurrect dormant ties by, among other things, discussing how to resume construction of a nuclear reactor. Russian com- mentators interpret the visit as one counterpoint to NATO’s eastward march. There’s even talk by some that Russia should look to China to form a military alliance. The most pro-Western figure in Moscow, soft-spoken Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, is widely speculated to be on his way out, and Yeltsin has done nothing to blunt talk of his pend- ing ouster. “I’m still dissatisfied with his work,” Yeltsin said Thursday. Spared a decision Kozyrev may spare Yeltsin from deciding. He is running for parliament and will be ineligible to continue as foreign minister if he wins. Yeltsin himself has chided the Europeans for letting themselves “be dictated to from beyond the ocean.” He proposed a big- powers meeting in Moscow or October 22, another European city to resolve the Bosnia war, but the United States will be hosting peace talks among the three warring parties at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. It was “a diplomatic defeat” for Yeltsin that the United States played the decisive role in achiev- ing the Bosnia cease-fire that made the talks possible, said Viadimir Lukin, chairman of parliament’s International Affairs Committee and a former ambas- sador to the United States. And that brings to light one of the biggest obstacles to coopera- tion in both countries: domestic politics. Russians are jockeying for sup- port in parliamentary elections in December, which will be followed by presidential elections six months later. The most popular theme is Yeltsin-bashing, fol- lowed by diatribes against the United States and NATO. In the United States, the 1996 presidential and congressional campaign already influences the Clinton administration’s decision- making. Russia has been a conve- nient target of critics for months for its stand on NATO, for its ties with the Bosnia Serbs and for building nuclear reactors for Iran and now possibly Cuba. Domestic political consider- ations leave both Yeltsin and Clinton little room to make concessions. 1995 \f"

        "ocr_text": " By MARCIA KUNSTEL snd JOSEPH ALBRIGHT COX NEWS SERVICE TBILISI, Georgia — There are signs of sprouting statehood in Georgia, and they are largely the doing of the country’s genteel strongman, Eduard Shevard- nadze, the onetime Soviet foreign minister who has led his home- land since 1992. Incomes are ridiculously low — three or four dollars a month — and people face another winter in - icy, lightless apartments. But a proliferation of newspa- pers and political parties are free to scream about it without fear of political retribution. Gun-lugging thugs’ no longer walk the streets. The economy is starting a feeble recovery. Democratic elections are ‘set for Nov. 5. Shevardnadze’s friends some- times worry he has resorted to autocracy to help preserve the country’s fragile democracy. But they fear Georgia could not last otherwise. “I think sometimes he plays ‘not according to the rules,” said Alexander Rondeli, a Shevard- nadze adviser. “But ‘do the people against him play by the rules?” Obviously not. Shevardnadze, 67, was almost blown up Aug. 29 File photo Narrow escape Bodyguards surround Eduard Saovardnedec on Aug. 30, a day after an attempt ... on his life. He’s given much of the_credit for keeping democraey alive in once chaotic Georgia. by a remote-controlled car bomb in an unsuccessful assassination attempt outside Parliament, which he leads as head of state. In response, the government arrested more than 250 people allied to Shevardnadze’s political opponents, including leading members of two paramilitary groups. Prosecutors gave out un- documented hints that the guilt extended to two of the most popu- lar candidates opposing Shevard- nadze in the president’s race. The opposition is crying foul,’ but Shevardnadze is adamant: that he plays fair. “For a country which only one- year ago was in chaos maybe it: would be more appropriate — a? more dictatorial regime. But we chose an absolutely different way,” he said in an interview. “There are more than 100 parties in Georgia. I don’t know whether there is any other small country that has as many parties as we have.” At the last minute, the snowy- haired communist-turned-re- formist canceled a trip to the United Nations this week. Sources said Shevardnadze felt it was nec- essary to concentrate on the elec- tion. Many world leaders see She- vardnadze as the man who urged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to set eastern Europe free. And Rochester (NY) Democrat and Chronicle-Sun - October 22, 1995 > Georgia they give him credit for his labors to wrench this small and ruggedly beautiful nation of 5.4 million peo- ple toward democracy. A late-summer poll showed two- thirds of Georgia's electorate back- ing Shevardnadze. The assassina- tion attempt has brought him more su “The only thing quite sure is that Shevardnadze will bring order to the system,” said Galina Alelishvili, 54, an unemployed accountant who now sells cigarettes at the central market in Tbilisi, the capital. She has found her corner at the market more secure since an earlier crack- down on crime. Order is paramount to Geor- gians, a remarkably resilient people who saw their capital awash in blood during a 1992 civil war follow- ing independence from the Soviet Union. The battered victors asked Shevardnadze to come back from Moscow and pick up the pieces. Furthering the material and emotional ruin were two regional ethnic wars, at least one of them prolonged by covert military assis- tance from neighboring Russia. The fighting has stopped but the ethnic regions of Abkhazia and Southern Ossetia no longer are controlled trom Tbilisi, meaning Georgia has lost one-sixth of its territory. The best prospect for Georgia will be construction of an oil pipe- line through which a consortium of companies wants to export some Caspian Sea oil to Georgia’s Black Sea port of Batumi. The recent de- cision was a blo Russia, which wanted all the oil flowing through its pipeline. The pipeline is expected to bring Georgia tens of millions of dollars a year, but not for at least two years. For now people struggle for small incomes. Reselling goods she buys at a small, cheaper market nets Alelish- vili the equivalent of about $3 a day to support a family of five. Many. Georgians similarly hustle for cash, : because $3 at the market. is about equal to monthly pensions and of- ten to monthly salaries. “I feel like a beggar, sitting here selling these things,” said Alelish- vili. Yet she voiced a remarkable optimism that threaded through in- formal street interviews. “First of all there is stabilization. No fighting,” said medical student Alex Karateshvili, 25. “Second, there is hope among the people. They have hope now that they didn’t have before.” His family of five, including his wife and child, father and a brother, may not always have enough to eat, he said, but they are optimistic. In his aborted trip to the United States this week, Shevardnadze had been expected to discuss the pipe- line, one key to Georgia’s economic future. Clinton’s support was in- strumental in the decision to use both the Georgian and Russian pipelines for the Caspian oil and the Georgians are determined to keep that decision on track. “There are a lot of problems to be discussed for executing this pro- cess without any pain and without any complications among the states,” Shevardnadze said, antici- pating snags from the Russian side. “There is not only Georgia, or only Azerbaijan, or only let’s say Turkey. _ a barter basis two-thirds of Here the whole world is interested in the final discussion of this ques- tion in a normal and civilized form.” Sometime in: the’ future;.

        "ocr_text": " Yeltsin hospitalized for heart condition; | China trip canceled Sad Sontchn Cea STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Mioscow — President Boris Yeltsin was rushed to the hospi- tal Thursday for his second heart-related illness in three months, and his somber-faced chief of staff reported his condi- tion ‘“‘does not evoke great op- timism.”’ Last week Yeltsin seemed his old feisty, cantankerous self on a four-day visit to Paris and New York. But Thursday morning the 64-year-old leader was again af- flicted with heart symptoms and flown to a Moscow hospital by helicopter from a suburban state-owned country house where he was reportedly work- ing on documents. The episode was sufficiently serious and sudden that Kremlin aides immediately canceled plans for a Yeltsin visit to China in mid-November. Victor Ilyushin, Yeltsin’s chief of staff, promised a deci- sion today on whether Russia will go forward with plans to host a symbolically important meet- ing with the Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian leaders next Tues- day on the eve of the Balkan peace talks in Dayton, Ohio. *. “It is doubtful that he will re- turn to work in the immediate days ahead,’’ Ilyushin said after consulting with attending doc- tors at the Central Clinical Hos- pital. The aide said the “intellectu- al, physical and moral pressure’”’ of Yeltsin’s U.S. trip combined with jet lag and in-flight air pres- sure to exhaust the Russian pres- ident. Earlier the Kremlin press service issued a blander assess- ment, saying Yeltsin’s condition: was ‘‘less serious than it was in July’? after the first episode of what Russian doctors then called Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 27, 1995 -———— | ee oe acute myocardial ischemia.

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — A political sce- nario as unstable as Boris Yelt- sin’s malfunctioning heart began materializing here .Friday, as doctors said the hospitalized Russian president must undergo five weeks of intensive moni- toring. Despite announcing that Yeltsin still suffered unstable blood supply to his heart, and that doctors were keeping him in semi-isolation, Kremlin spokes- man Sergei Medvedev main- tained that no consideration had been given to transferring power from Yeltsin’s hands. “The president is in com- mand of information, and he re- ‘ceives it in due course, fast and qualitatively,’ said Medvedev. “The nuclear button is in his presence.” . The Foreign Ministry an- nounced postponement of what for Yeltsin was'to have been a critical display of Russia’s con- tinuing world influence: a sum- mit meeting scheduled for Tues- day with the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. It was to be the prelude to American-bro- kered negotiations on the Balkan crisis, now scheduled to begi Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 28, 1995 Wednesday at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. Shortly after Yeltsin was heli- coptered to a Moscow hospital Thursday, his November trip to China was canceled. But the Bal- kan summit remained in ques- tion till Friday afternoon, with Kremlin leaders no doubt debat- ing the political implications of whether Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin should serve as stand-in host. - . afin The largely négative news Friday about Yeltsin’s condition, which follows a July heart attack that kept the president sidelined for a month, raised questions about Yeltsin’s capacity to lead a nuclear power and about who can determine his capabilities. Hoping to minimize political maneuvering in the next seven weeks leading up to parliamenta- ry elections, the press secretary warned against gamesmanship by unnamed political opponents of Yeltsin. + “The possibility is admitted that all those who count them- selves among opposition to the president and his course may take advantage of the opportuni- ty to influence public opinion,” Medvedev said at a briefing. ‘I not only accept this, but I already have observed it.”’ The Russian Constitution specifies no mechanism for de- ciding the key question of wheth- er Yeltsin is fit to keep power. One article simply says that the powers of the president are ‘‘ter- minated”’ in the event of his “‘sus- tained inability due to health to discharge his powers. ...” It calls for elections within thr months. Se A second article states that the prime minister temporarily takes over if the president is un-- able to perform his duties. But it places no time limit on the dura- tion of such a temporary power shift and does not specify who decides whether the president is incapacitated. it Conceivably, in the current unstable political atmosphere, any group with enough influence to get on television could declare that the president is unfit to keep power, setting off a potentially explosive chain reaction among competing political forces. In a perverse twist of logic, some who have been closest to Yeltsin stood to gain the most by yanking control from him. A transfer of power would put Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin’s stal- wart prime minister, at the helm, in strong position to lead his par- ty into December elections and possibly beyond to the summer presidential elections. Conversely, Communist and nationalist opposition groups would gain by having Yeltsin re- main nominally in charge, be- cause they don’t want Cherno- mydin to hold theladvantage of being de facto president. The scenario is complicated by a longstanding power struggle within the Kremlin itself, pitting Yeltsin’s security chief and clos- est friend, Gen. Alexander Korz- hakov, against virtually anyone else who accumulates power, such as Chernomyrdin. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Yeltsin’s No. 2 expands his role Prime munister takes some powers from hospitalized Russian president By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Cox News Service MOSCOW — Russia’s prime min- ister has taken authority over lead- ing government ministries from iling President Boris Yeltsin, who weak and sometimes dis- eented yesterday in his ae brief television appearance since he was hospitalized eight days -ago. Yeltsin, his face puffed and speech a little slurred, dispelled questions over whether he was comatose or worse in a videotape played on all major news shows last night. But it was clear that the resident’s second hospitalization or heart troubles in four months had taken a serious toll. Speaking after a half-hour visit with Yeltsin at the Central Clinical Hospital, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said he would “coor- dinate” work of the departments of defense, security, interior and for- eign affairs, collectively known as the crucial “power” ministries.” “The president has to be partially relieved of these duties to give him a better chance to recover,” Cher- nomyrdin said at a news confer- ence. “But of course we seek the president’s advice on all key questions.” Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - November 4, 1995 was evasive when asked whether Yeltsin had request- ed that he take on the additional responsibilities. “I could read in his eyes that Chernomyrdin needs to work more,” the prime minister Said. Chernomyrdin, who would take over as president if Yeltsin were incapacitated, did not formally as- sume the mantle of head of state. The broadcast, which showed Yeltsin seated in an easy chair wearing a blue and white jogging suit, was the biggest interruption of the president’s semi-isolation since he was hospitalized for a mild heart attack on t. 26. “Subjectively speaking, I’m not feeling bad now,” Yeltsin said, in a halting voice. “The doctors consult with me twice a day. I must restore myself up to the standard, of course. But there is no reason to worry now.” Chernomyrdin looked concerned as Yeltsin stumbled over words, but the camera later caught the two men chuckling over some wisecrack the prime minister made. The video , lasted less than a minute. While Yeltsin’s press service has pumped out optimistic descriptions of daily improvement in his condi- tion, no date has yet been set for when the 64-year-old president will leave the hospital or get back on the job.

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel!l COX NEWS SERVICE - MOSCOW — A legal challenge has opened the door for a post- *“ponement of next month's parlia- mentary elections, a move that ; could delay — or possibly deny — the resurgent Communist Party victory. --. President Boris Yeltsin dis- -cussed the issue for a third straight day in meetings at the Moscow hospital where he is re- covering from a mild heart attack. Three confidantes who visited the 64-year-old president de-, scribed him as favoring seemingly contradictory objectives: holding the election on schedule Dec. 17 and making changes to the com- plex election law before voting day. Sergei Filatov, Yeltsin's chief of staff, said the president had re- stated his “firm, categorical posi- tion not to postpone the elections to the State Duma (parliament) but to do everything so that the law raises no doubts.” The 19-member Constitutional Court has yet to rule on com- plaints over a rule restricting seats won by proportional repre- sentation to parties that get more than 5 percent of the vote. The political maneuvering over Indianapolis Star - November 14, 1995 the challenge, however, has raised new doubts about the durability of Russia's young democracy. “I connect this with only one thing — the fear of elections and efforts by all means to cancel the elections, at least for this Decem- ber,” said Yelena Mizulina, the leading constitutional expert of the upper house of parliament. Talk of postponing the election has been circulating in Moscow for about three weeks. The first serious stroke oc- curred last Thursday when a pan- el of appellate judges asked the nation’s highest court to review the election law. On Monday, the Constitutional Court received a second challenge from an electoral bloc headed by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, whose bloc faces ex- tinction under the 5 percent rule. The rule, common among West European countries, is designed to increase stability in parliaments by limiting the number of parties represented in them and weeding out smaller, extremist parties. The ballot that Russia’s 100 million voters will face lists 42 parties with 15,000 candidates competing for 225 seats. Opinion polls indicate that the revived Russian Communist Party and the nationalist Congress of Russian Communities, led by Gen. Alexander Lebed, would score best in the scheduled Dec. 17 vote. Another front runner is Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin’s centrist Our Home is Russia party. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Vows vague as Russians seek votes Foes of Communists ask changes in rules By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — The official tele- vision campaign for next month’s parliamentary elections opened Wednesday with broadcasts by parties that offered viewers plenty of promises and a splash of video satire but not much else. Last-minute efforts were ac- celerated by President Boris Yeltsin and by small parties to dilute the strength of the increas- ingly formidable Communist Party. The aim is throwing out the requirement that parties must get 5 percent of the vote to win any of the 225 national seats to be filled in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. Eliminating that rule would put more parties — and fewer Communists — in the chamber. But the court challenge to the rule also could end up postpon- ing elections. Georgy Satarov, chief politi- cal adviser to Yeltsin, warned that the Communists could pick up a majority of Duma seats if the 5 percent rule is not dropped. “T don’t believe in pink fairy tales about Communists coming to power with a human face,”’ Sa- tarov told the independent news agency Interfax during a trip to St. Petersburg. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 16, 1995 He predicted that a Duma controlled by Communists would try to rework Russia’s democrat- ic constitution and obliterate its laws on privatization. The Constitutional Court is considering appeals against the 5 percent rule, and Yeltsin said the parliament should have a confer- ence committee ready to amend the law if the court mandates changes. By Wednesday the court still had not indicated whether it would act on the ap- peals before the Dec. 17 election. The television campaign, in which 43 registered parties each get four seven-minute spots of free time on state-run television networks, opened with the first of regularly scheduled broad- casts that are to run until Dec. 15. Blocs from the Beer Lovers Party to the Western-oriented Democratic Choice of Russia sent their leaders before the cameras to speak about current conditions and to offer vague promises that they would do better. “Even those who appear on our screens endlessly don’t have a clear message to bring to us,”’ said Yelena Shestopol, a political psychologist interviewed on In- dependent Television after the first day’s offerings. “T’ve seen all the clips. I can’t single out even one concrete message, rich in content, brought by any of these politicians,” she said. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov paraded four col- leagues before viewers, includ- ing a former coal miner and woman cosmonaut, but he didn’t let any of them say a word as he quickly described the past glo- ries and present concerns of his party. Reform economist Gri- gory Yavlinskly complained about the cost of purchased tele- vision time when he wasn’t cast- ing doubts that the elections even will be held. Russian Public Television, one of the networks obliged by law to give the parties free time, had tried to elevate the political discourse by having the parties actually debate. But the parties refused to devote their free air time to joint appearances. \f"

Oni still suffers from an April 1991 earthquake that measured 7.1 on the Richter scale and dam- aged most of the houses, wrecked the regional power grid and ruined a network of small factories that was the main source of employ- ment. It also crumpled the oldest part of the Oni synagogue. The local economy has been further devastated by the cutoff of the most direct road to the capital Tbilisi, 85 miles away, as a result of secessionist fighting in Geor- gia’s nearby Southern Ossetian autonomous region. Within weeks of the earth- quake, about 500 of Oni’ s Jews, two thirds of the town’s Jewish families, moved to Israel with the help of international Jewish chari- ties. Now even the stubbornest of the stubborn who remained in Oni are praying about whether they, too, should emigrate. “I don’t want to leave Georgia, and I am afraid of it like my own death,” said Khakhiashvili, a poet by profession who lives on his $4- a-month state pension. “But what can we do? Have we got any chance?” This summer brought another blow when Oni’s longtime rabbi retired to Moscow, leaving Oni’s Jews under the spiritual guidance of a 21-year-old who had just re- turned after rabbinical studies in Israel. By oral tradition, the first Jews settled in Georgia in 586 B.C. ina town 80 miles east of Oni called Mtskheta.

Others such as Nathan Eliash- vili contend that the Georgian peo- ple “was by nature a people ahat loved the stranger.” The following century brought an end to serfdom throughout the Russian empire. With that came enough local prosperity in Oni in 1895 for the Jews to replace the old house of worship with a white stone synagogue that became one of the town’s landmarks. The new synagogue was near- ly dynamited in 1928 as part of dictator Josef Stalin's anti-reli- gious campaign.

Spassky said players need “incredible patience” to find in- door court time available.

Many people play tennis now. I wouldn’t say ordinary engineers, but almost ordinary engineers.” One change that has made tennis so popular is television, which now covers major tourna- ments and sells advertising to Western sports manufacturers whose equipment, though expen- sive, is used by Russia’s pros and by most serious amateurs.

        "ocr_text": " Expanded Coca-Cola plant gets Russian church blessing By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Mioscow — Coca-Cola Co. proved that an icon of capitalist consumerism can woo and win one of Russia’s most anti-West- ern forces — the Russian Ortho- dox Church. To inaugurate Coca-Cola’s $30. million expansion of its Moscow bottling plant on Friday, a (Rus-. sian) Dixieland band boomed a medley that included “Sweet ' Georgia Brown.” Then Russian Orthodox priest Father Matvei raised a golden icon and weighty cross for the church’s traditional “ceremony on the beginning of a new endeavor.” The bearded, brocaded priest then sprayed blessed water on the conveyor belt and on Coca-Cola’s top officials, including President M. Douglas Ivester, who on Thursday pledged to double the company’s Russian investment to $SOO million at the opening of a new Coke plant in St. Petersburg. The Russian Orthodox Church, which includes a faction verging on xenophobic, often blesses new quarters ranging from army barracks to an occa- sional joint venture business. But its leaders these days more frequently are speaking out against encroaching wester- nisms such as rock music and rampant consumerism. So the act of blessing Coca-Cola’s new plant, which was covered by most Moscow newspapers and television, left Russian believers with a clear message that Coke is almost one of them — at least in the eyes of the church.

Neville Isdell, head of Coca-Co- la’s Greater Europe Group, which includes the former Soviet Union. “I believe that the economy here today is sufficiently consumer based to be able to work together with any political dispensation.” He also doesn’t think a Com- munist renaissance would delay even further the point when the company begins to turn a profit here. Government privatization offi- cials and leading reformers warn the free market would be dramati- cally constrained under Commu- nist rule. But Moscow Deputy Mayor Josef Ordzhenikidze agreed with Coca-Cola that it’s too late to reverse course. “New investments and new Production facilities make the process of democracy in Russia ir- reversible,” he said at the ceremo- ny Friday. Underscoring the optimism, the Moscow city government of- fered Coca-Cola nearly another 10 acres of land for future expansion. \f"

The U.S. was lucky to finish the first day tied in the best-of-five match on a slow clay court that fa- vors the backcourt style of the Russians. Pete Sampras barely survived a five-set mara- thon against Andrei Chesnokov before collapsing on the court in agony from leg cramps. Sampras won 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, but said later he probably could not have played any further. In today’s doubles match, Todd Martin and Ri- chey Reneberg are slated to go for the U.S. against Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy, but U.S. captain Tom Gullikson said he was considering a change. In Friday’s first match, the 21-year-old Kafelni- kov attacked on almost every point and dumb- founded the more experienced Courier. “It is a momentum-swinger [today],” said Cou- rier. “Hopefully our guys will come out and play some good tennis.” ; For Sampras, there wasn’t time for a handshake at the net before he was flattened by cramps to his right hamstring and the left side of his groin. “T was in no shape to continue,” Sampras said. “T guess I wouldn’t have continued. It was such an emotional match. A lot of nerves. I’ve never cramped before on the court. The Davis Cup is just a lot of pressure.” As he was being helped from the court, Sam- pras cried out to the trainers to let him lie down. Just out of sight of spectators, they lowered him to the floor of the jam-packed Olympic Stadium and began applying ice packs. Sampras also was given quinine pills, then carried into the training room. After about an hour of treatment, Sampras emerged to tell reporters “I feel fine now,” and that he would be able to play Kafelnikov on Sunday.

The right hamstring of the world’s No. 1-ranked singles player still hurt when he strode gingerly on to the court for a rare outing in doubles. From the rafters of the packed Olympic Stadium a hush descended over the 12,000 partisan Russian fans —many of whom had been shocked 22 hours earlier to see Sampras’s limp frame being dragged from netside after he eked out an opening singles victory. The 24-year-old Sampras flubbed his first doubles shot, a looping backhand volley he should have nailed. But to the dismay of Russia’s prized doubles team — longtime partners playing on a home court tailored to their strengths — Sampras seemed touched by magic after his first five minutes of herky-jerky play. For the rest of the one-hour 51-. minute match, Sampras served thun- derballs and lashed laser forehands down the midcourt seam. Physically depleted, he was delivering the killer shots that he often whacked into the net when fully rested the day before. And so after floundering on Friday, the Americans held a commanding 2-1 edge in the best-of-five Davis Cup final. “T was very, very sore going into to- day’s match,” Sampras said. “But the —AP photo?

The American team captain, Tom Gullikson, said he asked Sampras late Friday if he would consider filling in for Richey Reneberg, a journeyman doubles specialist who was set to play. Sampras said he would hit some practice balls a few hours before Satur- day’s match to see if he could make it. “He was stiff, as you can imagine,” said Gullikson of the prematch prac- tice session, “but he sucked it up and said, T'll play if you really want me to play.’ ” \f"

Sampras, who had won two arduous Davis Cup matches on back-to-back days, began spray- ing his first serve into the net or too deep. Simultaneously, he seemed to lose control of the crosscourt forehand that para- lyzes opponents.

A grueling half-hour later, he rocketed his 16th ace of the day past talented Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, winning the decisive singles match 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) and clinching the 1995 Davis Cup tennis championship for the United States. Sampras, who also won the Wimbledon and U.S. Open this year, became the first American since John McEnroe in 1981 to personally wrap up the Davis Cup by winning all three decisive matches — two in singles and one in doubles. Until Sampras revived, Sun- day’s singles match was unfold- ing just as his brash opponent _ Kafelnikov had predicted a day earlier: Sampras, 24, would run ' out of energy. “Pete’s drawback is that he cannot stay on the court very long,” said Kafelnikov, ranked No. 6 in the world. “The longer I _ play, the better.” When it was over, Russian re- porters pounced on the moody 21-year-old Kafelnikov, wonder- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 5, 1995 as  * > |) a Associated Press Let’s shake on it: Yevgeny Kafelnikov (left) congratulates Pete Sampras, a 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) winner in the clincher. ing whether he crumbled be- cause he couldn’t stand the psy- chological pressure. Kafelnikov said Sampras’ big serve turned out to be much more devastating than he figured — even on the slow-bouncing red clay court that was supposed to neutralize the American’s serve- and-volley tactics. “I was calm today,” Kafelni- kov said. “We lost the match be- cause today Pete played much better than I.” Last week, Kafelnikov made the mistake of denigrating Sam- pras’ abilities on clay, telling the press, “We fear Jim Courier much more.” The English-language Mos- cow Times, which is distributed free in the team hotel, carried the headline: “No respect for Sam- pras in Davis Cup.” After wiming for the third time on Sunday, Sampras al- lowed himself one mild rejoin- der: “I think the Russians were looking at me as being the kind of weak link on the slow red clay.” The world’s No. 1 singles player added: “To come here to play in Moscow on my worst sur- face against very tough oppo- nents and a very tough crowd —I think that today’s match is prob- ably my best clay court match I’ve played.” The United States won the Davis Cup for the 31st time since it was first awarded in 1900.

Facing falling voter support, Russian extremist rips West Viadimir Zhirinovsky’s message is getting more strident as elections get closer. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Hoarse and abandoned by most of his vot- ers, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky took his re-election campaign to new heights of weirdness Sunday by spinning. out a three-century conspiracy theory. Polls show Zhirinovsky’s party falling so abruptly in pop- ularity since the 1993 election that he is on the verge of getting eliminated from the next par- liament. So with seven days to go be- fore parliamentary voting, Zhir- inovsky is falling back on what he does best: articulating the outrageous. Haranguing a sparse crowd in one of his major closing ral- lies, Zhirinovsky said outsiders have been plotting for 270 years to wipe out the Russian people and plunder their natural resources. The first plotters, he claimed, were the aristocratic Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 11, 1995 Russian Freemasons of the 18th century. When the aristocrats fell to the 1917 Russian Revolu- tion, the next villains were Leon Trotsky and other Bolsheviks of Jewish origin who he said formed a ‘fifth column,” seek- ing to undermine Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Next came the Americans. World War II convinced Wash- ington that Russia couldn’t be defeated on the battlefield, he said, so in 1945S, the American government launched a half- century “secret war’’ to destroy Russia from within. There is a constituency in Russia for an anti-establish- ment gadfly. And Zhirinovsky’s rally in Moscow’s’ Pushkin Square on Sunday showed he has not lost his gift for tweaking nerves. Two years ago, Zhirin- ovsky’s' Liberal Democratic Party stunned the West by win-. ning a 23 percent plurality and the second-largest bloc in par- liament’s lower house, the State Duma. But now pollsters are finding only 4 percent of Rus- sians support Zhirinovsky’s par- ty — about 500,000 votes short of the 5 percent minimum need- ed to win nationwide seats in the Duma. Until four months ago, Zhir- inovsky’s party looked like a sure bet to win at least a medi- um-size bloc. Its chances seemed so certain that Zhirin- ovsky turned down a chance to insure himself a spot in the new parliament by running simulta- neously for a safe single-district seat. But in September, Zhirin- ovsky took outrage too far when he shoved and pulled the hair of a woman parliamentary deputy on the floor of the Duma. Since that much-televised episode, his poll ratings have skidded below the S percent minimum for a na- tionwide seat. Zhirinovsky is far from fin- ished, however. Forty-three parties are running, and as many as 45 percent of Russian voters still have not made up their minds whom to support, according to the polls. Last time, the Liberal Democratic leader was devastatingly effec- tive in last-minute television ap- pearances, winning the votes of more than two-thirds of voters who decided in the last 48 hours before the election. Even if his party loses Sun- day, the 49-year-old Zhirin- ovsky won’t disappear. The election for the much more im- portant job of president is set for June, and Zhirinovsky al- ready has announced his candi- dacy. t \f"

By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — Voter nostalgia for communism and hard-line nationalism dominated the campaign and may help shape the new parliament today as Russia holds its second democratic election since the col- lapse of the Soviet Union.

Also poised to do well, according to the poll released Thursday, was ultranational- ist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party, which appeared to have benefited from a late surge in support.

Yeltsin, still recuperating from a heart attack, appeared on nationwide television Friday with a fervent appeal that voters not Russia. “You must not allow forces of the past to regain power,” he said. “You must not allow them to bring this country back to the times when everyone was instructed on what to think, what clothes and hair- European Social Democratic Party, the Communists St¥!es to have, and what songs to sing.” have struck a chord among discontented voters with promises to restore the old times, which 55 percent No single party or bloc seemed likely to emerge with two-thirds of the seats in the ' Duma, the margin needed to overrule presidential vetoes. As a result, the lower house is likely to remain ineffective. But the results of the election could reshape Russia’s political and economic debate — and determine who emerges as its next president. \\ Yeltsin, 64, has said he will wait until after the election to decide whether to seek a second five-year term. If healthy, he is expected to run. Communist leader Gen- nadi Zyuganov is among his potential oppo- nents. Yeltsin, who has no party affiliation, gave a barely veiled endorsement to the Our Home Is Russia bloc led by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, urging vot- ers to back candidates who can establish “stability and accord in our common home — Russia.” | Chernomyrdin may run for president next year if Yeltsin bows out. ‘Our Home will be hard-pressed to emerge with the greatest number of seats in the Duma since its tight-money policies in the name of the free market are broadly unpopular. The late poll showed it running no better than third. Even so, the so-called “party of power” has wielded formidable advantages, includ- ing control of state television and links with local officials across Russia’s 11 times zones. ‘In the closing days of the campaign, it hit the Communists head-on with televi- sion commercials contrasting wacky look- ing Russians professing confidence in the Communists and solid citizens backing Our Home.

Pickering Pickering is the senior ca- reer diplomat in the U.S. foreign service and has been ambassador in Moscow since 1993. uestion: Polls suggest the Communists will come out on top in voting for the State Duma lower house. How will this affect American-Russian cooperation? nswer: The Communists are expected to do well — in the range of 20 percent or more in the Pparty-list voting. But that doesn’t mean that in the end they will have more seats than anybody else. Half of the Duma consists of deputies from single-member dis- tricts hke our House of Represen- tatives and the other half is elect- ed proportionally by party lists. Since the opinion polls only re- flect the size of the party-list vot- ing, the end result remains quite umcertain. Two years ago, it was a mis- take to interpret Russia’s last election as a fairly cataclysmic event when WViadimir Zhirinovsky won 23 percent of the party-list vote. As it turmed out, Duma members have cooperated well. The Duma has passed over 300 bills, some of them very impor- tant. Mr. Zhirinowsky’s people were part of that process, as were Communists and reformers and democrats. Q@: Is today’s Russian Com- mumnist Party more similar to the socialist reformers who have emerged in Central Eu- rope or to orthodox communist parties out of the past? A: It is a little murky, but it is both. Tt least it wants to be both so that it can appeal to voters across the spectrum. It will proba- bly perform a little hike how it performed after winning fairly strong support in the 1993 Duma elections. That is, it becamea party which cooperated in the Duma, rather than a party of rigid ideology and iron party discipline. Palm Beach Post - December 17, 1995 Q: What is coming up be- fore the next Duma that will affect U.S. interests? ‘ A: A number of acutely tmpor tant issues — including ratifica- tion of the START II nuclear weapons treaty, ratification of a bilateral investment treaty and new legislation on taxation. Also extremely important — if it isn’t passed by then — is legislation providing for production-sharing in oil and gas exploration. Q@: The Communists have promised to lead the new Duma to ‘‘denounce’”’ the 1991 Belovezhsky agreements, which recognized indepen- dence for Ukraine and Be- larus. Your reaction? A: While some Communists have said that, it is not a foregone conclusion that it will happen. President Yeltsin is in charge of foreign relations while he is presi dent, and if he isn’t continuing as president, foreign relations will b managed by his successor. But should the Duma take thi step, it would cast a cloud over those treaties, which would obvi- ously be not very helpful. Q: How will this election affect Yeltsin? @: He has said he will decide whether he will be a candidate fo reelection after the parliamentary elections. I would suspect he would want to evaluate the re- sults and take them into account. As for cooperation between him and the Duma, one could believe that the process which has been pursued for the last two years would be continued — with differences over some issues but not total confrontation. Q: What will this election mean to an average American — will nuclear arms agree- ments come unstuck? ill we have to spend more on de- fense? A: None of these things is Sian constitutional arrangements, the Duma is probably somewhat less powerful than the American Congress. The Duma does not appear to be set for huge change in course, but for a readjustment among the three major groupings within the Duma — nationalists, Communists and centrist reform- ers. — JOSEPH:-ALBRIGHT \f"

He plans to run for president in June. Even if the Communists and hard-liners emerge with the greatest number of seats in the Duma, it was unclear how much influence they would actually wield. Power still rests primarily with the president in Russia, and Yeltsin would still appoint the prime minister and Cabinet. Vote counting was slow, and a clear picture was not expected to emerge until late today. Later results from vote-rich industrial cities its h r-and-sickle emblem was drawing en Russia could shave the lead of the nearly a quarter of the vote — twice as much as it polled in the last election two years ago.

The re-emergence of the Communists, which was forecast in pre-election opinion polls, capped a remarkable turnaround for a party that was _ widely dismissed as a historical relic four years ago when the Soviet Union collapsed.

The Central Election Commission estimated more than 60 percent of the country’s 104 million registered voters cast ballots, higher than expected. Forty-three parties fielded candidates, but they must gain at least 5 percent of the national vote before they will be seated in parliament. American Michael Caputo, an adviser to the election commission, said only four of the pro-re- form parties may clear the 5 percent barrier. “If they work together, they can prevent the national- ists and the Communists from overriding Yelt-' sin’s vetoes,” he said. \f"

That is why Borozna, 75, joined millions of other mostly older Russians in propelling the Communists to victory in parlia- mentary elections Sunday. “I was a Communist, and I livéd well then,” she said after casting her ballot in this dismal Moscow suburb. ‘Does that make me a bad person?” It is more than 12 million humdrum, individual reasons like this, 12 million votes, that explain how a party totally dis- credited in the collapse of the So- viet Union four years ago could revive. Six million more voters pro- tested life in Russia by backing ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirin- ovsky, whose star was thought to have fizzled since his stunning show in Russia’s last parliamen- tary election two years ago. Trailing the Communists’ 21.9 percent vote total, Zhirin- ovsky’s Liberal Democratic Par- ty was second with 11.1 percent by late Monday. Votes were still being counted, and final results were not expected until Wednesday. Voters who backed the radi- cal left and right emphatically rejected the pro-market policies of President Boris Yeltsin and Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 19, 1995 democratic reformers. “I got sick and tired of life like this. Banditry, prices, infla- tion,” said Nair Aleyev, 23 and unemployed, who breaks the stereotype that only old people went for the Communists. “There was nothing like this un- der Communists.” No voters interviewed in this. dreary, apartment block commu- nity Sunday and Monday said their life is really bad. Yet 19.5 percent here voted for the Com- - munists and 4 percent for Zhir- inovsky. Even in Sherbinka, where 29,000 people have escaped the Moscow hustle 10 miles to the north, some scourges of a trans- forming economy have followed. The district is home to sever- al mafia clans. The son of a for- mer brick factory director was kidnapped. Residents are afraid to step out after dark into the square where booths sell liquor and cigarettes and play loud mu- sic. Sometimes beggars show up in town. Not a few residents figure Russia’s new rich have some connection with crime and cor- ruption. “Let me explain it to you,” said 70-year-old Valentina Bog- danova. “The Communists them- selves used to steal, and they let us steal. Now these guys are stealing, but they don’t let us steal.” “They are building these fan- cy ‘kottezhi’ — on whose mon- ey?” she asked, referring to the fabulous luxury cottages sudden- ly towering on the outskirts of al- most every major Russian city. “Yesterday the guy was barefoot and today he’s building a fancy ‘kottezh.’ ” The small, slim woman looked down at her faded red coat, pinched at the waist with a straggly fur collar. “I worked for more than 40 years,” she said. “I have nothing new. I haven't bought anything new in years.” Only two centrist parties joined the Communists and Zhir- inovsky to beat the 5 percent bar- rier required to get a share of seats in the State Duma, the low- er chamber of parliament. Our Home is Russia, the government party, pulled 9.6 percent of the vote, and liberal economist Gri- gory Yavlinsky’s Yabloko party got 8.4 percent. Together those four parties received 51 percent of the esti- mated 60 million votes cast. What happened to the remaining 39 parties running? The leading anti-Communist, pro-democratic parties that espouse free market economics refused to pool their efforts to give the center a bigger piece of the parliamentary pie. The editor of the hometown paper, Nikolai Karavayev of the Sherbinka Herald, pondered how Sunday’s victory will change things. “It will take time, because they messed everything up so much for the last four or five years,” Karavayev said of Yelt- sin and his government. “But I’m sure that when the Communists come to power life will be very good.” \f"

By or he Marcia Kunstel | oscow — This week, it started to look as though the collapse of the Soviet Union may have a surprise ending. » If last Sunday’ 's huge victory by the Communists in parliamentary elec- tions means anything, by next sum- mer the West may be confronting the question, “‘Who lost Russia?” INobody knows for sure, of course, whether the Communists can dupli- cate their showing in June in the far more consequential election for Russia’s president. Maybe one year from now, Com- munist Party chairman Gennady Zyu- ganov will be teaching Marxist phi- losophy in Cuba. Maybe Russian President Boris Yeltsin not only will have shaken off his two heart sei- zures, but also will have gone back to playing tennis and will have won his second five-year term as president. But for now, let’s try to walk for- ward, stage by stage, and carry this week’s Communist parliamentary victory to what could be its logical conclusion. Stage I: Denial a‘ Even in the final week of the elec- tion, Yeltsin and Prime Minister oe Chernomyrdin were deep in “Nothing will change in Russia’s economic life after elections to the ' State Duma,” said Chernomyrdin, campaigning as head of the Yeltsin- endorsed Our Home Is Russia party. “The new parliament will be formed of mostly the same people.” That, we now know, was wishful thinking. Actually, the new State . Duma will have threé or four times as ..many outright Communists —and speperhape nena allies to give them -~\" With all the opinion polls showiiis the Communists just hours from a big win, a reporter asked Yeltsin on elec- tion day whether the Communists might someday regain power. “No and again no,” Yeltsin rumbled. The Yeltsin team drifted on with blinded eyes, even as election results showed the Communists winning 22 percent of the vote. More astonishing, the supposedly discredited ultrana- tionalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky came in a solid second with 11 percent. Stage 2: Taking stock Only 9.6 percent of Russians who made it to the polls — and only one out of 17 eligible voters — could be _persuaded to vote for Our Home, the _. designated official party. And this was after Russian state television was repeatedly used by Yeltsin appoin- tees to polish Chernomyrdin’s image . and decry the risks of communist totalitarianism. Only in Moscow, home of the well- fed bureaucrats, did Our Home score big. Here it won 19 percent of the vote — double its performance nationwide. ' So what did this election say about Yeltsin’s chances to be re-elected president? “I think that Yeltsin’s chances are getting better,” was the remarkable claim of Mark Urnov. Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel are correspondents for The Atlanta Journal- Constitution. INobody knows for sure whether the Communists can duplicate their showing in_June in the far more consequential election + for Russia’s president. head of the presidential analytical depart- Ment. ‘>: But outside experts, such as the Carn- Cagle Endowment’s Michael McFaul, said -Russia’s two-stage presidential election law theoretically could end up eliminating Yeltsin in the first round. -. “What is interesting about the parlia- “mentary results,” McFaul said, “is that if this had been the first round of the presi- -dential election, guess who is on the ballot in the runoff? Zyuganov and Zhirinovsky, »and Yeltsin is shut out.” ‘Stage 3: Spread the benefits . The conviction among the Moscow- based elite is that Yeltsin could win back ‘disaffected Russians if he would only tinker with his current policies to spread out the benefits of reform. ~ “TI can see there are opportunities to raise the level of life quite dramatically ‘for these several months,” said Alexander -Golz, political analyst of the Defense Min- *, istry newspaper Red Star. “The govern- ment has such an opportunity. And it can ~be used. It will change the attitude toward - Yeltsin.” _ State Duma member Alexander - Shokhin, a leader of Our Home is Russia, said that the government realizes that “a . certain social fatigue has set in.” The “answer, he said, is to change the policy so .. that the benefits of reform are “experi- fenced by the rank and file.” But spreading the benefits of -¢Chernomyrdin’s austerity policy is like ‘Spreading the enjoyment of a toothache. .~ His ti eg tight-mone pushed on Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 24, 1995 > \fRussia: Voters resist hectic pace of reform Leaders of the pack: Russian Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov (top) attends a meeting announcing early results in the parliamentary elections. Grigory Yavlinsky of the Yabloko party (left) and Viadimir Zhirinovsky of the Liberal Democratic Party will figure largely in presidential elections in June. Russia by the World Bank and Interna- tional Monetary Fund — has proved - remarkably effective in calming the country’s overall inflation rate, stabilizing the ruble and even stimulating small signs of economic growth. There is a big risk that, in trying to “spread the benefits” to win back the dis- affected, the government will have to print so many rubles for subsidies that by the next election, inflation once again will be running rampant. Stage 4: The Yavlinsky problem Grigory Yavlinsky, a pro-reform econo- mist with a big ego, has announced plans to run for president. If Yavlinsky runs, he easily could siphon off enough liberal and centrist votes to knock Yeltsin into third place in the first round of presidential balloting. That is exactly what Yavlinsky’s Yabloko party achieved in the parliamen- tary election. By winning 8.4 percent of the vote, Yavlinsky pushed Our Home into third place behind the Communists and Zhirinovsky. Yeltsin’s problem if he decides to run for re-election: Should he forget about how savagely Yavlinsky has been attack- ing him for driving Russians into poverty? Should he invite Yavlinsky to join the gov- ernment? Once before in 1991, Yeltsin faced the same problem. It was when he was look- ing for what he described in his autobi- ography as “an interesting intellectual figure” to reform the Russian econo- my. Even then, Yavlinsky was “indis- putably the most popular economist in the country,” Yeltsin wrote. Yet Yeltsin gave the job to Yavlinsky’s rival, Yegor Gaidar, because the Rus- sian leader judged that Yavlinsky “had developed a kind of insensitivity.” Theoretically, coopting Yavlinsky by inviting him to run the economy sounds like a workable strategy. But many who know Yavlinsky think he was too wounded by Yeltsin’s slight in 1991 and is too puffed up by his elec- tion showing to withdraw from the presidential race. Stage 5: Who is afraid of the Communists? Through the parliamentary election, Zyuganov was brilliant in packaging himself as a European-style social democrat while keeping the party’s fundamental hard-line nationalist ori- entation in the background. This will get harder in January, when the Communists have the biggest block in the State Duma. Only about half of the party leader- ship is firmly behind Zyuganov, and he will have a hard time controlling hard- liners who want the Duma to carry out the party’s pledge to “denounce” the 1991 Russian treaties giving indepen- dence to Ukraine. There also will be hard-line calls for symbolic backward steps, such as renaming St. Petersburg as Leningrad and perhaps even throwing out the Russian tricolor flag i in favor of Lenin’s red banner. Yeltsin will attempt to capitalize on every Communist excess, but this may prove a hard sell. This year, at least, opinion polls show that 20 percent of Russians are firmly pro-Communist; another 20 percent are staunchly anti- Communist. The remaining 60 percent of Rus- sians are Yeltsin’s problem. While Communist symbolism will dismay the West, it may not necessarily turn off Russians. The Communists aren’t their first choice, but that middle 60 percent also is not terrified by the prospect of going back to living under Communist rule.
