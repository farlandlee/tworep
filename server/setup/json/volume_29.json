There were four major launch failures, repeated delays due to lack of money and sporadic minicrises on Mir including a chronic coolant leak that could threaten the space station’s oxygen or water supply. The troubles in Russia’s once- vaunted space program raise seri- ous questions about the future of the international space station, an ambitious $40 billion effort by the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada to build a per- manent manned space platform by 2002. So far, the Americans show no qualms about sticking with the joint Russian-American program that advances another step when the space shuttle Atlantis to replace American John Blaha, who has spent four months on Mir. That launch from Cape Canaveral is scheduled for Jan. 12. **Personally, Iam not concerned at all about flying on board the Mir. The more that I study the Russian. systems and I look at their hardware, the more I realize that it is very robust and it is very well designed,’” said Navy Cmdr. Wendy Lawrence, 37, a Jackson- ville, Fla., native who is scheduled to fly to Mir in September. Although mission safety has not been compromised, doubts linger. Russia’s cash crunch already is af- fecting training and equipment. *“*How long can you keep doing this? How long can you keep re- covering, doing the final fix, hold- ing on just one more year?’ asked Michael Foale, a 39-year-old astro- physicist slated to replace Lin- per. “Obvious they know and Viadimir Filonov/For Cox Capt.

I hope not during my flight.”’ When Foale reaches Mir in May, he won’t know the layout of the experiments aboard the sta- tion. NASA signed a $1.3 million contract to finance Russian-built mock-ups of Mir modules in Star City so astronauts could practice the experiments they will conduct im space. But the mock-ups are no more than ‘ugly carcasses” sit- ting unfinished in a building at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Foale said.

Financial afflictions have put Russia a full year behind in build- ing one crucial component: the service module where astronauts and cosmonauts are supposed to live. U.S. engineers are struggling to find a way to go ahead with in- orbit construction of other pieces of the station despite the absence of astronauts living on the site.

Until it is built, however, the lives of the men and women who go to Mir will continue to depend on a Russian space program that has backslid from world pre- eminence.

And replace the tubes quicker,” Foale said. Such trouble is expected in a 10- engineers planned. But the fact that ground technicians have ' been unable to devise a way to combat the problem shows the overall stress on an underfunded space program. Financial crisis Russian Space Agency Director Yuri Koptev warned in December decade ago the Progress factory in Samara was building 60 rockets a year, and the Soyuz sat stockpiled. Last year Progress got the money to build four. Koptev earlier complained that in the past five years his budget has shrunk tenfold — dropping in 1996 to 3.3 trillion rubles, or about $673 million. Besides that, his agency has suffered the same as other state enterprises that don’t receive even the amounts promised in the govern- ment budget. By December, the agency then, according to Deputy Director Boris Os- troumov . also has only Ukraine that split off when the So- viet Union collapsed. More recent- ly, young Russian specialists left for private jobs as state salary pay- ments became sporadic. The budget shortfall is worry- ing those who care whether the space program continues not only to advance but also to perform anywhere close to past levels. “Insufficient financing will have a serious negative influence on the space program and on the reliability of the work of the peo ple and the equipment,” said Vse- volod Avduyevsky, a pioneer of Russia’s space program and mem- ber of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Staff Writer SAMARA, Russia — They were the Soviet elite, the engineers and workers who created the world’s first great space program — better paid, better educated, widely traveled and respected. dropped us off. Those who can swim will stay afloat for a while, Others will drown,” said Galina Yablochkina, 35, who makes booster rockets at the Pro- gress factory. “We all are waiting for a life preserver from our government,” And now hard questions are arising about whether badly paid, poorly sup- plied scientists can still meet the exact- ing demands of space exploration. State rocket orders have plummeted more than 90 percent at Progress, the factory that created the Vostok rocket to blast cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, then 25 years later constructed the most powerful super-rocket ever conceived, the Energiya. After averag- ing 60 rockets a year, Progress pro- duced four in 1996, when it fell apart soon after takeoff. The same problems occurred both times. First, the subcontractor badly made the shrouds, the aerodynamic shields that wrap the satellite sitting atop the rocket. The subcontractor ac- knowledged it incorrectly applied the glue that holds the layers of the shroud, “It is something that anybody in their right mind would test,” said Phillip Clark, a consultant on Russian space e] systems for Jane's Intelligence Review, MARCIA KUNSTEL/Staff Photographer Progress rocket plant employees line up to buy bread outside the plant. In mid-December, workers got their pay for work they did last September. Their average monthly salary of 500,000 rubles is worth less than $100 and, when it ts paid, ranks among the lowest factory wages in the industrial province strad- dling the Volga River, said Alexander Chechin, deputy director of the factory. It was humiliating for an engineer such as Lyubov Barisheva, 48, who has worked at Progress for 30 years, to hawk meat at a street market so she could afford a wool coat. Or for engineer- ing supervisor Yuri Lomovsky to take an 18-month leave because he could make more money painting houses. Besides confronting material woes, the technical wizards and laborers who collaborate on machines that defy the laws of nature also faced their worst nightmare this year: Twice in five weeks their Soyuz-U launch vehicle failed Palm Beach Post - The second problem stemmed from design specifications drawn up years ago, setting standards for locks that hold the shroud. When Russia’s space indus- try was flush with money, manufacturing shops always made parts to standards on the upper end of design specs, When new lock molds were made, the cash-strapped local shop decided it could meet the bare minimum set out in the design specifications, said Valery Abrashkin, an executive at the factory. \"This tuned out to be critical,” he said, The lower design standard wasn’t good enough. The locks didn’t hold. The first launch failed May 14, and the center didn’t have the time or per- sonnel to figure out what went wrong before the second launch went awry June 20, Fortunately both launch vehi- cles were carrying military photo recon- naissance satellites, not human cargo.

        "ocr_text": "Yeltsin turns 66 with power as shaky as health - @ Russia grows increasingly skeptical , of his ability to lead as officials try to influence succession MOSCOW —. President Boris Yeltsin celebrates his 66th birth- day today amid a growing belief that he never will really run Rus- sia again. The leader whose dynamic drive for reform forged a new Rus- sia six years ago has become a car- icature of the Soviet past: a frail president whose entourage props him into the seat of power. “From now on, he is a ceremoni- al figure,” Yeltsin’s former press secretary, Pavel Voshchanov, wrote this week in the daily Kom- somolskaya Pravda, one of Rus- sia’s most probing independent newspapers. “All this talk that he will alleg- edly roll up his sleeves and bring order in the country, correct the economic course, restore the country’s defense capability, strengthen control over the re- gions, reshuffle his personnel and punish corrupt officials, all this talk has no real basis,’’ Vosh- chanov wrote. Yeltsin’s aides maintain the president is tending to such issues from his sickbed — which during the past six months has been locat- ed at various hospitals, a rehabili- tation health resort or his country home — and will tackle them head-on once he fully recovers. But doubts are growing that Yeltsin can make another of the seemingly miraculous rebounds that have highlighted his career. In 1995 and 1996, he suffered three debilitating heart episodes, underwent quintuple bypass sur- gery last fall, then was felled by double pneumonia in January, re- portedly after he became ill on a hunting trip around New Year’s Dey. the meantime, some politi- are campaigning to replace . Others are trying to shift to the legislative branch a share of the huge powers held by the presi- dent under the Russian constitu- tion, which Yeltsin midwifed into existence in 1993. Communist members of parlia- ment this week began maneuver- ing to create a vice presidency, which would “ensure a smooth transfer of power in the event such a transfer is necessary,” said Anatoly Lukyanov, the Commu- nist who chairs the Legislative Committee. The constitution places Yeltsin’s hand-picked prime minister at the head of go- vernment if the president is inca- pacitated, but only until new elections can be held within three months, not to serve out the term. Yeltsin himself is preparing un- specified constitutional amend- ments, the official Itar-Tass news agency reported Thursday, lead- ing to speculation he and his close associates are crafting new lan- guage allowing him to choose a longer-term successor. What newspapers call the “‘pow- er elite” also may fear the conse- quences of such a _ powerful presidency, should Russian voters elect a maverick such as retired Gen. Alexander Lebed, whom polls show to be the nation’s most popular political figure. Assurances that Yeltsin still is in charge ring more hollow with each cancellation of a trip or event and with’each rare television ap- pearance in which the president moves tentatively and seldom is heard speaking. In January, the Kremlin twice postponed a summit of former So- viet republics that Yeltsin was supposed to lead, and canceled his trip to the European Union sum- mit in the Netherlands next week. His meeting with President Clin- ton, once planned to be held as ear- ly as this month, keeps getting pushed further into the spring. One nationwide poll taken be- fere Yeltsin’s pneumonia showed 66 percent of the respondents be- lieved he should resign the presi- dency because of ill health. Only 9 percent said they trusted Yeltsin. By one published tally, the pres- ident has appeared at his Kremlin office on only 13 days since he won re-election last July. Yeltsin’s spokesman said Fri- day that the president would cele- brate his birthday quietly with family members at his country residence in the Moscow suburb of Gorky-9, the same place his staff reports he spends hours every day on official paperwork.

        "ocr_text": " THE ASSOCIATED PRE WASHINGTON — Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin and Vice President Gore announce Fri day that President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will meet in Helsinki in March. Russian leaders unite against NATO’s eastward expansion By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — Not much unites Russian politi- cians these days. But the emotional level of one issue is: the eastward expansion of NATO. Officials of the most rere, ideologies are joining in fierce opposition to NATO’s plans to extend the military alliance to include former Eastern bloc states. With Friday’s announcement of a March 21-22 summit in Helsinki, Finland, between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the tenor of the debate is certain to intensify. “Could it be that NATO wants to impede our reforms, even our democratic transformations?” De- fense Minister Igor Rodionov fumed at a news conference Friday. “Could it be they want a return to the years of the Cold War confrontation?” Rodionov picked up on a theme that was stressed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in his talks with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in Washing- ton this week: NATO enlargement by the addition of east European and, ultimately, Baltic nations could spell disaster in Russia. Chernomyrdin has warned that hard-line nation- alists and Communists will use NATO expansion as a political lever in their battle against Western-oriented officials in the Russian government. Chernomyrdin’s two days of talks in Washington concluded with the announcement that Clinton and Yeltsin would meet in the Finnish capital next month. The site was shifted from the United States, which was to host the meeting, in deference to the 66-year- old Russian president’s ongoing recuperation from heart surgery and pneumonia. Helsinki is a relatively short plane ride or an overnight train journey from Moscow. Clinton sidestepped a question about Russian concerns about NATO during a photo session with Chernomyrdin in the Oval ice. ‘I think you have to see this issue in a context of all American-Russian relations,” Clinton said. At his talks with Yeltsin, Clinton is expected to offer assurances that NATO will keep nuclear weap- ons out of Eastern Europe and explore other ways to help make the alliance expansion plans acceptable to Moscow. NATO is expected this July to invite Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic — all formerly part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact —- to become mem- bers of the Western alliance by 1999. Not only nationalists and Communists have been playing the NATO card, especially in the past week. A leading advocate of big industry, Arkady Volsky, who heads the Russian Union of Industrial- ists and Entrepreneurs, warned that NATO expan- sion would require Russia to retarget its missiles at potential new NATO bases in Eastern and Central Europe. Russia also would have to “move its military and defense unions eastward, including a union with China,” said Volsky, who has often worked closely with Yeltsin’s government. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, considered a prime contender to replace the ailing Yeltsin, weighed in on Tuesday with a complaint that the West was breaking unspecified agreements its leaders made at the close of the Cold War not to extend the reach of NATO. Several Russian officials told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last weekend that NATO expansion would require Russia to increase military spending at the expense of much-needed social programs and economic stability. a Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel are correspon- dents in Cox Newspapers’ Moscow bureau.

Short of announcing that he is resigning, there seems almost nothing Yeltsin can say that would lift Russia from a 6-year-old economic trough that increasing- ly is beimg blamed on his ‘‘demo cratic’”’ reforms and on corruption he has tolerated. The Kremlin has gone to great lengths to dispel rumors that Yelt- ypass surgery quent bout of double pneumonia, might announce his resigmation on grounds of health. A Kremlin spokesman de- scribed first lady Naina Yeltsin as “indignant and upset’ when a Moscow newspaper reported last month that she had advised Yelt- sin to retire. Nine months after Yeltsin’s de feat of the Communists in last year’s presidential elections, opti- mism among Russia’s people has all but vanished. ‘The situation in Russia is ex- tremely unstable, and I don’t see any quick solution to our prob- lems,’’ said retired KGB Gen. Leo- nid Shebarshin, the chief executive of a Moscow bank secu- rity firm. “Whatever changes will take place at the top, the present setup Cunder Yeltsin) will not be able to lead the country out of the blind alley. Some radical changes are meeded and are inevitable. The only question is when, and at what price,”’’ said Shebarshin, who was the last chief of the Soviet KGB under President Mikhail Gorbachev. Yeltsin’s address to parliament will be his most physically de- manding public appearance since suffering a heart episode in June. In the intervening nine months, while Yeltsin has been virtually incapacitated, the economy has fallen deeper into disrepair. The mihtary is disintegrating from lack of money and low morale, and millions of workers across the country are owed $8.5 billion in unpaid wages.

It comes at a time when politicians of all stripes are fearful about a one-day nationwide strike and protest that is being organized by unions and Communist regional branches for March 27. Equally worrisome has been the plunge in the morale of the bud- get-starved army. oe *“\"We must at last say that we cannot Keep 1.7 million people (in the army). and that is why every- body is naked, barefoot, dirty and hunegry.’’ the nation’s most popu- lar politician, retired Gen. Alexan- Ger Lebed, said this week. Many Russians, including Yelt- sim’s former press secretary, Pavel Voshchanov, say the country has adescended into a period of stagna- tion resembling that of the mid- 1970s. “It is very similar to the last years of unforgettable Leonid Brezhnev’s rule.”” Voshchanov wrote in a newspaper column. ““The same obvious incapacitation of the leader, the same omnipo- tence of those who prop up his Kremlin bureaucracy, the same Gissatisfaction among regional leaders, and the same toneless ap- athy among the disillusioned low- er strata.”’ \f"

        "ocr_text": "Russian disparities echo past downfalls By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT AND MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service Moscow ake a ride on the Moscow sub- way on a Sunday evening and you'll see a disconcerting phenomenon: though the rest of this country is increasingly disgrun- tled, here a comfortable élite is riding home from parties and concerts in their new $500 brown suede over- coats. The other night, we looked around our Metro train and saw scores of Rus- sians wearing muskrat, Persian Lamb and goose-down. The most-shabbily dressed passengers were the two of us, bundled up in our three-year-old parkas from L. L. Bean and Blooming- dale’s. The next day as we were driving in our little Neva on Moscow's outer ring road, we drove past a fender-bender. It ‘was a collision between a BMW and a Mercedes, both bearing the licence plates of Russian citizens. Later in the week, the pro-govern- ment newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta arrived in our mailbox with a report that Russians were flush enough to buy $23 billion in American currency last year — up 19 per cent from the year before. The conventional wisdom is these were optimistic indicators. If wealth is being accumulated in Moscow and St. Petersburg, that must mean that a cap- italist democracy has a secure future in Russia. ‘Not necessarily. At least for now, some disturbing parallels seem to be emerging be- tween Boris Yeltsin’s Russia and the glittery, unstable prosperity that pre- vailed in the Iran of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi during the mid-1970s. The religious landscape is entirely different, of course. Yeltsin has no Is- lamic holy man waiting in Paris to dri- ve him from the Kremlin, only the peripatetic quasi-mystical nationalist politician ebed. But ren. Alexande, the elements of instability look rather similar in today’s Russia to those which so startled the world when the Shah’s Golden Throne collapsed in 1979. For example: e In Russia, as in Iran, the one supreme governing figure who built up the aura of the all-powerful favour- dispenser has become a sick recluse. Human problems are piling up, and Moscow’s élite — in an echo of Tehran’s — is talking openly about who will take over from Yeltsin. @ The Army is sullen after embarrass- ing battle defeats — in Iran’s case. against Iraq, in Russia’s, against Chechnya. The armed forces are in a “horrifying state,” Defence Minister Igor Rodi- onov lamented recently, and that is partly because his ministry owes an estimated five trillion rubles (nearly $1 billion) in overdue wages to service- men. @ An inchoate resentment is spreading in the provinces against “New Rus- sians” in the capital getting rich by ex- ploiting gas, aluminum, timber and other natural resources. One sign of the sour mood came last month when the well-regarded All- Russia Public Opinion Centre found that 40 per cent of Russians polled across the country felt that “rigorous dictatorship” is the only way out of the current mess. There is a growing sense that Yeltsin’s democrats and the mainline Russian Communist Party have amal- gamated into one big cautious “bour- geois nomenklatura” in Moscow dedi- cated to protecting the status quo. “The Russian political élite is now made up of both pro- and anti-govern- ment politicians who have lost touch with the populace,” wrote Dmitri Fur- man in the iconoclastic weekly Ob- shchaya Gazeta. “The consolidation of the élite means that it is distancing it- self from the nation ... But the masses are also consolidating: impoverished intellectuals and the workers feel very close.” one outside a id Disturbing parallels seem to be emerging between the Russia of Boris Yeltsin, left, with his granddaughter, Masha, and the unstable prosperity that prevailed in the Iran of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, shown above with empress Farah, during the mid-1970s Moscow, the problem with the “status quo” is that Russia has slid from re- cession to a seemingly bottomless de- pression. Last year, the production of Russiar “light industry” fell 33 per cent com- pared with the year before. A few big monopolies, including Gazprom in natural gas and Russia’s United Ener- gy electrical grid, remain healthy, but only 40 per cent of Russian industrial enterprises were financially solvent five years after the fall of commu- nism. Almost all the land is still tilled by hapless peasants on unprofitable col- lective farms. Starved for funds, the farms bought 15 per cent fewer trac- tors last year than the year before. And they could afford to apply only 13 per cent of the fertilizer applied five years ago. Naturally, wheat produc- tion is far below that of the 1970s. Because no Russian Silicon Valley has sprung up to replace the di- nosaurs of the defence industry and collective farms, Mr. Yeltsin’s tax col- lectors managed to bring in only $37 billion in revenue last year. This 44-per-cent shortfall in gov- ernment revenue projections, made worse by massive tax evasion, has rip- pled through the economy. As of late January, Russian workers were owed nearly $9 billion in over- due wages, and the government owed its elderly pensioners another $3 bil- lion. Ottawa Citizen Desperate to keep multi-billion-dol- lar loans flowing from the Interna- tional Monetary Fund, Mr. Yeltsin’s government has resisted pressure to make up the difference by printing rubles. Inflation has stayed in check, but this hasn’t sated millions of sullen souls working without paycheques in cold factories. Moscow’s response to the back-due wages crisis was so unfeeling and dis- jointed that it further stirred the juices of resentment. One day there was news that the up- per house of parliament had turned down a bill to add an inflation adjust- ment to the $12.65-a-month minimum monthly pension cheque. Then came the newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna’s report that 622,669 Russian public servants had found some reason to travel to a foreign country in the month of January. On top of that was the disclosure that Yeltsin’s designated successor, Prime Miéinister Viktor Cher- nomyrdin, had used public road- building funds to mount a lavish bear- hunting expedition in Yaroslavl province. When the weekly journal Ogonyok tried to report how the government facilitated the hunt by cutting a road into the forest near the lair of a moth- er bear and two cubs, Mr. Cher- nomyrdin’s office reportedly pres- sured a Moscow bank to freeze the magazine’s credit.

        "ocr_text": "KGB spy says Rosenberg gave him military secrets Wife Ethel was innocent, he claims BY JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service MOSCOW — For 47 years Rus- sia has depicted Julius Rosenberg as a victim of a communist witch hunt, but now his one-time Soviet controller has revealed that Mr. Rosenberg handed him dozens of military secrets. Retired KGB Col. Alexander Feklisov said that among the se- cret material turned over by Mr. Rosenberg, who was executed along with his wife Ethel in 1953 for espionage, was an early smart bomb mechanism and a hand- drawn diagram of a lens mold used in making the U.S. atomic bomb. Col. Feklisov insisted that the atomic information the Russians obtained from Mr. Rosenberg was insignificant. But his account — the only first-hand confirmation to date from a Russian intelligence veteran of Mr. Rosenberg’s spying activity — lends new weight to the U.S. prosecution case that sent the 34-year-old Rosenberg to the elec- tric chair. And it flatly contradicts Mr. Rosenberg’s sworn account at his trial that he had not been involved in espionage. Innocent spouse However, Col. Feklisov’s recol- lections cast fresh doubts about the fate of Ethel Rosenberg. His por- trayal of her as an innocent spouse who never met with a Soviet agent adds credence to those who have long insisted that she was wrongly put to death at the age of 37. Speaking in an interview in the Cox Newspa- pers Moscow Bureau, Col. Feklisov told of dozens of furtive meetings with : his ‘‘very true Julius friend’’ Julius Rosenberg Rosenberg in the 1940s, including an extraordinary exchange of wrapped gifts at a Manhattan cafe- teria on Christmas Eve morning 1944. Col. Feklisov said Mr. Rosen- berg’s gift turned out to be a radar-controlled proximity fuse, one of the world’s first ‘‘smart” weapons, that Soviet engineers replicated and put to deadly use Cincinnati Enquirer - March 16, 1997 against U.S. forces in the years ahead. The Russian spy veteran said one such fuse was used to down U-2 pilot Francis Gary Pow- ers over the Soviet Union in 1960. “T first met Julius Rosenberg in the second half of 1943,’’ remem- bered Col. Feklisov, who was then a junior spy-handler based at the Soviet consulate-general in Man- hattan. ‘‘I had maybe 50 meetings with him.’’ - Now 83 and one of the most highly decorated officers in the history of Russian intelligence, Col. Feklisov confirmed the still-contro- versial 1951 allegation by U.S. prosecutors that Mr. Rosenberg passed Russian agents a sketch of a so-called ‘‘lens mold’’ used in making the U.S. atomic bomb. But he downplayed its signifi- cance, saying Soviet experts “couldn’t get a fraction of useful information’ from the drawing and supporting material, which he said Mr. Rosenberg handed him in ear- ly January 1945. “Julius practically didn’t give any atomic information,’’ Col. Fek- lisov maintained, adding it was a minor sidelight to Mr. Rosenberg’s achievements as the ideologically motivated organizer of a ring of a half-dozen wartime Soviet spies in American electronics and aircraft- making plants. Clemency denied Col. Feklisov first told about his role as Julius Rosenberg’s case officer four years ago to Svetlana Chervonnaya, a historian at Rus- sia’s Institute of USA and Canada, with a view toward collaborating on a book. The book has yet to be written. 7 Testimony about the Manhattan Project’s lens mold — used in. manufacturing the part of the atomic bomb that focuses its explo- sive force inward — was among the central accusations that result- ed in the conviction of the Rosen- bergs in 195] on a charge of conspiracy to commit espionage. Denied clemency by President Dwight Eisenhower despite a worldwide clamor that they were victims of the anti-communist hys- teria of the time, the Rosenbergs | were executed in the electric chair at New York’s Sing Sing prison on June 19, 1953. They maintained their innocence to their death. “Julius and Ethel are heroes, real heroes,’’ said Col. Fekli- sov‘‘They died young. Some people say that heroes have to be young.”’ . \f"

Helsinki, Finland — What romises to be the most conten- ous U.S.-Russian summit since e end of the Cold War begins oday when President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin quare off over reconfiguring the 945 division of Europe between, ast and West. If months of preparatory ne- otiations by the Americans and ussians have led to a compro- ise solution, neither side has aked any hints. The pivotal question is over e U.S.-backed expansion of the orth Atlantic Treaty Organiza- tion this summer, when Poland, ungary and the Czech Republic re due to be invited to join the estern military alliance. j The broader issue is whether a large swath of central Europe, oe locked in the Moscow-led ommunist bloc, will be allowed to shift its allegiance westward hrough NATO membership.

These include Ukraine and the trio of Baltic nations — Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — all of which want NATO mem- bership. “NATO enlargement will re- main on track,” Albright told a Washington news conference. “The first new members will not be the last and we will exclude no European democracy from fu- ture consideration.” Despite Yeltsin’s strongly. worded opposition to NATO ex- pansion, there are indications Russia has recognized its. inev- itability and will thus try to work out the most advantageous terms. Yeltsin has demanded that, at the least, NATO’s 16 existing members agree not to deploy nu- clear weapons, foreign troops or allied military infrastructure on the territory of new members. NATO said in December it had no plans to move nuclear weap- ons into new member countries but has made no similar commit- ments regarding troops or mili- tary facilities. NATO has also offered to give Russia a voice — though not a Organization and to become a full participant in the annual summit of the Group of Seven in- dustrial nations. Working in their favor is that over their previous 10 meetings Clinton and Yeltsin have devel- oped the warmest relationship Russian and American leaders ‘ever have enjoyed.

As today’s daylong talks were about to unfold at the Finnish president’s seaside residence, Yeltsin confined himself to pleasantries: He hopes he and Clinton “can depart as friends.” Clinton, tired and under doc- tors’ orders to use a wheelchair because of his surgically re- paired knee, did not address re- cent assertions by Yeltsin and other Russian officials that they are dead set against Western plans to invite former Soviet sat- ellites Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. “T think we'll work something out. I hope we will,” Clinton said as he sat beside Yeltsin and Finn- ish President Martti Ahtisaari in a ceremonial photo session. “We have had 11 meetings. We’ve glad to see President Yeltsin looking so fit and well.” Yeltsin, 66, is recovering from heart surgery last fall and double pneumonia. In one of the summit’s smaller ironies, Yeltsin ! was able to walk — stiffly — down the steps of his plane, while Clinton had to be lifted uncere- moniously from Air Force One in an airport catering truck. The strongest signal of Mos- cow’s outrage at the planned NATO expansion was an an- nouncement by the official ITAR-Tass news agency that the Russian army’s elite Sist Tula. Airborne Regiment had conduct- ed an unannounced military air- lift exercise in a blizzard 110 miles south of Moscow. It was the second military ex- ercise announced by Moscow in the last two days. Though it was a minuscule display by Cold War standards — involving only 1,000 troops and 10 pieces of military hardware — the Tass account said “it is the first military exer- cise of such a large scope since the disintegration of the Soviet Union” in December 1991. In another display of Russian pique, Yeltsin’s top security chief, Gen. Anatoly Kulikov, flew to Russia’s western neighbor Be- larus for talks with President Al- exander Lukashenko, a fierce NATO opponent.

During the summit run-up, Lukashenko told the Belarus parliament that under some cir- cumstances he might favor the return to Belarus of Russian , strategic nuclear missiles — a: step that would spread nervous- ness in Germany, the Nether- lands and America’s other Euro- pean NATO allies.

But Yeltsin and Clinton did decide to go forward with a complex package of nuclear arms agreements, If eventually approved by the dubious Russian Duma and U.S. Congress, the two leaders’ tentative outline of a START III treaty would cut the number of strategic nucle- ar warheads on both sides by 80 percent by the year 2007.

        "ocr_text": "Unpaid workers across Russia hold protests against Yeltsin By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — Hundreds of thousands of working men and women who haven’t been paid for months vented their anger against President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday by hold-' ing street demonstrations across Russia. It was the largest mass protest since the collapse of communism five years ago and an ominous sign of Yeltsin’s growing unpopu- larity. Though it was only a one-day symbolic protest that occurred without bloodshed, or- ganizers promised a new round of anti-Yelt- sin demonstrations on May 1, the traditional workers’ May Day holiday when some Rus- Sians still celebrate their revolutionary roots. The demonstrations, organized by Rus- sia’s normally passive trade unions and by local Communist parties, spread across Rus- sia’s 11 time zones and occurred in hundreds of cities with dozens of differing pretexts. In Birobidzhan, the capital of the Jewish Autonomous Republic in the Russian Far East, teachers went on strike to demand the repayment of money Moscow was supposed to have paid for seven months’ worth of textbooks. In the Far East capital of Viadivostok, electrical workers cut off power for eight hours to more than 1,000 mostly state-owned factories that have refused to pay for elec- - tricity. Overall, the Interior Ministry estimated that 1.8 million people took part in 1,286 ral- lies across Russia. Even allowing for an official tendency to underestimate the size of protest rallies, it was clear that the demonstration fell short of unions’ predictions of a 20 million turnout. Nonetheless, the demonstration was im- pressive because it was the first time when old-line Communists and pro-democracy trade unionists had marched together in a joint denunciation of the Yeltsin adminis- tration. In the last week, the Yeltsin government has come up with funds to pay off a big chunk of the overdue wage demands, a fact that is likely to encourage unionists to stage repeat demonstrations in coming months. ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO / Associated \"Press Outside the Kremlin on Thursday, thousands gather to demand the pay they have not received for months. Protests were held in many regions. Seeking to blunt the stinging television images, Yeltsin released an order to Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin saying, “The current situation in which huge amounts of wages are being withheld is intolerable. I am dissatisfied with the course of paying with- held wages to employees and with the cur- rent situation regarding workers’ rights in the country.” Despite Yeltsin’s belated involvement in the late-pay issue, all evening TV channels showed long columns of picketers approach- ing Red Square carrying picket signs saying “Yeltsin Resign.” At the Moscow rally, which drew more than 100,000 outside the Kremlin walls, there was an air of pessimism. “I think nothing can be done to change the situation,” said Aleksei Masalsky, a 36- year-old crane operator who hasn’t received Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 28, Shouted Communist slogans mingle with other opinions in Moscow on Thursday duf- ing the demon- stration to de- _mand money.

This week, the young and harismatic Belarusian Presi- ent Alexander Lukashenko opes to reach another rung in Ss campaign for power. In a ove that is spreading ripples of ear among his opponents, Luka- henko plans to meet Wednesday Moscow with President Boris eltsin for talks on whether to erge Belarus and Russia into a ong-rumored supranational ‘union.’’ *“This is an attempt at state uicide,’’ said a downcast Alex- der Feduta, a columnist who reviously was press secretary o Lukashenko. “If he gets his ay, it will mean the liquidation f both the Russian and Belaru- ian states. And if he becomes eader of the joint Russia-Ee:- arus governing body, he gets his d on the nuclear button.”’ Judging from late reports m Yeltsin’s entourage, Fedu- *s vision is likely to amount to worst-case thinking. In oscow, Aman Tuleyev, Yelt- sin’s official in charge of deal- ngs with former Soviet neigh- rs, told a Russian news agency at ‘“‘neither Russia nor Belarus ill govern each other’? under ocuments set to be _ signed ednesday by the two Slavic residents. Geographically, Be- arus is bordered by Russia on ithe east and Poland on the west. Preposterous as it sounds, Lukashenko still is emerging as a dark force to be reckoned with in Russia’s future. Although the 42- jyear-old former Soviet state {farm boss isn’t a Russian citizen, this Communist supporters in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 1, 1997 Russian Parliament are deter- mined to push through a law on common Russian and Belarusian citizenship that would allow him to run and to rule from the Kremlin. Except for Russian hard-line Gen. Alexander Lebed, no one else has emerged with the force of personality to harness Rus- Ssia’s rising tide of Communist nostalgia and disillusionment with Yeltsin-style democratic re- formns. In fact, on some days, Lu- kashenko makes the thundering Lebed look like a voice of moder- ation. *‘People are saying, ‘Mr. President, give us dictatorship. Give us Stalin’s times,’ ’’ Luka- shenko recently said in a tele- Phone conference with Belaru- sian regional chiefs that was shown in Belarus on state tele- vision. “‘I want to warn you,’’ he said, “that my helicopter will hang over your heads in the.air almost every day. I will not tell anyone in advance where I am going.”’ Two weeks ago, Lukashenko hosted a co of former Communist hard-liners from across Russia, including some who led violent uprisings against former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and later Yeltsin. *“The Soviet Union had a lot of good things to offer,’ Luka- shenko said. ‘“They were free ac- cess to education, medical care and support for the elderly. Un- fortunately, on the threshold of a new millennium, politicians have lacked the will and wisdom to keep these joint achievements.’’ Along with showpiece social achievements from the Soviet era, Lukashenko has shown him- self more than willing to bring back a measure of Soviet totali- tarian controls. Indeed, he told one German interviewer in No- vember 1995 that Adolf Hitler’s “reign corresponds to our under- standing of a presidential repub- lic and the role played by the . president within it.’’ \f"

The union of Belarus and Russia does not create a single state. Both sides preserve their sovereign- ty,’; Yeltsin assured Russians at a Kremlin ceremony whtére he and the authoritarian Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko signed a draft of the so-called _ Treaty. treaty is much shorter and less specific than originally written, containing only nine articles, but still: creates closer ties between the two countries thaft have been forged by any of the 15 independent naions left when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. ‘“There is no alternative to integration with Russia,” said Lukashenko. “It is the well-considered chéice of our country.” ' The pact calls for general coordination of defense, ecdnomic and foreign policies, and is accompanied by a charter which is reported to be more specific but hag not yet been made public. ‘The documents will be subjected to public opinion unéil mid-May, when a joint commission will suggest any amendments. With that much time to take the publlic pulse — or to mount a campaign to pump up serffiment — the union could be either further watered down or strengthened to form a more solid stracture, ‘The treaty and charter then must be ratified by parliaments of both countries. ‘Russian media and non-Communist politicians hacbraised alarms recently over expectations that the twopresidents would use this first anniversary of the creation of a loose “community” of Russia and Belarus to pledge themselves to a full-blown federa- tion or even a single state. + With Belarus in even worse economic straits than Highlights of the treaty Highlights of the Treaty of the Union between Belarus and Russia, signed Wednesday by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko: @ Russia and Belarus will remain sovereign States, but plan to cooperate on political, economic, military and other issues, although no details were given. i The two countries will move to harmonize legislation, ensure joint security and maintain defense readiness. @ Other countries can join the treaty, al- though no other former Soviet republic has expressed an interest. @ Not mentioned in the treaty is the forma- tion of joint political bodies. Those are spelled out in the Charter of the Union initialed by Yeltsin and Lukashenko on Wednesday. The charter will be submitted for public discussion over the next six weeks. Russia, more resistant to democratic and economic reforms, and under the whip of a dictatorial president, fears have been widespread here that a strong union would drag Russia back to its Soviet past. The daily Moskovsky Komsomolets opined in an analysis Wednesday that the union would sink a half- dozen “knives in the back of Russian democracy.” Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said after the signing ceremony that the treaty is indeed a step toward recreating at least a portion of the old empire. “T congratulate you,” he addressed the peoples of the two countries. “We are now again living in the Union together.” Communist Anatoly Lukyanov, a leading member of the Russian parliament, charged that the campaign against the pact was organized by antagonists both within Russia and abroad, according to Russia’s official Itar-Tass news agency. And he suggested the union is a response to the expansion of NATO eastward toward Russia. “Those who have clamored for NATO member- ship have received what they deserve,” he said.

        "ocr_text": "Russian cosmodrome joins U.S. partner to launch new future By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — A cash-starved Red Army cosmodrome and a high-tech American company join forces this week to launch futuristic hardware for a space-based global communications network that both partners hope will be a trail to a pot of gold. The cooperative effort is a stretch for Russia’s once elite Military Space Forces, which launched its first foreign satellite from the Plesetsk cosmodrome three decades ago at a time when the So- viet Union wanted to woo France away from the U.S. orbit. Now the space agency is about to piggyback an American experimental commercial satellite on a military sput- nik — probably a spy bird — so the Rus- sians can pay their bills. “Of course it’s good for us,” Lt. Col. Ivan Safronov reluctantly acknowl- edged. But the senior officer? the agen- cy’s press center refused w*say how much the military is charging the Mary- land company, Final Analysis Inc. The launch scheduled for Thursday will be the first of 30 launches of for- eign-made satellites planned this year from Plesetsk and from Baikonur, the other major cosmodrome Russia’s mili- tary runs, according to the official Itar- Tass news agency. Final Analysis plans to launch a global system of 26 low-earth-orbiting satellites that will be the backbone to a $200 million worldwide communica- tions network. It is planning six launches in Russia within five years. Michael Ahan, executive vice presi- dent of Final Analysis, said the global system will be able to read utility me- ters, work as a two-way pager, or find a trekker lost in the wilderness. The money it will be paying the Rus- sians is needed at the closed launch site 500 miles north of Moscow. The cosmo- drome periodically has had its electric- ity cut off for failure to pay the bills and, like the rest of Russia’s military, has been unable to pay its soldiers’ salaries on time. “Unfortunately, the country’s astro- nautics, military astronautics above all, is in a state of profound, if not total, cri- sis,” the military newspaper Red Star wrote at the end of last year, noting that the military space budget was one-tenth of its budget in 1989, This week’s launch is an experimen- tal satellite through which potential cus- tomers in 10 countries will get six months of free usage, both to familiarize them with the system and enable Final Analysis to work out any kinks. Even though the Russian space sys- tem needs serious mending, Ahan said some experts assess this kind of a mid- class launch as less risky here than in the United States. He said one indica- tion is that launch insurance costs less for the same coverage. “Of course we worry about it. We worry daily,” he said. “Space is risky, but the’ rewards are high. Nobody who invests expects to get a 10 or 20 percent return. Everybody expects to get their money multiplied.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 14, 1997 \f"

Our mothers are begging for money. Our children, 25 per- cent of our children in Moscow don’t go to school. These are all dangers.” While May Day demonstrators were chanting outside for his res- ignation, Yeltsin spent two hours working in the Kremlin, accord- ing to the Itar-Tass government news agency. The president cut short a Black Sea vacation this week, after brief television news clips showed him looking tired and weak. His spokesman denied Yeltsin, 66 and recuperating from last fall’s heart bypass surgery, is ill again. In Asia, where communism still flourishes alongside market economies, people celebrated international Labor Day with praise for proletariat heroes and union-sponsored picnics. In Beijing, crowds filled Tiananmen Square at dawn to honor model workers and watch soldiers raise the flag on the first of a three-day vacation. But the May Day protests turned violent in Germany, where 370 people were arrested as thou- sands of police struggled to block clashes between radical rightists and leftists. Labor unions held dozens of rallies to protest high unemployment. Thousands of police were deployed in eastern cities to control clashes between left and right. Police said 120 neo-Nazis were arrested in the central German town of Hann Munden after rightists held an illegal rally, harassing pedes- trians and throw- ing bottles. Police used a water can- non and night sticks to break up demonstrators in Berlin, arresting _ at least 110 dem- onstrators. Another 150 were arrested in Leipzig. France’s labor unions used the holiday to air their grievances and goals ahead of legislative elec- ‘tions later this month. Their ral- lies in Paris and other major cities were a rare show of unity. Associated Press Party leader Gennady Zyuganov waves red car- nations as he marches to Red Square to celebrate May Day, a traditional workers holiday. Istanbul to denounce the Islamic-led gov- ernment, whose anti-secular moves have angered the mili- tary and put the governing coali- tion in jeopardy.

The two foreign policy officials said they had not reached agreement on the rela- tionship between Russia and an enlarged NATO nearly reaching Russia’s border. There remain hopes that such a charter could be ready to sign at a May 27 summit meeting in Paris. Russia has wanted legally bind- ing commitments that NATO would not station nuclear weap- ons in the new NATO members or advance troops closer to Russia. NATO control over Soviet mili- tary equipment left in Eastern Europe also has been an issue. Leaders of the main May Day demonstration sponsored by the Communists and more radical groups seized on the NATO expansion plan as one of the keen- est dangers allowed by Yeltsin’s government. Police estimated nearly 40,000 people marched in Moscow May Day rallies, while 1.5 million participated nation- wide, according to the indepen- dent news service Interfax..

By Joseph Albright and Dale Dempsey DAYTON DAILY NEWS MOSCOW —- For half a cen- tury an elite group of workers in Dayton has harbored an atomic secret from the rest of America, but documents from a Russian archive reveal that the facts somehow leaked to Soviet spy- master Lavrenti Beria’s espio- nage network back in 1949. The compromised secret involved an industrial process developed at the Monsanto Chemical plant in Dayton dur- ing World War I for manufac- turing a rare radioactive ingre- dient used in the “‘trigger”’ of an atomic bomb. ‘The ingredient was polonium- 210, an isotope that emits the burst of neutrons necessary to jump-start a chain reaction at the critical instant of a nuclear detonation. As Soviet intelligence reported to Beria in 1949, the U.S. govern- ment had just set up a shielded underground factory near Day- ton to extract the polonium iso- tope from slugs of an irradiated heavy metal called bismuth. The new factory, now part of the Mound Laboratory on the out- skirts of Dayton, replaced an pulling PU ast) Ly pesete aes Leg pariier Monsanto plant that pro- essed polonium in the mid- 1940s. The plants were at a former seminary at 1601 W. First t. and later at the Runnymeade layhouse in Oakwood, owned by he Talbott family, one of Dayton’s most prominent fami- ies. A March 1949 Soviet intelli- ence document, recently uncov- ered in a Moscow archive by Cox Newspapers, informed Beria how aluminum canisters of irradiated bismuth were being flown to Day- ton for chemical processing from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission’s top-security mili- tary nuclear reactor complex then operating at maximum ¢apacity in Hanford, Wash. ’ Once inside the “‘hot zone” of the Monsanto Chemical plant in Dayton, the rods of irradiated bismuth were dissolved in glass- Le vats 5 feet tall and 3 feet in iameter, explained the report to Beria, now declassified in Rus- sian Ministry of Atomic Energy archives. Shadows of doubt / Col. Vladimir Barkovsky, a vet- eran official of the Russian For- eign Intelligence Agency who served as a Soviet intelligence operative in New York from early 1949 to the late 1950s, said he has no doubt the Ministry of Atomic Energy document is authentic. ' In Moscow, Barkovsky described the information on | how to extract polonium from bismuth as a significant piece of intelligence on the American atomic program. | ' “This concerns the production | of polonium, a very radioactive material that is used as one of the! ingredients ofthe initiator for | nuclear reactions,” said Bark- ovsky, who recently has been poring through KGB archives to prepare an official history on Soviet wartime atomic espio- nage. “This appears to be a ca of the technology for the production of polonium, and that is why I think it is very valuable.”’ ' Beyond what the Soviet docu- ment shows about American Cold War technology, it also pro- vides intriguing evidence that Moscow’s spy chiefs continued to obtain current atomic secrets from inside U.S. Atomic Energy Commission facilities as late as 1949, three years after such | | ee JIM RUTLEDGE /DAYTON DAILY NEW: The T building (right), now part of the Mound Laboratory, was an underground facility built to withstand all but a direct hit from a nuclear bomb. known atomic spies as Klaus Fuchs and David Greenglass had ceased working for the U.S. atomic program. ' When Barkovsky was asked whether the new document might indicate the Russians had an undiscovered agent who had visited or worked at Dayton in the late 1940s, he replied: ‘‘Not necessarily. Because sometimes this kind of stuff was distributed to other (Western atomic) cen- ters. This could have been obtained from any source anywhere.” Not all the intelligence was on the money, either. One Russian intelligence report described a factory built underground “some- where in suburbs of Dayton, apparently in the city of Marion, state of Ohio.” ‘Marion, north of Columbus, is close to 100 miles from Dayton. The government did have a plant there, but it was a backup facility to the Mound. Working in silence ‘Gus Essig of Miamisburg was a physicist who worked on the project at the Mound from 1946 until he retired in 1982. Asked if the polonium reclamation pro- Dayton Daily News - May 4, 1997 > \fSECRET: Information on extracting polonium significant cess described in the Russian dgcument was accurate, Essig lied, ““Yes, roughly.” ssig and former Mound ~orkers are st luctant in g about the work, even process was declassified by the U.S. govern- ment in the mid-1980s. The work- ers, now in their 70s or 80s, all recall an atmosphere of extreme secrecy and security at the Mound during the Cold War years. “People were very security conscious,” Essig said. “I never said anything about what I was working on to my wife.” Essig worked in T building at the Mound, the underground facility described in the Russian document. Built underground to withstand all but a direct nuclear hit, T building required all of the concrete production in a three- state area for three months in 1948 to construct its hardened, 17- foot thick walls. T building now houses the tritium recovery oper. ation at the Mound plant, which is being returned to civilian use. Joe Garner of Farmersville, a former radiation safety officer at the plant, and John Birden of West Carrollton, a former research chemist, both described plant security measures that included code words and work instructions given on a strictly “need to know” basis. “The code word for polonium was Postum. !ike the artificial coffee during the war,’ Garner said. Birden said there were only 20 to 30 people working on the project in 1949, and each was sub- jected to a full background check by the FBI. “I was never suspicious of any- one there,’ Birden said. “However, when we travele other sites, we found that other people were not as secure.” None of the three former scien- tists was surprised that the Rus- sians knew about the work at the Mound. “It does not surprise me that the Soviets knew,”’ Birden said. ““They had spies everywhere, but they didn’t go after the little quys. they went for the top of the ine.” Expanding the project Garner recalled that specific knowledge was divided among groups at the Mound. “When you went to lunch you didn’t talk about what you were working on,” he said. Garner said that the only per- son with knowledge of the entire operation was its chief, Dr. Charles A. Thomas, one ofa small group of scientists chosen by President Harry Truman to work on the bomb project. He was a member of the inner circle of J. Robert Oppen- heimer, the American physicist who headed the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, N.M.., “4 and witnessed Charies Thomas the first test of the atomic bomb. Thomas founded the Thomas- Hochwalt lab in 1926 in Dayton. It was purchased by Monsanto in 1936. A former president of Mon- santo, Thomas died in 1982.

Beria’s agents must have got- ten wind of the AEC’s top-secret plans to expand and relocate its plant for making atomic bomb “triggers” in a bom under- ground facility at Mound Labora- tory. But whoever supplied the information to Beria’s network apparently couldn’t pin down the precise location of the new underground facility. The 1949 report said “‘it seems”’ the new underground polonium-making site was in Marion. There was a polonium- processing plant east of Marion in 1949, but it was a backup facil- ity according to Garner and Bird- en. The plant had all of the same equipment as the Mound, but not the reinforced, underground building. “Everything at the Mound was duplicated at Marion and we would go up at least once a month to check it,’ Garner said. “It was there in case something, like a bomb attack, happened at the Mound but there was never any radioactive material in Marion.”’ Dayton Daily News - May 4, 1997 (Continued) > \fSECRET: Information on extracting polonium significant | Subversive documents A cover letter, signed by Beria in his distinctively neat hand- writing on March 4, 1949, ordered the scientific director of the Soviet nuclear weapons project, professor Igor Kurchatov, to “familiarize yourself with the materials” and report back with conclusions. Only two others in the Soviet atomic bomb project — chief bomb designer Yuri Khari- ton and the top administrator, Boris Vannikov — were autho- rized by Beria to examine the report called “Factory for the Production of Polonium in the City of Dayton.” The report on Dayton was one of four intelligence “materials” totaling 39 pages that reached Beria’s office on the same date — March 1, 1949. According to an inventory contained in the cover letter to Beria, the intelligence packet consisted of four docu- ments: ®» Report No. 822-a, Atomic Center in Oak Ridge, 18 pages. ® Report No. 822-b, Factory for the Production of Polonium in the City of Dayton, 4 pages. » Report No. 822-v, Security Equipment in the Oak Ridge Enterprise and in the Factory for the Production of Polonium in Dayton, 9 pages. - ® Report No. 833-g, Condition of Work and Protection of . + Secrecy in the Oak Ridge Enter, prise, 9 pages.

With a half-life ofi only 140 days, it occurs in natiwre in minute quantities as an impw: rity of lead. fT ots! Polonium in the makifig: It was Oppenheimer, accords; ing to the official history, wha;c calculated that if 100 pounds of— bismuth rods were placed near= the center of a nuclear reactor in Hanford, neutron bombard- ment in the reactor would con- vert a tiny fraction of the bis- muth into the needed : polonium-210 isotope. Making polonium was a little- known sideline for the Hanford reactors, whose main role was making plutonium. It was the job of the Monsanto staff in Day- ton to extract the polonium from the irradiated bismuth rods, Meanwhile at Los Alamos, a team of Oppenheimer’s physi- cists, including Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe and Niels Bohr, : designed a mini-sphere called the ‘initiator.’ Measuring one ce meter in diameter, the sphere was made of beryllium with an inner shielding liner made of gold. Inside the sphere was a powerful dose of 50 curies of polo- nium to trigger the nuclear explosion. The American bomb designers’ theory was that as the bomb’s external blanket of chemical explosives was detonated, an implosive wave would crush the central core of plutonium to make a critical mass. Then, at the crucial instant, the implosion would also crush the polonium- beryllium initiator, thus releas- ing a jet of neutrons into the imploding plutonium just in time to touch off a chain reaction. The United States used initia- tors made of beryllium and polo- nium in the first plutonium bomb tested at Alamogordo, N._M., in July 1945, as well as in the plutonium bomb dropped the following month on Nagasaki. The Hiroshima bomb, using the so-called gun-type design and made with a core of enriched ura- um, also used a polonium- jum initiator k eo gstt y+ Pi tet Sa . using powerful chemicals includ- es ing formaldehyde and a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids called aqua regia. At Oppenheimer’s behest, the task of organizing a polonium- making lab was assigned in 1943 to Thomas, the central research director of Monsanto Chemical Co., who set about to create the secret lab at the Monsanto plant in Dayton. wi = DAYTON DAILY NEWS Dayton Daily News - May 4, 1997 (Continued) \f JE PRY LM re Ash Pits ‘ PT] *. a D 10 10 0 eo o 0 5 \\ i -( 6 D > D : ¢ '¥ Db 0 O c \" Ou ‘ 0 ‘ i uo . uf u t a> 4 U 0 S A oC 6d ] a y » } 0 A S i p 0 q Te ¢ DAD 4 0 no goo O20a! ri f a t GQ on 0 noe co oe } # u t 5 C a0 f 6 uer 0 0 5 r a * tw O CE) $3 $ ORD ‘O G iP iH) Of is pr aai ; o * iV os > a ere a = S + iJ = J S JVAVDe Dayton Daily News - May 4, 1997 (Continued) > \f po i (ocobad Marka) — Bante, whey ae - Corzeceo yuasanup toe.

AND JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Areticn-Statesran Itematonal Sa BUKHARA, Uzbekistan — When local histo- ry buff Zulya Rajabova recites the background of the splendid mosques and Islamic acade- mies still gracing this ancient city, she some- times adds a jarring update. In 1927, women of Bukhara demanded an end to 1,000 years of living in anonymity when they gathered not far from the towering Arc citadel for a public demonstration, tore off their veils and burned them. “Their fathers and their husbands and their brothers were so angry that they shot them,” she said. Other Uzbek women living in what had been a cultural wellspring of Islam eventually were forced to give up their chadors by the Bolshe- viks who came to power in 1920. They have never returned to the veil.

Yet even now, the region’s secular governments believe they must act de- cisively to repel the newest threat of funda mentalism effervescing northward from Afghanistan. They are bracing for the Taliban movement, which already controlled most of Afghanistan before it launched an offensive at the end of May to take over the northernmost territories abutting Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Even Central Asian nations not directly ad- jacent to Afghanistan reinforced their borders to counter potential Taliban incursion, as well as to control the droves of refugees expected to flee Taliban rule. “The danger is very strong,” said Abror Gu- lamov, an official of the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry in the capital, Tashkent. “We are very worried about this.” The Taliban enforce an interpretation of Is- lam more rigid than the Saudis’ or Iranians’.

But Taliban fundamentalism surging in Afghanistan has the region’s secular governments on edge. REPUBLICS IN TRANSITION The Caspian’s buried riches By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Baku, Azerbaijan uried below the murk of the Cas- pian Sea is up to $3.5 trillion worth of undeveloped oil and gas, probably the last great trove to be tapped before the world must wean itself from gasoline-powered cars in the late 21st century. The surface of the Caspian looks like a river of gold as rays from a setting sun slice down through the spindly hulks of old Soviet oil derricks and onto the deck of a sputtering ferry boat. The shimmering fusion of black and gold is no mirage. This spring, the U.S, State Depart- ment reported to Congress that the “proven” and “possible” oil deposits of the Caspian basin add up to an astonish- ing 178 billion barrels of oil. That would be 15 times as much oil as in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay field and would make the Caspian potentially the most important oil discovery since the opening of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s. One of the most stunning results of the 1991 collapse of communism is that this historic treasure — first discovered by Soviet geologists — is about to be exploited by partnerships of western oil companies and independent post- communist nations. “The future is amazingly bright,” says Wayne Wheeler of Unocal Oil Co., a 42-year-old engineer from Houston JOSEPH P. ALBRIGHT/ Cox Newspapers The sun sets behind oil derricks erected by Soviet drillers in the Sea 30 to 50 years ago, before Western oilmen were allowed in. | who is overseeing the construction of the first western-financed oil export terminal 30 miles down the coast from Baku. “This is the next gold rush. I think anyone who would say or imply otherwise is just naive.” Wheeler’s crew of Turkish and Azer- baijani pipe layers are welding the last links in place in an onshore tank farm so oil from the Azeri sector of the Cas- pian can start flowing to the world mar- ket. Four towering tanks, each holding 155,000 barrels, are in place, and he is rushing plans to extend the tank farm with another 28 tanks. Tacked onto the wall of Wheeler's prefabricated headquarters is a sign that tells workers what must be finished day by day so the first oil can begin flowing Aug. 28. The group of foreign investors for whom he works, the 40 percent American-owned Azerbaijan Interna- tional Operating Consortium, has signed deals with neighboring countries to export the “early oil” through a pair of pipelines — a “western route” through Georgia to Georgia’s Black Sea port of Supsa and a “northern route” through Russia’s rebellious Chechnya province to Russia’s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. But whether the oil will flow on schedule is anyone’s guess. That makes both the oilmen and the Azeris nervous, for, as Wheeler put it, “you can produce all the oil and gas in the world, but if you can’t sell it, you’re just spinning Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 15, 1997 > \fThe Caspian’s buried riches wheels.” At least for now, the Western oilmen and their local partners appear con- vinced answers will be found to the great geopolitical obstacles to opening up the Caspian: @ Which nations can legitimately sell the drilling rights for the Caspian? Iran, Russia and Turkmenistan have yet to endorse Azeri claims to an offshore sec- tor of the Caspian, raising questions over the validity of the western con- tracts for exporting oil. Russia has also grumbled that Kazakhstan has no right to allow western drilling in the lucrative Caspian waters off Kazakhstan. @ Even if the Caspian countries can agree on the legalities, how can the oil be piped to market through hundreds of miles controlled by local chieftains, including Armenians, Afghans, Kurds, Chechens, Dagestanis, Abkhazians, and Baluchis? Choosing the permanent pipe- line route will be a political ballet requiring grace, timing and a talent for spreading the money. Despite all obstacles, Klondike fever is sweeping every city on the fringe of the Caspian, as exploration geologists from Exxon, Mobil, BP and other oil giants fan out to the provinces hoping to identify new fields for the 21st century. The epicenter of the oil bonanza is the new Baku Hyatt Regency Hotel. Deal makers gather there from London Beirut and Houston to drink Irish beer by the swimming pool while awaiting calls on cellular phones, rented from a Motorola franchise owned by Israeli interests. Though nearly all Azerbaijanis are Shiite Muslims, oil-crazed Baku is remarkably tolerant of anyone who can pay. Baku is one of the few oil-exporting capitals in the world with embassies from Libya and Israel, as well as China, Iraq, Russia and major western nations. In a country so poor that full profes- sors at the national university earn only $20 a month, a single room at the Hyatt costs $330 a night. Yet the Hyatt is so jammed with regulars from the interna- tional oil and construction companies that it has stopped taking reservations through travel agencies. \" At night, oilmen convene to eat imported T-bone steaks at the hotel’s Britannia Pub, swapping stories about their last trip to Kuwait or Little League in Houston. The Azeri whom many of the visiting oilmen want to see is Khoshbakht B. Yusifzade, 67, a geologist who is the main discoverer of the huge oil poten- tial of deepwater oil fields in the Caspi- an. Now a vice president of the Azerba- ijan state oil company SOCAR, he is one of the Azerbaijani negotiators who meets with western oilmen to discuss the likeliest spots where they might strike oil. In 1970, Yusifzade was chosen by Soviet oil ministry bureaucrats in Mos- cow to lead an exploration team to assess how much oil was beneath the Caspian. It took him 18 years, but by the time the Soviet Union collapsed he had determined the contours of 350 poten- tial offshore Caspian oil fields, from the northern waters bordering Kazakhstan to the southern fringe touching Iran, Because of money shortages and dif- ficulties in deepwater drilling, Yusifzade could afford to drill only a few wells to test the “structures” he and his team had delineated using geophysi- cal measurements, Even with his primi- tive equipment, he almost never hit a dry hole, he said. “We just used the test wells to deter: mine that they have oil,” Yusifzade remembered. “What we did was to drill down to the first oil-producing layer to see that our geophysical appraisal was accurate, So it wasn’t a full pleasure.” To Amoco, Exxon, Pennzoil, Statoil, Agip, BP and other big-leaguers in the international oil business, the first srzall export of Azerbaijani “early oil” expected later this year will be just a nibble of a banquet that could go on for half a century. In what Azerbaijan termed the “deal of the century,” the nation’s president and parliament in 1994 granted the AIOC consortium the right to pump oil from three interlinked fields comprising a sausage-shaped 50-mile-long offshore oil deposit. In exchange for 20 percent of the oil revenues, AIOC agreed to invest $8 billion to produce the oil, which had been discovered by Yusifza- de’s exploration team roughly 160 miles east of Baku. Yusifzade’s maps indicate the fields contracted to AIOC are part of a 250- mile-long undersea oil-bearing forma- tion known as the Apsheron Trend that runs from the east coast of Azerbaijan to the west coast of Turkmenistan. He said his research indicated other equally promising oil structures dotted through the Caspian waters off Kazakhstan, Rus- sia and Iran. Terry Adams, the BP exploration spe- cialist who is the consortium president, predicts that within 10 years, oil pro- duction from all sectors of the Caspian Sea could well reach 3 million barrels a day — more than half of Saudi Arabia’s current production. Others say that if pipeline problems can be solved, the potential output from the Caspian could exceed 6 million barrels a day. “This is one of the last provinces in the world where there is a certainty of finding giant fields,” said Adams. “The exploration risk is low, the technology risk is low, but the geopolitical risk is ‘ p h. ” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 15, 1997 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "American on Mir savors challenge By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Star City, Russia — Michael Foale, the American astronaut aboard the damaged Russian Mir space station, spoke about the risks and excitement of his mis- sion shortly before it began in an interview on Dec. 17, 1996. Here are excerpts: Q:The Mir has been up there a long time, not designed to be up for more than five years. And so the question is, what does that make you feel like as the guy who is going up there? ASI think it is overstated how close to the edge the Russian space station is. Always — we’ve seen this with the shuttle also — you can have a story. The satel- lite barely missed the shuttle on the last flight by 10 feet. And it sounds awful. And yes, if they had hit it would have been terri- ble. But the commander was watching, it moved very slowly, it was under control. It is the same situation with the Mir. Yes, the water is being used up. Yes, the oxygen is being used up. But it is under control, and the ON THE NEWS inventories of these consumables are very carefully monitored. There are other systems that may be more critical to the sur- vival of the Mir that he could € | affect an es Ee evacuation jo rather more quickly than run- ning out of oxygen or running out of water. And that would be, for example, the thermal cooling system. That is the one system which the engineers here unani- mously regard as weak. And because the cooling sys- tem uses a form of ethylene gly- col and this leaks into the atmo- sphere, suddenly they then have a whole bunch of more problems, because this chemical, though not particularly harmful to human beings in small quanti- ties, damages the oxygen regen- eration systems very badly, and the water regeneration system that they use for drinking water. QiAs I understand it, they always have a completely reli- able way of getting back. They Q:How does this all make you feel? DAVID J. PHILLIP / Associated Press At Johnson Space Center in Houston, NASA shuttle- Mir director Frank Culbert- son answers questions about the damaged space station. can get back [aboard a Soyuz capsule], but they would have to give up their own station. True? AsYes. Well, they may have to temporarily leave it. Abandoning is a strong word. They would make efforts to go back to it. But I don’t think it is that way out to imagine they would sometime have to leave the station until more supplies or more repair materials were brought up again. That is a possibility. A:To be honest, it sort of adds a certain interest to the whole thing. Because when you imagine yourself working as a scientist for four, five months, maybe six months in space, you are looking for those operational moments that break up the day — EVAs [walks in space], arrival of the Progress vehicles with supplies. If you had to do an evacuation of the station, that would be another interesting experience. None of it would be what I consider partic- ularly life threatening. And so as such, just for me as an interested astronaut, I would find it very interesting. Doing a landing in the Soyuz in Baikonur, in Kazakhstan, would be interesting. It would be a shame for the program, it would set them back in terms of supply, etc. But I believe they would recover from it. How long you can keep doing this, how long you can keep recovering, doing the final fix, hold on just one more year? Obviously they know and we know that it can’t go on indefinitely with Mir, and at some point they have to call it quits. = Mir updates and info: http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office /pao/NewsRoom/today. html http://shuttle-mir.nasa.gov/ shuttle-mir/ http://members.aol.com/K5WX/ index.html Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 27, 1997 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Scorched earth: the Soviet ruins Dying Aral Sea is typical byproduct of ravenous USSR By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Uzbekistan — A few forlorn cows graze .on mesquite-like shrubs that have taken hold in the sandy, pesticide-laced bottom of what until 1960 was a giant inland sea teeming with fish. Back then, in the heyday of* Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and his sweeping “Virgin Lands” policy, the Aral Sea was con- demned by the fiat of the Soviet Water Resources Ministry to shrivel into a poisoned salt desert. Once the size of Lake Huron, the Aral was deprived of its water sources as part of a water diversion scheme to extract more cotton from the plantation economy of Central Asia. Unfortunately, the Aral Sea is typical of the environmental wreckage dotting the former Soviet Union: The indications from across the 11 time zones of - the former empire are that almost none of the ecological catastro- phes have gotten much better since the fall of communism. w At Russia’s once-pristine Lake Baikal, the Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill continues to dump cellulose residues into the 25 million-year- old lake. Proposals introduced in the 1980s to convert the paper mill into a nonpolluting furniture factory have come to nothing. min the Russian Arctic, the smelting giant Norilsk Nickel continues to emit at least 2 mil- lion tons of sulfur dioxide and other air pollutants from two plants on the Kola Peninsula and in northern Siberia. Long known one of world’s most_blatan industrial polluters, Norilsk Nickel has destroyed 400,000} acres of forest from acid rain and spreads its sulfur-dioxide emis- sions as far away as Scandinavia. m At the Chernobyl nuclear power| Station in the Ukraine, water con- f& taminated with the cancer- causing strontium-90 isotope con- tinues to drain into ground water from the runaway reactor’s par- tially unsealed concrete sarcopha- gus, built after the 1986 accident } ” there. None of the 15 other out- moded, RBMK- power reactors in Russia, Ukraine |. and Lithuania has been decom- missioned. About a dozen are gen- |. erating electricity.

When Muynak ceased to be a city, Bakaushin started junking beached ships. ture of airborne dust, nitrogen dioxide and benzopryene was offi- cially found last year to exceed the maximum allowable concen- trations by a factor of 10. When it disclosed these findings, the newspaper Izvestia commented: “Scientists note a paradoxical sit- uation: Enterprises are shutting down in major industrial centers, but the air and water aren’t get- ting any cleaner as a result.” The reason for all this seems rather simple: When the Soviet empire collapsed in 1991, it left behind a trillion-dollar-due bill for more than 70 years of envi- ronmental pillage. So far, neither the inheritors of the empire nor the outside world feel any com- pelling need to pay it. The Aral Sea has continued to shrink even after Uzbekistan gained its independence in August 1991. “Today you can see the Aral Sea only by flying in a plane or helicopter,”’ laments Muynak deputy mayor Rustem Duisenov, 53, who was a sailor on a fishing boat before the Soviet local fleet s abandoned in 198. Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov, an authoritarian figure who was once the first secretary of the Uzbekistan Communist Party, has not tried to reverse the massive Soviet irrigation schemes because his. nation is still eco- nomically hooked on cotton exporting. Instead of cutting back on cot- ton production, Karimov has decreed the introduction of Chinese-style drip irrigation for cotton seedlings in order to boost production while supposedly wasting less water. “Cotton pro- duction must go up,” said Viktor Sumin, general director of the Trade Agency of Uzbekistan in the capital Tashkent, “but not by expanding the planting into new territories.” Yet with all cotton land owned by the state and with no fees assessed for the use of irrigation water, virtually all Uzbekistan’s river water is consumed before it reaches the Aral. Massive quanti- ties of water are still wasted through leaks from old unlined irrigation canals and profligate POtE: at irrigation practices, such as try- ing to flush saline residues and pesticides out of worn out fields. So the Aral Sea continues to shrink. And clouds of salty, pesticide-laced dust residues con- tinue to blow throughout Central Asia for more than 1,000 miles. The only difference is that representatives of Uzbekistan no longer make publicized trips to a parliament in Moscow to com- plain about the rape of their homeland. Even now, there is a way to save the Aral, claims Uzbek envi- ronmentalist Oleg Zaruk, one of a tiny group of intellectuals in the capital Tashkent who still agitate about the Aral Sea “‘catastrophe.” He says Uzbekistan must switeh a very large proportion of the - try’s agriculture from cottan-to less water-intensive crops. + = But Zaruk’s alarms make almost no impact. Independeér has brought even tighter media controls to Uzbekistan, andthe Aral Sea is no longer the cele- brated cause it was in the dying days of the Soviet Union. big Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 29, 1997 \f"

Editors note: Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright recently completed their assignment as Cox Newspapers’ corre- spondents in Moscow. This is their part- ing view. oscow — Valentin Zakharov is a member of a small Russian minority group: He’s a risk-taker. Now he’s getting nervous. When we met Zakharov more than a year ago, he was in debt up to his eye- brows, yet optimistic that the invest- ment he had made to transform the grungy Proletarsky gastronome into a modern food emporium would pay off. Today, the renovation remains half done, scarcely further along than one year ago. The empty, boarded section of the market is even more of an eye- sore next to the slick new glass and metal front of the finished side. Zakharov, 38, not only has failed to pry investment capital out of Russia’s stag- nating economy but also has lost half his old customers. “T’m hanging on by my teeth,” he laments. Zakharov’s efforts to coax a com- mercial butterfly from its gray cocoon have stalled, just like Russia’s attempt to tranform into a modern nation where the economy works and law and democracy rule. And the stopping point is a danger- ous place. A group of “New Russians” — wealthy potentates tied to organized crime — and unelected power brokers have a lock on money and resources, leaving most people stranded under the huge odds weighing against them. This is our take on Russia after a four-year excursion through history in which troughs of state-sanctioned vio- lence and peaks of democratic elec- tions always seemed to lead back to the same basic question: Can Russia climb out of its oppressive past into a free and open future? The way we see things as we depart, it’s not looking good, at least for the rest of this decade. We chose the Proletarsky gastro- nome as a barometer when we came to live here in 1993, a place to revisit periodically to get a feel for life in what had been a prototypical Soviet working-class district. This industrial sector of Moscow, spewing out rubber and metal products that catalyzed the communist economy, was so working class that it took the name Proletarsky in honor of its proletarian population. Shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the gastronome exemplified how communism had failed the Russian people. Back then on a visit, we saw near-barren shelves stretching through the state-run store, where lines of people awaited the priv- ilege to buy a scrap of meat or tin of bony fish. , By the time we arrived as perma- nent correspondents, the store had been privatized. Employees had shares of stock and ran the market, which by then at least had some food to offer — ' eggs, sausage, bread. But not a lot had changed. The old store director was the new store director, and his one innovation was leasing space to an entrepreneur selling exotic liquors and metallic balloons. The touch of color, however, didn’t keep customers from scowling as they counted out rubles to cover inflated prices. It wasn’t until Zakharov entered the scene in 1995 that a real face lift began. He had been an early risk-taker in import trading and accumulated enough money by 1995 to buy a con- trolling share in his old neighborhood grocery, which was foundering under new taxes, high prices and the alien MARCIA KUNSTEL / Cox News Service Out on a limb: Valentin Zakharov looks over the inventory in his remodeled store in Moscow, the Proletarsky gastronome. Russians’ craving for order and familiarity means many don’t like the convenience Zakharov offers. We thought he produced an eco- nomic miracle, renovating the smelly, dirty, ill-provisioned store into a cor- nucopia of capitalism. He expanded the food line and added pricey Italian furniture and more reasonable cloth- ing. There were blueprints for a beer garden, coffee bar and state-of-the-art refrigerated cases for more expansion. We took Zakharov’s daring, and its visible results on the store’s shelves, as a sign that Russia slowly was pulling itself out of the dregs left behind b the failed communist system. So why is he — and the rest of the country — having so much trouble today? Zakharov, for one thing, misread the growth of the Russian pocketbook and the workings of the Russian psyche. This has been one of the most puz- zling things to us as Americans in Rus- sia. Today’s Russians aren’t bundled in dreary gray any longer. So we expect them to think and behave like they look — like fashionable, modern Western- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 6, 1997 > \fEDWARD OPP / Special Under cover: enn ae Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright ride the subway.

Russians’ craving for orderand . familiarity means many don’t like the convenience Zakharov offers — the one-stop shopping Americans demand. Two-thirds of the customers quizzed recently said they didn’t like seeing food and clothes and furniture in a sin- gle store. Beyond that, Zakharov created a house of wishes, a shopping emporium for a middle class that has yet to issue from Russia. One reason is that so many Russians lack the penchant for risk-taking and change. Take the Hammer and Sickle Metal- lurgical Factory not far from the gas- tronome. The average monthly wage there is about 1 million rubles ($175). It is higher than the national average of 903,000 rubles ($158), but below the 1.2 million ($210) average in Moscow. For three months last year, business was so bad that workers didn’t get paid. Did people quit? No. Did they goon + strike? No. Did they even complain to their bosses? No sign of it. Alexandra Poveshnikova, 34, said she never considered leaving the place where she has worked for 16 years, even in the bad days just before the factory went into bankruptcy and was reorganized. Separated from her hus- band, she is raising four children on a salary of $200 a month. “T came here when I was a young girl. I worked in the warehouse, and now I’m a customs broker,” she explained. “There are a lot of families that work here, parents and grandpar- ents and children. Several generations of them.” We have found such risk-averse people all over Russia, people who simply accept the country’s $12 billion in wage and pension arrears. It’s sim- plistic to attribute this just to the pas- sive nature of Russians who experi- enced generations of authoritarianism under czars allied with the Russian Orthodox Church and then under the Bolsheviks. Or to the early communal imperatives of life in a harsh climate with marginal soil. But the tendency exists and undeniably contributes to today’s inertia. There are more tangible explana- tions, too. A legiti- mate job in any major city requires a living permit, and those are still almost impossible to come by. Hous- ing is tight and expensive. Russians up to President Boris Yeltsin blame much of the country’s eco- nomic ills on the corrupt and inept managers who manipulated the chaos following the collapse of commu- nism, taking greedy dips into pots of cash meant to pay salaries or buy sup- plies. The pernicious corruption infecting the country contributes to the woes of the Prolestarsky gastronome. Working Russians couldn’t imagine, for example, buying the purple velve- teen couch selling at Prolestarsky for $1,500. Instead they haunt what has become the bane of Zakharov’s busi- MARCIA KUNSTEL / Cox News Service Variety: .A vendor sells ice cream, soda, beer and candy in front of the Proletarsky gastronome. ness: wholesale outdoor markets and other gray- and black-market outlets proliferating in Russia’s free-for-all atmosphere where criminality prevails but the prices are lower. “Already, 50 percent of our custom- ers have gone,” Zakharov said. The Interior Ministry estimates that $16 billion in contraband goods came into Russia last year without any cus- toms payment. Massive tax evasion is requiring emergency budget cutbacks in a country that already has watched health and social services shrivel. Zakharov hopes Moscow will crack down on the unlicensed vendors and has applied to a new city program offer- ing commercial loans at 17.75 percent. Whether the money is funneled into corrupt channels or reaches stores such as the gastronome remains to be seen. “We're OK with our taxes; we've paid all those, but we owe our suppliers,” Zakharov said. ‘We asked for $1 million to pay our debts and finish the renova- tion work.” He owes $700,000, but fig- ures that consolidating his debt would give him some breathing space. Without the loan, Zakharov has one more card to play. He will sell about a fifth of his building. He would have to burn the blueprints for the new ; expanded food sec- tion, but at least he wouldn’t lose every- thing. Zakharov may exhibit a decidedly un-Russian trait in taking the risk to plow yet more money into his store. At the same time he also has what we have found in four years to be a very Russian habit of turning sardonic humor on his own tough times. “There’s a saying nowadays,” he said. “<The more you owe, the longer you live.’ It means the mafia won’t come until we have money.” The ability to laugh at a very bad sit- uation keeps a lot of Russians from weeping. We wonder how long it will keep them from taking to the streets to demand a better, fairer life., \f"

On reading, we have been imprassed by the thoroughness cf their research and by the dignified, even-handed manner in which they have treated the subject. It looks as though it will be a very nicely produced book, and, but for one problem, ane we could comfartably recommend te our friends. That problem, however, is for us a vary serious one: we very strongly edject to the title and subtitle. Ferhaps mot surprisingly, our feelings about this are much stronger than those of the authors. We want to explain them to you directiy in the hope of cbtaining more consideration. The book is a serious investigation of certain historical events that took place half a century age; but the wording of the title and subtitle inmakes it gound like a spy thriller gbout things that happened last week. No doubt this impression is partially offset oy tha overall! visual effect of the cover, which indeed we find very attractive; but my name, together with the words ‘bomoshell', ‘Ssecret', ‘spy’ and 'conspiracy'in close proximity, convey a sensational impression which in our opinion misrepresents the intention of the authors, the charaster of the main protagonist, anda the point of the book. when we firat began our discussions with the authers we understood that their book would cover & number of people and the whole panorama of political and scientific thinking of the time, in which Ted Hall would te just a pact. As the work progressed it became evident that he was going to Play a very prominent role. However, though he emerged as the most prominent personality, he is by no means the whole subject of the book. There were other peapie invelved who skovld not be reduced ta the role of mere adjuncts to his biography. More ifpertantly, the book's significance ies not in the story of one individual, but in its reappraisal of the political and moral issues involved. The title and subtitle you have chosen give no inkling of these aspacts - as if you thought the American public wouldn't be interested unless it was hyped up and marketed as a thriller. To be the subject of something which appears like that, with my name prominent an the cover, is deeply repugnant to me. We understand you were prepared to consider changing the subtitle on eondition I agreed to give an interview on ‘60 Minutes’. Unfortunately, after giving sérious consideration to that proposal, for the present 1 have G@ecided against it for several reasons including my state of health. But your readiness to consider such a des] makes it clear that even at this Tate date a change of subtitie is technically possible, and we urge you to do it anyway. We believe the book will be a success - it is very good and is certain to arouse public interest, We fesl very strongly that the authors, the events in question and the people involved in them deserve a better, less sensationalistic titie.

BY JOSEPH ALBRIGHT AND MARCIA KUNSTEL THE BO WHO GAVE AWA THE BOM ON A LATE WINTER MORNING, WE WERE SET- tling once again around the kitchen table at Theo- dore and Joan Hall’s pleasant brick row house near Cambridge University. Outside the sliding glass doors to their back garden, a feeble sun was making no headway against the gray English day. But it was light and warm enough inside, and the wall of snapshots overlooking the table — chil- dren and grandchildren, siblings and friends — generated a cheery warmth of family love. Hall, who is a little bent at age 71 and forced by illness into a slow, shuffling walk, had just fin- Theodore Hall, 1943. ished a bowl of what his wife calls the “cardboard cornflakes,” the cheapest house brand from Sainsbury’s market. “The good thing about them,” he liked to say, “is that if you run out of the cereal, you can cut up the box, add some milk and you won’t know the difference.” Parkinson’s disease and kidney cancer have taken a toll, but the retired American biophysicist remains wry and sharp. Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel recently completed a four-year as- signment as the Moscow correspondents of the Co:-. Newspapers. This article is based on their book “Bombshell: The Secret Story of Amer- ica’s Unknown Atomic Spy Conspiracy,” to be published next month by Times Books/Random House. But we were not there on a social call. Almost two years before, in mid-1995, “Teodor Kholl” had turned up in decrypted Soviet intelli- gence cables released by America’s National Security Agency. Drawing on intelligence sources in Russia and the United States, we had identi- fied Hall as an atomic spy, the long-rumored third spy at America’s Los Alamos bomb laboratory. The only people at Los Alamos known and convicted as Soviet agents were the German Klaus Fuchs and the American David Greenglass, whose espionage led to the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. But Hall, who was then a conscience-driven idealist of 19, was the first to provide the Soviets with the crucial information that helped them build the bomb. We assembled his story from archival research and interviews in America, Russia and Britain — sometimes with the help of the Halls, sometimes in spite of them. In 100 hours of interviews over 18 months, Hall was cagey, fearing the F.B.I. might reopen its long-dormant espio- nage investigation. Never once did we hear a direct, on-the-record ac- knv- zledgment from Hall himself. He needed more time to think about it, he said, more time to fill in the blanks in his memory: to ponder what he had done during World War II, back when his precocious gift for quantum mechanics got him recruited from Harvard’s senior class to become the young- est physicist at Los Alamos.

After al- lowing us time for the words to sink in, Hall found a fine-tipped pen on a kitchen shelf and signed the document in his neat, minuscule handwriting. This is part of what Hall wrote: “During 1944 I was worried about the dan- gers of an American monopoly of atomic weap- ons if there should be a postwar depression. To help prevent that monopoly I contemplated a brief encounter with a Soviet agent, just to in- form them of the existence of the A-bomb project. I anticipated a very limited contact. With any luck it might easily have turned out that way, but it was not to be. Now I am casti- gated in some quarters as a traitor, although the Soviet Union at the time was not the enemy but the ally of the United States; the Soviet people fought the Nazis heroically, at tremendous hu- man cost, and this may well have saved the Western Allies from defeat. “Tt has even been alleged that I ‘changed the course of history.’ Maybe the ‘course of hirzo- ry,’ if unchanged, could have led to atomic war in the past 50 years — for example the bomb might have been dropped on China in 1949 or the early 50’s. Well, if I helped to prevent that, I accept the charge. ...” to arrenge lin- with BEX ts. Ye oon” oe THE SON OF A JEWISH FURRIER WHO HAD FLED Russian pogroms, Ted Hall demonstrated his ex- traordinary intellect early on. He made quick work of PS. 173, the public school in the Wash- ington Heights neighborhood of New York City where he grew up during the Depression. By ju- nior high, he had not only skipped three grades but was a teacher’s helper in algebra class. In 1937, the chubby-cheeked boy of 11 sat through citywide examinations and won one of about 80 places in Townsend Harris High New York Times Magazine - September 14, 1997 (Continued) > School, then an elite public school for boys. In- fluenced by left-wing literature that his older brother brought home from City College of New York, Ted joined the leftist American Stu- dent Union when he was 12 or 13. He soon envi- sioned a two-track career for himself. In addition to pursuing theoretical physics, he says, “I also felt that I hada social debt,.that people should do things which would benefit humanity.” Impressive scores on New York Regents ex- ams propelled him on his way. In 1940, he was tentatively admitted to Columbia University, but then turned away because he was only 14. He enrolled at Queens College and, in 1942, transferred to Harvard. The deadline for Har- vard had passed, but Hall applied anyway. Seek- ing scientific whiz kids for the war effort, Har- vard accepted the tall, slender 16-year-old and made him a junior. He was assigned to Leverett House, a magnet for leftist intellectuals that was widely known as “Moscow on the Charles.” Of the 3,494 Har- vard undergraduates in the fall of 1942, no more than a dozen were active participants in Har- vard’s main pro-Communist organization, the John Reed Society. Hall’s two roommates that first year happened to be among its leaders. Both were so witty and articulate that their in- fluence on Hall was instantaneous. “My room- mates as a matter of fact are quite brilliant,” Ted wrote to his brother Ed. The deeper that Hall dug into Harvard’s cur- riculum of advanced math and physics, the more captivated he became — and the more his talent became evident to his professors. With the na- tion running short of physicists for myriad war projects, it was natural that the Harvard physics department suggested Hall when Washington requested four candidates to work as junior physicists at Los Alamos. He was interviewed for a position sometime around his 18th birth- day, on Oct. 20, 1943. After the interview, Saville Sax, his leftist, literary-minded roomate, mur- mured a startling thought: “If this turns out to be a weapon that is really awful, what you should do about it is tell the Russians.” Ted immediately took him aside and told him never to say such a thing, not even as a joke. But Hall wasn’t too harsh; he had been thinking the same thing. bel Peace Prize winner Joseph Rotblat. Often, Rotblat remembered, these conversations re- volved around the same question bothering Hall: Wouldn’t the postwar world be more sta- ble if the bomb were shared with the Russians? At Los Alamos, Hall would earn a reputation as a rebel. Once drafted, he became Private Hall. But he never learned to salute properly and frequently forgot to say “sir.” One time he was reported AWOL for 10 days after he de- cided to stay with civilian friends rather than in his barracks. Hall hated hats, and once tried to destroy his regulation Army cap with a band saw. (The material was too tough.) He won a ruling from the base legal officer that he could wear a yarmulke instead of the cap. “He was the least religious Jew you can imagine,” says a former colleague at Los Alamos, Sam Cohen, “but he found a way to tweak them at every op- portunity.” In October 1944, Hall used his two weeks of annual leave to return home to celebrate his 19th birthday with his family in Forest Hills. By that time, he had decided he would try to in- form the Russians about the atomic bomb project. In New York, he looked up his old Harvard roommate, Saville Sax, the ideological soulmate Hall knew he could rely upon. The two devised a plan that led Hall eventually to the purchasing office of Amtorg, the Soviet trade company located at 238 West 28th Street. There, he told the Russians he had information to volunteer and was directed to his first Soviet control officer, Sergei Kurnakov, a Russian working as a journalist for left-wing publica- tions. Kurnakov accepted them both — Hall as informant and Sax as his courier. BOUT TWO MONTHS LATER, HALL and Sax arranged a rendezvous in Al- buquerque so amateurish it would have made their controller cringe. Soviet spies were trained to scour the streets for sur- veillance before risking any clandestine en- counter. Instead of converging on the meeting place, Hall and Sax both approached from the same direction. To make matters worse, they accidentally bumped into each other in the street some distance from their meeting spot. Luckily for them, nobody was watching. \fAfter reaching a private place, Sax took out a single piece of paper he had brought in his shoe from New York. The Soviets had posed a tech- nical question involving the use of sulfur diox- ide, possibly to test Hall’s bona fides. Sax car- ried back to New York a piece of paper far more important. It was only a page or two, some- thing Hall had written by hand during breaks from his work. What Hall gave his Harvard roommate was the “implosion principle,” a rad- ical departure from previous designs for ignit- ing a nuclear explosion. Scientists at Los Alamos had been testing various explosive methods to produce the pres- sure in the bomb core needed to achieve critical mass — and thus set off a nuclear blast. But none of these worked well with plutonium, which was the primary bomb fuel available to them. So they turned to implosion, in which critical mass is attained so rapidly that the risk of a misfire is eliminated. Hall’s paper included a description in the form of equations of howa plutonium implosion bomb might work. On Feb. 28, 1945, Moscow’s N.K.G.B. head- quarters finished its first comprehensive report in two years on atomic intelligence. “The ma- terials are of great interest,” responded the head of the Soviet bomb project, Igor Kurchatov, af- ter reviewing the report. Kurchatov had never heard of implosion and didn’t even have a Rus- she warned that they were involved in a dan- gerous business and “things might tum out to be pretty hot.” Hall scarcely found reassuring Cohen’s promises that the Kremlin would res- cue him to a great new future in Moscow, should the need arise. But they hadn’t come to debate the merits of life in Russia, so Hall passed his papers to Cohen. There were five or six handwritten sheets— that is what stuck in Ted Hall’s memory. On one page, he had drawn an actual diagram of a dummy bomb. “ater, Soviet officials assessed what Cohen brought back from Los Alamos as “priceless” and “urgently needed in Moscow.” The fact that it neatly paralleled what Klaus Fuchs was delivering relieved Moscow of al- most paralyzing fears that it might be the victim of a disinformation campaign For nearly a decade, Sax, Chern and her hus- band, Morris, also a Soviet intelligence recruit, would weave in and out of Ted Hall’s life as he wavered in and out of the spy network. Hall es- caped prosecution precisely because of the irreg- ular pattern of his spy contacts after the war’s end. At the very time a decoded Soviet cable made him the target of an F.B.I. espionage inves- tigation in 1950, Hall had just departed the net- work so he could campaign in Chicago parks and street corners for progressive causes. Hall and Sax and their young wives were living like typical the Queen Mary. Cambridge is where they stayed, and where Hall won international ac- claim for developing the *Hall Method” of us- ing an electron microscope to map minute con- centrations of trace elements within a cell. In 1995, the National Security Agency re- leased the decrypted November 1944 cable naming “Teodor Kholl” and “Savil Saks” as vol- unteer Soviet informants. Within weeks, vis- itors and phone calls pierced the Hall’s quiet re- tirement, destroying their hopes that they had outlived the risk of a public accounting. No American or British authorities came calling, however. With the deaths of Sax, the Cohens and four of Hall’s Soviet overseers, thé F.B.I. had little prospect of finding a living eyewitness who could directly tie Hall to espionage. Of course, there is a personal accounting for Hall to render. In one reflective moment, he ac- knowledged having had some second thoughts following disclosures of the brutality of the re- gime he had aided. “I think my emotional revul- sion against Stalin’s terror would have stopped me in my tracks,” he said. “Simple as that.” Back in 1945, however, Hall was more wor- ried about the consequences of an American monopoly of the bomb. “I had been thinking and reading about poli- tics since an early age,” He and Joan remained uncomfortable in America. The chance of renewed investigation always nagged, and besides, they found the political climate of 50’s America unpalatable. sian word for the concept. He had to call it “ex- plosion toward the inside.” Until now, historians have assumed that one of two convicted spies, Fuchs or Greenglass, supplied this first crucial information on implo- sion. But Greenglass was just a machinist with- out clearance for the implosion secret. And de- classified Soviet cables now prove that Fuchs had been out of touch with Moscow for months. One day before the Soviet intelligence summary was completed, a cable from Lubyan- ka about Fuchs demanded that its New York agents immediatély report “what he has been doing since August.” Documents indicate that twice more in 1945, first in the spring and then in August, the agent “Mlad” shared with the Soviets details of bomb development on the mesa. With the exception of one early cable, Hall’s Soviet handlers called Hall by this code name, which is derived from a Slavic root meaning “young.” (Sax was code- named “Star,” meaning “old.”) After Sax went back to Harvard, Hall’s new courier became a wily young woman who had been a radical since she was 13 and working ina New York garment factory. She was Lona Petka Cohen, the daughter of Polish Catholic immi- grants in the dour mill town of Adams, Mass. Cohen was far more professional than either Hall or Sax. When Hall showed up three weeks late for their August meeting in Albuquerque, New York Times Magazine - September 14, 1997 (Continued) grad students with garden-variety radical ideas. Intense surveillance produced no sign of ongo- ing espionage, and F.B.I. interrogators failed to extract a confession from Hall or Sax. Unable to use the top-secret decrypted Soviet cable in court — intelligence agencies didn’t want the So- viets to know their code had been broken — the EB.I. never could build a prosecutable case. But the menacing prospect of arrest was enough to drive the Halls back into the arms of a Soviet agent, who arorad the end of 1951 again offered to help them flee America when- ever necessary. Hall left the University of Chi- cago’s prestigious Institute for Radiobiology and Biophysics for a quiet research post in bio- physics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York. There, he and his family could more easily slip away, if the need should ~u,8e. As it turns out, by the time the Halls bolted to New York the F.B.I. had just downgraded ‘all from its list of the most-urgent espionage suspects. After more than a year without F.B.I. tails or interrogations, Hall abandoned the Soviet net- work for good in 1953. Yet he and Joan re- mained uncomfortable in the United States. The chance of renewed investigation always nagged at them, and besides, they found the po- litical climate of 50’s America unpalatable. When an opportunity came in 1962 to spend a year at the Cavendish Laboratory of Cam- bridge University, the Halls gratefully boarded he wrote in an early draft of his statement, “and had seen that in a capitalistic society, eco- nomic depression could lead to fascism, aggres- sion and war — as actually happened in Italy and Germany. So as I worked at Los Alamos and understood the destructive power of the atomic bomb, I asked myself what might happen if World War II was followed by a de- pression in the United States while it had an atomic monopoly? “In fact, I was very optimistic. I didn’t believe that there would necessarily be a depression, or that a depression would necessarily lead to war. But it seemed to me that an American monopoly was dangerous and should be prevented. ...” In any event, Hall expressed no apologies. “In 1944 I was 19 years old — immature, inex- perienced and far too sure of myself,” he wrote. “I recognize that I could easily have been wrong in my judgment of what was necessary, and that I was indeed mistaken about some things, in particular my view of the nature of the Soviet state. The world has moved on a lot since then, and certainly so have I. But in es- sence, from the gerspective of my 71 years, I still think that brash youth had the right end of the stick. I am no longer that person; but I am by no means ashamed of him.” = Hall and his wife, Joan, at home, {997. \fy eee edie etgee LETTERS | «2ieciesiecew cot tier BOS Athens goroenpeed wey allannne io gral ze 7 : | Hi HE FROM PrEAce Peocess Te PoLtict Peocess i fi FE ri if i | me does mot hawe no be an admirer of Wasir Acar or Fibnil Rapoub oo predict chat should they be femaored from the aot, : x fy in lh | & f 535? i FH iyi AC aevy rate, if ot digerese- ingly easy to eee how there Tay : = Hie ite fi i if i r!

        "ocr_text": "Spy story: How secrets can thwart war GLOBE STAFF A brilliant American scientist who slipped atomic secrets to the So- viet Union during World War IT has broken his silence. In a book titled “Bombshell: The Secret Story of America’s Unknown Atomic Spy Conspiracy,” two jour- nalists, Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel, detail how a Harvard grad- uate named Theodore Alvin Hall be- trayed findings of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, N. M. Hall, who lives with his wife in Cambridge, England, after a career as a biophysicist, had refused to talk about charges of espionage, even after documents released two years ago implicated him as a Soviet agent. But Hall told Albright and Kun- stel that he became a spy for Josef Stalin because he feared that a nu- clear monopoly could lead to a nucle- ar disaster. He acknowledged that as a young Communist, he misjudged the brutality of the Soviet state, but he insisted that history has proved him right by at least one measure: The Cold War ended without the use of nuclear weapons. “In 1944, I was 19 years old - im- mature, inexperienced, and far too sure of myself,” Hall wrote. “But in essence, from the perspective of my 71 years, I still think that brash youth had the right end of the stick. I am no longer that person, but I am by no means ashamed of him.” Hall was investigated by the FBI in the late 1940s and 1950s, Evidence of his espionage did not become pub- lie until 1995, when declassified doe- uments suggested that he was the Soviet spy code-named “Mlad.” Hall has received far less notori- ety than scientist Karl Fuchs or ma- chinist David Greenglass, who also betrayed secrets of Los Alamos, or Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who went to the electric chair in 1953 for working with the Soviets. But he may have been even more helpful to the Soviet Union, which exploded its first nuclear weapon only four years after the Americans. In “Bombshell,” which is excerpt- ed today in The New York Times Magazine, Albright and Kunstel re- port on how Hall’s sketches and de- scriptions of the Manhattan Pro- ject’s work were smuggled out of Los Alamos in a Kleenex box. The information was so detailed, the book says, that one Russian spymas- ter said he could have used it to build a bomb himself. Hall defends his actions, He said he had been worried that a postwar depression could lead the United States to use the bomb again, and he admired Soviet courage as an ally in the war against Nazi Germany, Without the fear that the Soviets would retaliate, the United States might have bombed China in 1949, or in the Korean War, Hall said. “It has even been alleged that | changed the course of history,” he said, “Maybe the cowrse of history, if unchanged, would have led to atomic war in the last 50 years, ...

        "ocr_text": "Ex-N.M. Man Gave Secret To Soviets Ex-LANL Physicist Reveals Role in Book By ROBERT BURNS The Associated Press WASHINGTON — A retired American physicist long suspected of having spied for the Soviet Union in the 1940s has spoken out for the first time on his role in apparently helping the Soviets break an American monopoly on atomic weapons. In two written statements to the authors of a new book on his case, Theodore A. Hall explained his motive and intentions in con- tacting a Soviet agent in 1944 when he was a 19- year-old physicist at the Los Alamos laboratory where scientists were secretly developing the world’s first atomic bombs. Hall, now 71 and liv- ing in England, did not admit in his statement that he committed any specific act of espi- onage. But he made clear that, at the time, he believed the world would be safer if Moscow had the bomb. “During 1944 I was worried about the dangers of an American monopoly of atom- ic weapons if there should be a postwar depression,” Hall wrote in a statement. “To help prevent that monopoly, I con- templated a brief encounter with a Soviet agent, just to inform them of the existence of the A-bomb project. I anticipated a very limited contact. With any luck it might eas- nce turned out that way, but it was not to be.” Hall provided his statement to authors Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel for their book, “Bombshell: The Secret Story of America’s Unknown Atomic Spy Conspira- cy,” to be published Oct. 1 by Times Books/Random House. The authors are reporters for the Cox Newspapers. The statement was released Sunday. HALL: 19-year- old LANL scien- tist In 1944 Historians have long believed that convicied spies David Green- glass and Klaus Fuchs had given the Soviets the first information on the “implosion principle” developed at Los Alamos as a new way to ignite an atomic bomb. Albright and Kun- stel say their research shows it was Hall who divulged it first. In late 1944, according to the book, Hall arranged a rendezvous in New Mexico with his old Harvard roommate, Saville Sax. Hall gave Sax a piece of paper on which he had written a description of the implosion principle. Sax took the paper to their Soviet control officer, Sergei Kurnakov, in New York. Twice more in 1945, Hall, who was referred to by his Soviet handlers as “Mlad,” gave the Soviets details of bomb development at Los Alamos, the book says. Later the Soviets called this information “priceless,” according to the book. In one of his two written state- ments to Albright and Kunstel, Hall recalled his mindset in 1944. “My decision about contacting the Soviets was a gradual one, and it was entirely my own. It was entire- ly voluntary, not influenced by any other individual or by any organiza- tion ... I was never ‘recruited’ by anyone,” he wrote. Albright and Kunstel said they interviewed Hall for more than 100 hours over 18 months. They described him as “cagey, fearing the FBI might reopen its long-dor- mant espionage investigation.” Asked Monday whether the Jus- tice Department was considering any action in the Hall case, spokesman John Russell said, “There is nothing imminent on this. Beyond that, we have no comment.” A decoded Soviet cable made Hall the target of an FBI investigation in 1950, but intense surveillance of his activities while he was living in Chicago produced no evidence of espionage, the authors wroie. The decoded Soviet cable was not used as evidence because U.S. intel- ligence agencies’ didn’t want Moscow to know they had broken their codes. The cable, which is reproduced in the Albright and Kunstel book, names Hall and Sax as Soviet informants. Haii is described as bright and “politically developed.” The FBI questioned Hall and Sax separately in March 1951 but could not get them to confess. Sax died in September 1980. Hall was a scientific whiz from an extraordinarily early age. He entered Harvard in 1942 as a 16- year-old. The government was actively recruiting physicists for the war effort, and the Harvard physics department recommended Hall. He was interviewed for the position of junior physicist in Octo- ber 1943, the book says, and he arrived at the secret Los Alamos lab on Jan. 27, 1944. Hall and his wife, Joan, moved to England in 1962 when he took a posi- tion at the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University. There he gained international acclaim for developing the “Hall method” of using an electron microscope to map minute concentrations of trace elements within a cell. In his written statement released Sunday, Hall said he was not ashamed of his past but regards his actions as misguided. “In 1944 I was 19 years old — immature, inexperienced and far too sure of myself,” he wrote. “I rec- ognize that I could easily have been wrong in my judgment of what was necessary, and that I was indeed mistaken about some things.” Albuquerque Tribune - September 16, 1997 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Atomic spy finally tells his story By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Los Alamos, N.M. n Sundays, Theodore Alvin Hall lounged on his dormitory bed at Los Ala- mos and ruminated while classi- cal 78s revolved on his Victrola. He was the youngest physicist recruited to help create the first atomic bomb, and the work enthralled him. “I would be will- ing to live on whale blubber alone in an igloo at the South Pole for a crack at the same job,” he wrote to his sister-in-law on May 20, 1944. But could Ted Hall limit him- self to fathoming the complexities of atomic physics? Other dimen- sions of his life seemed just as important. What if capitalist America got the atomic bomb and then collapsed into an economic depression? For someone who had been attracted to Marxism enough to join the John Reed Society at Harvard, this question did not seem far-fetched. Nor did the follow-up: What if postwar depression dragged a nuclear America so far down that the _country fell into the hands of fas- cist leaders, as happened in Ger- many? Could that lead to another world war? As he lay on his bed in New Mexico, Hall chewed over a con- cept of morality that had ‘intrigued him ever since he was -1S and living with his parents, immigrant Barney Holtzberg and his wife, Rose, back in Forest « Hills, N.Y. To be really fulfilled, he must pursue two careers in parallel. Qne would be an “ivory tower” existence in which he enjoyed theoretical physics for the sheer pleasure of it. The other somehow would pay back what he liked to think was his social debt to humanity. Could this be Ted Hall’s time to repay his social debt? Over three or four months in the summer of 1944, Hall’s thinking ratcheted up to a riskier notch. Shouldn’t some- one take steps to break America’s monopoly on atomic research before it was too late? Was it his moral duty to inform the wartime ‘allies in Moscow about the bomb? Hall was a physics prodigy so gifted that he was asked to join the Manhattan Project when he was an 18-year-old senior in the ‘Class of 1944 at Harvard. In war- time Los Alamos, working under J. Robert Oppenheimer and . Bruno Rossi, Hall helped deter- mine the critical mass of uranium for the Hiroshima bomb and then became a team leader on the early implosion tests for Fatman, the Nagasaki plutonium bomb. . Tohis friends and co-workers, Hall was a brilliant young rebel with a boundless future in atomic science. At Stalin’s spy headquar- ters on Lubyanka Square, he was’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution about to become something else: “Mlad,” the Russians’ first mole at Los Alamos, a hidden asset who slipped them the implosion prin- ciple and later the layout of the bomb itself weeks before they obtained other versions of the bomb specifications from their spies Klaus Fuchs and David Greenglass. After a half-century of obscuri- ty, Hall’s name broke into the open last year in a decoded 1944 Soviet intelligence cable released by the U.S. National Security Agency. But the story published in The Washington Post soon fad- ed. . Nobody with the power to demand an accounting in court pressed for one. With the deaths of Saville Sax and Lona Cohen, the couriers who brought Hall’s data from Los Alamos, there was no longer any living eyewitness who could directly tie Hall to espionage. Hall simply avoided public comment and kept on liv- ing a quiet retirement in England, near the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, where he had gone in 1962 to work in elec- tron microscopy. Yet on one level Ted Hall and his wife, Joan, wanted to explain his role in history while Hall, suf- fering from kidney cancer and Parkinson’s disease, still could manage the strain of interviews. - September 17, 1997 > Atomic spy finally tells his story Theodore Hall, shown as a young American physicist and in 1990, says he was an idealist who helped break the U.S. monopoly on atomic weap- ons because he feared the United States could turn fascist and nuclear power could fall into wrong hands. By the time of the Post’s article, the Halls had begun telling us their story in private, with the stipulation that everything be embargoed for at least one year. They wouldn’t tell us every- thing — not with the risk that the FBI might reopen the espionage investigation that lasted from 1950 to the mid-1960s without producing evidence to prosecute him. So the rest of the story of Hall and the spy ring known as “the Volunteers” had to be accu- mulated from archives and inter- views in Moscow, Washington, Los Alamos and elsewhere. As Hall ruminated in that sum- mer of 1944, his Los Alamos dor- mitory room would vibrate with his favorite piece, Strauss’ Opus 20, ““Ein Heldenleben (A Hero’s Life).’”’ While many of his genera- tion were listening to Glenn Mill- er’s “String of Pearls,” Hall’s tastes centered on Mahler, Prok- oviev and the overripe romanticism of Richard Strauss. Sometimes Hall couldn’t help imagining himself as a romantic hero taking on an evil world. His other Strauss favorite at Los Ala- mos was the rollicking symphonic poem “Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks.”’ The music celebrated the folk tales of the irrepressible German prankster Till, who made kings and peasants smile at his cunning tricks at the very moment he was duping them. There was a rarefied, fast- metabolism atmosphere about Los Alamos that speeded the matura- tion of Hall’s ideas. The intellec- tual soil was far more fertile to Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 17, 1997 (Continued) > \fSecret conspiracy: In ailing health, Theodore Hall has decided to outline how he, as a young dreamer and physics genius, decided to share with Russians the findings of his work on bombs to be used on Japan. Soviet sympathy and globalist musings than leaders of the Los. Alamos laboratory would acknowledge, either then or later. But as time passed, it became more and more evident that war- time Los Alamos was spiked with discussions on the politics of the bomb, with participants including the Nobel-Prize-winning Danish physicist Niels Bohr and the future Nobel Peace Prize winner Joseph Rotblat. Often, Rotblat remembered, the conversations revolved around the same ques- tion bothering Hall: Would the postwar world be more stable if the bomb were shared with the Russians? On Oct. 15, 1944, Hall left Los Alamos for two weeks of annual leave. He was going home to cele brate his 19th birthday with his family in Forest Hills. But by the time he departed, he had all but decided he would try to inform the Russians about the atomic bomb project. Once in New York, he never looked back. Striding into Manhattan, Ted Hall moved like a man with a pur pose. Fast. Determined. He weaved around the less energetic or less focused who didn’t match his pace, which meant just about everyone else on the pavement. That is how he often walked, in silent competition with the rest of LT] WOTLC On that mid-October day in 1944, Hall had a pressing objec- tive. He was en route to the pur- chasing office and warehouse of the Soviet trade company Amtorg at 238 W. 28th St. That was where Hall first told the Russians he had information to volunteer, and where he was directed to his first NKGB control officer, Sergei Kurnakov. Shortly before this walk down- town, Hall refined his plan at Saville Sax’s apartment at 15 W. 75th St. His loyal friend and former Harvard roommate was the one person Hall could rely on. Most Americans would have been scandalized at Hall’s plan to give top-secret defense data to a Com- munist regime, even an allied one; he was right to assume Sax would not disapprove. Sax the undisciplined dreamer was a dif. ferent sort from the probing sci- entist Hall, but politically they shared a world view.

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS New York few phrases, a few pas- sages of poetry, that’s all it took to fool the censors. Theodore Alvin Hall, an idealistic young American physicist work- ing on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos, N.M., and his New York friend Saville Sax had per- fected the Walt Whitman code during Hall's October 1944 vaca- tion in New York. Each owned the same edition of “Leaves of Grass,” and they decided to make it their code book. Their cipher system was really quite primitive. All it could communicate was a time and date for a clandestine meeting in New Mexico. As things turned out, “Leaves of Grass” was the ideal code book for fixing dates. Whit- man had attached to each of his verses a number from 1 to 31 and beyond, and each verse had a dozen lines or more. Both Hall and Sax had become fearful that if America alone got the atomic bomb and then col- lapsed into an economic depres- ‘sion, the weapon could fall into the hands of fascists. They had decided to sh@re the bomb infor- mation with Moscow. Sax would be Hall’s courier to deliver infor- mation from Los Alamos to the Soviets. Within weeks after Hall’s vaca- tion, he and Sax began to exchange letters. Through the Walt Whitman code they arranged a meeting in Albuquerque, N.M. Hall’s rendezvous with Sax was so amateurish it would have made their controller cringe. Soviet agents are trained to scour the . site of a contact for potential sur- veillance. But instead of converg- ing on the meeting place in Albu- querque, Hall and Sax approached from the same direc- tion. They ‘‘bumped into each other in the street” some distance from their pre-planned meeting spot. Fortunately for them, no one was watching. Hall had taken a room in a hotel near the Albuquerque train station and Sax was already checked in at another hotel. After . reaching a private spot, Sax took out a single piece of paper that he had brought inside his shoe all the way from New York. On the paper was a question given to Sax by a Soviet intelligence officer involv- ing the use of sulfur-dioxide, pos- sibly to test Hall’s bona fides. Sax and Hall spent only that one evening together in Albuquer- que before Hall had to hurry north to Los Ajamos. Sax carried back to New York a piece of paper Atlanta Constitution - Theodore Hall’s story as the man who leaked atomic secrets is emerging ina new book. far more important than a response on sulfur-dioxide. It was a page or two, something Hall had written by hand during one of his breaks from work in the Gadget Division. What Hall gave his Har- vard roommate that day was a radical concept for assembling a critical mass. The idea would become the key to the invention of ‘the plutonium bomb. Hall’s hand- written paper included a descrip- tion in the form of equations of how an implosion was supposed to work. On Feb. 28, 1945, the NKGB — the forerunner to the Soviet KGB intelligence agency — finished its first comprehensive report on atomic intelligence after two years of gathering information. “The materials are of great interest,” responded Soviet physi- cist Igor Kurchatov, who had never heard of implosion and didn’t even have a word for the concept in Russian. He had to call it “explosion toward the inside.” Until now, historians have assumed that one of two convicted spies, Klaus Fuchs or David Greenglass, was the source of this first crucial information on the implosion principle. But Green- glass was just a machinist without clearance for the implosion September 18, 1997 > \fsecret. And Fuchs had been out of touch with Moscow in the months before the drafting of the NKGB intelligence report. Just one day before the Soviet intelligence summary was completed, a cable from the agency’s Moscow head- quarters demanded that its New York agents immediately report “what he [Fuchs] has been doing since August.” All spring of 1945, the implo- sion test project was going full tilt. As the final design for the pluto- nium bomb was being perfected, Bruno Rossi’s group hurried through five implosion test shots using dummy bomb cores in April 1945, another three shots at the end of May and seven more in June. For most of these 15 test shots, the ‘“‘static’”’ implosion cal- culations came from Hall, who worked alone with each new dummy bomb core in his cabin on the mesa. Rossi needed more than a technician to take raw measure- ments of radiation and density. He also needed a scientist who could quickly interpret what the changes in density showed about the smoothness of the implosion. To do his calculations, Hall had to know the outer dimensions of the dummy bomb core. He also had to have at least a rough idea about the inner configuration of the metal mockup. After all, it was Hall working in his solitary work- space who had to separate the hemispheres of the mockup, insert a canister of the tracer iso- tope lanthanum and then re- assemble the two halves. Hall would have surely known the Atlanta Constitution - EDITORS NOTE Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel recently completed a four-year assignment as Mos- cow correspondents of the Cox Newspapers.

He would have surely known about the heavy ‘‘tamper”’ around the central core, and also about the layer of aluminum around the tamper. The Russians could not have hoped to find a junior scien- tist in a more sensitive position than Ted Hall. It was on a Sunday in mid- August 1945, just days after Hiroshima. The University of New Mexico campus in Albuquer- que was almost empty. There was this young guy who didn’t seem to be doing anything, and this woman turned up at the same place and didn’t seem to be doing much more. They sized each other up and made the connec- tion. Ted Hall thought he and the spy courier Lona Cohen must have talked for about half an hour while they wandered around the campus. Cohen was quick to assure Hall that the Soviets didn’t forget their friends. They were up to some dangerous business, she warned Hall, and “things might turn out to be pretty hot.” Hall understood that. But he did not understand Cohen’s blithe acceptance of the prospect of being rescued to a new life in the USSR. Hall recalled thinking the prospect grim, and he told her as much. He suggested that things in Moscow “weren’t as happy and wonderful as she thought” and that he “didn’t really share her opinion of happiness.” But they hadn’t come to Albu- querque to debate the merits of life in Russia. They made their meeting, talked as much as they needed, and Hall passed Cohen the papers he had prepared about the work at Los Alamos. There were only five or six handwritten sheets — that was what stuck in Hall’s memory about his meeting with Cohen. On one page he drew a rough sketch showing the con- centric spheres of a mock bomb — just like the gadgets he had sus- pended from the ceiling of his lit- tle cabin dozens of times to take static measurements for the implosion experiments. Cohen hustled back to her boardinghouse, where she had already packed for her return to New York. She stuffed the papers from Hall under some tissues in a Kleenex box and headed for the train station, where she would have to match wits with federal agents rummaging through every bag of every passenger a the trait.

To tell the truth and risk nothing,Leonardo was brought up in a background of armchair activism. In a family meeting many years ago we determined that we wanted Leo to steer clear of the ‘military entertainment complex'and star in movies that do not promote mindless nationalism. So far, so good. At this moment,we are considering scripts that describe events disclosed by the recently enacted freedom of information policy. These events depict government involvement in the \"neutralization\"of Dr. Martin Luther King. Leonardo will have some very serious parts to think about. ~ About twenty years ago,I published and edited a small-counter culture comic format magazine called \"Forbidden Knowledge\"and I've enclosed a section of it called'Atomic Follies'.Not for nothing is Plutonium named after the Lord of Hell. The idea of the magazine was to format information that was more er less swept under the rug by public ignorance. Hard to believe, but it is near the end of the century and we haven't de-Stalinized. As a footnote-only last week did I understand that the movie done in Hollywood, \"The Quiet American\" which vilified communism in French Indo-China was adapted from a book written by Graham Greene that was meant to do the opposite-absolve communism and accuse the C.I.A. Just another example of co-opted politics in show biz. A careful reading of a new book(Will they ever stop using that cursed Freedom of Information Act !) called \"The Decision to use the Atomic Bomb” by Gar Alperovitz filled me in on the political climate around 1944. It is my direct intention to have the screenplay erase any ambiguity about the heroic lives that you both have led together. The script will separate you from the opportunists of recent year such as Nicholson, Pitts and Aldrich Ames. Perhaps by a careful depiction of Depression Era leftism and Nuclear Parity as well as the principles ~ of Scientific Disclosure,the script will indicate how rational your reasons were at the time. It will.contrast with the insanity of the decision of Byrnes and Truman to use such a weapon on a people that had already sued for peace. The script could demonstrate that the decision was not accepted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff anda majority of prominent scientists had urged Roosevelt to share the secrets of the Atomic Bomb or risk \"Perpetual menace to human security\".Not only are you right in hindsight but, at that very decisive moment, you were right to second-guess the military and corporate powers that had brought America to the point of being a dictatorship. Very few people have the courage to look beyond the boundaries of nationality to the world-overview. It would almost be a pleasure to participate in this project but more sobering is the idea that it is not fictional. At least we are now entering an age when a whole generation of young people grew up with the Pentagon Papers as a warning.

The Soviet Union's complete and devastating collapse in 1991 opened sealed records and shattered many apparatchiks’ reserve toward their old regime, to the amazement of Western and Russian researchers. Accompanying this abundance of new information was the National Security Agency and CIA’s decision between 1995 and 1996 to release cables sent. during World War II to Moscow by Soviet agents in the United States; these cables had been intercepted during the war and later deciphered but concealed from public scru- tiny. Even President Harry S Truman appar- ently never learned at the time about these so-called VENONA cables, as the program was code-named, and they would not have been released in the mid-1990s without persistent pressure from members of the bipartisan Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, including its chairman, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.). The sudden availability of these classified Soviet and American intelligence records has led to publication of new, informative works on Soviet intelligence activities in the United States, to which Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel’s “Bombshell” can now be added. The authors skillfully use both a number of VENONA documents and a wide range of . written material, agent memoirs and inter- views collected in post-Communist Russia, where both have worked as journalists, My NAME HAS BEEN A MATTER OF SOME CONCERN TO ME OER THE YEARS ., Their focus is Theodore ‘“Ted” Alvin Hall, who was, in 1944, a 19-year-old American physicist and Communist working at the top-secret Los Alamos complex and who became a major source of information for the Russians on work underway related to development of the atomic bomb. As one of the VENONA project's most dramatic rev- elations, he was exposed publicly in the 1990s as a Soviet agent. Although cable decoding in 1949-50 had led Western agents to identify atomic spies Klaus Fuchs and Harry Gold, Hall—though questioned by the F'BI at the time—was never arrested as a spy because of a lack of concrete evidence. Hall, to whom the Soviets assigned the code name “Mlad” or “Youngster,” was an unexpected volun- teer spy who came in from the heat of the Los Alamos desert to deliver crucial materi- als on the American A-bomb project to a pair of Soviet couriers in 1944-45, thus joining fellow spies, German exile scientist Fuchs and American mechanic David Greenglass, who were among now-known Soviet agents at the facility. Albright and Kunstel met Hall in 1995 and persuaded the scientist to sit for hours of interviews, (Hall had left Los Alamos in 1945 and a few years later abandoned atomic physics to pursue a distinguished career as a microbiologist at Cambridge University.) Their exchanges bolster the book's richly documented account of Hall’s professional and personal development as well as his brief but damaging career as a Soviet agent. Hall's initial courier was Saville Sax, a Allen Weinstein is the author of the recently reissued “Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case.” His new book, “The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America,” with co-author Aler- ander Vasiliev, will be published next year. Los Angeles Times - September 28, 1997 > close friend from Harvard student days and fellow Communist, who was soon replaced as Hall's go-between by an even more self- assured young party activist named Lona Cohen. Lona and her husband, Morris, ful- filled a number of Soviet intelligence assign- ments in the United States during the 1940s and, in the following decade, in England under the aliases of Helen and Peter Kroger. Both were arrested, tried, convicted and imprisoned for espionage in England before finding refuge in the Soviet Union after the two governments made an exchange of agents, The Cohens lived out their lives as retirees in Moscow, where I interviewed Morris at a KGB hospital in 1995 shortly before his death. At the time, I was doing research for my own book, “The Haunted Wood.” Al- though Lona Cohen worked as Hall's courier for only a period of months in 1945 and Morris (contrary to the authors’ assertion) may not have met the physicist, the couple's story is also told in “Bombshell,” a wise decision by Albright and Kunstel to broaden their book beyond the scope of Hall. Despite their assiduous research into Hall's life, the authors present their most interest- ing information about him in those early days when he was spying at Los Alamos before the war ended, and although they suggest he may have spied for the Soviets after the war, their evidence is less persuasive. But it is Lona Cohen, brave, quick-witted and viva- cious, who served as Hall's courier, among her many other covert duties, who is the most interesting figure in the book. “Bomb- shell's” fluid narrative weaves the basically distinct threads of Hall's life with the Cohens’ in an absorbing previously untold spy story. Secret Agent Man “Bombshell” describes a more chaotic and haphazard espionage environment during the Cold War era than the one portrayed in the melodramatic memoirs of such ex-Com- munist agent-defectors as Whittaker Cham- bers. Hall and his friend Saville Sax roamed New York City in October 1944, during Hall's leave period from Los Alamos, seeking a contact with Soviet intelligence to convey the data that the physicist had taken from his laboratory. Their information included a valuable list of American and British scien- tists then working on the atomic project. They managed to make contact with not one but two Soviet operatives, an undercover journalist and a Soviet scientist-consular official, in one of the book's most improbable yet accurate chapters. Research in Soviet intelligence archives done for “The Haunted Wood” corroborates the authors’ version of events, fter these initial October 1944 en- Acze Hall managed to meet Sax and then Cohen in New Mexico sev- eral times in 1945 with more information from the project, which supplemented and confirmed for Soviet scientists, data sent by Fuchs, a senior physicist who was also a resident at Los Alamos, Whether, as the authors argue, Hall contributed more be- tween 1944 and 1945 to Moscow's knowledge of the Anglo-American atomic project than did Fuchs, who had worked continuously with Soviet operatives since 1942, remains an open question awaiting a more complete release of information on atomic research from Soviet archives. Only then can we determine accurately what information came from Hall, Fuchs, Greenglass, Donald Ma- clean (then working on such matters in Washington) and other sources who remain unidentified. One undeniable fact recognized by that incorrigible realist Joseph Stalin was that despite all the efforts of his Western agents, the Soviet atomic project still lagged far Project. behind when, in 1945, the United States dropped the first atomic bombs. After Hiro- shima and Nagasaki, Soviet intelligence files reveal urgent instructions to redouble efforts at obtaining secret atomic data, though with diminishing results amid tightened postwar security. Albright and Kunstel do an excellent job of clarifying the complex processes involved in making the atomic bomb, pausing even to explain various false starts and unworkable procedures that often preceded the program's periodic breakthroughs. The authors examine the problems with which Hall and his col- leagues wrestled and are critical in under- standing exactly what he and other agents at Los Alamos gave to Soviet intelligence. At various points in “Bombshell,” Albright and Kunstel raise the difficult question of Hall’s motives and his justification. If their answers don’t provide a defense for Hall, then at the least they argue that assisting the Soviet atomic program helped create the nuclear stalemate with which the world has lived for the last-half century. “Though Mlad admits he acted illegally, the crude calculus of history has yet to refute Mlad’s view that he helped decrease the risk of war.” Similar assertions are found elsewhere in the book, including an epilogue that quotes Hall’s own 1997 apologia for his actions. The scientist concluded that as a young man, he had “the right end of the stick. I am no longer that person; but I am by no means ashamed of him.” Had the VENONA documents not exposed his identity, the authors recognize that Hall would never have acknowledged his involve- ment with the Soviets. What were his motives? “During 1944,” Hall wrote in his 1997 statement to Albright and Kunstel, “I was worried about the dangers of an Ameri- can monopoly of atomic weapons if there should be a postwar depression” and “to help prevent that monopoly . . . [I] contemplated a brief encounter with a Soviet agent, just to inform them of the existence of the A-bomb Hall's assertion, however, falls short of the full truth. Not only did he inform the Soviet agent-journalist Sergei Kurnakov at their October 1944 meeting about “the existence of the A-bomb project,” he also turned over a list of scientists working on it, explained to Kurnakov the principles of the atomic bomb and handed over a detailed written report on progress to date at Los Alamos. Also at this “brief encounter,” according to a report that Kurnakov wrote the next month and that emerged during my research in the KGB records, Hall also “proposed organizing meetings, if needed, to inform [us] about the progress of ... practical experiments on explosion [sic] and its control, the [bomb] shell’s construction, etc... .” Kurnakov was fascinated but still cautious, possibly fearing that this off-the-street agent might have been planted by the F'BI, $0 he asked Hall: “Do you understand what you are doing? Why do you think it is necessary to disclose U.S. secrets for the sake of the Soviet Union?” Hall responded: “There is no country except for the Soviet Union which could be entrusted with such a terrible thing.” This blind faith in the superiority of a communist society whose norms differed so greatly from his own country’s, a faith that almost 50 years later Hall recognized had been terribly misplaced, led him and others down the road to profound betrayal. In retrospect, that journey, which “Bombshell” chronicles, demands understanding, if not justification—compassion, if not respect. Los Angeles Times - September 28, 1997 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Ex-Moscow reporters uncover tale of atomic- ‘age espionage By ANNE Morris American-Statesman Staff Working as Moscow correspon- dents, journalists Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel uncovered a story too big to be limited to the pages of a newspaper. Their new nonfiction book, “Bombshell” (Times Books, $25), . tells how and why an idealistic 19- year-old Harvard graduate work- ing as a scientist at Los Alamos gave atomic bomb secrets to the Soviets in 1944, helping bring on the Cold War. Albright and Kunstel will be at the Barnes & Noble store at the Ar- boretum at 3:30 p.m. today pro- moting their history-making spy book, which has already been op- tioned for a movie. Now based in Washington, the husband and wife were Moscow correspondents for Cox newspa- pers from 1993 to 1997. They an- swered questions about their book in Austin on Sunday afternoon: ' Q. How did the idea start? Albright: At first we were going to do an interview with Morris Cohen, an American spy who was living in Russia. He was an old man, and he died before we could interview him, but there was a videotaped interview with him that the KGB allowed us to see, and in it he talked about meeting a young scientist from Los Alamos. Kunstel: Then the National Se- curity Agency came out in 1995 with decrypted cables done back in the ’40s. In one of these intelli- gence cables there was the name of a young, idealistic American scientist who had worked at Los Alamos: Ted Hall. He had volun- teered his services to the Soviets. This person was Morris Cohen’s contact. We thought, “Let’s see if we can find him.” Albright: We flew from Moscow to England. At first, Hall was re- luctant to talk to us, but he did. It was the first of hundreds of hours of (exclusive) interviews. Kunstel: This was the best story we'd ever come across — this ob- scure person who changed the course of history. He was the youngest scientist at Los Alamos. Q. Ted Hall says in “Bombshell” he gave atomic secrets away be- cause he thought there would be less risk of war if the Soviets aso had the bomb. Some readers a t swallow that. Albright: You have to understand where the guy is coming from gnd then make your own judgmenits. Kunstel: We tried to play ifas straight as we could — explai circumstances and the history a the political environment of the times — but without trying tbe the judge and jury of it. Q. How did working in Moscow help? ‘ Albright: Being there four ~ years gave us the contacts with the Russian intelligence agencies that allowed us to get documents that substantiate the espionage story. Q. Dealing with all these spies, you're dealing with people who lie as a matter of course. Albright: Absolutely. That's why there had to be the docu- ments. We're setting up a Web site so people who read the book can use clues from it to access the doc- uments online that are not includ- ed in the book. The address will be www.bombshell-l.com. Q. Did the Russians know you had started interviewing Ted Hall, or did you do it in secret? Albright: No. They didn’t know. He was a very big secret Austin American-Statesman - October 6, that they were still trying to keep. Kunstel: They always thought we were doing a story about Mor- ris and Lona Cohen, which is what. we started out to do. They might have confiscated our notes about Hall. Q. What is Hall’s situation now? Kunstel: He’s a retired scientist in Cambridge, England. He has cancer and Parkinson’s disease. Q. Did you discover any other F traitors in the course of you research? Kunstel: We uncovered infor- mation that after the war there f. were a couple of other atomic sci- }: entists recruited by Ted Hall. We don’t know who they are. Albright: Nobody else does, ex- cept Hall and the Russians. Larry Kolvoord/AA-S Q. Hall had been in all kinds of « e Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel unearthed a decades-old case of a leftist organizations. Why wasn’t s young American scientist at Los Alamos who gave atomic bomb secrets there better security at Los Alamos? Kunstel: Perhaps they didn’t have the suspicion then that there was so much political discontent that could turn into espionage. Albright: We don’t know, be- cause the FBI has not released the Ted Hall file. We hope one of the results of this.book will be that fi- nally the FBI will release thou- sands of pages about the Hall c case and Morris Cohen. Q. My favorite character in the book was Lona Cohen. Kunstel: Mine, too. She was really a feisty, brave lady. She did what she did out of ideology, not for venal motives. She must have been one of the most important So- viet agents in this country. Albright: Maybe the most im- portant woman spy of the 20th century. Patching in the back- to the Soviets. They tell the story in their new book, ‘Bombshel,' ground of Lona Cohen was proba- bly one of the most important things we did. Q. So Joe McCarthy was right? There were a lot of spies? Albright: No, I don’t think Mc- Carthy was right. He saw commu- nists everywhere. It’s important to differentiate between provable evidence there was espionage based on these decrypted cables and his fantasies. - ohh e \f"

        "ocr_text": " r TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER he brilliant physics grad student strolled the Univer- sity of Chicago campus with his pregnant wife, both of them keepers of a secret so huge they were desperate with fear that they would be found out and executed. Now, nearly a half-century later, that secret is out. What Ted Hall and his wife, Joan, could not tell anyone was that Hall was a spy who first slipped the Sovi- ets the secrets of how to build an atomic bomb. Early in the 1950s, shadowed by an intre- pid Chicago G-man, Hall came perilously close to being discovered as the central play- er ina true spy drama every bit as com- pelling as best-selling fiction. Thanks to what now appears to have been bountiful good luck, the Halls were never prosecuted and went on toa frugal retire- ment in England, where they live today. Key chapters of the Hall spy story were played out on the streets and grassy midway of Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood between 1946 and 1951, including the cou- ple’s traumatic fear that they would be arrested and wind up on trial for espionage, like Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. However, Hall actually passed the A-bomb secrets to the Soviets before arriving at the U.of C., during the time the teenage Har- vard graduate was working on the Manhat- tan Project at Los Alamos, N.M. The fruits of his effort became clear on Sept. 23, 1949. The Halls were in their Chica- go apartment at 847 E. 56th St. when they heard President Harry Truman on the radio make the historic announcement that “within recent weeks an atomic explosion (HYDE PARK SPY A new book reveals the 50-year-old story of how a UV. of C. graduate student helped the Soviet Union get the bomb By then, the Halls were wisely fearful that their small apartment was bugged, and they hurried to the safety of the outdoors to talk about the impact of what they had just heard: The information that they had passed along apparently had worked splen- didly for the Soviets, “They walked down this street and they realized they had changed their world,” author Joseph Albright said as he recently revisited the South Side locales where the Halls had lived and continued to meet with the Soviets in Chicago. Albright and his journalist-wife Marcia Kunstel are co-authors of a new book that unmasks Hall*as-a here- tofore unknown spy-who used-his work at the Los Alamos bomb lab to aid the Soviet quest for Attier: ica’s nuclear secrets, Afterward, during Hall's gradu. ate studies at the U, of C, ie a the hydrogen bomb. Chicago also was the site of Hall’s closest call, when he was in danger of being found out by local FBI investigator Robert K. McQueen. McQueen shadowed the couple, bugged their phone and watched their mail. Despite his enormous efforts, though, he never got the goods on one of the most successful and important Soviet spy missions in history. Following leads from previously classified documents, the authors found the Halls in retirement near England’s Cambridge University. Now 72, Hall agreed to talk to the couple in interviews that lasted some 100 hours. After interviews and research in Washington, Chicago, England and Russia, the result is “Bomb- shell, The Secret Story of Amer- ica’s Unknown Atomic Spy Con- spiracy’’ (Times Books), a spellbinding and meticulously detailed story of the Halls told by Cox Newspapers’ Moscow corre- spondents Albright and Kunstel, now based in Washington. Chicago Tribune - October 10, 1997 > \fSpies CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 Fearful that he could still be - prosecuted, Hall remained unapol- ogetic and would not admit to ~ specific acts of espionage. In a signed statement given to the authors, Hall said he acted out of concern that an American monop- oly on atomic weapons was dan- gerous to world peace: “It has even been alleged that I ‘changed the course of history.’ Maybe the course of history, if unchanged, could have led to atomic war in the past 50 years — for example the bomb might have been dropped on China in 1949 or the early ‘50s. Well, if I helped to prevent that, I accept the charge. . .” Kunstel says that with all known witnesses, both American and Soviet, dead, it seems unlikely that the U.S. government would chose to recpen the Hall case after all these year's. On their recent trip to Chicago — a homecoming for Albright, who as the adopted son of artist Ivan Albright grew up here and was a cub reporter for the Chi- cago Sun-Times from 1958 to 1961 — the authors told the story of ' the Halls as they strolled the sites : where their story unfolds, On the top floor of Eckhart Hall, Albright peered into an office sim- , ilar to the one Hall used as a physics grad student and said, : “You can just imagine them up *- here deciding whether to get back -in touch with the Russians” — . Since it was during this period “that. Hall had ended his spy career, a decision he later reversed. It was in Chicago that one of Hall’s American contacts, Harvard undergraduate Saville Sax, brought him some special Soviet- supplied “revolting male jewelry,” tie clips and such that featured golf clubs and racehorses, so that those working for the Soviets who had never met could recognize each other. “Bombshell” recounts how it took six years for American code breakers to crack a Soviet cable that marked “Teodor Kholl” as a spy. This was in 1950, when McCar- thyism and the frenzied hunt for Commies in private and public life in the U.S. led to the mobiliza- tion of FBI teams across the nation to track down spies. The FBI’s McQueen put the Halls under the bureau's watchful eye, What the feds uncovered was not suspicious, furtive espionage activity, however, but a politically active couple circulating peace petitions to sun worshipers on the Chicago lakefront and joining an assortment of left-wing move- ments. “If McQueen had learned any- thing about the pattern of Soviet operations in America, it was that real spies never joined anything,” p subscribe to ‘The Worker,’ » the Communist party newspaper. But the Halls did. In fact, by sheer good fortune, just about the time in 1950 when McQueen and his team of federal gumshoes put him under surveil- lance, Ted Hall had decided, for the time being, to stop spying for the Soviets and instead to use his considerable energy in leftist political endeavors. For more than a year, McQueen kept up his watch, shadowing Hall from his lab at the Institute of Radiobiology and Biophysics at 56th and Ellis, to his nearby apartment, a U. of C. prefab at 6002 S. University (the building has since been leveled; a univer- sity law school building is there now). And finally, on March 16, 1951, the authors say McQueen said he “invited” Hall to come to an inter- view at the FBI's Chicago office in the Bankers Building on West Adams Street. During three hours of question- ing, Hall, then 25, admitted noth- ing. McQueen remained convinced that Hall was guilty, the authors said. And although he seemed calm, Hall was churning inside. The FBI questioning occurred the very week that the Rosenbergs were on trial in New York for spy activity. Weeks later the Rosen- bergs were convicted, sentenced to death and, ultimately, executed in the Sing Sing electric chair. Hours after Ted Hall was inter- rogated, the Halls made a frantic search of their apartment for any- thing that could be used against them if the FBI returned with a search warrant. ney packed the an old Chevy they got from Chi- cago native Joan Krakover Hall’s family and drove to a drainage canal where they dumped the papers in the water. McQueen, now retired and liv- ing in the northern suburbs of Chicago, went on to become a state prosecutor and circuit court judge in Waukegan. He told Albright and Kunstel that he accepted a decision by FBI higher- ups who said the decrypted evi- dence against ‘Teodor Kholl” could not be revealed in court. And McQueen went along with his supervisors’ conclusion that without it there was insufficient evidence to indict Hall for spying. Though the FBI ordered the Hall case to the back burner, the couple lived in fear that Ted would wind up like the Rosen- bergs. In 1953, the Halls abandoned their dealings with the Soviets for good but continued to worry that they might be prosecuted. They moved from Chicago to New York (Hall’s hometown), where Ted Hall took a low-profile research post in biophysics at Memorial Sloan-Ket- tering, thinking this would make it easier to leave the U.S. in case a quick getaway was necessary. Looking back, Hall, slowed by Parkinson’s disease and kidney cancer, told the authors that his spy career was the work of a 19-year-old, “immature, inexperi- enced and far too sure of myself.” Had he known then about the brutality of the Stalin regime, he would have lived his life differ- ently. “I think my emotional revulsion against Stalin’s terror would have stopped me in my tracks,” he told Kuntsel and Albright. “Simple as that.” Chicago Tribune - October 10, 1997 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "The Harvard man who gave Russia the bomb By Michael Grunwald GLOBE STAFF Harvard reunion yearbooks tend to be exer- cises in self-promotion, but Theodore Alvin Hall never had much to say for himself. “My wife and I Book have three children, and I am doing technical work in biology Review and physics in a local universi- ——— ty,” he wrote for the 25th annual report of the class of 1944. “I do not believe any- thing is worth noting in our personal histories.” Actually, there was at least one thing. As a 19- year-old junior physicist working on the Manhat- tan Project, Ted Hall slipped the secrets of the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. He probably accelerated the Soviet nuclear program by a dec- ade, drawing the curtain on America’s atomic mo- nopoly, radically changing the dynamics of the Cold War. And unlike Julius and Ethel Rosen- berg, who were executed for much less, he got away with it. Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel believed that was worth noting, so they wrote this book, which is well worth reading. “Bombshell” is an exhaustive character study as well as a great spy yarn, elevating dry academic questions of nuclear ethics and international relations to the level of high drama. The plans for the bomb are smuggled out of Los Alamos in a Kleenex box. The spies send messages with a code based on Walt Whit- man’s “Leaves of Grass.” Even in the era of Oprah, where nothing seems shocking, this saga of a teen rebel genius who betrayed the United States should raise a few eyebrows. And if it doesn’t, the film version is already in production, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. , Hollywood will surely play up Hall’s rebellious side, but his thoughtful side is even more interest- ing. He was just a kid when he gave Stalin the bomb, but he is portrayed with an almost spooky maturity, embarking on his espionage career after careful consideration.

Hall was eager to put his mind to work for the good of humanity as well as the advance of sci- ence. He was also a committed leftist. Finally, he was convinced that an American atomic monopoly after World War I] would threaten the balance of power and risk a nuclear war. The authors make it abundantly clear that Hall was by no means alone in this belief - dozens of scientists loyal to the Western cause, including future Nobel Prize win- ners Niels Bohr and Joseph Rotblat, were openly calling for an end to nuclear secrecy at the time. In fact, it was a common debate topic at Los Ala- mos until project leader Robert Oppenheimer BOMBSHELL The Secret Story of America’s Unknown Atomic Spy Conspiracy By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Times Books, 399 pp., illustrated, $25 clamped down on political talk among the hired brains. At the time, Hall thought America might plunge into a postwar depression and fall into the hands of fascist leaders, as Weimar Germany had done. He was wrong about that. But he also thought that a bipolar world where both great powers had nuclear capabilities would be unlikely to descend into Armageddon. He turned out to be right about that. There were tense moments dur- ing the Cold War - in Korea, in Berlin, during the Cuban missile crisis - but neither side was ever crazy enough to press the button. The logic of mu- tual assured destruction may have been scary log- ic, but it was logic nonetheless. Today, Hall is alive and not so well and living with his wife, Joan, in Cambridge, England. Al- bright and Kunstel do not try to judge him. They point out that unlike the venal Aldrich Ames, he never accepted a dime for his work as the agent code-named “Mlad.” They note that the second half of the 20th century has been far less bloody than the first, but they emphasize that Hall had no way of predicting that at the time. And they pass along Hall’s first public statement, a surprisingly foreeful defense of his past mixed with a poignant admission of his arrogance and naivete. The authors do not try to answer whether Ted Hall was right to try ‘to change the world by breaking the law. And they do not try to recon- struct what would have happened if he hadn't done what he did. They explain why he did it, and how he did it. They report the facts that Hall left out of his reunion yearbook, and leave the moraliz- ing and hypothesizing to parlor historians. Boston Globe - October 14, 1997 \f"

Regrettably, the archives have since closed up again, amid an ongoing turf war between Russian scientists and former spies over who de- serves credit for breaking the U.S. nuclear monopoly. Recently, the U.S. National Se- curity Agency shed more light on the sub- ject when it declassified some 2,900 wartime messages sent by the Soviets be- tween the United States and Moscow. The coded cables were intercepted and subse- quently decrypted under an ultra-secret NSA project known as Venona. Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel— two correspondents for the Cox Newspa- pers who were formerly based in Moscow—have written the first book on So- viet atomic espionage to draw upon Russian archival sources as well as Venona. It is both a solid, well-researched work of histo- ry and a brilliant piece of reportage. The authors’ story revolves around two Gregg Herken is a curator and historian at the Smithsonian and author of “The Winning Weapon: The Atomic Bomb in the Cold War, 1945-1950.” Theodore Alvin Hall, the American spy who worked at Los Alamos, and-“Fat.Man,” the plutonium bomb young American spies, Theodore Hall and Saville Sax, and a husband-and-wife team from New York named Morris and Lona Cohen who passed atomic secrets to Sovi- et handlers and thence to Moscow Center. Unlike modern-day traitors such as Aldrich Ames, who spied for money, Hall, Sax and the Cohens did what they did out of love of country. Unfortunately, the coun- try was the Soviet Union—a place they had never seen. Like Britain’s notorious “Cam- bridge Comintern,” whose members in- cluded famed spies Donald Maclean and Kim Philby, Hall and Sax made the deci- sion to become spies while they were still in college (they roomed together at Har- vard). Although little has been known about them until now, Hall, Sax and the Cohens—a spy ring known to the Russians as the “Volunteers’—-may actually have done more damage As a 19-year-old physicist at Los Alam- os, Hall passed the Russians a detailed de- scription of the “Fat Man” plutonium bomb—the type that the United States tested in New Mexico and later dropped on Nagasaki. The Soviets copied Fat Man and tested it four years later, in an explo- sion that stunned the West. Until now, this piece of treachery has been blamed on Klaus Fuchs, the German-born spy who worked for the British Mission at Los Alamos. Bombshell provides convincing ev- idence that Fuchs only confirmed informa- tion the Russians already had from Hall, and thus that the first act of treason and its perpetrator were homegrown. The authors’ careful sleuthing leaves lit- tle doubt that Hall and Sax are the agents identified in Venona cables by the code- names “Mlad” (“Young”) and “Star” (“Old”). Cronically, their cover was blown as early as 1944, when the Soviets sent a Washington Post Book World - October 18, 1997 >  BOMBSHELL ~ The Secret Story of America’s Unknown Atomic Spy Conspiracy By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Times Books. 399 pp. $25 By Gregg Herken message containing the names Hall and Sax and details of their recruitment.) But as even Albright and Kunstel ac- knowledge, enough gaps and inconsisten- cies exist in the Soviet record and Venona to suggest that Hall may not have been the only source for the secrets that Lona Co- hen, codenamed “Helen,” couriered from Los Alamos to the Russians. In an inter- view earlier this year, Hall himself ex- pressed doubt that he was Lona’s onlv or even most important informant. Indeed, at least two agents who appear in earlier Venona cables as sources of atomic se- crets—“Kvant” (“Quantum”) and “Pers” (“Persian”) —remain unidentified to this day. The names of two other “Volunteers” subsequently recruited by Hall—“Anta” and “Aden”—are likewise unknown, as is the identity of another pair of agents whom the Cohens recruited. One marvels, at the end of this book, not that the Russians were able to steal America’s atomic secrets but that there were any secrets left to steal. Like the Nazis’ Enigma code, Venona was too valuable a Cold War secret to risk compromising by prosecuting the Volun- teers (even though NSA suspected that the Russians knew about its cryptanalytic breakthrough from Kim Philby and a mole_ within the agency). Yet there is either more to the story than Albright and Kun- stel have been able to uncover, or Ameri- can counterintelligence was even less competent than previously thought. De- spite what they knew about Hall and Sax, the FBI removed both from its active “watch list” in early 1952. Six months later, Hall was back in the spying business. In 947. the authors claim, Hall may have been the source of information that helped the Russians build their hydrogen bomb. One U.S. document that Albright and Kunstel do not cite shows that, as late as 1954. one of Hall’s colleagues at wartime Los Alamos warned the congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that Hall was possibly the “second Fuchs” the committee was seeking. A year earlier, a J oint Committee staffer had sparked a se- curity investigation of Robert Oppen- heimer by accusing the physicist of being more probably than not” a Soviet agent. Bombshell provides new information about the whole hunt for “Red atom spies” that dominated much of this country’s political life in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The same is true for the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953 for what FBI director J. Edgar Hoover famous- ly called the “crime of the century.” It now appears that the Rosenbergs were only bit. players in the theft of atomic secrets—a point that Hall understood at the time. “I was more responsible than they were,” he told his Soviet control. Despite the fact that the subjects of this book were guilty of what many consider mortal crimes, there is a zany quality to their real-life exploits that gives the story a human interest missing in most espionage ’ thrillers. When Hall and Sax sense that the FBI might be hot om their trail, they con- sider dressing up as women and walking into New York’s Soviet consulate to seek asylum—until Hall’s wife, Joan, asks if they have ever tried walking in high heels. Lona Cohen seems a somewhat ditzy, bleached-blonde who is forever forgetting the identifying cryptogram to use with her Soviet handlers. But she has enough pres- ence of mind to slip an incriminating sheaf of secrets into a tissue box when Army se- curity agents unexpectedly stop and search her while she is boarding a train. She hands the Kleenex box to one of the agents while pretending to fumble through her luggage for her ticket. As she climbs on board, the agent gallantly returns the box of tissues. This incident is immortal- ized in the KGB's official history, as are the Cohens, who today occupy a shrine-like niche in the Moscow museum of the Russ- ian Foreign Intelligence Service, the KGB's successor. The denouement to this story is also stranger than fiction. After drifting from job to job, Saville Sax finally wound up teaching “values clarification’ in a Great - Society-funded education program called NEXTEP. (“Get in touch with your love feelings,” he wrote in a manual on media- -tion.) Sax’s boast to friends that he had giv- en the atomic bomb to the Russians was universally ignored to the end of his life in 1980, The Cohens ultimately betrayed not. one country but two. Fleeing the United States, they changed their names and lived seemingly quiet lives as antiquarian book dealers in a London suburb—from which they passed British defense secrets to the Russians until being caught in 1961. Even- tually traded to the Soviets in a spy swap, Morris and Lona spent their last days in Moscow, under virtual house arrest by the KGB they had so diligently served. Ted Hall also moved to England with his family in the early 1960s and subse- quently made a name for himself in an en- tirely different scientific field, biological microanalysis. His last contact with Soviet intelligence was in 1953, Now 71 and ailing from Parkinson’s disease and inoperable cancer, Hall gave the authors a two-page statement that falls short of a confession but justifies his actions long ago as moti- vated by the fear that an enduring U.S. atomic monopoly would be a threat to peace. In a “mistakes-were-made” vein, Hall’s letter acknowledges Soviet brutali- ties but leaves little doubt that he remains, like the Cohens, unrepentant: “I am no ‘longer that person; but I am by no means oan asnamed 01 nim, a Washington Post Book World - October 18, 1997 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Treason’s Hidden Accomplice By RONALD RADOSH We have known for a few decades— since Klaus Fuchs’s confession in 1950— that the Soviet Union obtained the atomic bomb from espionage sources within the Manhattan Project. Recently Michael Dobbs of the Washington Post, digging through formerly classified Soviet cables, broke the story that in fact there was an- other major spy at Los Alamos—a young scientist named Theodore Alvin Hall. Now, with “Bombshell” (Times Books, 399 pages, $25), Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel tell the whole story. . Basing their account on Soviet sources, U.S. government files and, most impor- tant, personal conversations with Hall himself (now 71 and living in London), the authors have written a narrative that com- pares with the best espionage thrillers. Here is an all too true story of how lax se- curity and political naiveté combined to give the Soviets access to our nation’s top- secret military project. Hall, a prodigy, entered Harvard as a junior at the ripe age of 16. His brilliant work led his teachers to recommend him for the physics staff at the Manhattan Pro- ject. He already belonged to a Communist front group, while his Harvard roommate, Saville Sax, was a party member, The two friends quickly approached the Soviets with the news that Hall was in a position to hand over valuable information. While visiting his friend in Albu- querque, Sax received from Hall the first notes on the “implosion” principle—the ac- tual method used for creating the first atomic bomb. At the time, the Soviet physi- cist Igor Kurchatov, who headed Stalin’s bomb program, had never even heard of the concept. When Klaus Fuchs resumed contact with Moscow—he had been out of touch for a while—his data filled in some holes and confirmed the accuracy of what the Soviets had learned from Hall. Thus did “Mlad” (“youngster”), as the Soviets called him, first give the Russians what they needed. Sax would soon be replaced as Hall’s courier by Lona Cohen—a 32-year-old rad- ical and party member who was arrested a few years later in Britain, with her hus- band, Morris, for transmitting British mil- itary secrets to Moscow. Lona Cohen was so good at her job that she managed to take data -from Hall at Los Alamos at a time when security was at its most tight,. right under the nose of scores of FBI LN Bookshelf ' . “Bombshell” By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel agents. Weaving the Cohens’ story to- gether with that of Ted Hall, the authors manage to present in gripping detail a hitherto unknown spy drama. After leaving the Manhattan Project, Hall campaigned for Henry Wallace in 1948, formally joined the American Com- munist Party—and soon renewed his espi- onage activity. By 1952, he had recruited two new scientists as spies, the still un- known agents named “Anta” and “Aden” by their Moscow control. Did Hall feel a pang of conscience when he learned that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, lesser players in Moscow’s spy drama, were to be executed for the crime that he had actually committed? Hall says he went to his Soviet control and offered to give himself up, since “I was more responsible than they were.” His control officer, not surprisingly, “felt it wasn’t a good idea.” Hall’s wife, aware of Hall’s activity but not herself a spy, says now that if she and her husband had been arrested, they would have claimed “innocence just as [the Rosenbergs] did.” If there is a flaw in Mr. Albright and Ms. Kunstel’s book, it is that they present ~ this story too much from Hall’s point of view. Rarely pausing to challenge him, they portray Hall, at times, almost as a tragic hero—a man who betrayed his coun- try for the higher good of preventing atomic war. Hall believed that a nuclear monopoly would have enabled the U.S., lamentably, to use the bomb on China to ~ block Mao’s 1949 revolution. He still thinks that Soviet possession of the bomb may have stopped a military takeover of the U.S. government during the Cold War. The authors argue that the Cohens were real revolutionaries. Ted Hall, by contrast, was better than that—a humanist who ar- gued that “the breaking of the atomic mo- nopoly was in the best interests of Ameri- cans, even if it meant breaking American law.” It is worth asking whether Stalin, would have given Kim I! Sung the green light to invade South Korea in 1950 if he had not possessed atomic weapons. Cer-. tainly the tens of thousands of deaths that_ resulted from that war do not figure in Hall’s equation. Ted Hall has no regrets. He now ac- knowledges Stalin’s terror, but he still be- lieves the West was on the wrong side of the Cold War, and he has the gall to de- nounce the McCarthyite “witch-hunt.” By giving Hall the last word, the authors do a disservice to their important work. In re- ality, Hall, the Cohens and hundreds of others betrayed their country and served a murderous totalitarian state. The authors argue that Hall was neither a “viper in our © bosom” nor an “unsung hero of the nuclear age.” But others will conclude that the first of these labels—Rebecca West’s stinging phrase for those who committed treason— fits him perfectly.

The story is the result of more than 100 hours of personal interviews with Hall, who now lives in Cambridge, Eng- land, and his wife, as well as re- search compiled by Kunstel and Al- bright: The Soviets would have been able to build a nuclear bomb anyway, Kunstel said, but Hall — and other Americans who sold secret informa- tion — just accelerated the Soviet nuclear weapon time frame, allowing the Soviets to produce their first bomb in 1949. It was basically a replication America’s bomb, she said. Hall, '72, has Parkinson’s disease and kidney cancer: With his own mortality staring him in the face,. Kunstel said, she thinks he finally was ready to tell his story. “J think he - just sort of wanted to get his story out. He thought it was going to come out in one version or another and he wanted to get his version out.” Kunstel said she and her husband of 14 years just wanted to tell Hall’s story. “We put in a lot of work to try to understand what the era was like. We tried not to be judgmental.” However, she added, “I can under- stand where he was coming from and I think I can understand what motivated him, but to take that first step ... it’s not something I would do myself. a Kunstel and Albright first got Hall f interested in the project by sending the Halls a copy of Their Promised Land, which is a history of the Is- raeli-Palestinian conflict. “He and his wife loved it and felt it was straight down the line, that it was a history that presented the facts | and: didn’t take sides.

While they were still trying to figure out how ~they could live and work together, Albright was offered a foreign corre-~ spondent position in Rome. Kunstel quit her job with the Atlanta newspa- per, moved with her husband to Rome, and began freelancing. Their Promised Land was written while the two were visiting scholars at MIT’s Center for Foreign Studies. “Basically it means that they gave us a desk and an office and let us loose in their library and at Har- vard,” Kunstel said. After the book was published, Cox Newspapers also hired Kunstel as a foreign correspondent and the couple was assigned to Russia for four years. Before departing, Kunstel said they took a crash course in the Russian language.

        "ocr_text": "Vaaw eS By STEPHEN T. SHANKLAND Monitor Managing Editor For a look at the look at the dark side of the Manhattan Project, go read “Bombshell,” the freshly released book about physicist Ted Hall and his secret contacts with the Soviet Union. In “Bombshell: The Secret Story of America’s Unknown Atomic Spy Conspiracy” (Times Books, $25, published Oct. 1), journalists Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel have compiled a well-researched, detailed history of one Amerie can’s desire to put the Soviet Union’s nuclear weapons program on an equal footing. The book reads like a cross between Richard Rhodes’ “The Making of the Atomic Bon.v” and a spy novel. It traces the childhood and career of Ted Hall, a child prodigy who entered Harvard as a junior when he was 16 years old. Before he even gradu- ated, he was drafted into the Manhattan Project and sent to Los Alamos. There, he worked on the implosion model plutonium bomb, the type that was set off at Trinity and dropped on Nagasaki. But Hall, who grew up in the midst of philo- sophical debates with parents and his older brother, was interested in politics as well as science. His left-wing inclination led him to lead left-wing literature and become politically active at the tender age of 13. When he transferred from Queens College to Haryard in 1942, his room- mates by chance were two leaders of the college Communist Club, the John Reed Club. At Los Alamos, Hall — apparently on his own initiative — took it upon himself to transfer infor- mation on the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union, the authors say. In the endeavor, he enlisted the . help of one of the John Reed members, Saville Sax, and two other self-appointed spies for the Soviet Union, Lona and Morris Cohen, according to the authors.

But their book is carefully researched and makes a very strong case that Hall was in fact the spy the KGB had code-named “Milad.” To come to their conclusion, Albright and Kunstel have connected decoded Soviet cables from the National Security Agency, KGB infor- mation released at the end of the Cold War but muddied by disinformation to disguise Soviet tactics, and more than 100 hours of interviews with Hall, who lives in England. According to their findings, Hall beat Klaus Fuchs to the job of getting a design of the world’s first atomic weapon to the Soviets. However, his information wasn’t as detailed as what Fuchs pro- vided, they say. In two sections of the book, the authors repro- duce carefully written statements from Hall. They are among the most fascinating parts of the book, containing courageous descriptions of what for many is very alien thinking. , In one of the statements, Hall says, “T have occasionally been asked to explain what moti- vated me in 1944, Thinking back to the rather: arrogant 19-year-old I then was, I can recall quite well what was in my mind at the time. My deci- tomic spy sion about contacting the Soviets was a gradual one, and it was entirely my own. It was entirely voluntary, not influenced by any other individual or by organization such as the Communist Party or the Young Communist League. I was never ‘recruited’ by anyone... “During World War II, I shared the general sympathy for our allies, the Soviet Union. After they were attacked, everybody knew that they were bearing the main load of the fight against Nazi Germany.... Hall says he believed that capitalism in eco- nomic depression could lead to “fascism, aggres- sion and war,” as happened in Italy. Although he didn’t think a depression likely, “It seemed to me an American monopoly was dangerous and should be prevented.” Hall notes, however, that the situation “was far more complicated than I understood at the time, and if confronted with the same problem today I would respond quite differently.” In another statement, Hall says, “During 1944 I was worried about the dangers of an American monopoly of atomic weapons if there should be a postwar depression. To help prevent that monop- oly, I contemplated a brief encounter with a Soviet agent, just to inform them. of the existence of the A-bomb project. I anticipated a very limited contact. With any luck it might easily have tumed out that way, but it was not to be.... In fact, the authors report, Hall was in contact with Soviet intelligence during three separate phases, including contact during the a of the Red Scare in the U.S. “Bombshell,” despite its annoyingly sensa- tionalist title, is a good book. As the narrative \"progresses, nagging questions get answered, the story grows deeper and more credible, the char- acters take on a certain depth, and: their motiva- Los Alamos Monitor - November 2, 1997 > \fq af (from Page B-1) tim start sounding more believable. Some of the most interesting parts — and probably some of the hardest infor- mation for Albright and Kunstel to obtain — involve Hall’s interactions with the KGB and, later, the FBI. As it turned out, Hall had a difficult time trying to persuade the Soviets he had something they wanted. He had to knock on several doors before finding a receptive individual. And the FBI’s efforts during the McCarthy era are even more intriguing. Using the Soviet cables decoded by the National Security Agency, the FBI was awakened to the existence of a spy code- named Vlad, and they had several partic- ulars that pointed to where he was at certain times. Ironically, false lead end the FBI pursued for some time was whether the spy was Edward Teller, one of the chief designers and advocates of the hydrogen bomb. But the FBI methodically homed in on Hall, and got to the point of hauling him and his old roommate Sax in for ques- tioning. The actions took place at the same time as David Greenglass and Harry Gold were caught in their courier activities transferring Klaus Fuchs’ infor mation to the Soviet Union, and later, during the trial and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Perversely, Hall was spared in part because of the continuing left-wing activism he and his wife engaged in. “In the upside-down world of FBI counterin- telligence, the fact that the Halls had any overt left-wing political ties stymied the investigators. If (the FBI’s investigator) had learned anything about the pattern of Soviet operatives in America, it was that real spies never joined anything.” = Evidently what the FBI hadn’t counted on was that someone might help the Soviets out of a sense of altruism. It’s an irony that Communist activity, the very thing that would have qualified the Halls for persecution in the McCarthy era, was exactly what got them off the hook with the more realistic FBI. The book is filled with fascinating glimpses of the espionage world. The reader learns the proper way to bum sen- sitive information; the unusual bureau- cratic situation where extra links in the chain of communication are actually desirable; and the tension and peril that led Hall’s couriers, Lona and Morris Cohen, to flee the U.S. and head for the Soviet Union, And the Manhattan Project security apparatus, for all its fences’ and guns, comes off as decidedly ineffective. One atomic espionage expert said the failure to conduct body searches of those : leaving Los Alamos was the single largest oversight. Albright and Kunstel have done an excellent job extracting information from both the U.S. and Russian governments, piecing together a fascinating story. And the authors have succeeded in perhaps the authors’ most important and most difficult task: whether to pass judg- ment. In the end, they carefully avoid the issue, letting others speak. They quote Los Alamos National Laboratory nonpro- liferation expert Terry Hawkins 4s saying that although he believes the drop in war- related deaths is attributable to the Cold War's nuclear parity, Manhattan Project spies could well have led the U.S. to defeat in a war, had the American nuclear program stalled. At the end of the book, the authors quote Hall. After reading hundreds of pages devoted to his motives and actions, his carry a profound weight: al recognize that I could easily have been wrong in my judgiment of what was necessary, and that 1 was indeed mistaken about some things, in particular my view of the nature of the Soviet, state. The world has moved on a lot since then, and certainly so have I. But in essence, from the perspective of my 71 years, I still think that brash youth had the right end of the stick. I am no longer that person; but I am by no means ashamed of him.” Los Alamos Monitor - November 2, 1997 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "NONFICTION Reading ‘The one who & Former reporters Albright and Kunstel unearth secrets of ‘lost’ World War Il spy Ted Hall. By Paul Reid COX NEWS SERVICE For five decades it was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and the physicist Klaus Fuchs. They were the vil- lains, along with Ethel’s brother, David Greenglass, and a few other dedicated socialists who gave away U.S. atomic secrets, who aided and abetted Joe Stalin, murderer of 25 million and enemy of humankind. But they did it for the principle, however arrogant and undemocratic their thought processes. They didn’t do it for the money, like Aldrich Ames and other recent spies who sold their colleagues’ lives for the price of a big-screen TV. In any event, they were all caught by our dedicated and efficient counter- intelligence apparatus — the FBI. Then they were pun- ished. But there was at least one other spy within the Man- hattan Project who aided the Soviets during World War Il. He was a brilliant teen- age scientist working on the A-bomb at Los Alamos. He gave the Soviets far more than the Rosenbergs, and did it earlier than Fuchs. The FBI was handed his name by Army officials who had broken the code on Soviet diplomatic messages. But the FBI couldn’t builda case and he went on to livea long and comfortable life. Now he’s in his 70s, resides in Britain, and remains steadfast in the certitude that he did the right thing. His name is Theodore Hall. Bormbsheill is his story, well told with insight and balance by former Cox News Service correspondents Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel. Albright and Kunstel spent three years sifting through declassified Rus- sian and U.S. documents. ts, “a = a = ie Z a Ee a = f i n v iss aT al WALLY NELSON /DAYTON DAILY NEWS Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright spent three years researching Ted Hall’s life for ‘Bombshell.’ Bombshell: The Secret Story of America’s Unknown Atomic Spy Conspiracy By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel, Times Books, 399 : pages, $25 They interviewed hundreds of people who might have had anything to do with Ted Hall from his birth to the present. They cross-checked sources. They compiled, ver- ified and prioritized infor- mation. They tell a complex story with no hyperbole, make no normative assess- ment and give new meaning to the word balance. The authors’ concise reporting is doubly reassur- ing because this book isa page-turner. It’s nonfiction with the suspense of a tale told around the campfire. Ted Hall might be a snake, but he’s got one helluva sto- ry. He gave the Soviets data about the construction of the A-bomb they could match up with data also sup- plied by turncoat physicist Klaus Fuchs. Without a sec- ond source, the Soviets would have had no way of knowing if they were vic- tims of an American disin- formation campaign. With both Hall and Fuchs (who knew of each other but didn’t know the other wasa spy), the Soviets were assured the incoming infor- mation was good — so good that they produced their own bomb in less than four years, 10 years sooner than if Hall and Fuchs had not been traitors. got away From the late 1940s to the present, the FBI was certain Hall was a spy, but luck was on Hall’s side. The woman who acted as his intermedi- ary with the Soviets, Lona Cohen, was arrested and imprisoned in Britain. But she never talked, never gave up Hall in exchange for free- dom. Hall’s other accom- plice, Saville Sax, told tales so tall his friends and family completely discounted them. His favorite tale: that he had been part of a Soviet spy ring dealing in A-bomb secrets. Saville Sax told the world about Ted Hall and nobody listened. So Hall settled in Britain and did research for 30 years, wrote letters against the Vietnam war, went on picnics, earned the respect of his scientific colleagues. He lived the good life. Hall seems a contempla- tive sort, but stubborn. His treachery aside, there isa grating self assurance about him, a rigidity that is dan- gerous in those on a moral mission or in positions of power. It would not and has not occurred to Ted Hall to admit to the enormity of what he did, let alone apolo- gize — not for treason that he felt morally compelled to commit, but for the hubris of playing God. He has penned a carefully scripted statement about his actions that pretty much admits to what dozens of witnesses, Soviet and American, have alleged. But he still fears prosecution and will not say *T did it.” With the clarity of hind- sight, Hall’s motives have been vindicated. The bal- ance of nuclear power he sought to establish between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. was the biggest reason nuclear war never happened. Lucky guess. Hall was right in that regard. But Hall was wrong —a traitor who played God with nuclear information. The authors of Bornbshell don’t say that. They just present the facts, allowing readers to either applaud Hall or con- demn him. \f"

        "ocr_text": "By STEPHEN T. SHANKLAND Monitor Managing Editor It began as a couple of Cox Newspapers reporters in Russia tracking down what they thought would be a Sunday feature that would play well in the South: Mor- ris Cohen, a University of Mississip- pi graduate who spied for the KGB and ended his days in the Soviet Union. But investigating Cohen led to a much bigger story. Over the course of two years, reporters Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel gath- ered a whole book’s worth of infor- ation on how Manhattan Project physicist Ted Hall smuggled the design of Fat Boy to the Soviet - vations of an altruistic spy. He gets , the last word in the book — partly because it’s such gripping informa- tion and partly because it arrived in March 1997, when the book was already done. Reading from the book, Kunstel * quoted Hall: “From the perspective of my 71 years, I still think that brash _ youth had the right end of the stick. I “am no longer that person; but I am ’ by no means ashamed of him.” | “This stuff is for real,” Kunstel said, and adds credibility to the _ book. Albright noted that Hali, an _ American citizen, is still alive and living in England. He is suffering _ from Parkinson’s disease and kidney cancer, and might not have expected to live long enough to see the book - published. Kunstel said that in writing the - book, the authors tried to give Halla - fair presentation. “We try to steer “ away from a verdict. We kind of felt ‘the reader should be the jury,” she ~ said. _ She noted, “It certainly looks like .. this was an illegal action — essen- _ tially an act of espionage.’ However, she added, there is at least one case where a jury decided that commit- . ting a crime can be justified “if it _will prevent a greater crime from happening.” She said a jury in Liverpool, Eng- . land, acquitted a group of women who had attacked a jet fighter with S book on Manhattan Project spy Kunstel and i Albright spoke about their book, “Bombshell: The Secret Story, of America’s Unknown Atomic § Conspiracy,” to an overflow CRP Foelbury Sci- ence Museum Thursday night. The book describes the life and actions of Hall, a leftward-leaning prodigy whose political activism was matched by his scientific talent. At age 16, he transferred to Harvard as a junior, Albright said. He was one of four Harvard undergraduates recruited to be junior physicists at the Manhattan Project in Los Alam- os. He arrived in January 1944. Hall, apparently motivated by his political idealism, decided to trans- hammers, causing $2.5 million dam- age. The jury said the action was lawful, accepting the argument that the plane, which was going to be exported to Indonesia, would have been a tool of genocidal warfare in East Timor. Kunstel also pointed to civil rights activists in the United States as people who were willing to vio- late a law they believed unjust — and go to jail for it. Clearly, the book pushed people! 8 buttons, Kunstel said. Many reviews mention the words “traitor” or “treachery.” ( But she said much of the’ judg- ment of a spy depends on one’s per- spective. One Russian was celebrat- ed as a hero for his work in slippirg Russian information to the U.S. dur- ing the Cuban Missile Crisis. His work, many argued, was instrumen- tal in keeping World War III from breaking out. But the Soviets arrest- ed him, tried him, and executed hi “That may not be so different from what Ted Hall did,” Kunstel said. “It really depends a lot on where you’re sitting when you logk at these issues.” Albright said readers can weigh in with their own opinions on the issue by visiting the Bombshell site on the World Wide Web at http://- www.bombshell-1.com. The site is loaded with reviews and tidbits about the book. ' Right now the site also has an area with copyrighted materials the authors extracted during _ their Los Alamos Monitor - fer atomic bomb designs to the Sovi- et Union well before the Trinity Test in July 1945. He went in and out of contact with the Soviets up until the early 1950s. Despite a close scrape with the FBI, which put Hall under close sur- veillance in the years of McCarthy- ism, Hall never was prosecuted. Onc reason was that the FBI didn’t want the Soviets to know that the United States had decoded incriminating cables sent to the Soviet Union in World War IJ, Albright said. Albright and Kunstel said they have been taken to task by at least one person who said Hall “should not enjoy a sympathetic article,” referring to an adaptation of “Bomb- Bombshell\" authors Joseph Aibright and research, but visitors will need to have a copy of “Bombshell” handy in order to gain access to this part of the site. The three documents so far in this area are the FBI’s report about interviews with Hall and Saville Sax, Hal?’s Harvard roommate and fellow spy; a note from Russian weapons designer Igor Kurchatov describing the significance of the information Hall sent; and a KGB interview with Cohen, a courter for Hall. Kunstel said Hall’s information was the first the Soviets heard about the implosion desigri used in the Trinity Test and the Nagasaki bomb. The concept was so new they didn’t have a term for it, and called it “explosion to the inside.” Based on Kurchatov’s lette) we played this pretty straight,” shell” that appeared in the New York Times Magazine. And a Wall Street Journal reviewer criticized’ Albright and Kunstel for portraying Hall “almost as a tragic hero for the higher good of preventing an atomic war,” Kunstel said. But Kunstel defended their work. “There may have been times) when we were a little too soft on Ted Hall, but by and large, I think she said. The ates said they simply tried to present Hall’s own point of view. Hall, speaking in the book about why he ie the Ss viets, Marcia Kunste pe l’s information apparently preceded that sent to the Soviets by Klaus Fuchs, another Manhattan Project spy, the authors said. Albright said he and his co-author are gathering material for a new edi- tion of the book. Two of the people in the Los Alamos audience said they knew Ted Hail. - Albright said he and Kunstel still don’t know much about Hall’s espi- onage activities after the Manhattan Project. He later worked for the Uni- versity of Chicago and apparently had ties to what is now Brookhaven National Laboratory. Hall worked with Edward Teller — commonly known as the father of the hydrogen bomb — and it’s possible Hall might have known something about the H- bomb work. November 7, 1997 \f"

(Times Books, $25) By Doyle Baker When the United States. perfected the atomic bomb in 1945, the American gov- ernment expected to hold a monopoly on the weapon for at least a decade. Only four years later, the Soviet Union —- using in- formation supplied by scientists from the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, NM. — exploded its own atomic device. The spy network that allowed the Soviets to build their bomb so quickly remained hidden for the next 45 years. Now, with the publica- tion of “Bombshell,” the details of an atomic espionage conspiracy that even the FBI could not solve are available to everyone, Written by journalists Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel, “Bombshell” com- bines two stories in a single book. The first recounts the espionage career of Ted Hall, a New York native and Harvard-educated physicist who was recruited|at age 18 to do atomic research for the Manhattan Pro- ject. Hall began working in Los Alamos in January 1944. Like every other scientist who worked on the project, he had no limits placed on what he was allowed to know. Hall did not keep his knowledge to him- self for long. In October 1944, while on leave in New York City, he contacted a So- viet agent and offered to share the secrets of the atom bomb. For the next two years, Hall supplied data from the Manhattan Project to the Soviets. Despite the security measures at the Los Alamos compound (mail was censored, and everyone except babies was fingerprinted and issued a pass), he had little trouble smuggling out top-secret information that eventually made its way to Moscow. Short of sub- jecting all persons leaving Los Alamos to a full body search — the procedure favored by a Soviet army officer who is quoted in the hook — there was no way to guard fully against espionage. Though the FBI came to suspect in 1950 that Hall was a Soviet agent, the evidence against him — coded telegrams sent be- tween Moscow and the United States during World War Ii — was weak. Surveil- lance of Hall revealed nothing, for he had previously broken his ties with the Soviets. When others such as Klaus Fuchs con- fessed to divulging America’s atomic se- crets, the FBI's interest in Hall waned. He moved to England, where he still lives, and his espionage activities did not become public knowledge until the Soviet Union's bre ‘ “Bombshell’s” second story is a study of the ethics of Hall's conduct. Hall, who spoke with the authors and gave them a written statement, contends that the dan- gers of an American monopoly on atomic weapons compelled him to act as he did. Having lived through the Depression and the rise of fascism in the 1930s, he believed that the atom bomb should not be en- trusted to only one country. Why not share the weapon's secrets with an American ally, one that suffered enormous losses in a courageous effort to win the war against Nazi Germany? While Hall remains convinced that his actions were right, there is another view- point to consider. Regardless of his mo- tives, Hall violated the law, and he did so at a time when he did not know what the consequences would be. Had the Man- hattan Project failed, the information di- vulged by Hall and others could have al- lowed a country controlled by a brutal dictator to become the first an atomic weapons. It is unlikely that Hall will ever be pros- ecuted for espionage. The persons who could testify about what he did are dead. Anyone expecting Albright and Kunstel to resolve “the mix of morality and politics that makes up Ted Hall's story” will be dis- appointed. While the authors give a superb account of the facts, they do not pass judg- ment, The question of whether Hall is a traitor or a hero is left for each individual reader to decide.

Harry Truman’s announce- ment that the Russians had the bomb shook the Cold-War world, but made Ea Uke Soeteaes wife proud of her husband’ achievement. “It was as if hee had done it all by himself.” she would say many years later. Hall was only a teen-ager when he was hired as a physi- cist im 19044 to work on the top secret atomic bomb project at Los Alamos laboratory, join- ing J. Robert Oppenheimer ’s staff of 600 on The Hill. He also wasa politically active iefrist, with pro-communist leanings that were no secret to his college mates but which went undetected by the lab’s clearamce process. Hall was a dedicated scien- tist at Los Alamos. good enough to merit letters of recommendation from Oppenheimer and Edward Teller. but the young scientist also was a dedicated, fearless and selfless spy for the Ruas- sians. He wasn't recruited; he and a former Harvard roorm mate made the first contact while Hall was on a 14-day leave from Los Alarnos, clurmsily first talking to a Russian newsman, then the head of oe American Communist ty. then a Russian busi- messman, and fimally a clerk a@t the Soviet consulate who happened also to be a =Pp> and the son of a prominent euss- ian scientist. . Between 1944 and 1950, Hall would be one of the most ismportant spies the Russians would have, passing through AF Tah te ie the gate at Los Alamos Labo- ratory — without being pat- ted down, so lax was security there — and passing top secret materials to couriers im Santa Fe and Albuquerque. Now in his early 7Os and living in England in poor health, Halli went undetected wmtil the early 1950s and wasn’t publicly exposed until - 1995S. He was interrogated in 1950 when cryptogeraphers daecoded a Russian cablie men- tioning his name, but for lack of 100 percent solid evidence and other reasons the authors explain, Hall and his old Har- vard roommate were never prosecuted. Meanwhile, for Passing on less important secrets, Ethel and Julius Rosenbergs were electrocuted, while other spies received sentences ranging from isto 25 years. Hall, imterviewed exten- sively by Albright and Kun- stel. is umrepentant. He vol- unmteered to spy for the Russians because, like many other scientists, he felt that an American monopoly om the atomic bomb would upset the Gelicate balance of power and jeopardize the security of the world. His decision very pos- sibly helped change the course of history. Looking back, Hall conjectures that without Russian atomic pari- ty. the U.S. might have . dropped a bormb on the Peo Ple’s Republic of China in 1949 or the early 1950s. He says that *“*from the pex spective of my 71 years, I still think the brash youth had the right end of the stick. I am no longer that person; but I am by no means ashamed of him.” : Authors Albright and Kun- stel, relying om recently declassified documents, undercover sources and extensive interviews with the Wallis and others central to. this story, have written a book that reads better thar many fictional spy thrillers, with clandestine meeting oo that Tony Hillerman arms will relate to —- the Santa Fe River.the UNM cempus.

WICK i n Britain and Canada, Klaus Fuchs and Alan Nunn May went to prison, and in the United States, Julius and Ethel Ro- senberg were executed for passing atom bomb secrets to the Soviets. Now, more than 50 years after the first atomic device was detonated at Trinity, N.M., Joseph Al- bright and Marcia Kunstel reveal the story of yet another atom bomb spy, Theodore Alvin Hall, the youngest physicist to work on the Manhattan Project. Hall, a retired biophysicist living in Cambridge, England, admits to working for the Soviets during the war but has not confessed to specific acts of espionage. Re- lying on information newly available from KGB and other Soviet archives as well as dozens of interviews here and in the for- mer Soviet Union, Albright and Kunstel dramatically reconstruct Hall’s astonish- ing career as an atomic spy. A longtime sympathizer with left-wing causes, the precocious Hall graduated from Harvard in physics at the age of 18. By that time, he had already been recruit- ed to work on the Manhattan Project. Like many scientists, Hall questioned the moral- ity of creating an American monopoly on nuclear technology. But according to the authors, he determined in October 1944 to turn over everything he knew about the atom bomb to the Soviets. The KGB gave him the code name ‘Mlad” (young) and as- signed the code name “Star” (old) to Hall's co-conspirator, his former Harvard room- mate Saville Sax. Perhaps the most important items of information that Hall gave the KGB, say the authors, were details about implosion, an approach to detonating an atom bomb that the Soviets had never considered. Klaus Fuchs unknowingly and indepen- dently corroborated Hall’s information. Al- though we will never know how much the atomic spies contributed to the accelera- tion of the Soviet nuclear program, it is generally thought that they advanced by several years the USSR’s detonation in 1949 of its first atom bomb, After the war, Hall went to graduate school at the University of Chicago, where he switched from nuclear physics to bio- physics. Still maintaining contacts with his Soviet controllers, he may have continued spying, possibly acting as a conduit from American scientists working on the hydro- gen bomb. But Albright and Kunstel are less convincing on this score. For one thing, Hall no longer had a security clear- ance and did not work on sensitive govern- ment projects. For another, Hall was active in left-wing and communist front organiza- FROM ‘BOMBSHELL’ Theodore Alvin Hall, circa 1990 tions, activities not permitted by the Sovi- ets for one of their spies. Meanwhile, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, American code breakers began to decipher much of the Soviet cable traffic intercepted during the war. Newly deci- phered KGB messages led the FBI and MI-5 to Klaus Fuchs and eventually to the Ro- senbergs. According to the authors, the new evidence was even more damning against Hall and Sax. Why didn’t the FBI simply arrest and try them as they did the Rosenbergs? The authors explain that the FBI's only evi- dence were the deciphered intercepts, which, as a matter of national security, they could not use in court. By contrast, the Rosenbergs were convicted on the ba- sis of testimony from their associates; Fuchs confessed. In neither case were in- tercepts of Soviet cable traffic used at trial. The FBI never found corroboration or us- able evidence, and Hall and Sax never con- fessed, so the FBI eventually gave up. Hall went on to become an internation- ally known biophysicist, spending 30 years at Cambridge University’s famous Caven- dish Laboratory. Sax became a professor of education and died in 1980 at 56. But Hall, though reportedly ill, is still very much alive. Should he, after all this time, be called to account for his wartime espionage? The authors take no position, but Hall himself, in a statement printed in the book’s last chapter, says that he was an 18-year-old idealist, that the Soviet Union was Ameri- ca’s wartime ally, and that there is every reason to believe that the strategic balance of power between East and West is precise- ly what has kept the world from using nu- clear weapons for the past 52 years. From a practical standpoint, it would be difficult to obtain a conviction against Hall. Those who could have corroborated the charges against him are long dead. Most of the evidence amassed by Albright and Kunstel, though persuasive, is circum- stantial and second-hand. Still, there may be federal prosecutors who do not view youthful idealism as an excuse for betray- ing vital military secrets, and who might want to remind Hall that there is no statute of limitations on treason, si Daniel L.

Reviewed by Martin J. Sherwin is is a book about secrets and science, politics and war, youth [ and ideology, conscience and deception. Set in the context of the wartime alliance against fascism, it revolves around the development of the atomic bomb and a brilliant young physicist at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory who concluded, after giving considerable thought to the role of nuclear weapons in the postwar world, that he had to betray his country in order to save it. American prodigy turned reluctant Soviet spy Theodore Alvin Hall, at 18 so precocious that he was recruited during his senior year at Harvard to work on the Manhattan Project, came to the conclusion in 1944 that only a postwar balance of nucle- ar weapons could prevent a third world war. Ironically, perhaps the earliest of nuclear deterrence theorists, Hall decided that it was his responsibility to assure parity and peace by informing the Soviet Union about the atomic bomb project. With skill and empathy, authors Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel tell us why and how Ted Hall became “Miad,” a conduit for secret atomic energy infor- mation from Los Alamos to NKGB headquarters and beyond, to nuclear physicist Igor Kurchatov. The result is the best of the many histories of atomic espionage. Ted Hall's story is a cold war tale warmed for public scrutiny by the end of that era. In 1995, the National Security Agency, the ears of American intelligence, released the “Venona” files, a collection of decrypted Soviet cables that identified a “Teodor Kholl.” Was this the Jong-rumored third spy at America’s Los Alamos bomb labor- atory? Albright and Kunstel, then working in Moscow for Cox Newspapers, began to investigate. Reconstructing Hall’s story from archives and interviews, they located him, in England, living near Cambridge University, where he had worked since the early 1960s as a biophysicist. On one level, Bombshell is a riveting story of atomic espionage. Characterized by clear prose, sound judgment, and thorough re- search in Russia, Britain, and the United States, it is as intricate and absorbing as any John le Carré novel. But on a deeper level, Bomb- shell considers the moral and political questions that moved Ted Hall to spy for the Soviet Union. While Albright and Kunstel offer no answers of their own, they leave room for probing readers to ponder those questions. After all, depending on one’s point of view, spying is either heroic or deceitful. Spying involves difficult moral choices, even if done out of conviction. An assertion of individual responsibility, spying is always condemned as treachery by one society, and praised as heroism by another. “It has even been al- leged that I ‘changed the course of history,’ ” Hall wrote to the authors. “Maybe the ‘course of history,’ if unchanged, would have led to atomic war in the past 50 years.... Well, if I helped prevent that, I accept the charge.” Atomic secrets and the balance of superpowers Over the course of 15 full days of interviews, Hall and his wife, Joan, cautiously discussed his espionage. “In 1944, I was 19 years old—immature, inexperienced, and far too sure of myself,” Hall wrote in a carefully worded note to the authors. “But in essence, from the perspective of my 71 years, I still think that brash youth had the right end of the stick. Iam no longer that person, but Iam by no means ashamed of him.” With the publication of Bombshell, readers now have the opportunity to judge Hall and his actions. But his story also may lead some to ponder the actions of the govern- ment, and the cold war climate of opinion, that assured that there would never be a similar encounter with Julius and Ethel Rosen- berg.

There, in wartime Los Alamos, working under Robert Oppenheimer and Bruno Rossi, Hall helped build the atomic bomb. To his friends and coworkers he was a brilliant young rebel with a boundless future in atomic science. To his Soviet spy- masters, he was something else: “Mlad,” their mole within Los Alamos, a most hidden and valuable asset and the man who first shipped them the secrets to the making of the atomic bomb. In a book that will force the revision of fifty years of schol- arship and reporting on the Cold War, award-winning journalists Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel reveal for the first time a devastatingly effective Soviet spy network that infiltrated the Manhattan Project and ferried America’s top atomic secrets to Stalin. At the heart of the network was Hall, who was so secret an operative that even Klaus Fuchs, a fellow Manhattan Project scientist and Soytet agent, bad no idea they were comrades. Bombshell tracks Hall from his days as a brilliant schoolboy in New York City, when he came under the influence of his older brother’s radical tracts, and on to Harvard, Los Alamos, and Chicago, where Hall continued to spy even after the war Was over, passing more secrets while the Soviets were trying to build the hydrogen bomb. We meet Hall’s partners in espi- onage: his Harvard roommate Saville Sax, who received Hall’s es ina code based on Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass; Morris and Lona Cohen, New York Communists who formed the core of the atomic espionage conspiracy; Yurt Sokolov, ofh- cially the Soyiet Union’s U.N, Mission press chief, unofficially a spy handler for Moscow Centre; Colonel Rudolf Abel, to his friends an artist-photographer, to his agents thei “illegal” con- troller; and Anta and Aden, two as-yet-unidentified American atomic scientists brought into the Soviet network by Hall. (continued on back flap) Times Books - Random House - July 1997 (Advance copy) \f(continued from front flap) Bombshell also tells the story of the U.S. Army code breakers and FBI sleuths who, ina thrilling game of cat and mouse, race to catch the unknown spy before it 1s too late. Drawing on previously classified documents, undercover sources, and years of research in Russia, England, and the United States, Bombshell reads like a classic spy novel, full of secret meetings, coded messages, and daring escapes. But it is much more than a terrifically exciting tale of conspiracy and subterfuge; Bombshell is a stunning piece of historical detective work, revealing a spy network in brilliant detail. Albright and Kunstel have done what no FBI agent managed to do: discover the truth about the mysterious agent “Mlad” and track the still- living and unapologetic spy to his resting place in England. For forty years, only a few Russians knew what Ted Hall really did. Now Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel reveal the astonishing true story of the atomic spies who got away.

        "ocr_text": "“Miad” and “Star” TRIDING INTO MIDTOWN MAn- S hattan, Ted Hall moved like a man with a purpose. Fast. Deter- mined. He weaved around the less en- ergetic or less focused who didn’t match his pace, which meant just about everyone else on the pavement. That was how he often walked, in silent competition with the rest of the world. He would catch a side glance at potential rivals traveling at a good clip, then move faster, pushing past the un- witting losers left trailing in his dust. It was part of his style, picking his own private targets for achievement. On this mid-October day in 1944 Vall had a clear and pressing objective as he walked south past uptown apart- ment houses with their scattering of apothecaries and groceries, then cruised into the frenetic high-rise cen- ter. He was en route to the Soviet trade company Amtorg, where he hoped to find a way to tell the Soviets how the wizards of American science were rushing into existence the world’s most devastating weapon. His faith in the principles of democ- racy had made him question whether he had the right to take this unilateral step and share American technology with another country, even an allied country. But he had worried for some years now that what was going on in America wasn’t quite democracy. This decision to build the atom bomb, for example. Neither the American people nor their Congress even knew about it, much less approved it. He found Congress itself to be a skewed version of democratic govern- ment. “The U.S. Congress was con- trolled by the various committees, and the chairmen of the committees were all Southern Democrats who were not by any means democratic representa- tives of a democratic country,” he said 48 ‘The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Bulletin of Atomic Scientists - January-February 1998 > By Joseph Albright ¢> Marcia Kunstel in a discussion years later. “They were usurpers who were in their position because half or more of theirspeople couldn't vote.” How would American power grow and what would be its shape if there were no counterbalance anywhere on earth? THe thought it was too great a chance to take, especially when poten- tial disaster could be so easily checked. What he wanted to do might not fully clear what Hall considered his social debt to the world. But he thought it would be a goodly down payment. NOT LONG BEFORE THIS WALK DOWN- town Hall had been at Saville Sax’s apartment at 15 West Seventy-fifth Street, a red brick building not quite up to the standards of the neighbor- hoad’s stately brownstones or the near- by Museum of Natural History. Sax and Hall met several times during Ted’s two-week breather from Los Alamos, but none of these meetings was a simple social get-together. His loyal friend Savy was the one person Hall could rely upon to understand and help him clandestinely guarantee a global balance of power after the war. Most Americans would have been scandalized at Hall’s plan to give top- secret defense data to a communist regime, even an allied one; he was right to assume Savy would not disap- prove. Sax the undisciplined dreamer was different from the probing scien- tist Hall, but politically they shared a world view. It was right, they thought, and the danger added a romantic edge that appealed to both young men. Savy’s mother, Bluma, an excitable Old World matriarch most comfort- able speaking Yiddish, was ironing in one of the apartment’s two living rooms and seemed preoccupied the day her son brought Ted to visit. That was fortunate for the two young men, because Bluma’s bossy, loving nosiness would have been hard to circumvent. Had her mind not been elsewhere— possibly on her work as a volunteer with Russian War Relief getting ban- dages and food and clothes to her war- torn former countrymen—she proba- bly would have pounced on Hall with a string of demanding questions: Why had he Jeft Harvard in the middle of a: term? How come such an able-bodied young man wasn’t in uniform, anyway? Hall wasn’t even supposed to men- tion where he was working, and cer- tainly not to say anything about what he did there. And now he and Savy were trying to plot the touchy logistics of getting exactly that information into the hands of Soviet intelligence opera- tives. Bluma, who supported the com- munist revolution till the end of her life, might not have objected to the plan in principle, but she surely would have objected to a risk like this. Decades later, she still refused to talk openly about what Savy had done be- cause she feared that the law might yet catch up with him. Savy’s older sister was hanging around the apartment, too, so Ted and Savy may have gone outside to talk. The two identified several places with the potential to handle Hall’s proposi- tion, according to information pieced together from decrypted Soviet cables and other sources. Both young men were familiar with leftist publications such as The Daily Worker that chroni- cled the doings of Soviet-related orga- Excerpted from the book Bombshell.

TRYING TO CONNECT WITH A RE- ceptive Soviet spy, Sax embarked on a Woody Allen adventure. He began at Artkino, the branch of Soviet cultural propaganda that produced Soviet films and dis- tributed them in the West. It was a risky bet, going to a place with an obvious political aura that was likely to attract American coun- terespionage attention. Nonethe- less, that was Sax’s starting point. Nicola Napoli, the president and manager of Artkino in New York, didn’t bite. A sloppy kid shows up at his office on Times Square with a tale about his buddy the teenaged super-scien- tist who was building a super- bomb—his buddy who wanted to share this top-secret information with the Soviets. Could this be anything other than an FBI provoca- tion? According to a Soviet intelligence telegram, Napoli, “not wanting to lis- ten to him,” sent the boy packing—but not entirely empty-handed. Stranger stories were recorded in the annals of espionage, and, after all, the Soviet Union was gliding on a tide of popular- ity in America. It was a comrade in arms, suffering but still standing up against Nazi tyranny. So maybe there really was a whiz kid who wanted to help. Napoli nervously suggested Savy look up Sergei Kurnakoy. It was cer- tainly legitimate to send such a story to a Soviet author and journalist well- known as a “military analyst” for com- munist newspapers in New York. Napoli couldn’t lose. If Sax was a plant, he had done nothing wrong by sending him to a journalist. If it looked like he was a legitimate source, then Kur- nakov would take it from there. A White Russian cavalry officer who had emigrated to America in the 1920s and then become enamored of the revolu- tion back home, Kurnakov was now an agent of Soviet intelligence. He was Bulletin of Atomic Scientists - January-February 1998 > Above: Ted Hall entered Harvard as a 16-year-old junior. On page 47: Hall wears the uniform of the army’s Special Engineering Detachment, a sham unit into which some 500 young Los Alamos scientists and technicians were drafted. trained to make decisions about guys like Sax. Sax apparently wasn’t satisfied that some journalist was the proper vessel for the hot disclosures Hall was ready to deliver. From Artkino Savy went to knock on the door of Earl Browder, the head of the American communists. He fared even worse there than he had with Napoli. IIe couldn’t get past Browder’s secretary with his tale of se- cret U.S. weapons. This shouldn't have been surprising: Browder’s people had been under intense Fst surveillance just a few ycars carlier that had result- ed in Browder’s imprisonment for using a false passport. Relations were better now that the Soviets and Ameri- cans were fighting on the same side, but the party still was wary of potential traps. POSSIBLY AT THE SAME TIME SAX WAS knocking on doors that fall day, Hall was hiking down to the purchasing of- fice of Amtorg at 238 West Twenty- eighth Street near Seventh Avenue. Few Americans knew or even suspect- ed that Amtorg’s $1.5 billion in import/export activities covered clandestine contacts by a network of Soviet spies and their Ameri- can agents. Hall figured only that he'd have a better chance talking to some “nice businessmen” than to propagandists at the film com- pany who were sure to be edgy about surveillance. Little did he know that para- noia was rampant at Amtorg— work had been paralyzed one day at the head office when two Do- minican nuns innocently tried to solicit contributions and were taken for provocateurs. Yet when Hall wandered in, he got spectac- ularly lucky. He simply walked up to an American employee he found stacking boxes in some corner of the Amtorg warehouse and started talking. Whatever veiled version of his mission Hall gave, it made the guy nervous. The workman scemed to think this earnest young man was balmy, but before he shooed him out he gave Ted a name and a phone number for a fellow named Kurnakov. It was the same contact suggested to Sax at Artkino. COURTESY THEODORE HALL. HALL HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT IN his 14-day leave that ended October 29. He needed at least a couple of days to ride the train back to New Mexico. Hall quickly managed to set a meeting. How could Sergei Kurnakov believe his good fortune when Ted Hall walked into the Soviet agent’s lower Manhattan apartment and started talk- ing? He immediately realized that the 19-year-old scientist “has an exception- ally keen mind and a broad outlook, and is politically developed.” Himself the son of a famous scientist, Kurmakov understood the import of what Hall was doing when he described the in- stallation at Los Alamos and his work there and then offered to keep the So- viets informed of developments in the classified lab.

        "ocr_text": " “Did the United States have any secrets?” One of the U.S. counterintelligence officials most inti- mate with the details of World War II Soviet atomic in- telligence voiced a startling conclusion at a recent con- ference behind the walls of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Robert Louis Benson, a senior officer in the code- breaking agency's Office of Security, noted that the So- viet spy cables decrypted in the Venona project showed more than 200 Americans had worked with Soviet intel- ligence during World War IT. These included perhaps a half-dozen spies for the Soviet Union working inside the Manhattan Project and dozens more in the Treasury Department, the Office of Strategic Services, and the State Department. “I don’t think any country at any time ever had so many assets,” said Benson, who is the Nsa’s chief histori- an of the Venona project. He then went on to ask: “Did the United States have any secrets? “The answer would have to be no.” Historians and researchers around the world contin- ue trying to answer Benson’s question themselves, as they seek out who gave what to whom and when. Our book, Bombshell, dug out at least one piece of the story: the role of Los Alamos physicist Theodore A. Tall in helping Moscow replicate the Nagasaki bomb. But the focus remains intense on the unknowns that still litter the field of atomic espionage. The conference where Benson spoke, the Nnsa’s bien- nial Cryptologic History Symposium at Fort Meade, Maryland, drew not only septuagenarian experts of a bygone era, but a generation of researchers hoping to find new hints to pry open the remaining stubborn mysteries. The October conference did not generate much hope for new breakthroughs, though it seems likely that the nsa will release more dribs and drabs as its experts continue pondering declassification possibilities. Here are three lingering questions: = Who was “Fogel/Pers,” and how much did he tell Moscow? “Fogel” (his codename was later changed to “Pers”) worked at Oak Ridge in 1944 and had access to some of the most secret engineering plans of ENORMOZz (a Soviet codename for the Allied atomic bomb project). His or her identity is one of the most important remaining mysteries of Cold War espionage. In June 1944, a Soviet cable reported the dispatch to Moscow of “two secret plans of the layout of the ENOR- Moz plant from Fogel.” ' Shortly thereafter, in Moscow, Soviet scientist Isaak Kikoin wrote a top-secret commentary describing as “extremely important” some freshly received plans of an ENORMOZ factory. Kikoin was fascinated to read about the “influence of thickness of the mesh on the separa- tion process,” and said the plant would produce an esti- mated “1.86 kilos of material a day.”? Kikoin was almost certainly referring to the fresh intelligence from Fogel on a new uranium separation plant at Oak Ridge. The last mention of Fogel/Pers in decrypted Soviet cables came in December 1944, when the New York reziden- tura was considering which of several couriers should have contact with him or her at “Camp 1.”* Camp 1 was identified in another Soviet document as the codename for Oak Ridge. A strange echo of the Fogel/Pers story surfaced in Moscow in 1991, when kcB publicists began dribbling out a story that Soviet intelligence had obtained Los Alamos secrets from a “young idealistic American scien- tist” codenamed “Perseus.” As we document in Bomb- shell, the press burean of the KGB had simply invented. Perseus. To enhance the Kcp’s tarnished reputation, it had.combined into one fake agent the actual exploits of no fewer than three real Soviet atomic sources the KGB still wanted to protect: “Mlad” (Theodore Hall), “Star” (Saville Sax), and “Pers” (unidentified). u How deeply did the kcs penetrate the Chica- go operations of the Manhattan Project? Soviet es- pionage agents doggedly worked every source they could find in Chicago. This went on for at least 11 months after physicist Clarence Hiskey was ejected from the Met Lab in April 1944 when the FBI observed him meeting with a Soviet agent. Just a month after Hiskey’s arrest, Sovict spy head- quarters in New York cabled Moscow of a plan to “strike up an acquaintance” with another American sci- entist supposedly in Chicago. A decrypted cable re- ferred to the potential recruit as “Ramsay.” * To reach him, the Soviets planned to work through an unidenti- fied woman in the American Communist party in Chicago who had already “met Ramsay on the instruc- tions of the organization.” She was described as the wife of “Olsen,” who was said to be a district leader in the Chicago branch of the party. (U.S. counterintelligence Continued on page 53 50 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Bulletin of Atomic Scientists - January-February 1998 > erans have circulated variously dis- guised versions of the “recruitment” of a Los Alamos scientist in the 1940s. There are common threads to these KGB-approved accounts: The young American volunteered his service; he acted out of idealism that included be- lief in socialist goals and fear and ha- tred of fascism; he wanted to assure a post-war strategic balance in the world; he was indignant at any hint that the Soviets might pay him for his trouble. One of the lesser-known elements of the real conversation is that Kurmakov kept pressing Hall to gulp down shots of vodka as they talked in the dim Manhattan apartment. True, it is a Russian custom. Also true that Soviet razvyedchiki, like spies the world over, hope the liberating influence of alcohol may flush out inconsistencies or mis- takes and uncover a source as a double agent. The liquor slowed down Hall, who wasn’t much of a drinker and may never have tasted vodka before that day. But there wasn’t much to reveal that he hadn’t already laid out for the agent. At one point Kurnakov openly chal- lenged this self-recruit to convince him that he both was serious and had some goods to deliver. Hall was prepared for exactly that tactic. He handed over a file folder containing a report he had written on Los Alamos and a list of the scientists there working on the atomic bomb. Kurnakov may have been anxious to open a permanent channel to Ted Hall, but he didn’t have the authority. He was a low-level officer without diplo- matic cover and thus forbidden even to acknowledge that the Soviets fielded an intelligence network of which he was one strand. NxcB policy dictated that he couldn't accept Iall’s offer of services, but he decided to stretch a point and accept Hall’s allegedly secret data. And the journalist snapped a pho- tograph of Hall, telling him this would be a critical source of identification for anyone wanting to get in contact with him again. Kurnakov could only promise to check into the situation despite Hall's warning that after he left New York he would be virtually incommunicado on Bulletin of Atomic Scientists - January-February 1998 > the New Mexico mesa. Trying to facil- itate the link-up that Kurnakov wasn’t empowered to make, Hall also let the Soviet agent know that he came equipped with his own courier. Saville Sax was willing to play the role. AFTER THE KURNAKOV MEETING TED and Savy were in a bind. Whoever would have suspected it would be so difficult to give people something they so clearly needed? Tow could it be so hard to hand over such a gem—no charge, free of strings? Hall and Sax had to find a quiet place to talk where they could be alone, out of earshot of anyone who might try to stop them. Sax would later remember that twice they went rowing on the lake in Cen- tral Park, renting a rowboat for an hour or so from the boat house in The Ramble off East Park Drive in the middle of the park. An hour on the lake was easy, inconspicuous, and pri- vate in an obversely public way. That may have been where they decided Sax would have to take another stab at getting to a high-placed Soviet, some- one more competent than Kurnakov seemed to be. He would do it the next day. The Soviet Consulate was in Man- hattan’s most expensive neighborhood at 7 East Sixty-first Street near the corner of Fifth Avenue. The Pierre Hotel was on one corner, Central Park across Fifth Avenue, and a string of fine homes spread down East Sixty-first. Perhaps not wanting to ad- vertise the fancy neighborhood to their colleagues back in Moscow, the Sovicts code-named the consulate zavod, or “the factory,” in their secret cables, conjuring up a much drearier vision than East Side elegance and greenery. When the inelegant Saville Sax ar- rived at the guarded door, he needed a cover story ready to guarantee passage. The tale he later told the FBI was that he visited the consulate to inquire about the fate of his mother’s relatives left behind in the German-occupied western Soviet Union. (In fact, the Sax family eventually would find that no one survived the Holocaust. Many were probably among the 100,000 Jews who perished in their former Ukrainian home province of Vinnitsa, which was the site of the Nazis’ Pecho- ra concentration camp.) But that day his real mission was getting Hall’s Los Alamos file into the hands of some- body who would know what to do with it. He succeeded. Sax managed to meet with Anatoly Yatskov, then a clerk at the Soviet con- sulate. He was also a spy who would focus almost exclusively on developing atomic espionage sources, the man who was Klaus Fuchs’ control officer. Sax and Hall posed a dilemma for Yatskov. Potential sources had to be vetted before they could be recruited for real spy work. It was unthinkable to accept overtures like this from guys walking in off the street. Yet Hall came to the Soviets at the very moment they were hungering to find a sympathetic scientist in Ameri- ca’s most secret weapons project. Yatskov made no greater commitment to Sax right then than Kurnakov had made a day carlicr to Hall. But he did accept a second copy of the paper on Los Alamos that Ted had pressed on Kurnakov the day before. Yatskov had little time to act. Hall was catching a train in two days. Based on his conversation with Sax and what he learned about Kurnakov’s talk with Hall, the credentials of both young men looked good. Sax’s mother, Bluma, had contacts with the Commu- nist Party, besides working for Russian War Relief. Both young men were considered “gymnasts,” evidently the Soviet code name for associates of a communist youth organization. Both had belonged to the John Reed Soci- ety, and Sax may have been in other groups. Hall had been a member of the American Student Union in high school, although he may not have been aware that it was a communist front. Both were smart enough to attend Harvard. That day Leonid Kvasnikov, Yatskov’s boss and the deputy station chief in charge of scientific intelligence, was unavailable to consult. Instead, Yatskov talked with his NKGB station chief Stepan Apresyan, who also wore the January/February 1998 51 \f official hat of a Soviet vice consul. They decided the consequences of los- ing Hall and Sax if they were legiti- mate were worse than the conse- quences of accepting them if the two were American undercover agents. Yatskov and Apresyan told Kurnakov “to feel out H., to assure him that ev- erything was in order and to arrange li- aison with him.” Initially they would let Sax be the contact, keeping the scien- tist a healthy step away from any Sovi- et controller. The day Hall was to leave New York, his father and stepmother took him out for a send-off lunch. They had a leisurely meal at Bonat’s Café, a French restaurant on West Thirty-first Street, two blocks from Penn Station. Then they all walked over to the sta- tion. As they stood talking in the main booking hall, waiting for the train to Chicago, Ted got a shock. There was Kumakov, standing not far away and beckoning him to come over. His fam- ily also saw the man, so Hall couldn't simply ignore his insistent gesturing. Mumbling an excuse to his family about some acquaintance he really ought to greet, the astonished Hall went over to the Russian. Kurnakov assured Hall that he and Sax had been accepted into the club. Then Kurnakov indulged in a bit of be- havior that left Hall mortified. Appar- ently moved at the thought that a bril- liant young man would risk his career and even his life to supply the Soviet Union this critical information, Kur- nakov drew himself up tall and saluted Ted. THE FIRST Moscow HEARD OF HALL and Sax was in a November 12, 1944 cable from the New York rezidentura, two weeks after Ted Hall left New York for the atom bomb laboratory. It named the two young men from New York (code-named “Tyre”) and told how they offered to work for the Sovi- ets. It noted that Hall turned over to Kurmakov (code-named “Bek”) the same report on Los Alamos (code- named “Camp-2”) that Sax gave Yatskov (code-named “Aleksej”). And it reported that Yatskov and Apresyan 52 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Bulletin of Atomic Scientists - January-February 1998 > LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY In June 1944, Hall was assigned a key role in the Manhattan Project’s implosion experi- ments, the success of which made the plutonium bomb possible.

[one word or letter unre- covered] through S. and not to bring in anybody else. WHEN TED HALL WAS ASKED ABOUT this cable early in 1997, he didn’t try to dispute that he had met Kurnakov on that furlough years earlier. The only thing that he condemned in the Venona decryption as “simply wrong” was the implication by the Soviet rezi- dentura that he had to be talked into passing atomic information by Sax or anyone else. As he later put it, “I was never ‘recruited’ by anyone.” Whether or not the contemporary Soviet cable was more accurate than Hall’s memory, this was the last time Hall and Sax were mentioned by name in a decrypted cable. In subsequent references they would be called by their new code names, “Mlad” and “Star.” Hall would be known as Mlad, from the Old Slavonic adjective mladoi, which means “young.” Sax, who was one year and not quite three months the elder, was code-named “Star,” the short form of the adjective starii or “old.” Mlad and Star—Young and Old— were in active service. \f Continued from page 50 officials never were able to identify Olsen and conclud- ed this was a cover name.) In one classified paper circulated within the intelli- gence community in the 1950s, the nsa declared that Ramsay was “possibly” the nuclear physicist Norman Foster Ramsey—the man who would go on to win the 1989 Nobel Prize in physics after a brilliant career as a Harvard professor and U.S. government adviser. However, while Norman Ramscy was supposedly being targeted for recruitment in Chicago, he was work- ing more than 1,000 miles away, as a 29-year-old group leader in the Ordnance Division at Los Alamos. Reached recently in Massachusetts, where he is an emeritus professor at Harvard, Ramsey said he was mystified by the newly released Nsa document. He told us by e-mail: “It is reasonable that the [Soviet] agents should have tried to contact me, since 1 had major clas- sified responsibilities at Los Alamos and Tinian and our activities were kept secret from most others at Los Alamos. However I have no knowledge of any recogniz- able efforts to do so. I do not recall a Mrs. Olsen or any other woman whose husband was residing in Chicago at that time. I also do not recall any interview with the FBI asking about such contacts.” a Who were “Veksel” and “Guron,” and did they ever hold a clandestine meeting in Chicago? As late as February 1945, the decrypts show that Moscow was still pressuring its New York spy headquarters to make contacts with Ramsay. But by then, Moscow was even more cager to cozy up to another Manhattan Pro- ject scientist in Chicago—someone codenamed “Vek- sel.” Hoping to lure Veksel into its spy network, Moscow Center bombarded its New York spy outpost with four cables in late 1944 and carly 1945 demanding that New York send a secret agent codenamed “Guron” to Chicago “to reestablish contact with Veksel.”® Moscow ordered that while in Chicago, Guron must also renew his acquaintance with another Manhattan Project scientist, “Goldsmith,” who according to the cable “is known to you.” Who was Goldsmith? Ilis full name remains deleted in the latest published version of the nsa’s decrypted cable. However, we have strong rea- son to believe that the un-redacted version of the cable contains an Nsa footnote tentatively identifying him as the late Hyman Goldsmith, the Austrian-born physicist and instructor at City College of New York who worked at the Met Lab during the war. After demobilization, Hyman Goldsmith became one of the first editors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and then was an official of Brookhaven Laboratory in Long Island until his death in 1949 at the age of 34. We know of no evidence indicating whether Guron ever succeeded in contacting Goldsmith. How about Veksel? Back in the 1950s, the FBI and NSA circulated a document within the intelligence com- munity speculating that Veksel was “possibly” J. Robert Oppenheimer.’ Yet if Guron was supposed to make con- tact with Oppenheimer, Chicago was hardly the place to send him. Soviet intelligence must have realized that Oppenheimer had almost no tics to Chicago, either be- fore or during the war. At the nsa conference, former Atomic Energy Com- mission official Amold Kramish proposed another sce- nario: that Vekscl was actually the codename for Enrico Fermi. As Kramish noted, Fermi did have Chicago ties. Throughout the war, Fermi kept his position as chief physicist of the Argonne Laboratory, even though he spent most of his time in Los Alamos after mid-1944. Even if the Soviets assigned Fermi a codename, that doesn’t mean that he was a Soviet contact. To thwart foreign codebreakers, the Soviets often assigned cable codenames to recognizable names, including Roosevelt and Churchill. Who, then, was the intended intermediary Guron? How about the late physicist Bruno Pontecorvo, who had been Fermi’ close friend in Italy in the 1930s? Pontecorvo, allegedly recruited into Soviet intelligence in 1943, spent the latter months of the war working at the isolated Anglo-French nuclear project at Chalk River, Canada. For those intrigued by semantic clues, Guron is the Russian word for Huron. And Pontecorvo’s Chalk River lab was only about 100 miles from the northern coast of Lake Huron. The timing is also sug- gestive: the first known Soviet cable alluding to Guron reached Moscow just four weeks after Pontecorvo had visited the Met Lab in May 1944. Based on what we learned while researching the book Bombshell, it is plausible to guess that Guron = Pon- tecorvo and Veksel = Fermi. But let’s admit it: this is only a theory—one that will need a lot of concrete and reinforcing rods before it can stand the test of history. —Joseph Albright & Marcia Kunstel 1.

Here is why some scholars believe that “Veksel” was Oppenheimer: A February 1945 cable stated that Klaus Fuchs was working at a site co- denamed “Zapovednik,” and a May 1945 message identified Zapoved- nik’s director as Veksel. Although no actual names were given, the only site where Fuchs worked in 1945 was Los Alamos—and that was headed by Oppenheimer.
