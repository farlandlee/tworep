        "ocr_text": "‘Special angel’ warns of peril, Marcos claims at rally By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BACOLOD, Philippines — President Ferdi- nand Marcos, mixing pork barrel politics with mysticism, told a campaign audience Monday that he has a “special angel” who warns him whenever he is in danger. Lately, he said, the angel has told him that both he and the Philippine people are facing per- il. “Wake them up and tell them the time has come. for courage,” Marcos said the angel warned him. . The 68-year-old pres- ident, who seemed fa- tigued by a half day of campaigning in the outer islands, repeatedly charged that a victory by opposition candidate Cor- azon Aquino would lead to a communist takeover in the Philippines. “They will deprive 7 of the right to vote,” ‘| said. “There will be no elections. ... They ‘ will take back all the , Ferdinand Marcos land, for under the communist government no one can own private property.” He said he “suspects” that his opponents plan to declare martial law if they win the election — something Marcos himself imposed on the Philippines between 1972 and 1981. ere in the center of the depressed sugar in- dustry, Marcos announced he was ordering the Philippine Central Bank to help prop up prices for sugar growers by extending an immediate $52 million credit to a government sugar mar- keting corporation, enabling it to buy surplus Pe sugar. e also announced that he was oe terest rates on sugar growers’ outstanding bank loans chopped from 42 percent to 16 percent an- nually. Anticipating that the order might be chal- lenged in court by lenders, the president directed a subordinate to draft new rules or laws to make the cut in interest rates possible. He drew his biggest cheer in Bacolod when he announced to a crowd of 25,000, “I hereby or- der the lowering of electric rates from the Na- tional Power Corp.” When the Marcos presidential jet reached the island of Panay in midafternoon, the president seemed to have lost some of the pep he dis- played in the morning. . Nearing the end of his 65-minute afternoon speech, Marcos forgot to mention some of the campaign goodies he brought for his first visit in about six years to the island of 900,000 farmers and fishermen. _ When Marcos mentioned “electric rates,” a roar arose from the 40,000 Filipinos packed into “ — stadium in Iloilo, the only city on the land. “You are already clapping, and I haven’t an- nounced anything,” he teased. Electric rates in Iloilo will be cut immedi- ately, the president said. Applause was tepid. Most of the audience, it turned out, had been trucked in from barrios in outlying provinces and wouldn’t be affected by cheaper electricity in Iloilo, which is home to about one-third of the island’s population. First lady Imelda Marcos spotted the gaffe instantly. She rose from her seat on the platform and stage-whispered to Marcos that the cut in electric rates was supposed to apply to the whole island of Panay. “This order includes the whole island of Pa- nay,” Marcos said into the microphone, correct- ing himself. As Marcos was about to finish talking, his vice presidential candidate, Arturo Tolentino, 75, tiptoed to the podium and was heard asking his running mate, “How about sugar?” “Oh yes,” said Marcos. Picking up the cue, he launched into a description of the package he had announced in the morning of credits and in- terest rate reductions to help sugar planters.

Durano predicted to a visitor that he will deliver his home terri- tory to Marcos by 700,000 votes, with just 10,000 for the opposition. He has offered to bet anybody a million pesos (about $50,000) that Marcos will be re-elected. _ There have been no takers. “Marcos has a machine, and it is well-oiled,” he says. If Durano and a few dozen lesser “godfathers” come through, Marcos probably will win. Howev- er, Marcos needs their help in a big way to overcome the unexpect- ed popularity of challenger Cora- zon Aquino, especially in urban districts. Even for Durano, pulling 700,000 votes would be a stunning feat. As of 1984, there were only about 600,000 registered voters in the area that he says he and his “control.” Ramon Durano stands before his 10-foot-hig replica of the Statue of Liberty. Photos by Rick McKay | {lox Newspapers Atlanta Constitution - February 3, 1986 > \f ‘ ee Few poll-watchers will be on hand to monitor how fairly the votes in Durano country are counted. For decades, the political opposition has been unable to attract local organizers. Even the church-supported, non-partisan Na- tional Movement for Free Elections (NAM- FREL) cannot find recruits willing to brave the outlying precincts on election day. “Tt is useless,” says Durano’s parish priest, Monsignor Santos de la Cerna, who is the nominal NAMFREL representative in Danao, Durano’s hometown. The monsignor says no local people are : willing to volunteer to be NAMFREL poll- watchers. “I have sat here for 10 years al- ready,” he says, “These.people-are.all-afraid:, of the old man.”\"\" De la Cerna says he has advised regional NAMFREL officials to “avoid trouble” by not trying to send in volunteer poll-watchers from elsewhere. He says armed Durano men ordered a carload of NAMFREL volunteers to leave town on the day of the Philippine congressional election in 1984, “I am not so enthusiastic about forcing in another NAMFREL group because the sane thine might happen.” the monsignor Durano, a feisty 81-year-old multimil- lionaire, insists he doesn’t mind having NAMFREL people around “so long as they are neutral,” He says he can tell “by. their A member of the Philippine Congress from 1949 through 1973, Durano has’ fash- ioned political alliances with every president since the country gained independence in 1946. : “There is no party here,” he says, ‘dt is Ramon Durano.” Philippine democracy is based largely on “personal cults,” he says. “Our country has not reached that stage yet when we have an intelligent middle class.” Durano began building his wealth.before World War II as a coal mine operator. After fighting as a guerrilla against the Japanese in World War Il, he branched out by per- suading two former Philippine presidents to grant him government credits to open a ce- ment plant and sugar mill. He claims he has gotten no favors from Marcos. His enterprises, which now also include a printing plant, a machine shop and:a pri- vate port, are the main sources of employ- ment along a 50-mile coastal strip of Cebu Island. Durano says his payroll is $100,000 a month but won't say how many people he employs. People here call him “manang,” which means “godfather” in the dialect of the Cebu islanders. Durano says the title is a sign of rever- ence, His enemies say “manang” carries an overtone of menace. _ Old-timers remember that back in 1952 Durano was tried on charges of ordering the SnOotINE 0 Pach meeting. He denied it and was acquitted. Durano says he is accustomed to being criticized falsely, “I am not an onion-skinned politician,” he says. “I can take it.” The real reason people follow his lead, he says, is that “these people simply love me. ... I am good to them. And they know I am a religious man.” In addition to his 10 parish churches, Durano has donated money through a per- sonal foundation to build 25-acre public park, which is near his house, that is filled with more than 300 larger-than-life religious statues, They include more than 200 busts of popes and saints, a 20-foot-long replica of the Last Supper, and 14 pastel-colored, plas- tic-enclosed tableaus depicting the Stations of the Cross, each equipped with a tape-re- corded message. Durano also has built a 50-bed hospital, a nursing home, an orphanage and a ceme- tery. Poor people don’t pay anything, he says. “I take care of these people from the cradle to the grave.” The only people who have to worry about him, he says, are communists. He says a victory this week by Marcos’ opponent, Mrs. Aquino, would be a step toward a communist takeover of the Philip- pines — an opinion that Mrs. Aquino says is ridiculous. “These people supporting Aquino are godless,” Durano says. “I cannot allow the communists to take over the country. “You see I am fully armed,” he ‘adds, pointing to a Jeep full of personal security guards who carry M-16 rifles. “I just cannot put my destiny and the destiny of my family with the armed forces: of the Philippines. I have to defend myself.” Atlanta Constitution - February 3, 1986 (Continued) \f"

It’s paving no food, no vitamins. ... It’s a very hard life. Sometimes my chest is aching.” Like masses of other have-nots in the wretched slums of Manila, Mrs. Nibal plans to vote for opposition candidate Corazon Aquino. It’s a pocketbook issue to her. Dried fish and rice, the staples of her diet, cost more than they used to. And no one in her household has a regular job. Asked if Mrs. Aquino would improve her life, she replied, “I don’t think so, but we will hope.” Although she started college to become a teacher, she dropped out to get married and now has two children, a 3-year-old and an &month-old whom she is breast-feeding.

She calls President Ferdinand Marcos a “personification of Satan” and adds that she “hates” President Reagan for supporting Marcos. She says she isn’t a communist or a revolutionary — not yet, at least. Angry, outspoken but not fully radical- ized, Sister Tan represents an activist Cath- olic “X factor” in the Philippine equation. For the moment, the 55-year-old nun is all for democratic opposition candidate Cor- azon Aquino. Yet she fully expects Mrs, Aquino to lose. And if that happens, she could well veer all the way into the revolu- tionary camp. Although Sister Tan's views are to ‘the left of Mrs. Aquino’s, she is one of the can- didate’s trusted personal advisers. They have been friends since Sister Tan would call on Mrs. Aquino while her husband, the late Sen, Benigno Aquino, was imprisoned under martial law in the 1970s. One of a small minority of nuns and priests who are overtly partisan, Sister Tan has been spending her recent Saturday mornings riding in Aquino motorcades along with pro-Aquino businessmen. She says an Aquino victory would give the country inspiration — “a little crack in the window” — although she doubts. that Mrs. Aquino could do much to help slum dwellers. Fifteen. years ago, Sister Tan was part of the church establishment. She was not only the ranking nun in the Order of the Good Shepherd, but also chairwoman of the Philippine Association of Religious Superi- ors, a group representing all nuns in the country. In the 1970s, she began devoting more of her time to work in the slums. For the last seven years, she has lived and minis- tered full time in a Manila slum called Le- veriza. “In our kind of work, we have to work with the communists,” she says. She says she stays in touch with nuns who work in outlying provinces where the communist rebels of the New People’s Army pave created “liberated and semili- Sister Christine Tan poses with children in the Manila slum of Leveriza, where she has lived and worked for the berated zones.” She says these contacts have told her that “the people generally like the commu- nists far more than any other administra- tion. ...

        "ocr_text": "Despite having a leg up, Marcos is not a shoo-in By Joseph Albright Cox News Service Writer MANILA — Despite his huge ad- vantages of money, patronage and a docile press, President Ferdinand Mar- cos still doesn't have his re-election locked up. With only one day of campaigning left, the wounded old warhorse emerged from Malacanang Palace Tuesday for one public appearance. He made a meandering speech to tepid ap- plause assuring 1,000 businessmen that he isn't “a flabby, ineffective leader.” His opponent, Corazon Aquino, the self-styled “crusading housewife,” gave the capital one more sign that she has captured the public's imagination. At least half a million marchers crammed a park along Manila Bay and waited up to five hours to see her at a rally. Like everything else in the Aquino campaign, the rally was orga- nized on a shoestring. There wasn't enough money for buses. The organiz- ers asked people to walk — and they did. For all practical purposes, the cam- paign Is over even though Marcos will | stage his own monster rally in the same spot Wednesday. After two months of mudslinging and 47 cam- paign-related killings, it's now up to the 26 million voters, A close look at the registration fig- ures suggests that Friday's election could be extremely close, Mrs, Aquino has a strong base in, metropolitan Manila and three other nearby regions, Central Luzon Island, South Tagalog and Bicol, These are places where opposition candidates did well against pro-Mar: cos candidates in the 1984 National Assembly elections, It Is also where the Marcos political machine |s least formidable, Nearly 12 million voters live in these regions that can be considered Mrs, Aquino's heartland, To have a chance against Marcos na- tionwide, she has to chock up at least 60 percent of the votes in metropolitan Manila and her three other strong re- gions. If she gets 70 percent, Marcos Will be in trouble. The president's electoral base is nar- rower. Only about 6 million voters live in the four regions where his New Soci- ety Movement totally dominated the Opposition in the 1984 General Assem- bly balloting. They are the “Solid North,” where he began his political career; much of the Muslim South on Mindanao Island, and the Eastern Visayas Islands, which are the home of first lady Imelda Marcos. Judging from past performance, Marcos will probably draw a 70 per: cent majority in his safe regions. Even if he gets 80 percent, he will not be home free, ‘Another 8.6 million voters live in five other regions where no candidate starts with an obvious advantage. The candi- date who wins in Manila will probably win the election. These battleground regions are scat: tered over a 500-mile arc from south- ern Mindanao Island almost to the coast of Malaysia. Asin all Philippine elections, person- al attacks have been the meat of the campaign. In one speech this week, Mrs. Aquino called Marcos a “cruel enslaving Phar- oah,” who began by fabricated his war record and went on to enriched himself and disgrace the nation. Marcos, for his part, has tried to por- tray Mrs. Aquino as a naive and inexpes |- rienced dupe of the communists, The president hasn’t let Mrs, Aquino forget her early, and quickly retracted, comment that she would permit com: munists into her government if they re- nounced the force. Marcos has enjoyed a commanding edge in getting his points across be- cause either the government or his close friends own all the well-estab- lished newspapers and all the television channels, The opposition depends on two anti-Marcos newspapers that have little circulation outside Manila. Not a day passes without either Mar- Cos or one of his subordinates blasting Mrs. Aquino for her lack of mental experience on the TV news. ng her sttetutagt After ignoti mucn 0 ne aAmnaioning. || news shows have in the last week tak- en to airing a quick clip of Mrs. Aquino each evening. Her slashing attacks on the president are not broadcast. What has carried the Aquino cam- paign despite its handicaps is that the Philippine economy is in a horrendous recession. A government agency says the in- dustrial sector of the economy has shrunk by 21 percent in the last two years. Export earnings dropped 14.5 percent in 1985 alone, while construc tion was down 28 percent last year. All the statistics don’t matter much to people without jobs — and through- out the Philippines are millions of un- employed and underemployed people. Like Herbert Hoover in 1932, Marcos is bucking a groundswell for change. Mrs. Aquino says she has to win by an overwhelming 65 percent of the votes to keep Marcos from rigging the election returns in his favor. That's probably an exaggeration. Unquestionably there will be some cheating. There has been fraud and in- timidation in every one of the eight Philippine presidential elections since the country won its independence from the United States in 1946. In dozens of towns and cities, voting lists are shamelessly inflated. In the southern town of Imelda, for example, the Commission on Elections estimates the voting age population is about 2,650 — yet there are 5,516 registered voters. The discrepancy is even more bizarre in Lumbayanague, another municipal- ity in the Muslim south. The town has about 1,850 people of voting age and 4,483 registered voters. Stealing votes by the millions above and beyond what has been stolen in past elections would be a logistical challenge of a different order. Dayton aernele Herald - February 5, 1986 \f"

Cabitubituc is a “ghost baran- gay\" — a fake village that comes to life only on election day, The place affords a rare look at one way votes are stolen in Philippine elections — and at why millions of Filipinos aren't going to accept the fairness of r iday's presidential election no matter how the tabulation comes out. Barangays are the smallest units of government in the Philippines. Rural barangays usually have a few hundred resi- dents while those in the cities often have several thousand, Feisal Tomawas is an adminis- trator of the school that would teach any children from the Cabitubitue barangay if they existed.

The other man would say nothing. Two visiting reporters got an armed escort and help in finding Cabitubitue from local suppor ers of opposition candidate Cora zon Aquino, who were clearly eager to embarrass the local pro- Marcos machine. Repeated efforts to obtain comment from Ali Dimaporo, the provincial governor and Marcos's strongest supporter among the 5 percent minority of Muslims in the Philippines, brought no response, ONE OF DIMAPORO'S close litical allies, Kamar Boloto, ac- owledged that “there may be some very insignificant cases” of ghost berengeye on the prov: ce's voting rolls.

There has been no official at- tempt to reconcile the apparent 42 percent disparity between census and voting figures. No doubt at least some of the difference results from an undercount of the lation by census takers in 1 SEVERAL LOCAL sources, in- cluding Dimaporo's political ally, Boloto, agreed that the 1980 cen- sus figures for Lanao del Sur were 100 low because a lingering Muslim separatist insurgency kept census takers from reach- ing the more remote regions.

After the poll-watchers left, the intruders took over the counting of the roughly 5,000 ballots that had been cast _ A Filipino nun, who was serving as one of the non-partisan poll- watchers for the National Move- ment for Free Elections, gave this account of what she saw: “We were waiting to count the ballots when I saw two men armed with rifles in the school courtyard. I heard some shots. One of them came into the classroom where we were waiting. “One of the men told us to get out or else they would kill all the NAMFRELs. He said, ‘We will take care of the counting.’ I saw the man open the ballot box.” . The nun, who declined to have ne name published, said this just after she and I were driven out into East Panataleon Street by a burst of gunfire in the school courtyard. The e happened a half-hour’s drive from the government-owned hotel where American election ob- servers were staying. I had walked into the school half an hour after polls closed to look into reports that some opposi- tion voters had not found their names on voting lists. ~ About 200 people were milling around the inner courtyard of the school. The counting was about to in the 26 precincts, each occu-. pying one classroom. It is a work- ing-class district which went heavily for an opposition candidate in 1984 parliamentary elections. This time, opposition leaders hoped a presidential . candidate would do even better against 20- year incumbent Ferdinand Marcos. . Opposition sources later blamed the shooting incident on policemen loyal to the pro-Marcos mayor of ndaluyong, but this could not be confirmed. _ Mrs. Geralda Raymundo, year-old worker for opposition can- didate Corazon Aquino, was close to tears even before the raid. _ “It was a very d election,” ‘she ‘said before the raid.

        "ocr_text": "Tally dashes Marcos bid for landslide By Joseph Albright Cox News Service Writer MANILA — President Marcos’ hopes for a quick landslide evaporated early Saturday, as some Vote counts showed him trailing and others showed him holding a dwindling lead. Reform candidate Corazon Aquino, who attacked Marcos as a phony war hero and patron of “a den of world-class thieves,” took a quick edge in a tally by the church-supported National Movement for Free Elections. By daybreak, she led Marcos wr by-a margin of 58 to 42 in the ry NAMFREL count, but that | F margin was sure to shrink as more pro-Marcos rural pre- cincts reported. Even by Philippines stan- dards, voting Friday was bloody and dirty. The chief American election observer, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said he was “very disturbed by the patttern of incidents.” . Lugar also speculated that the government “may be deep- ly concerned abcut the results and trying to assess the situation.” Twenty-six people were killed, regional bureaus of the Philippine News Service re- ported. NAMFREL and opposi- tion leaders charged that more than a dozen of the country’s 86,000 ballot boxes were snatched before their votes could be counted. Marcos held a 54-46 edge in tabulations by a consortium of pro-Marcos newspa- pers and by the state-owned television channel. More than 12 hours after the polls closed, the Com- mission on Elections had tallied less than 1 percent of the votes. Returns dribbled in so slowly to the government's high-tech “Operation Quick Count” center that 100 computer operators sat idle through the night. The government count at daybreak showed Marcos lead- ing by a 51-49 margin. “I am so disappointed that the results are not com- ing in faster,” said elections commissioner Quirino Martinez. “I am worried that something is being done, you know.... It could be that somewhere along the Corazon Aquino line somebody is trying to cook them (results) and trying to delay it.”’ The government-owned Philippine News Agency reported that nine na- tional police troops and two teachers were killed in the bloodiest election day incident. The agency said their convoy was ambushed by the New Peoples Army, the military arm of the Philip- pine Communist Party, as they trans- ported ballots to the polls in the south- ern Island of Mindanao. It was unclear whether this outbreak was related to an incident reported ear- lier on Mindanao in which the news agency reported that four suspected Communist insurgents were killed by soldiers when they ambushed an Army tank. One of the roughly 500,000 nonparti- san NAMFREL pollwatchers was killed “while preventing the snatching of a ballot box,’”’ a NAMFREL statement said. The volunteer, Rodrigo Ponce Jr., was shot in an episode in Roxas City, a city south of Manila. Almost as soon as the polls opened, NAMFREL headquarters was deluged with calls from worried NAMFREL pollwatchers about episodes of intimi- dation, ballot thefts and citizens whoa weren't being allowed to vote. Reporters and other foreign observ- ers found some schools where every- thing was calm and friendly. But it wasn’t hard to find ugly incidents, es- pecially in urban pro-Aquino districts where the incumbent mayors and bar- angay captains are pro-Marcos. One of the first signs of trouble came in Danao, the home of pro-Marcos war- lord and millionaire Ramon Durano Sr., who had boasted that his neighbors loved him so much they would give Marcos more than 95 percent of the votes. Christian Monsod, a NAMFREL offi- cial, announced at midmorning that a squad of NAMFREL volunteers had been “intimidated and beaten up” when they showed up to watch the polls in Danao. Durano’s bailiwick was the first of at least a half-dozen cities and provinces where NAMFREL ordered its poll- watchers to pull out to avoid getting killed. About noon, the NAMFREL opera- tions center at the La Salle Catholic high school got a panicky call that some of its volunteers were ‘“‘trapped’’ b armed men at a school in Metropolitan Manila. Reporters who drove to the pro-op- position neighborhood found that a NAMFREL pollwatcher had been grabbed and pushed to the ground by unknown armed men. Witnesses, in- cluding Sister Mary Anunciata, said the men shot into the air and grabbed the volunteer because he had tried to pho- tograph voting procedures. “One of the men grabbed me on the shoulder,” said Sister Anunciata, her- self a NAMFREL pollworker. “I pushed his hand away.” Further reports of shootings and beatings continued through the day. In Mrs. Aquino’s home province of Tarlac, north of Manila, opposition par- ty workers reported that one of their pollwatchers, Vicente Rosillo, was hit in the head with an M-16 rifle butt when he tried to stop armed intruders from grabbing a ballot box. In the Manila suburb of Manda- luyong, where Mrs. Aquino is popular, two voting centers were hit by ballot- snatching raiders in separate incidents about three hours apart. In the first incident, witnessed by a Cox Newspapers reporter, a half-dozen men — including two with M-16s and one with a pearl-handled pistol — drove away two dozen NAMFREL and opposition pollwatchers after firing their weapons into the air. Members of the gang then took over the vote tabu- lation at the school. Three hours later, according to NAMFREL, five people armed with M- 16s burst into a second Mandaluyong school, snatching ballot boxes from NAMFREL volunteers. A NAMFREL spokesman said some volunteers chased after the raiders and saw them dump the boxes into a canal. Although the ballots were fished out of the water, it wasn’t clear whether they could be counted legally. Despite the violent incidents, Reno Martinez, a pro-Marcos member of the Commission on Elections, told report- ers the election had gone off “fairly well” throughout the country. “In- elections in the Philippines, shooting is not unusual,’’ said Martinez. “When you get into politics here, you are ready to die. We are very emotional about our politics.”” The most wide- spread problem, it seemed, was tens of thousands of voters who arrived at polling places to find their names were not on the lists.

She said one will be celebrated by the senior Catholic prelate in the Philippines, Cardinal Jaime Sin. Asked at a press conference how she proposes to have the elec- tion settled if Marcos doesn’t con- cede, Mrs. Aquino gave replied, “Well, they (Parliament members} will just have to accept our re- sults.” Buoyed by a lead and irate over dirty tricks in the election, Mrs. Aquino told reporters, “If it is very evident to me that I am being order to meet the exigency, issue the necessary decrees ... which shall form part of the law of the land.” US. officials said the Reagan administration is * artis over reports of vote fraud but does not plan to comment officially until Monday or Tuesday. Administration officials downplayed Marcos’ hint that he may invalidate the election. “We don’t believe he would do that,” one administration official told the New York Times, “because he knows that-Manila would go up in flames.” Mrs. Aquino has vowed to hold “peaceful” anti-Marcos street pro- tests every day until she is pro- claimed president. Probably not since the fall of the Shah of Iran has a trusted U.S, military ally swayed with such obvi- ous instability. Marcos dropped a new hint that he may turn toward other powers for help if the United States doesn’t stand by him, The pro-Marcos speaker of the cheated out of an election, I will not accept anybody's proclamation.” Shé led a honking caravan of Jeepneys and taxis to Makati, where about 1,500 of her supporters were holding a vigil to make sure nobody: attempted to steal or switch ‘their ballots, which were stored in the municipal motor pool building. The exuberant crowd sang “Bayan Ko,” which translates to “My Country,” and then held high the familiar thumb-and-first-finger “fight” sign that is the symbol of her anti-Marcos crusade. “The Philippine people aren’t going to be cheated anymore,” Mrs. Aquino said over a megaphone from the balcony of Makati Town Hall. Marcos quickly fired off an ap- peal to her to accept the judgment of the National Assembly on who won the election. Two-thirds of its members also are members of Marcos’ party, and the president has said he would not resign until the assembly proclaims the winner. Marcos also put the United Philippine National Assembly called members to meet in Manila late Monday to begin an official canvass of vote totals compiled by provin- cial and city registrars, The election clearly did not give Marcos the “new mandate” he said he needed when he called a va election in November. Yet he isn showing signs of conceding, as Mrs. Aquino asked him to do. Marcos said his own campaign headquarters has assured him he will win even “under a worst sce- nario.” Victorino Savellano, chairman of the Commission on Elections, made a plaintive televised appeal for all municipal officials to forward their voting tally sheets to his office to speed the tabulation. “There is nothing to hide,” the chairman said about the unresolved controversy over why the commis- sion’s computers are counting so slowly. Meanwhile, Marcos and the Catholic Church were at each oth er’s throats, Marcos charged that States on notice that he will consid- er making deals with unidentified “other powers here in the region” if Washington cuts back on military aid because of irregularities in Fri- day's voting. ‘d Marcos implied that continued American use of Subic Bay Navy Base and Clark Air Base could be at stake, He was reacting to charges aired by Sen. Richard Lu- gar, chairman of the U.S. election observers team, that “some degree of systematic harassment” had oc- curred in Manila precincts, “My feeling is the count is being managed, manipulated,” the Indiana Republican told reporters. Au we presidenual — palace, which was equipped with a new barbed-wire barricade on election day, Marcos elaborated. “If you want to cut the military aid to us, to eliminate the bases, what can we do? We will have to live with that. We will have to make some kind of a modus vivendi with the other powers here in the region,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 9, 1986 \f"

Lugar, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, read a statement approved by the ob- servers before they left for Wash- ington: He said the report would be delivered to President Reagan on Tuesday. The statement said in part, “Sadly ... we have witnessed and heard disturbing reports of efforts to Undermine the integrity” of the election process “both during the voting and vote- -counting process, whieh is still under way.’ As the Americans left their Ma- nila hotel, about 200 pro-govern- ment-demonstrators outside the en- trance chanted and waved placards demanding that foreign observers and reporters leave the country. By Monday morning, with 28 percent of the precincts reporting, the government election commis- sion’s unofficial tally gave Marcos 3,056,236 votes to Mrs. Aquino’s 2,903,348, a split of 51.28 percent to 48.72 percent. But an independent count by the National Movement for Free Elec- tions, a citizens ballot-monitoring group known as NAMFREL, had Mrs. Aquino in the lead with 5,576,319 votes to 4,806,166 for Mar- cos, or 53.7 percent to 46.3 percent. The country remained generally calm as the count inched forward. However, Aquino forces planned to begin”a series of daily mass pro- tests aimed at building pressure on the National Assembly to declare her the winner. The 30 workers, who would not give their names, charged that the totals they calculated on their com- puters were not being accurately , posted on the center's giant tally ” board. Meanwhile, a team of interna- tional election observers invited to the Philippines by Marcos unani- mously charged there had been ma- jor electoral abuses. “We saw many instances of vote-buying, attempts at intimida- tion, snatching of ballot boxes, and tampered election returns,” de- clared a report by the 44-member international delegation, which is fi- nanced mainly by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Information Agency.

Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), one of the observers who spoke with representatives of the computer op- erators, said he found their allega- tions highly credible. “I think these are the most damning comments that I've ever. heard and the most dramatic event that I’ve witnessed in the course of ne in the Philippines,” Kerry Sai \f"

        "ocr_text": "Philippine vote heads toward worst- case finale By Joseph Albright Cax News Service MANILA — It looks as though the Philippine election is dragging out toward a worst-case finale: Fer- dinand Marcos narrowly re-elected, thanks to the last-minute disfran- chisement of perhaps 3 million vot- ers. Challenger Corazon Aquino is holding a 52-to-48 percent lead with Analysis 64 percent of the votes counted, ac- cording to the latest tabulation by the National Movement for Free Elections, or NAMFREL. But her lead is gradually eroding as pro- Marcos rural strongholds report. She doesn’t have much of a cushion because the NAMFREL figures al- ready include three-fourths of the precincts in regions where she is strong. One intriguing twist is that Mrs. Aquino’s running mate, longtime presidential hopeful Salvador Lau- rel, may eke out a victory even if she loses. Some cynics believe Marcos would be delighted to arrange this outcome because it would allow him to split the opposition into “ins” and “outs.” Laurel said in an interview with the Cox News Service on Tuesday that if the National Assembly pro- claims him the winner on the basis of accurate tallies, he will accept — even if Mrs. Aquino is not elected. Lacking a quorum, the assembly ad- journed Tuesday without proclaim- ing a winner. * # ee KS — es «~ ¥ eee. oe By I a ae 3 Corazon Aquino is clinging to a 52-to-48 percent lead, according to unofficial NAMFREL tallies. “I have no choice to accept the people’s mandate,” said Laurel, a former member of the National As- sembly from Marcos’ party who now heads a centrist opposition fac- tion, the United Nationalist Demo- cratic Organization. “I know I didn’t cheat.” He maintained that he expects both he and Mrs. Aquino will win. But if it turns out that he alone is elected, ‘I can be vice president without working for Marcos.” Laurel said a Marcos-Laurel combination, if it happens, “would partially defuse, but not completely, the intensity of the disgust of the people.” More than 90 people have been killed since the campaign began in December. On Tuesday, former Gov. Evelio Javier, chairman of Mrs. Aquino’s campaign in the central Philippine province of Antique, was shot to death by unidentified men outside ne Antique provincial capitol build- ng. | Laurel’s silence since the elec- | tion has intrigued many. He has not claimed victory and has not joined Mrs. Aquino in declaring that he would reject the findings of the pro- Marcos National Assembly if it dif- fers from the opposition vote tallies. Laurel is running ahead of Mrs. Aquino by about 150,000 votes. He is pulling gradually further ahead of Mrs. Aquino as returns pile in from the “solid north,” where Marcos has once again demonstrated his abso- lute control. A senior NAMFREL official said privately that while Mrs. Aquino should not be counted out yet, “it looks like” a narrow Marcos victory. A pattern is emerging of wide- spread omissions of names from voter lists in Aquino areas. The turnout in metropolitan Ma- nila, Mrs. Aquino’s home base, fell some 400,000 votes short of the turnout here in the 1984 National Assembly elections. She is on her way to carrying between eight and 10 of the regions. But where she is winning, the turn- out is averaging at least five per- cent less than that in the Marcos re- gions, judging from NAMFREL data. The Aquino margin in the met- ropolitan area turned out to be only 54-46, far below the 60 to 70 per- cent analysts said she needed to win. Atlanta Constitution - February 12, 1986 \f"

It was so extreme that the election's credibility has been called into question both within the Philippines and in the United States.” A Reagan administration official, who asked not to be identified, said there are no easy answers to the problem. “There are no magic solutions, but the goal is ‘| to remain involved,” he said, Asked whether the United States would continue to deal with Marcos’ government, the official replied: “We will deal with the Filipino body politic.” Despite the fraud and violence, Reagan said the elections “were marked by heartening evidence of the continuing commitment of the Filipino people to the democratic process and the furtherance of a two-party system, which should strengthen that process in the fu- ture.” Meanwhile, Philippine opposition members walked out of the session hall shortly before midnight, charg- ing that the pro-Marcos majority sought to “railroad” Marcos’ re- election. ' Two minutes later, the pro-Mar- cos assemblymen unanimously passed a motion declaring Marcos the winner of the bitterly fought election. The formal proclamation asserting that Marcos and his run- ning mate, Arturo Tolentino, had won six-year terms was read to the legislators by National Assembly Speaker Nicanor Yniguez. , He reported that Marcos had outpolled challenger Corazon “Cory” Aquino by 10,807,197 to 9,291,716 votes, gathering nearly 54 percent . ' Meantime, there were these oth er developments in a tense, rumor- filled capital a day after the 104- member Catholic Bishops Conference denounced the election, held nine days ago, as “unparalleled in fraudulence”: @ A Catholic radio station re- peatedly called on its listeners to bring their rosaries and march to downtown Manila on Sunday for a huge “‘people’s victory” rally called by Mrs. Aquino. @ Marcos told a television inter- viewer that he had dispatched the Philippine Constabulary command- er, Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, to meet opposition leaders in hopes of avoid- ing street clashes Sunday. “We are going to do everything to reconcile,” sald Marcos. “We believe we can do so by removing all the hotheads.” . @ Presidential envoy Philip Ha- bib was met by Acting Foreign Min- ister Pacifico Castro when he ar- rived late Saturday to begin his round of meetings with church, busi- ness and political leaders. Habib de- clined to answer questions. @A spokesman for UNIDO, the largest party backing Mrs. Aquino, charged that three of its women: campaign workers had been found raped, mutilated and killed in Quiri- no province, an isolated mountain region 250 miles north of Manila. At the Manila headquarters of the Phil- : ippine Constabulary, an officer said - two UNIDO workers in the province: had been reported killed but that! there had been no reports of rapes. - The pace of events accelerated: as the protagonists in the electoral crisis rushed to reposition them-: selves after Friday's open assault, by the church hierarchy against the! arcos administration. 1 The bishops, reportedly rebuff-~ ing a personal appeal by first lady! Imelda Marcos during their meet-! ing, called on rhe ca to begin a 1 “non-violent struggle for justice.”  * ~-Yniguez reacted by speeding up assembly subcommittee, whose members have been questioning al- most every province's certificate of canvass for improper seals, era- sures and missing signatures. ished reading the last of the official vote tallies from the 140 provincial and city tabulation centers. A report on state-owned TV reported that Marcos and Tolentino “are the win- ners.” : After a five-hour caucus by a an board of tellers, Yniguez, who was Marcos’ national campaign manager, issued his formal report to the assembly. “The speaker finds that His Ex- cellency Ferdinand. E. Marcos has garnered the highest number of votes for the position of presidency of the Philippines,” said the report by a board of tellers chaired by Yn- iguez. His tally gave these results from 99 percent of the precincts: For president: Marcos: 10,807,197 votes, or 54 percent. Mrs. Aquino: 9,291,717 votes, or 46 percent. For vice president: Tolentino, Marcos’ running mate; 10,134,130 votes, or 50 per- cent. ‘Salvador Laurel, Mrs. Aquino’s running mate: 9,173,105 votes, or 46 percent. Opposition floor leader Ed- mundo Cea called on the speaker to delay a final vote, saying, “We be- lieve the report of the speaker is er- roneous.” He overruled Cea’s point of order. The last unofficial count by the church-backed National Movement for Free Elections, or NAMFREL, showed Mrs. Aquino leading by about 600,000 votes with two-thirds of the precincts reporting. The NAMFREL count has not been up- dated for two days. Minority leader Jose Laurel, who is the brother of Mrs. Aquino’s running mate, then called on op i- tion members to walk out. They are trying to railroad the proclama- tion,” he said, to the jeering of pro- Marcos majority members. State-owned television, which has followed election developments in virtually non-stop fashion since Feb. 7, cut away from the National Assembly during most of the opposi- tion pleas for an extension of de- bate. The government channel did return to televise the opposition members filing out of the chamber. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 16, 1986 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Revised voter lists contributed to confusion in Philippines By Joseph Albright Gox News Service - MANDALUYONG, Philippines —+ They looked like desperate peo- ple pushing in a bread line, but they were just disenfranchised citizens clamoring for their chance to vote against Ferdinand Marcos. ~“ Serunched into the one-room election registrar's office and down a:narrow wooden staircase, the 500 residents of this Manila suburb knew the polls would close in half an hour. ' “I’ve been robbed,” said Barba- ra Escucha, a 24-year-old social worker with tears of rage on her cheeks. “I am disgusted. Look, here is my voter card. I have been a reg- ular voter since 1981.” “; She had gone to vote in her lo- 1 schoolhouse seven hours earlier, ly to find that her name was not on the precinct voter list. Now, fi- mally, someone had directed her to this office, where she might get a Special affidavit allowing her to vote. _ But time ran out. The electoral registrar, a Marcos patronage em- Bixee. was not around. Barbara Es- a never voted. ~: The absence of her vote, along with that of roughly 3 million other disenfranchised voters, would pro- vide Marcos the decisive edge against opposition candidate Cora- zon Aquino. For as Mandaluyong went, so went the nation. And Saturday, the tional Assembly certified that larcos did indeed win, 54 percent to 46 percent. . ‘“Our objective was to the gap,”’ crowed Mayor Ernesto Domingo, a political ally of first lady Imelda Marcos, in an interview after the election. . He showed off a copy of a polit- ica] intelligence report he sent to Marcos’ eldest daughter, Imee, a month before the election. It said Marcos was behind 55 percent to 45 percent locally, and that is almost exactly how the election turned out. . ‘We imparted what we and the president have done for the poopie. said the mayor. “Modesty aside, I am No. 1 in metro Manila. You can see the multipurpose building, the basketball courts, streets, water tanks, everything.” ‘Domingo denied that the Marcos organization had deliberately sup- pressed the turnout by altering vot- er lists. His own daughter’s name was left off the list, he said, and it took two hours before one of his aides could track down the elections reg- istrar to get her name restored to the list. A key voting region A rural backwater until it was linked to Manila by a bridge in the 1930s, Mandaluyong is now a bur- eoning suburb of 250,000 people that inc neighbor! and mansions. Among its residents are Cardi- nal Jaime Sin, Aquino financial backer Jaime Ongpin and Jose Con- ception Jr., chairman of the Nation- al Movement for Free Elections, or NAMFREL. Both sides knew the electoral mathematics: Mrs. Aquino had to win metropolitan Manila by 1.8 mil- lion votes to overcome Marcos’ con- trol of the “Solid North” and other machine-dominated rural domains. As it turned out, she only car- ried the metropolitan area by about 225,000 votes. That’s why the offi- cial tallies say she lost nationally by 1.5 million votes — and why the National Assembl is moving toward proclaiming Marcos’ re-elec- tion. To_ beat Marcos, Mrs. Aquino needed to win Mandaluyong by 45,000 votes, or 70 percent of the vote. No problem, or so her campaign aides believed when they saw all ~ = But when the returns came in, she only won here by 13,000 votes, ‘with a margin of 57 percent to 43 it. “It’s not very good,” said the lo- cal uino leader, former municipal judge Abalos. Mrs. Aquino’s failure here was partly her disappointing margin and partly the fact that only 63 percent of those registered voted. As it turned out, the dropoff in voting made far more difference than raid of six armed men who burst into one Mandaluyong polling place, evicted the poll watchers, and took over the counting. The raid, witnessed by a Cox News Service reporter at the Hulo .Elementary School, left two NAM- FREL volunteers with bloody faces. Disturbing as it was, the raid hardly was worth the effort since it only deprived Mrs. Aquino of a few thou- sand votes. - What really made a difference was the unarmed bureaucratic bal- lot snatching. By Philippine standards, 63 per- cent is an abysmally low turnout. Seventy-seven percent of those eligi- ble voted in 1984 elections for the National. Assembly. Even that was well below the national turnout, les slums, working-class. which averaged 89 percent that It is si — here as well as elsewhere — that the opposition and NAMFREL were caught so flat- footed by the wholesale omissions in the precinct voting lists. Voters confused, mad The Aquino campaign leaders, most of them lawyers, should have realized that a 1984 law ordering the Commission on Elections to re- shuffle voters to new precincts based on street addresses could cause problems. Two years ago, almost everyone considered the law that revised pre- cinct lines a reform. It meant that people would vote near their homes rather than in their old polling places, which were divided alpha- betically. Bureaucratic backlogs kept the Commission on Elections from redoing the voter lists in time for the 1984 elections. The task was finally begun in earnest last August, four months before Marcos called the special election, one pro-Marcos elections commissioner said on elec- tion night. The opposition says there was no official notice of the voter list reshuffle. Even so, it seems incredi- ble that such a widespread change — which must have involved hun- dreds of election clerks around the country filling out voters lists in handwriting — could have slipped by without the opposition or NAM- ‘REL catching on. Aside from what the voter list snafu showed about the gullibility of the Aquino camp, it also demon- strated how little the 1,000 foreign journalists and presidential observ- ers really knew about the intrica- cies of Philippine politics, especially the strategy of the Marcos camp. “No one of us had anticipated ‘tthe disenfranchisement trick,” said Aquino press secretary Rene Sagui- ae “It was so subtle — and effec- ve.” Outside three Mandaluyong poll- ing places, a reporter found no one who said he had been denied a chance to vote for Marcos. Yet there were scores of voters who had tried all day to vote for Mrs. mane and gave up only when the polls closed. “Damn those people,” cried Son- ny Manuel, 25, as the 3 p.m. voting deadline passed. “They don’t want me to vote.” Manuel, who earns $1.50 a day as an ice cream ‘vendor, gave up a day’s work and spent 50 cents on Jeepney fares trying to find some- one who could help him vote. One of the Marcos precinct leaders, Manuel Reyes, 38, a munic- ined license inspector, approached uring the conversation to warn that Manuel was giving a reporter a biased view. How, Reyes was asked, did he feel about seeing at least 100 angry would-be voters milling around the front of the polling station. “I don’t feel nothing. I was able to vote,” said Reyes. Protests are ignored It was a telling comment. For many on both sides, this election was an eye-gouging, no-holds-barred struggle in which there was no code of fairness. That’s probably why the ballot box raid at the Hulo Elementary School by men armed with M-16s has not caused much of a stink here. “Nobody came to me and com- plained, so I consider it a minor problem,” Mayor Domingo said in an interview. “The problem you saw in Hulo, it will be patched up, no problem. After elections, we patch up our differences.” After the armed raiders left, a woman schoolteacher serving as an election judge and a NAMFREL volunteer decided to file a protest. After trying in vain to f the local election registrar, they ve to Manila and handed the stuffed ballot boxes to the one anti-Marcos member of the Commission on Elec- tions. When it came time to canvass the ballots, the local Aquino repre- sentative on the Mandaluyong board of canvassers decided not to make a public issue of the ballot raid. He simply moved to exclude the ballots from 12 precincts — meaning ‘per- haps 3,000 voters who had voted at the school. “It was a move to defuse the tension in the community,” said Er- nesto Gatdula, the Aquino represen- tative. He made no issue of the other 14 Hulo precincts, even though Mrs. Aquino only beat Marcos 51 percen to 49 percent in them, well below her margin in the rest of Manda- luyong. As of a week after the incident, Col. Emilio Templo, chief of staff of the national police for the capital region, said he wasn’t sure when an investigation of the incident would begin. Domingo said he has not. or- dered an investigation either. “It’s not within our jurisdiction,” he said. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 16, 1986 (Sidebar) \f"

Marcos, who declared, “I am the president, They are not going to drive me out.” More than 500,000 Filipinos packed into a park by Manila Bay to hear Mrs. Aquino set forth her agenda of “non-violent struggle” aimed at pressuring Marcos to re- sign. On orders from Marcos, police left the demonstrators alone. At a news conference at the presidential palace, Marcos rejected charges of fraud by his campaign supporters. “T am the president. They are not going to drive me out. The peo- ple are behind me,” he said. Marcos met with President Rea- gan’s special envoy, Philip Habib, on Monday to discuss the election results. He is scheduled to meet with lMrs. Aquino later Monday. Officials did not release any de- tails of Habib’s meeting with Mar- cos. In another development, Marcos said he has accepted the resignation of armed forces chief Gen. Fabian Ver Jr., whom some U.S. officials have called an obstacle to military reform. Ver will be available as a con- sultant. Appointed to replace him on an interim basis was the Constabulary chief, Lt. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos.

But he later was acquitted of the charge. Meanwhile, Mrs. Aquino called on her supporters to pull their mon- ey out of seven banks owned by the government or by Marcos asso- ciates, She also called for a boycott of products sold by a half-dozen com- ee controlled by Marcos loyal- ts. . The largest is San Miguel Corp., a beer and soft drink manufacturer that reportedly has a 70 percent in- terest in the Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. San Miguel’s chairman is Eduardo Cojuangceo Jr., who has been widely criticized as the holder of a monopoly on coconut products conferred by Marcos. The United States has Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base in the Philippines. Under the current five-year treaty, which runs out in 1991, the United States provides $900 million in military and economic aid to Marcos’ government. For the 1986 fiscal year, U.S. military and eco- nomic aid amounted to $245 million. The Aquino demonstration was tinged with anti-American senti- ments resulting mostly from Presi- dent Reagan’s initial post-election tilt toward Marcos. Few of those in- terviewed said they knew of Rea- gan’s latest broadside at “wide- spread fraud and violence perpetrated largely by the ruling party.” Atlanta Constitution - February 17, 1986 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Far left grasping at Aquino coattails By Joseph Albright Cox News Service MANILA, Philippines — The far left is floundering, much to the surprise of those who said the communists would be the big gainers in a disputed victory by Presi- dent Ferdinand Marcos. Two weeks after an election it boycotted, the left fringe coalition called Bayan has delayed clashing with police while it tries to fight its way aboard the band- wagon of the official loser, Corazon Aquino. Mrs. Aquino so far has stiff-armed feelers from Bayan about a possible ‘‘tactical alliance,” although some of her own backers favor the idea. Bayan claims it quickly can mobilize 30,000 to 50,000 students, peas- ants and workers for demonstrations. Bayan’s leaders are not overtly communists, but many support the tac- tics and objectives of the Philippine Communist Party and its military arm, the New People’s Army. One of the key strategists of Mrs. Aquino’s post- election campaign, management consultant Emanuel Soriano, predicted that Mrs. Aquino would continue to reject Bayan’s participation. “We don’t trust them in the sense that we think that the more bloodshed, the more drastic steps are taken, the better for them,” Sor- iano explained. Another reason for rejecting Bayan’s help, he said, is to avoid casting Mrs. Aquino in an unfavorable light in the United States. The left, meanwhile, has been holding midnight cau- cuses trying to figure out how to cope with Mrs. Aquino’s unexpected popularity and her own non-violent protests aimed at forcing Marcos to resign. “She could be the unifying symboi of the anti-dicta- torship front,” says Jose Castro Jr., executive director of Bayan for metropolitan Manila. “It depends on Cory now.” The communists and their 16,000-strong New Peo- ple’s Army boycotted the election, but generally re- frained from trying to disrupt it by ballot-snatchings or kidnappings. Bayan’s dithering about whether to send its corps of student militants into the streets after the election its. trates the left’s dilemma. Castro says Bayan initially planned to send 6,008 members with their red flags and Bayan banners to Mrs. Aquino’s mammoth “victory of the people” rally. Feb. 16. But, Castro says, Bayan got a call on the eve of the. rally from former Sen. Lorenzo Tanada, a forme# Bayan chairman who had left the organization to ant paign for Mrs. Aquino. Castro quotes Tanada as sayin “There are elements [around Mrs. Aquino] that don't, want Bayan yet.” 4 So Bayan left its banners home and sent only a ken force of 600 marchers for the Aquino rally. were all but lost among the more than half-millgon “yellow people” (for the yellow color that is the traties mark of her Laban Party) called out by Mrs. Aquino. ,* Bayan decided Monday to put itself back on map. The leadership made plans for a march of 10; militants the next day to the Mendiola Bridge eating to Malacanang Palace. The march was supposed to signify that the left was bolder than Mrs. Aquino, who had chosen not to march. to the presidential a Mendiola Bridge is a well- known site for bloody student protests, because of inci- dents in 1972 and 1983 in which protesters were killed by palace security forces. At a Bayan caucus Monday night, leftist leatets changed their minds and decided to settle for a small rally at the American Embassy and a larger deraiet: stration in front of a post office. +g id At the embassy there was fiery talk but no actor, as the roughly 600 student protesters could be seen: x- changing pleasantries with the young police officers facing them behind riot shields.

        "ocr_text": "Can Marcos ride out storm over election fraud? Outcome of protests is key to nation’s future By Joseph Albright Cox News Service MANILA, Phili — Presi- dential envoy Philip Habib keeps quiet about what he’s learned since arriving here a week ago, but Phil- ippine sources outline two sharply differing scenarios: one saying Pres- ident Ferdinand Marcos can ride out the storm, the other saying he can’t. Analysis The Marcos vision is that the country will simply settle down, as it always has after past elections. The Corazon Aquino forecast calls for sustained turmoil: strikes rippling through key industries, runs on banks, international isolation and perhaps even defections by key mil- itary commanders. Neither side is ready to buy a SE ee ae between reos and Aquino — the op- tion that apparently would make the White House happiest. Marcos has dangled the prospect of including Mrs. Aquino on an advi- sory Council of State, and Friday he said that such a council could be “more powerful” than typical advi- sory councils. But even Marcos loyalists con- sider the council a non-starter. “Given the post-election tension, any opposition leader who accepts a post in one of these more elevated advisory bodies will be immediately lynched in Rizal Park,” said Secre- tary of Labor Blas Ople. The starting point for both the Marcos and Aquino scenarios is the one-day nationwide “work stoppage” that Aquino has called for the first working day after Marcos’ in- auguration, scheduled for: Tuesday. She has said industry-by-industry strikes and school closures will fol- low if the first one-day nationwide strike is effective. “The strikes will fail,” said Ople. “It is a major act of petu- lance, but it will not affect the in- tegrity of society.” U.S. presidential envoy Philip Habib is holding talks with both sides in the Philippines. In Ople’s “ride-it-out” scenario, Marcos and his wife, Imelda, soon will recapture people’s attention with dramatic government reforms. Ople said that if the Internation- al Monetary Fund and foreign banks cut off loans, “the Philippines will be driven closer to Japan and China and the Soviet Union in terms of new trading links to replace some of the windows we may lose in the West.” Ople said that if the U.S. Con- gress cuts back on foreign aid funds, “we will reluctantly employ our own leverage,”’ by making moves toward ending American use of Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base. From the opposite perspective, Emanuel Soriano, who is a key member of Mrs. Aquino’s “non-vio- lence advisory group,” said that hit- a at weak points in the économy will gradually increase the pressure on Marcos to resign. In the next few days, he told an interviewer, the head of Mrs. Aquino’s group will send a telex to 432 banks around the world that have lent money in the Philippines. The telex will warn that a future Aquino government may not honor any financial obligations undertaken from now on by the Marcos govern- ment. “That should further destabilize the financial system,” Soriano said. Soriano predicted that at least one of the seven banks on Mrs. Aquino’s boycott list will go out of business, providing her with an ear- ly measure of success. “Just take Trader’s Royal Bank,” he said. “We can close their bank indefinitely in the Davao area {about 600 miles south of Manila] any day we want to. All we have to do is tell our people there to picket ae ee ee Oe ee ee out of the bank for several days. “In Manila, we will just issue the threat that it will be done here as well. In the ensuing few days, you can be sure their depositors will want to take their money out.” Five business days after Mrs. Aquino issued her bank boycott list, no banks have been closed. But in- dependent banking sources report “major” withdrawals from the tar- geted banks, including one “run” touched off when employees of one. bank closed their own accounts. The Central Bank has promised to back the targeted banks with special loans and deposits. Soriano said the Aquino forces’ “preferred” route would be a “nego- tiated settlement” in which Marcos agrees to have the Philippine Na- tional Assembly reopen the canvass- ing and declare Mrs. Aquino the winner. It would mean Marcos’ stepping down as president, some- thing he has flatly ruled out. That failing, Soriano said, the next best choice would be a decision by Mrs. Aquino to form an “alterna- tive government” on a secure terri- torial base in the Philippines. Soriano said this would require “a firm offer by decent elements of the military” to support Mrs. Aquino’s claim to be the legitimate president. Soriano claimed that certain un- named unit commanders affiliated with the army's semi-secret Mili- tary Reform Movement are pre- pared to side with Mrs. Aquino’s government if there is “black-and- white proof” that she actually won the election. Only one military officer has re- signed in protest since the election. It is widely believed that the. mili- tary reformers will not move against Marcos unless they believe they have a light from their American military contacts. If key military men won't back an alternative government, the Phil- ippines is likely to drift into a “Po- land situation,” Soriano said. Under that scenario, most Filipi- nos would follow Mrs. Aquino’s lead, just as Poles were insp by the church-backed Solidarity labor movement. “The people will relate to the government as minimally as possi- ble,” Soriano said. Unhappily, the “Poland situa- tion” looks like the most logical end of this excruciating election. Atlanta Constitution - February 22, 1986 \f"

President Aquino said she was ‘very happy” with the way the United States the handled Philippine crisis. USS. finally bet on a winner by backing Aquino Soviets seem like troublemakers as dictator Marcos is thrown out By Joseph Albright Cox News Service MANILA, Philippines — Eat your heart out, Gorbachev. After nearly blowing it two weeks ago, the Reagan administra- tion has come out of the Philippine crisis smelling like a rose. This may be the first popular revolution in the 20th century in which the Americans won by siding with the insurgents and the Rus- sians lost by embracing a dictator who went down the tubes. America’s former colony has in- stalled a charismatic moderate as president, and the communists end- ed up looking less like Robin Hoods and more like troublemakers. This was a revolution of a mili- tant bourgeoisie and a progressive church, backed up in the final days by fearless students, tank-stopping nuns and sensible soldiers. As revolutions go, it was an Analysis American dream. Here was a nation ripe for rebellion with a well- armed, well-organized communist underground ready to pounce when Marcos died. Then along came Corazon Aquino, a widow who didn’t know much — except how to fire up a na- tion, persuade ambitious rival Sal- vador Laurel to run as her vice president, and then campaign for 18 hours a day as she kept her cool. Even when Marcos was stealing the election and President Reagan was waffling, Mrs. Aquino didn’t veer leftward. The leadership of her own left-of-center Laban Party fa- vored a “tactical alliance” with the communist-influenced coalition Bayan a fortnight ago when she needed to mobilize anti-Marcos pro- testers to support her post-election boycott. Mrs. Aquino said no, she would rely on the Roman Catholic Church, the businessmen and the people. Asked Wednesday what she thought of the way the United States handled the crisis, she re- plied, “I was very happy. ... There was a slight ae with the first statement [Reagan’s post- election press conference]. But that _ quickly forgotten by yours tru- y.” ; Mrs. Aquino said that in the in- terests of reconciliation, she would not press for the extradition of Mar- cos, thus relieving Reagan of the embarrassment President Jimmy Sarees suffered with the Shah of ran. Mrs. Aquino, the little housewife with no experience in affairs of state, took all of 20 hours after the flight of Marcos to name a Cabinet on Wednesday. It was made up of intelligent, experienced moderates, most of them sympathetic to the United States. Sie She said she still was “keeping her options open” on what will hap- n to the American military bases n the Philippines after the current agreement expires in 1991. But she gave the foreign minister’s job to her vice president, a pragmatist who wouldn’t mind having the bases here forever if the Americans pay a fair price. Mrs. Aquino left the armed forces in the control of two old hands in counterinsurgency warfare who have shown under Marcos that they are no pushovers against com- munist rebels. They are the leaders of the mili- tary revolt against Marcos. One is Gen. Fidel Ramos, a West Point graduate who commanded the Phil- ippine counterinsurgency detach- ment that fought alongside the Americans in Vietnam. The other is Juan Ponce Enrile, who served as defense minister under Marcos. He also had doubled as chairman of the board of the United Coconut Plant- ers Bank, one of the seven banks the Aquino forces were boycotting. Reagan sounded hopelessly na- ive when he said immediately after the election that he would like to see the Marcos and Aquino factions work things out together in a new government.

At 1 a.m., six hours after Ra- mos. and Enrile called on him to re- sign, Marcos appeared on television to say the two were enmeshed in a plot to assassinate him. He said he could order artillery and tank fire onto the rebels at any time and ‘it would be a bloody mess.” But, he added, “We have no in- tention to hurt them. ... I just want to know why they conspired against me ” Marcos acted as though he did not take his own story seriously. In- stead of ordering the culprits cap- tured as assassins, Marcos tried to talk to Enrile on the telephone. En- rile refused. There was another phone call in the night, one Enrile accepted. “What can I do?’’ Corazon Aquino asked him. “Just pray for us,” he replied. It was Sunday’s only really im- rtant conversation. Mrs. Aquino ad wondered whether Enrile ‘and Ramos were trying to seize power and cut her out of the action. “We wanted to be satisfied ... that they have the interest of the country at heart,” she would explain in a midday statement. Marcos continued throughout the day to overestimate the rebels’ strength — and to underestimate the importance of the civilians gath- at the military camps. arcos constantly threatened tank and artillery attacks that nev- er materialized. Instead of frighten- ing the civilians, he built up their nerve. Yet at times, it seemed that the Marcos forces were gaining.

Early in the afternoon, Enrile and his reform movement guards left the Defense Ministry building and “consolidated” their forces with those of Ramos at Camp Crame.

Artemio Tadiar, a Marcos stalwart known as ‘‘the Hero of Bataan,” got his lesson in people power around 4:45 p.m., when he tried to move his hulking amphibious armored vehicles up A Avenue toward Camp Crame. Tadiar asked a crowd of 2,000 ple to get out of the way of the racked monsters. Butz Aquino jumped on top of one of the vehicles and said, “If we must die, we are ready.” When the tanks started their en- gines, soldiers tried to herd people out of the street, but er would not move. Nuns kneeled in front of the vehicles, leading the singing of ‘Ave Maria” and “The Lord’s Prayer.” The tanks cut their engines. Ta- diar said later, “It’s becoming mob rule.

We don’t want to hurt anybody.” Monday, Feb. 24 By 7 a.m,, cheers could be heard every few minutes from in- side Ramos’ packed inner office. A prominent Aquino backer, As- semblyman Alberto Romulo, emerged at 7:21 a.m. to give out a story that Enrile now acknowledges was false. . “I have just come from Minister Enrile,”’ Romulo said. “He has talked to the Presidential Security Command.

Shultz said he Marcos could rn his le any longer and should be invited to come to the United States. © “I agree,” said Reagan. At 8:03 a.m. Enrile stood up in front of cheering crowd of officers at Camp Crame and announced the formation of “a new government.” At roughly the same moment, according to itnesses, about 30 rebels in civilian clothes sneaked over the fence of Channel 4, about four miles northwest of Camp did not believe Crame. Mariano Santiago, a rebel Rambo in a jogging suit, led re- formist officers on the most impor- tant mission of the day, even though he wasn’t even a member of the army. When Santiago arrived at Chan- nel 4 with three truckloads of re- bels, all in civilian clothes, he found that a pro-Marcos unit was already well-entrenched inside. “Why should we fight?” Santia- go remembers telling the head of security, who was a fellow “mistah” — the nickname for graduates of the Philippine Military Academy. “We are brothers,” said Santia- go, a retired military man. “If we shoot each other, this would be our last meeting. We don’t shoot. ‘mis- tahs,’ we shoot enemies.” Within a few minutes, according to eyewitnesses, several of the re- bels clambered up the side of the television tower until they held a. commanding perch about 150 feet above the street. Santiago intended to knock Channel 4 off the air as fast as pos- sible. As it turned out, Marcos was able to get on the air to announce that he had not “flown the coop,” that he was still in charge and was declaring a “state of emergency.” But ’ Malacanang Palace was obviously in a state of agita- tion.

Western diplomats here were skeptical, but interested. Pakistan, the host of two-thirds of the five mil- lion Afghan refugees, remained noncommittal. “The key to resolving the Afghan crisis is to get the Soviet troops out,” said one Western diplomat. “If the Soviets are prepared to put forward a timetable for their withdrawal, I am sure it would be considered a great step forward.” U.N. Undersecretary Diego Cor- dovez said Afghan authorities gave him a document containing a troop withdrawal timetable during his visit to Kabul within the past sever- al days. Cordovez said the document also contained conditions that other na- Austin American-Statesman - March 19, 1986 tions would have to accept as part of a final Afghanistan settlement. Briefing reporters at the end of a 10-day shuttle mission between Af- ghanistan and Pakistan, Cordovez called his latest round of talks in the four-year-old negotiations “very positive.” He made clear, however, that no settlement is imminent, adding that the time and format for the next round of talks remains to be settled. Cordovez declined to discuss the timetable or other details. Many Pakistanis have been con- vinced that the Soviet Union will never pull out its troops for fear that the government of Afghan leader Babrak Karmal would collapse. “There is every indication of a prolonged if not permanent stay” by the Soviets, said Noor Husain, head of the Pakistani Institute of Strategic Studies.

Antonov, 37, a meek-looking, be- spectacled man who Agca has said was to be his getaway driver, ex- claimed after the court finding, “I am a free citizen again.” But court officials said the ac- quitted defendants probably would not be allowed to leave the country pending a ruling on their liberty to travel by an appeals court, which could not meet until Tuesday. “I am not prepared to say that these are definitive sentences,” said Santiapichi. “I think there will be a second trial.” Under Italian law, an appeals Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 30, court would hold a full-fledged trial. Two other Turkish defendants, Oral Celik — the alleged “second gunman” in St. Peter’s Square, who never has been arrested, and Musa Serdar Celibi, the former leader of a right-wing organization of Turkish migrant workers in West Germany — also were ordered acquitted by. the jury because of insufficient proof. Agca, whose seemingly psychot- ic courtroom behavior has made a joke of what Italian newspapers an- ticipated as “the trial of the centu- ry,” continued his bizarre antics even as he was being led into the high-security courtroom to hear the verdict. “I'm not God, I'm the son of God in human form. I am Jesus Christ,” shouted Agca, 28. The trial began May 27, 1985. The court traveled to Bulgaria, Tur- key, France, West Germany and the Netherlands, hearing 80 witnesses during 97 sessions. The jury began deliberations a week ago. The court rulings shattered the so-called “Bulgarian connection” in the case — Agca's charge that Bul- garian and Soviet officials plotted the slaying of the Polish-born pon- tiff. because of his support for Po- land's Solidarity labor movement. The pope was seriously wounded in the attack, but he eventually re- covered. The Soviet Union said Saturday that the acquittals proved that Western attempts to “smear” Bul- garians and “besmirch” communist countries had failed. 1986 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bhutio’s exiled daug By Joseph Albright fe Cax News Service ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A fi- ery woman politician, Benazir Bhutto, is due to fly back from ex- ile in mid-April with aspirations of becoming Pakistan's Corazon Aquino. , Her return heralds a period of political turbulence in this pivotal parma nation, just emerging rom 8% years of martial law. Like the widowed President Aquino, Miss Bhutto, 33, starts with’ minimal political experience and boundless sympathy. Her father, former President ‘Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was Benes seven years ago this Friday after Pakistani courts found him guilty of plotting a political rival’s murder in a trial that many of Pakistan’s 95 million citizens considered unfair. It was Pres- ident Moham- mad Zia ul-Hagq, then doubling as martial law ad- .

President Aquino always had the Catholic clerics on her side, but the mullahs who make up Pakistan’s re- ligious establishment are resolutely against Miss Bhutto — as they often were against her father. “Tt goes against’ her that she is not married up to now,” said Mo- hammad Aslam Saleen, the No. 2 leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, the influ- ential Islamic fundamentalist party. Three months ago, Zia gave Miss Bhutto a political opening when he lifted martial law after turning over day-to-day governing to a civilian prime minister, Mo- hammed Khan Junejo, a conserva- tive landowner whom he had ap- ee Zia kept the ultimate power n his own hands by retaining the oe of president and army chief of staff. : With the next scheduled election not due until 1990, the respected we ag se pierigien stppreere nis ublishing popularity polls matching iP Zia and M ss Bhutto. The latest national survey, taken in February, shows Zia leading Miss Bhutto 51 percent’ to 24 percent. ’ Zia has promised that Miss Bhutto will be allowed to return from her exile in Europe to lead po- litical demonstrations as long as she follows “‘certain rules of the game.” Pro-government and opposition sources say the undefined “rules” mean she. will be permitted to lead demonstrations only if they don’t spill over into violence. . ' To Zia that. is a very big “if.” No one knows better than he that almost every top Pakistani leader since Pakistan was partitioned from India in 1947 has come to power through a military coup brought on by large-scale street protests that the previous government could not control, The opposition is determined to avoid giving Zia an easy excuse to reimpose martial law. ‘‘We have learned a lesson from Mrs. Aquino’s victory,” said Miraj Khalid, a mem- ber of the executive committee of Miss Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party. “Unless we can keep the struggle peaceful.and non-violent, we can't succeed.” Reflecting this cautious strate- gy, Miss Bhutto has chosen to re- ‘main out of the country during the @ memorial rallies organized by ‘Gar party to recall her father’s ng. w=: When she steps off the plane {Km Europe about a week later, @% is expected to begin an intense sampaign-style tour featuring mass rallies at cities throughout Pakistan. Almost everyone expects an enormous turnout in her first round of rallies, which will last until early May. There is much less certainty about whether she will be able to ignite the same enthusiasm when politicking resumes in August after the anticipated ae break for Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting that starts in May, and the summer monsoon rains in June and July. vethere will be some bubblin for two or three weeks, or at mos' two or three months,” said Mian Tufail Mohammad, a Moslem funda- mentalist leader. “Then everything will evaporate.” Others, including People’s Party stalwart Naved Ahmad, foresee in- creasingly hostile confrontations be- tween demonstrators and Zia’s secu- rity forces, ‘The armed forces will refuse to fire ape the people, you'll see,” Naved said. — Her ee as well as some Western diplomats familiar with Is- lamabad politics, think she won’t be able to sustain a mass following for very long. As many observers point out, Pakistan’s economy is not as depressed as was the Philippine economy ee President Aquino’s rise to power. Nor is Zia debilitated by the stench of personal corruption that hung around Marcos during his rs. Her chief demand, shared by 11 moderate and leftist opposition par- ties that are loosely allied in the so- called Movement for the Restora- tion of Democracy, is that Zia must call immediate national parliamen- tary elections. Zia and Prime Minister Junejo have rejected the call for “midterm elections,” saying there is no reason to scrap the incumbent Parliament, elected only 14 months ago for terms that run until 1990. Miss Bhutto and other opposition leaders called for a boycott of the 1985 election, complaining hier will campaign to be ‘Corazon Aquino’ of Pakistan that it was held under a martial law formula devised by Zia and banned political party participation. Despite the boycott, official figures show that 53 percent of the elector- ate voted. Beyond her call for elections, Miss Bhutto has kept her program hazy. Others in her party favor a heavier ree on government ownership of key industries and de- creased support for the Afghan re- bels. who are fighting Afghan and Soviet forces inside Afghanistan from bases inside Pakistan. _ A descendant of an aristocratic landowning family from Sind prev. ince, Miss Bhutto received a West- ern education at Radcliffe College in Massachusetts and Oxford Uni- versity in England. Her father’s arrest in 1978 pushed her into the role of a Peo- ple’s Party surrogate spokeswoman. At unauthorized protest rallies; she called for “hanging the generals” she said caused her father’s exeeu- tion. . Vie Zia responded by putting her un- der house tet feeen March 1981 until January 1984, when she was allowed to go to Europe for medical treatment. She again was put under house arrest briefly last year when she returned to Pakistan for her brother’s funeral. rity Atlanta Constitution April 3, 1986 \f"

But physically we are threatened because of famine and in- creasing Sovietization {control of key regions).” Western diplomats keeping a close watch on the war say they, too, have detected some drop in Mujahe- deen morale in the last year. “It’s a long war,” said one diplomat. “People do get tired.” The rebels say it is getting harder and harder to get weapons and supplies over the mountains to the fighters inside Afghanistan. | a In mid-March, one rebel supply depot near the bor- der received a truckload of warm clothes from Saudi Arabia that included 320 sleeping bags, 920 warm jack- ets and 150 blankets, . Unhappily, the rebels in Pakistan had no immediate way to move sleeping bags to a Mujahedeen unit that was holding out on a mountain just 15 miles across the border against a Soviet and Afghan army column, The irony was inescapable when Khalim Khan, the rebel commander, happened to make it over the moun tain to the depot in search of medicine on the day the Saudi truck arrived, “It is very cold at night, so cold that in the morning Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 6, 1986 (Continued) we can hardly move,” said Khan. “During the attacks, we don’t have caves for cover — only rocks and trees,” To depot commander Karim, the most immediate shortage is something much more prosaic than Stinger missiles, It is money to hire pack mules. “T have a depot full of ammunition, but not enough of it is moving inside,” said Karim. The rebels who transport supplies are often forced to take remote and roundabout routes these days, The Soviets have cut many of the best infiltration routes, Three years ago, a caravan of pack horses could travel from the Pakistan border to the strategic Panj- shir Valley north of Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, all year. Since early last year, however, the Soviets and their Afghan army allies have kept the old all-season route to the Panjshir blocked. Now the trip is possible only in the summer, when the snow melts in the high mountain passes. | They have done it not only by seizing key highway and river crossings but by exploiting rivalries between Mujahedeen factions along the infiltration routes, With dismay, Karim read aloud a letter smuggled out of Afghanistan three days earlier from Ahmad Shah Massoud, a key commander in the northern Panjshir re- gion. In it, Massoud asked Karim to send him anti-per- sonnel mines for use against the Soviets. “What can I do?” Karim said, explaining that he had the mines but that they surely would be seized by a rival faction if he sent them along the all-weather trail, He said he would have to wait three months until the snow melted on the high mountain route, \f"

Glass Cox Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — American warplanes bombed five military tar- gets in Libya’s two largest cities early Tuesday to retaliate against what President Reagan called a “reign of terror” unleashed by Liby- an leader Moammar Khadafy. One U.S. warplane, a two-man F-111, was unaccounted for after the mission, according to Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. The president told the American people of the strikes at 9 p.m. in a seven-minute televised address. He spoke from the Oval Office, in sol- emn tones, two hours after targets in the coastal cities of Tripoli and Benghazi had been hit at 2 a.m. Lib- yan time. “Today we have done what we had do to,” the president said. “If necessary, we shall do it again.

In the subsequent blackout, Libya can- celed a bus tour for foreign reporters, who were to be shown proof that the Americans had damaged a civilian apartment building near the French Embas- sy.

Libyan Radio broke into its regular broadcast of ne songs to announce that some members of adafy's family had been injured in the raid and that planes bombed a residential area near Khad- fay's home. Atlanta Constitution April 15, 1986 In a broadcast monitored in London, it reported: “Our Libyan Arab forces have downed three air- craft of the American enemy. Following that, Liby- an Arab citizens killed the pilots from the crew of the three American aircraft, in accordance with the principle of reciprocal treatment, because when the American Air Force carried out its aggression in March on the Gulf of Sirte [Sidra] American pilots killed the crew of a boat which was hit by American fighter aircraft. | “When the crew of this boat tried to save thems selves, the American fighter aircraft opened fire on them, prevented a Libyan tugboat from approaching, and killed the crew.” The twin air raids culminated months of internal debate both within the Reagan administration and among American: allies in Europe on how to cope with the mounting threat of indiscriminate terrorist attacks against both civilian and military sites, In his speech, Reagan said he possessed “solid evidence” that Khadafy was hatching further attacks against “United States installations and diplomats and even American tourists, Weinberger and Secre- tary of State George Shultz, who joined in the brief. ing, said U.S, military bases and embassies had been placed on a high state of alert, Reagan revealed that Khadafy had planned a “massacre” against a U.S, Embassy, The attack called for hurling grenades and firing small auto- matic weapons at people waiting in line for U.S. vie sas, but the attack was prevented, Reagan said, “with the help of French authorities,” Nevertheless, France barred the US. warplanes from flying over French soll on a direct route to Libya, which would have cut 2400 miles from theit’ | round-trip mission, : The president said he held “no illusions” that the alr raid “will bring down the curtain on Khadafy's reign of terror.” But, he added, ‘This mission, > lent though it was, can bring closer a safer and more secure world for decent men and women,” Reagan promised that when American citizens are “abused or attacked anywhere in the world on the direct orders of a hostile regime, we will re- spond 90 long as I'm in this Oval Office,” \f"

The Al Kabir Hotel, a luxury high-rise half a mile from the bombed Khadafy household, probably housed the largest group of Americans in Tripoli. Roughly 26 American journal- ists and network technicians were politely barred inside the hotel lobby by plainsclothesmen, while information ministry offi- cials shut off most of the inter- national telephone service. Half a dozen information min- istry hangers-on bustled around the lobby assuring journalists that nothing was wrong. “You can go back to bed. This is just a test of ours,” said one official. “There is nothing wrong.” A few minutes later, Libyan radio confirmed that Khadafy's tions, or simple trigger happi- * ness had not been discovered. Two of the rocket bursts were close enough to the Al Kabir Ho- tel to make some reporters sus- pect they were being targeted. But the explosions tapered off in the direction of Khadafy’s barracks. ! Before the raid on Monday, life appeared normal in Tripoli despite the looming presence of the U.S.‘Sixth Fleet nearby. The only major change I no- ticed from my last visit two years ago was at Khadafy’s bar- racks.

        "ocr_text": "F-111 takeoffs spark Tripoli fire Pentagon denies jets headed for Libya, calls flights training mission By Joseph Albright Cox News Service TRIPOLI, Libya — Libyan de- fenders, fearing a renewed U.S. air attack, opened fire Tuesday night with hundreds of rounds of anti-air- craft fire over a city draped in total blackout. The drumroll of defensive fire over Tripoli came a few hours after a flight of 14 American F-111 jets were reported to have taken off for an unspecified mission from their base in Britain. The Pentagon called it a training mission and in- sisted its planes were not approach- ing Libya. However, Khadafy had every reason to wonder about whether President Reagan might order a repeat of the air strike of the night before. Libya chose to strike back mili- tarily within 18 hours of the Ameri- can bombing raid — essentially challenging President Reagan to make good on his threat Monday to attack Libya again if necessary. The Libyan countermove took the form of an attack on the small Italian island of Lampedusa, which hosts a sensitive American commu- nications station 400 miles north of Tripoli. Libyan radio described an aerial attack that caused major damage, but Italian sources mini- mized the incident, calling it a raid Staff Map by Mary Coppinger by a patrol boat that fired a few missiles, causing minimal damage. The Pentagon also dismissed the at- tack as harmless. Meanwhile, foreign camera crews escorted to the intensive care unit of Children’s Hospital photo- graphed Libyan leader’s Moammar Khadafy’s youngest sons, Set al Arab, 4, and Camis, 3, who had been injured in the U.S. raid. Khadafy’s 15-month-old adopted daughter was killed in the raid. Later, according to a network source, Libyan censors informed at least one American network it would not be allowed to “feed” any Tripoli film by satellite Tuesday ex- cept the footage shot in the hospital. An incomplete casualty count by Libyan authorities showed 15 killed and at least 60 injured in Tripoli during the bombing raid. No figures had been tallied on casualties in other cities. A doctor for Khadafy’s children, Mohammed Muafa, confirmed that Khadafy was not with his family in their living quarters inside Tripoli’s Bab Al Azziziyah army barracks when the barracks was bombed by American jets at 2 a.m. Libyan time Tuesday. : “T went to the (living quarters) about 3:10 a.m. and found the fam- ily really in terror, the children and the women,” Muafa said. The Libyan leader made no per- sonal appearances or radio broad- casts in the 18 hours following the American raid. Libyan information officials in- sisted, however, that Khadafy was unharmed by the American bombs. They said his only official meeting was a session with the Soviet am- assador to Libva Austin American-Statesman - April 16, 1986 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Try Reagan for war crimes, Khadafy urges By Joseph Albright Cox News Service TRIPOLI, Libya — Col. Moam- mar Khadafy emerged from seclu- sion Wednesday, for the first time since a U.S. air attack on his coun- try, and declared in a broadcast from an unknown location that President Reagan should be put on trial as a child murderer and war criminal. The Libyan leader told Ameri- cans, “We will not kill your chil- dren. We are not like you, we do not bombard cities.” It was an indirect reference to his 15-month-old adopted daughter, who was reported killed in Mon- day’s bombing. “ “If there are any living forces in America, then Reagan’s govern- ment should collapse and he should be put on trial as a war criminal and murderer of children,” Khadafy said. “We have Allah on our side, and Allah is stronger than the U.S.” In Washington, U.S. government sources said unconfirmed intelli- gence information suggested that Khadafy fled Tripoli, possibly wounded, and had gone into the de- sert. It could not inneiately be de- termined whether his TV appear- ance was live or taped, but his dis- cussion of the raid squashed rumors that he had been killed in it. Meanwhile, there were these re- lated developments Wednesday: m@ Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher fended off an opposition bid to' censure her backing of the US. ‘bombing. She had allowed the United States to use 18 of its Brit- ish-based F-111 bombers in the at- tack. Her party won a 325-206 vote to end the six-hour emergency de- bate. During the debate, Prime Minis- ter Thatcher recited a litany of ter- rorist attacks sponsored by Khadafy and declared, “The time had come for action. The United States took it. Their decision was justified. As friends and allies, we support them.” Atlanta Constitution April 17, 1986 isi leader Mikhail Gorba- chev Khadafy a letter pledging “feelings of solidarity in face of dmerigan: imperialism's bandit Seewwth also declare that such a de- velopment of events cannot but have 8.76 gative impact on Soviet- relations as well,” the let- ter states. In West Germany, base for 250,000 American troops and site of many terrorist attacks, U.S. Army personnel .were ordered to stay off the streets overnight. @In Beirut, Lebanon, the Abu Nidal organization, the most feared Palestinian terror group, issued a statement warning that US. institu- tions “will be the target of our re- taliatory blows.” Immediately after Khadafy’s speech, the blackened city of Tripoli. could be seen lighting up.as though a fog had lifted. “Put back the lights in the street,” Khadafy had urged. “We are ready to dance in the street. We are ready to fight and to die.” Within a few minutes, disci- ned crowds of demonstrators re- turned to downtown streets, shout- ing. anti-American slogans and honking horns. It was a sign of stability for the . oe regime. After nearly two days of used silence, Libyan au-. thorities returned to their. old ways of mobilized mass support. . Early Wednesday afternoon, two minutes of panicky. machine-gun and rifle fire broke out near Khadafy’s barracks in.southwestern Tripoli. “We were shooting because we saw American. airplanes in front of the coast of Libya, and we tried to shoot them down from here,” said one Khadafy security aide half an hour later. A Washington source acknow}l- ‘edged that American reconnaissance planes had flown over this north Af- rican nation. ‘ The , shooting, which nearly caught a busload of reporters in a machine-gun cross fire, led to re- rts on several international radio roadcasts of factional fighting.

        "ocr_text": "lying | ® qT; oe ol e By Joseph Albright Cox News Service TRIPOLI, Libya ~ Foreign dip. lomats urged Westerners to stay off the city’s streets Thursday in the af- termath of U.S. air strikes that have prompted anti-American demonstra- tions, But for the most part Thursday, Tripoli remained peaceful. Libyan leader Moammar Khada- fy, who emerged from two days’ se- clusion Wednesday to charge that President Reagan should be put on trial for the American raid Monday, was shown on Libyan television again Thursday night as he visited a Tripoli hospital, touring the wards an men deste with bandaged victims of the attack. “Thank God, you're all right,” one woman told Khadafy. Efforts by foreigners to flee the country were frustrated because Libya's land borders were closed and the airport was largely inac- tive. An Italian diplomat, speaking on * tri condition of anonymity, said no evacuation was ordered, “but it’s obvious some women who have been subjected to strain and tension want to leave.” Among them was the wife of an Italian consular official who suffered facial cuts during the air strike. About 8,000 Italian citizens are in Libya, the largest foreign group among about 18,000 Westerners who work in Libya’s oil and construction industries, Embassies of several other countries, including Belgium, Spain and. Canada, reported that no full- scale evacuation was in the works, but they said contingency plans had been prepared in case the situation herg deteriorates. -aWe advise people just to stay put and wait, not to go outside,” said, an official at the Belgian Em- bassy. :An estimated 800 Americans stil] are living in Libya despite President Reagan's previous order that they leave by Feb. 1. a in New York tried frantically Thursday to find out about his daughter's welfare. «No, no,” a Canadian executive mabseyne into the telephone to the father of a woman who teaches in Libya, “everything is really all right for foreigners in Libya.” Lanuf, a seaside chemical rocessing center 400 miles east of ripoli, is where the American es English to children of expa- ell, we haven't had: any tele- phone. contact with Ras Lanuf,” said the Chadian who wished to remain Atlanta Constitution April 18, 1986 anonymous. “But there is no sign of any expatriates’ being threatened.” The Canadian, who has earned a good salary here for four years, put down the phone. “My biggest con- cern,” he told a visiting reporter, “js that my relatives back home are worried.” The Libyan military has sent ex- tra guards to patrol outside the oil company compound in Tripoli’s sub- urbs, where the Canadian lives, . y are just doing it to pres- sure us,” said the Canadian, who says he has no plans to leave. On the day after Khadafy’s tele- vised reappearance, Tripoli demobi- lized from what had been a war- time footing. Compared with the carnage of Beirut, Lebanon, and the mob scenes at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, Tripoli was’ as sleepy as a seaside resort in the off season. Newsstands, airline offices, cof-s fee bars and a few clothing stores reopened, Most other shops in the old downtown section remained closed behind green shutters. The shops remain despite Khadafy’s suc- cessive crackdowns on privately owned businesses, At 12:50 p.m., people waiting to buy tickets at the Italian airline, Alitalia, got a curious reminder that the war scare wasn’t over quite yet. An Alitalia official hurriedly closed the company’s downtown of- fice, which had had its front plate- glass windows knocked out by the American bombing. The official explained to cus- tomers that the airline office had received a telephone warning about another possible outbreak of trouble at 2 p.m. Thursday. And sure enough, just after 2 p.m., a double boom sounded in the sky over Tripoli. It sounded very much like the noise of a high-flying reconnaissance plane breaking the sound barrier. This time the Libyan anti-air- craft batteries around the city did not open fire. It was the first time in three days that a hint of an ap- proaching American plane had not touched off a deafening rattle of anti-aircraft rockets around the city. ’ At the airport, meanwhile, re- porters saw about 400 people, many of them women and children, on the sidewalk outside the terminal in lines waiting for a chance to board one of the four commercial jets that were said to be scheduled to depart on the first day the airport was to reopen for international traffic. Most were Libyans, but there were five French families, a scattering of Yugoslavs and other Eastern Euro- ns. One airline official said he was allowed by Libyan authorities to survey the civilian runways before giving his approval for the resump- tion of flights. He said he saw no damage on the civilian side but wasn't sure about what had taken place on the military portion of the airport, which the Pentagon said was one of the targets. Airline offices were not selling tickets to foreigners living in Libya unless they could show a Libyan exit visa stamp in their passports. And without a ticket, people weren't allowed into the airport terminal. In more normal times, a Libyan exit visa can take days to arrange. Since the American bombs dropped, however, most Libyan government offices have been closed, making the paperwork virtually imposible. An ambassador from an Asian country said, “A few of our people plan to leave if they can get on flights. But we do not think it is time to evacuate yet. We think the mig thing to do now is to stay ere,” \f"

But Libyan authorities said the airport raid achieved nothing be- sides killing Milhud Hassan’s 300 prize hens. Libyan officials took two bus- loads of journalists Saturday to within severai miles of the military airport that the Pentagon has iden- tified as one of the major targets of Monday’s raid. But the press was allowed no closer than Hassan’s former chicken house, now a spray of corrugated metal fragments covering half an acre of sandy orchard. Hassan, mobbed by television crews from around the world, grabbed one of his surviving chick- ens and led half a dozen relatives and neighbors in a chant: “Reagan is a chicken killer. ... Reagan is a terrorist. Down, down, U.S.A.” Here and at another farm out- side the airport, reporters were shown about a dozen craters appar- ently made by American air-to- ground rockets. The holes, averag- ing 6 feet in diameter, appeared to be roughly two miles outside the airport fence. A Libyan military expert, Major Ahmed Abdullah, told journalists that between 10 and 12 American bombs landed inside the airport proper. He maintained that damage to military equipment was minimal. Abdullah declined to comment on reports from European diplomats that between 10 and 15 helicopters had been disabled on the ground during the raid. The same European sources said at least 10 of Libya’s Ilyushin transports also had been badly damageed. Since the raid, the Libyan re- gime has maintained that its mili- tary losses were insignificant, while stressing casualties in civilian ar- eas. Three more.

        "ocr_text": "Missed target raises danger to ULS., allies By Joseph Albright Cox News Service RIPOLI, LIBYA — Bernard Montgomery, the British gen- eral whose armies van- quished Nazi panzer divisions on these North African sands during World War II, had some advice that applies to President Reagan's at- tempt to combat terrorism with la- ser-guided, 2,000-pound bombs. “If you are going to go for the par- rot,” Montgomery would say, “you had better knock him off his perch.” What stood out most clearly in all of last week’s dramatic events is that the President sought to knock Libya’s leader, Col. Moammar Kha- dafy, off his perch — and failed. Foreign correspondents who were permitted to enter the Bab Azizia army barracks in Tripoli a few days after the raid came away convinced that one aim of the at- tack was to obliterate the place where Khadafy would most likely be sleeping. Two of the 2,000-pounders landed 140 feet from the flaps of the sand- bagged tent where Khadafy has maintained his Bedouin-style sleep- ing quarters. Three more bombs landed about 75 feet from the tiled house where Khadafy kept an apartment and where his wife and children slept. One can make the cold-blooded calculation that the world might have been a safer place if Khadafy had been killed. But from the moment he made his first somber television appear- ance, 45 hours after the raid, it was clear that the United States and Great Britain, which had allowed the F-111s to use English bases for the long-distance attack, would pay a high price for missing the target. In the aftermath of the bombing, terrorist incidents rippled through Europe, Africa and the Middle East, Officials in Washington and London were girding for more of the same. In short order, in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, a U.S, commu- nications technician was shot in the head and critically wounded. A U.S. Marine guardhouse was fire- bombed in Tunisia. Two British hos- tages and one American were slain in Lebanon. A British journalist was kidnapped en route to Beirut air- port and safety, A disaster aboard an Israeli El Al jumbo jet was nar- rowly averted when security guards found plastic explosives designed to tear the huge Boeing 747 apart in midair. These were the kind of attacks that could be planned on a day's no- tice by terrorists plotting in a coffee bar. The worst, observers fear, will come after the Moslem month of Ramadan, a period of fasting, which ends June 8, No one has had time yet, here or elsewhere, to organize a world- class terrorist spectacular, It takes awhile to arrange the needed pho- ny passports, the double-bottom suitcases and the miniature elec- tronic detonators, as well as all the other paraphernalia of high-tech terrorism. When and if Khadafy gives the order to strike back, he will certain- ly want to have at his command more secure channels of communi- cation with his worldwide network of agents — now that America’s ability to eavesdrop on his mes- sages to the Libyan “People’s Bu- reau” in East Berlin has been exposed. It would be astonishing, however, if the summer passed without at least one more U.S. airliner being diverted to Beirut by hijackers or Without a tourist hotel in Cairo be- ing savaged, or even without the off- spring of an American official being murdered in his or her sleep. But, the next time, it is not likely to be so evident who did it. That, of course, leaves the ques- tion of what the President would do. He has pledged to strike swiftly again if Khadafy responds by esca- lating the violence. But the bitter reaction in Europe against the raid may be giving policy-makers in Washington second thoughts. Some observers in Washington thought much the same could have been accomplished by mining Lib- ya's ports — without loss of life. It is always possible that the Reagan ad- ministration is holding the mining scenario in reserve for round, Thus far, Khadafy has chosen to speak softly, In his initial reaction, for a man whose adopted infant daughter has just been killed by an American bomb, he has sounded more dignified and less than venomous, But at the funeral for bombing victims, one of his oldest revolution- ary colleagues, Maj. Kweildi He- meidi, gave a clear taste in his funeral oration of what the West — especially Americans and Britons — had better expect by this summer. Clutching his red beret in his hand, Hemeidi called on all Mos- lems to join in a jihad (holy war) against “the Western imperialists who killed Libyan children.” Islamic leaders have been calling for such holy wars for quite a while, This time around, however, no one should not underestimate the emo- tional force throughout the Moslem world that has been unleashed by the American bombs that missed.

        "ocr_text": "Analysis Fiat retreat hints Khadafy trouble JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Wows Service TRIPOLI, Libya — This week Fiat — 12 percent owned by the Libyan government — decided it was time to cut its risks. Over the weekend the Fiat truck assembly plant sent home 35 Italian family members and staffers, leaving be- hind only a skeleton crew. One knowledgeable Fiat staffer explained that he and others at Fi- at sensed indications last week of an unresolved power struggle among Khadafy's followers. “Something isn't right, and we don't know exactly what it is,” he said. The partial evacuation by Fiat was one piece in the Libyan puz- zie. While no one knows the full pic- ture, there is reason to believe that Khadafy's leadership is under in- ternal challenge as a result of the American bombing raid a week ago. What is going on seems to be more of a rolling realignment of power than a coup. Whether the outcome could change Libya's pro- pensity to sponsor international terrorism is anyone's guess. One European diplomat says the chances are 50-50 that Khadafy will be out in three months. Another diplomat says Khadafy will probably remain in power. He recalled that Khadafy has already survived at least 10 serious coup attempts in 16 years, most recent- Khadafy keeps low profile ly an abortive uprising which he blamed on the Moslem Brother- hood in May 1984. These are among the indications that may suggest that Khadafy’s grip may have been weakened by the American raid last week: Khadafy has been surprising- ly passive. He waited 45 hours af- ter the raid to make an appear- ance. And when he finally surfaced in a late-night TV address Wednesday, he spoke only briefly, with little rhetorical flourish. Af- ter his one appearance, he passed up a chance to address a funeral for victims of the American raid and has refrained from holding press conferences. VY Only hours before Khadafy spoke, the Libyan news agency distributed a much more forceful policy statement, which made no reference to Khadafy or his role as leader. The statement was preced- ed by the novel headline ‘State- ment by Revolutionary Leader- ship,” a phrase which led some analysts to suspect erroneously that Khadafy was dead. V The same statement referred to the country by its pre-revolu- tionary name “Libya,” rather than calling it “Jamahiriyah,” the name Khadafy gave it in 1977. (Official statements once called it ‘“Jamahi- riyah,”” a made-up word that means “State of the Masses,” fol- lowing Khadafy's reappearance.) V Mass demonstrations, which Khadafy's Revolutionary Commit- tees usually mount at the slightest provocation, have been virtually absent in the face of the most pro- vocative attack Khadafy has ever suffered. This could indicate that some other force, possibly the Ar- my, is reining in the Revolutionary Committees. V Reporters heard episodes of unexplained automatic rifle fire in Tripoli early Tuesday morning and Wednesday night. Diplomats re- ported another brief outbreak on Friday night. The most likely ex- planation, according to diplomats and businessmen, is small-scale fighting between Army units and Revolutionary Guards. “On Sunday, new security barriers were seen outside Bab al Azizia military barracks, where Miami News Khadafy normally lived until the barracks was struck by American F-111 bombers. V Near the same barracks last Wednesday, reporters heard an outbreak of firing and saw mili- tary guards rush out into the street to assume firing positions. As it turned out, Libyan anti-aircraft guns were firing upward at what they thought were American planes. But at the time, the guards clearly thought they were facing a ground attack from the street out- side the barracks. A week in Tripoli can yield a pocketful of explanations for all this, although none is conclusive. One theory is the regular Army is struggling to claim power from the Khadafy-backed Revolution- ary Guards. Another says two fac- tions have emerged among Khada- fy’s confederates: first, a pro-Soviet faction which sees Lib- ya's salvation in a closer relation- ship with the Soviet Union, and second, a pro-Algerian faction which would prefer closer ties with Algeria — one of Khadafy's longtime rivals. Some Western European diplo- mats propound another intriguing theory: that agents of the Ameri- can CIA are stirring up trouble for Khadafy by spreading rumors and encouraging plots within the mili- tary. “They (the CIA) are playing on their nerves,” said one diplomat, who acknowledges that he has no proof. “That's the real war.” - April 22, 1986 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Tests show Italians affected by Soviet fallout By Joseph Albright .Journal-Constitution Correspondent CASACCIA, Italy — Tests at a ‘gpovernment research center are showing that at least here in Italy, there is a little bit of Chernobyl in ‘all of us. ‘ Italian officials said Friday that minute traces of radioactive iodine have been detected in all 20 resi- nts of Italy who have been tested ere since the Soviet nuclear acci- ‘dent three weeks ago. Radioactive cesium has also shown up in some tests. Slightly higher levels of radioac- tivity have been found in 39 other Italians who happened to be in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe immediately after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power sta- tion. Italian health physicists said that all the readings are far below the range of what has been proved hazardous. But they stopped short of saying that there will be absolutely no long-term effects. “There is a risk of getting a tumor from any amount of radiation, and in this case, we increase this risk by just a little bit,” said Giovanni Ingrao, a physicist at the government’s Ener- gy Research Center 20 miles north . Of Rome. Before Chernobyl, this research center had detected no cesium and iodine isotopes in humans since shortly after the United States and Soviet Union ended atmospheric nu- clear tests in the mid-1960s. The Casaccia center has one of the relatively few “whole body counters” in Europe capable of measuring low-level internal radio- activity. Readings made available here are providing some of the first scientific clues on how much radio- activity humans have absorbed hun- dreds of miles from the Chernobyl accident. One unexpected finding is that 18 Italians attached to the Italian Embassy in Warsaw, Poland, had virtually the same internal iodine “burden” as several Italian tourists who happened to be in Kiev imme- diately after the reactor fire. War- saw is 400 miles from the reactor site, whereas Kiev is only 80 miles from Chernobyl. A whole body counter is an ul- trasensitive radiation meter mount- ed inside a chamber lined with lead, concrete and iron. The apparatus enables technicians to measure the amount of radioactivity being emit- ted inside the body and to identify what nuclear isotope produced it. Visiting the laboratory Friday, I watched on a television monitor as an Italian man sat in the chamber with a radiation counter the size of nothing to worry about. One nanocurie is a measure of atomic disintegrations. It means that I have something inside me that is popping off tiny particles at the rate of 37 disintegrations per second. One nanocurie of iodine should produce a radioactive dose of only about one millirem to the thyroid, I was told. By contrast, a flight across the Atlantic exposes a travel- er to cosmic rays that can produce a dose of several millirems scat- tered over the body. The International Commission on Radiological Protection has set 5,400 nanocuries of iodine-131 as a limit for radiation exposures to the general population. Despite the much higher official a small wastebasket pointed at his Re chest. “He has about the same as ev- F if eryone else, about 2 or 3 nanocuries of iodine,” said Ingrao. “This is due, to the iodine released from Cherno- byl. Before the Chernobyl accident, there was no iodine-131 in the at- mosphere.” If he had taken potassium iodide tablets three weeks ago, the man could have saturated his thyroid and prevented absorption of radioactive iodine. “Unfortunately, if he takes the pills now, it will just prevent his body from excreting the iodine 131 that is already there,” said Ingrao. I asked if I could be tested. The answer was yes. So I changed into blue paper laboratory garments and spent the next 40 minutes in the windowless radiation counter. Technicians watching monitors one floor above me found that I had 1.6 nanocuries of iodine-131. By international standards, a nanocurie or two of iodine should be standards, I found it a touch dis- maying to hear a physicist at the lab say that someone with 1.6 nano- curies of iodine-131 had about 50 million of the iodine atoms running around the thyroid gland waiting to disintegrate. Eighteen Italians who flew back from Warsaw for tests were found to have an average of about 40 nan- ocuries of iodine-131 and 75 nano- curies of cesium-137 inside their bodies. Roughly the same levels were measured in 12 Italian tourists and contract workers who have vis- ‘ited Casaccia after leaving the Sovi- et Union. By contrast, the Italians who have remained in Italy have meas- ured from 1 to 3 nanocuries of io- dine and up to 3 nanocuries of cesi- um.

He steps out of his gray Peugeot and makes his way upstairs to the Salon Francais, a meeting room 50 yards down a hall from his Afghan counterpart. It was Monday, the start of a make-or-break week lor the “indirect” Afghanistan peace talks that have sen dragging so long and so fruitlessly that much of he world has forgotten them. . Pakistan, the reluctant host to about 3 million Af- fhan refugees, is using the talks to pressure the pro-So- Myet Kabul government for a timetable for the with- rawal of Soviet troops. The Afghan government is pressing for a counter- ledge that Pakistan will stop using its territory as a MIA supply route to the Afghan rebels. Pe» As in all their previous sessions, beginning in June 82, the Afghans and Pakistanis aren't speaking to ‘pach other face to face. ; *» Instead, a team of four U.N. mediators led by U.N. Undersecretary Diego Cordovez of Ecuador is shuttling between their two meeting rooms trying to devise an Afghan peace treaty both sides can accept. Each draft is written by the U.N. diplomats and worked over word by word by the Afghans and Pakistanis. Now a self-imposed deadline looms: The foreign ministers are due to leave Geneva this week, and there ‘still is no whiff of an impending breakthrough. The Af- ghans, Pakistanis and U.N. mediators agreed two months ago that this seventh round of Geneva talks, «which began May 5, would be their last. Atlanta Constitution - May 22, 1986 (oe ee J - Pakistan, the reluctant host to about 3 million Afghan refugees, is using the talks to pressure the pro-Soviet Kabul government for a timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Une participant said Wednesday that the Afghani- stan talks may be suspended Friday with no resumption date. But the deadline could be delayed. The most favorable sign is that this year the Af- ghan government has for the first time shown a willing- ness to negotiate on the pace and conditions for a with- drawal of the 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan. The bad news is that they and the Pakistanis re- portedly are nowhere near agreement about what would constitute an acceptable timetable for the pullout of So- viet troops. “It’s like going for a Middle East peace settlement; you keep talking and talking and it never comes,” one diplomat said early in the week. Diplomats from the United States and the Soviet Union are watching from their Geneva missions, but neither is represented directly in the talks. Last year, the two superpowers extended commit- ments to the United Nations that if the Afghans and Pakistanis could work out an Afghan peace treaty, they would help guarantee its implementation. That essentially meant the Soviets would abide by a or withdrawal timetable and that the United States would end its covert aid to the Afghan rebels. The Afghan rebel groups, who have no voice in the talks, consistently have said they will refuse to abide by any peace formula the Pakistanis and Afghans might devise. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Afghan-Pakistani peace talks stall over monitoring of Soviet pullout By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent GENEVA, Switzerland — The 4- rol Afghan peace talks stalled tiday over whether international observers should monitor the future withdrawal of the 115,000-man Sovi- et occupying force. Int that ended Friday, the pro-Soviet ao government reportedly told U.N. mediators that the Soviet Un- ion won't permit any outside group to check on the departure of its troops from Afghanistan. Neighboring Pakistan told the same mediators that an Afghan peace deal wouldn't hold together unless U.N. representatives or other neutral observers are on the spot to deal with any alleged violations. Pakistan's proposal would mean that observers — stationed in north- ern ee to verify the with- drawal of Soviet troops and other observers along the Afghan-Paki- stani border — would ensure that CIA-supplied arms shipments are not moving through Pakistan to reach Afghan rebels inside Afghani- stan. Other observers would monitor the treatment of returning Afghan refugees. “IT have to express my disap- pointment at the slow pace at which we have been moving,” said U.N. Undersecretary Diego Cordovez, an Ecuadorean diplomat who has been weeks of secret sessions - trying for four years to broker a deal between Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan. After three weeks of shuttling between two U.N. conference rooms to confer with the Afghan and Paki- stani foreign ministers, Cordovez announced that this seventh round of talks would recess until July 30. Aside frome the international observers issue, the Pakistani and Afghan delegations remained far apart on what would constitute an acceptable timetable of Soviet troop withdrawals. ° “There is still a wide gap,” Cor- dovez said at a press conference. He sounded less optimistic this time than after past rounds of talks. An- other participant called the differ- ence on the timetable “a chasm.” Informed sources disclosed that the Pakistanis are calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops within three to six months of the signing of an agreement. The Afghans are said to be in- sisting on a Soviet troop withdrawal that would last considerably more than two years. Sources said there was no real bargaining on the timetable issue because the two sides spent most of the last three weeks hung up on the verification question. “Both sides kept throwing out dates to scare each other,” one par- ticipant said. . All the negotiating took place through U.N. intermediaries because Pakistan continues to refuse to en- gage in direct talks with the Soviet- installed Afghan regime. Afghanistan insisted until two months ago that it would not dis- cuss the paragraphs dealing with Soviet troop withdrawal except in a face-to-face negotiation with the Pa- kistanis. The Afghan negotiators now have dropped that reservation, agreeing to continue talks in an “‘in-: direct” format when the two sides return to Geneva in July Diplomats from the ° United States and Soviet Union have kept in close touch with developments but haven't entered the bargaining sessions. Both superpowers agreed in 1985 that they will support any peace deal worked out in the U.N.- sponsored negotiations between Pa- kistan and Afghanistan. For the United States, that means a commitment to cut off CIA-supplied arms when the Soviet troop pullout begins. Although no breakthroughs oc- curred on big issues, this three-week session in Geneva produced some lesser compromises. These included an agreement that any final settle- ment will take the form of signed international agreements rather than unilateral declarations that would be less binding.

To some skeptical diplo- mats, this demand sounds like a ready-made pretext for calling off troop withdrawals whenever neces- sary, on trumped-up charges that the Pakistanis have violated the agreement. this will sound like an outrageous price. If Reagan and Zia accept terms along these lines, they will be berated around the world for selling out the freedom fighters. Perhaps, though, if the Soviet troops started leaving, the pro-Sovi- et regime in Kabul would simply collapse. And what then? Would a more independent, neutral govern- ment of national unity emerge? There was a time back in early 1983 when these talks appeared to be moving toward a ble negoti- ated settlement in which the United States and Pakistan might swallow a kind of tame Finland-like regime in Afghanistan in exchange for a So- viet troop pullout. But the: talks bogged down in April 1983 because the Soviets re- fused to put forward any troop withdrawal timetable. In four subsequent rouads of meetings over the next three years, the Afghan foreign minister ducked all talk of a timetable. He did it by insisting that he wouldn't discuss the issue unless the Pakistanis agreed to meet him face to face ~ knowing well that they wouldn't. As late as last Dec. 19, Cordo- vez referred to this procedural issue as a “wall of mistrust” between the rties that had to be overcome be- ore discussions could proceed on Soviet troop withdrawal.

Arrested four months ago when police in helicopters swooped down on his Sicilian mountain hideout, Greco is charged with complicity in 97 murders and of in- a in wholescale heroin smuggling to the United tes. He told a trial court that his chief accusers, Mafia turncoats Tomasso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno, never would have leveled their “calumny, unsupported infamy and bile” against him if they hadn't seen “The Godfather.” Looking like a banker in a midnight blue, pin- striped suit, the 62-year-old, white-haired Greco sat im- en as a judge read a partial list of the victims is accused of killing during a Mafia clan war of the 1980s. en, in what seemed to be a caricature of the Marlon Brando “godfather,” he described himself as a respectable Sicilian farmer and family man who never did anything wrong. earl “Violence is not part of my dignity,” he said. The only thing he spoke about shooting was clay pi- geons. Greco appeargd in court on the 59th day of Italy's “maxi-trial,” the largest judicial assault in history on the Sicilian Mafia. Police in armored cars continued to guard all entrances to the trial, which is being held in- side a specially built “bunker” courtroom inside Ucciar- done Jal. ’ oat With 475 defendants and thousands of pages of banking and other documentary evidence, the trial is expected to last a year. No matter what the final verdicts, the fact that the Italian government could arrest and try the purported “boss of bosses” in Palermo, the mecca of Mafia influ- ence, has gone a long way to destroy the tradition of Mafia invulnerability. , . 7 Eight reputed leaders of the main Sicilian Mafia families are in the dock. Four others are named in the indictment but still at large. During three hours of testimony, Greco said the ac- cusation that he is a Mafia boss — first lodged by pros- ecutors in 1982 — has been a “disaster for my family.” He rejected as “fantasy” the prosecution claim that he has headed the reputed 12-member Sicilian Mafia “commission” since 1978.

        "ocr_text": "Crackdowns and trial are giving Mafia a ugh ime in Sicly By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent PALERMO, Italy — The Sicilian Mafia has fallen on hard times. Here in the capital of the Mafia heartland, eight of the top 12 Mafia family bosses have been on trial for four months. With them in the dock are about 365 of their underbosses, lieutenants and other “men of hon- or.” The defendants are stuck in the high-security “bunker courtroom” behind the old stone walls of Uc- ciardone Prison. Outside the gates, two armored police cars protect the main entrances, and scores of police officers stand guard while wielding Beretta machine pistols. Every passing day is a sign to the people of Palermo that the Ma- fia not been able to arrange a jailbreak or even bail. Of the 102 other alleged Mafia defendants who haven’t been caught, a few more fall into police hands every.month. chael “Papa” Greco, the man who is supposed to inspire more fear than anyone in Sicily, is among the more recent police acquisitions. Seized in a raid on a remote mountain cabin in February, Greco complained in court last week that he couldn’t even persuade his jailers to let his family send him food. Greco, the accused “boss of bosses” of the Sicilian Mafia clans, said from the witness stand that he had no choice but to adapt to jail food. The judge, apparently ‘paying no attention,’ pressed on to another question. “Violence is not part of my dig- nity,” Greco said in his own de- fense. Minor outrages the Mafia can bear. The real threat is that the Italian and U.S. governments are protecting the lives of Mafia defec- tors who have been singing their dramatic stories to the courts like opera stars. It is as though omerta — the code of silence — had gone out of style. Stool pigeons telling all Things have changed in the gen- eration since the the man who be- trayed the famous Sicilian bandit Salvitore Giuliano was killed inside Ucciardone Prison with a poisoned cup of coffee. This year the defendants, sitting in 30 barred cells at the rear of a courtroom, were reduced to watch- ing impotently through a bulletproof glass barrier as Tomasso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno took the stand to describe more than 90 Ma- fia killings in Italy over the last six years. Vincenzo Sinagra, a lesser turn- coat, last week became omerta breaker No. 3. Sinagra told, among other things, about a Mafia “chamber of Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 15, REPUTED BOSS: Michael ‘Papa’ Greco complained about having to adapt to jail food. death” in Sant’Erasmo, a village near Palermo. He’ named four er- rant Mafiosi he said were strangled to death in the chamber for such misdemeanors as trying to shake down merchants in a rival Mafia family’s “zone of competence.” It’s not only in the courtroom that the Mafia is being squeezed. Local newspapers say the Mafia is experiencing a “financial crisis.” Though that is certainly an exagger- ahs] oe \fCrackdowns and trial ation, it contains a bit of truth. The construction business in Pa- lermo, which once was a major out- let for laundered Mafia money, is at a virtual standstill. The drug business is down but not dead. Investigators say at least a few Mafia figures still are running clan- destine heroin processing laborato- ries. Two couriers with packets of pure heroin were seized last month, one in Palermo and the other in New York. But heroin processing is riskier than usual while there are 2,000 ex- tra police officers in and around Palermo for the “maxi-trial.” And in Pakistan there are competitors processing heroin without bothering to route morphine, the opium poppy extract, through Sicily. Collection racket faltering That means the Mafia must rely more on its old standby, extorting pizzu — protection money — from Sicilian businessmen. There are signs that collecting pizzu is getting harder, though the practice remains widespread. In May, a hit man put six .38- caliber slugs into Francesco Semi- lia, 47, a Palermo construction con- tractor with a reputation for not playing ball with the Mafia. Investigators theorized that whoever killed him probably was upset because Semilia wouldn't pay his pizzu — an unheard-of impu- dence in Palermo a decade ago. The Mafia also is losing some of the political clout it has enjoyed in Sicily since 1946, the first free elec- tion after World War II. Like the political warlords of the Philippines, the Sicilian Mafia long has traded on its power to de- liver blocks of votes from remote rural villages. Vote for ‘friend of friends’ Luigi Barzini, a noted writer on Italy, has told of explicit billboards in Mafia-controlled villages in the 1940s urging votes for a candidate as l’amico dei amici (the friend of the friends). Everyone knew the phrase meant “friend of the Mafia.” This year, though, Italy’s largest party, the Christian Democrats, made an extraordinary effort to field an untainted ticket for the Si- cilian regional elections on June 22. Among those the party regional secretary dropped from the slate was Salvatore Grillo, a longtime Christian Democratic leader from western Sicily. In February, Grillo became a liability for the Christian Democrats when he was noticed at- tending the funeral of Antonino Sal- vo, a Palermo businessman with many alleged Mafia connections. An ingrained pattern had changed, at least for the duration of the Palermo Mafia “mavi-trial.” For years, politicians “in Sicily had found it expedient to drop in on ‘the weddings and funerals of impor- tant Mafia families. Now it is more likely to shorten a career. . This isn’t to say all the politi- cians who have accepted: support from Mafia figures have suddenly vanished — either among the Chris- tian Democrats, who hold 40 per- cent of the seats in the Sicilian re- gional Parliament, or in the lesser parties. One of the more controversial holdovers is Salvo Lima, an Italian deputy in the European Parliament and still the head of Foreign Minis- ter Giulio Andreotti’s Christian Democratic faction in Sicily. About five years ago, Lima re- ortedly was named in testimony Before Italy's Anti-Mafia Commis- sion as among the “most compro- mised” politicians. That description came from Italy's top anti-Mafia in- vestigator, Gen. Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, who was assassinated by a Mafia gunman in 1982. The Dalla Chiesa killing has had as much to do as anything with the Mafia’s current troubles. This, along with the murder of Palermo prosecutor Rocco Chinnici a year later, convinced Italian judi- cial and executive authorities that ‘they were dealing witha full- fledged challenge to the apes y of the Italian state.

Happily for the Lampedusiani, the Libyans launched their two Soviet-made Scud missiles on a wintry day when the island’s fishing fleet had stayed in port. The missiles fell, detonating about 1 ton of high explosives each, in the water three miles offshore, not far from a traditional fishing spot. No one was hurt, But windows rattled at the Coast Guard station, and people in town took cover in caves and World War II air raid bunkers.

A Maltese inquiry casts doubt on Egypt's account of the raid. By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent VALLETTA, Malta — A Mal- tese inquiry into last year’s tragic hijack rescue attempt has blamed the deaths of 56 of the 58 hostages on Egyptian commandos, who were portrayed as having stormed the plane under orders to kill the hi- jackers “even if that meant killing everyone.” The inquiry also criticized two of the four Egyptian sky marshals for having acquiesced too easily to the orders of the hijackers who seized the EgyptAir jet on a flight from Athens, Greece, to Cairo, Egypt, last Nov. 23. “There were only three hijack- ers, but they were helped, too much, by the security guards,” Anthony Abela Medici, chief of the inquiry, has testified. The witness, a forensic expert, heads Malta's police crime laboratory. It was the two Egyptian sky marshals, according to his recon- struction, who dragged Nitzan Men- dersen, a terrified Israeli woman. out of her seat and up the aisle toward her death about two hours after the plane landed in Malta. The lone hijacker at the front of the Boeing 737 ordered her out onto a loading platform, where he killed her with a pistol shot to the head. The Maltese inquiry found that one of the sky marshals then bound the hands of three American hos- tages with neckties. All three subse- quently were shot in the head by the hijacker. But only one, Scarlett Rogenkamp, a civilian employee of the U.S. Air. Force, died. Although the findings were read in a public court session in Malta in February, they have received no publicity.

Omar Mo- hammed Ali Rezaq, 22. A detailed, unofficial record of the Maltese court hearings was made available to two visiting American correspondents. Key ele- ments of the record were confirmed by other sources, though Maltese of- ficials declined to be interviewed. The most surprising finding in the Maltese investigation is that the Egyptian commandos did not place their explosives in the plane’s bag- gage hold for the purpose of en- abling the commandos to get inside, as the Egyptian government has al- ways maintained. Instead, the commandos set a more. powerful explosive charge in- side the hold as part of a last-resort, contingency plan to ‘explode the plane” if. they al not kill the hi- The Maltese inquiry has con- cluded that this. charge exploded during the raid — possibly “by mis- take”. — and ignited plastic compo- nents inside the passenger compart- ment. The result was the fast-spreading cloud of poisonous smoke that enveloped the cabin, suf- focating at least 45 of the people who died in the hijack tragedy Nov. 24, 1985. The unofficial court record quotes Abela Medici as testifying: “There was one big explosion in the . lane by the Egyptian commandos. it was not meant to open the door of the plane because they [the com- mandos] had instructions to explode the plane if the firing did not kill the hijackers, even if they had to kill everyone.” An Egyptian Defense Ministry spokesman, reached by in Cairo, issued a brief statement. de- nying there had been an order to blow up the plane. “That is not true,” the state- ment said of the Maltese finding. “There was no instruction to the commandos to explode the plane.” Medici said he based his. conclu- sion in large part on previously un- disclosed statements to Maltese po- lice by an Egyptian commando officer whose legs were blown off by a hijacker’s grenade. Three other commandos suffered shrapnel wounds when the grenade exploded storming of the on the tarmac as the raiding party was about to rush aboard. “He [the wounded officer] said that if this attack did not succeed, they would explode the plane,” Me- dici said. The wounded commando officer was identified last November by Egyptian authorities as the leader of the assault force, Capt. Ibrahim Dahroug, 25. He was described but not named in Medici’s testimony. The commandos’ bomb consisted of ribbons of plastic explosive. The strips were affixed to the top panel of the baggage hold, 2 inches below a. Oe seat. Maltese investigators evidently did, not; take a statement from the commando they believe was as- signed. to operate the detonator from a hiding place behind one of , the plane’s tires. _According to Medici’s recon- struction, the commando “decided to explode the plane” soon after he | saw his leader and three other com- _ mandos felled by the hijacker’s gre- nade.

It was only the second time an Israeli leader offi- cially has set foot in an Arab state since the state of Is- rae] was founded 38 years ago. Syria quickly reacted by announcing termination of diplomatic relations with Morocco, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called Hassan’s move a “grave vio- lation” of his country’s 2-year-old treaty of union with Morocco, but he stopped short of saying the Morocco- Libya pact was dead. Egypt, which is beginning to erode the wall of Arab isolation that grew up after former President Anwar Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem in 1977, was quick to issue a cautious endorsement of Hassan’s initiative. From Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, there were no substantive reactions, Peres’ visit was seen by Israelis as helping to estab- lish acceptance of Israel’s existence by its Arab neigh- bors, But there appeared to be no immediate hope that the trip would lead to a breakthrough in Middle East peace talks, Atlanta Constitution - July 23, 1986 Cautioning against raised expectations, Yossi Beilin, the Israeli Cabinet secretary and a close Labor Party associate of Peres, said, “I am not sure that operative things will necessarily emerge from the meeting. “There is no special plan the prime minister is car- rying with him,” Beilin added in an interview broadcast by Israeli radio. . Western diplomats, speaking on condition of ano- nymity, said the meeting was prepared carefully, with | “friendly leaders” — including President Reagan and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia — informed in advance. ” Night fell over the capital of Rabat without any of- ficial government announcement that Peres had even arrived, But informal sources disclosed that the Israeli leader flew into the Fez airport late Monday and held | at least two sessions with Hassan on Tuesday.

        "ocr_text": "Morocco proves Arabs, Jews can live together in peace By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent CASABLANCA, Morocco — From his office above Hassan II Boulevard, Robert Assaraf, one of the 9,000 Jews still living in Moroc- co, spends most of his days helping to manage the royal fortune. But during last month’s Israeli- Moroccan summit, Assaraf was not at work. He was serving as a be- hind-the-scenes intermediary at the meeting in Ifrane, Morocco, be- tween King Hassan II and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Assaraf would not discuss his role. But informed sources said he is on close personal terms with Ra- phael Edrie, the second-ranking Is- raeli delegate, and Reda Guidera, the king’s chief counselor, for whom Assaraf worked 20 years ago at the Moroccan Foreign Ministry. Assaraf’s regular job is as man- aging director of Omnium Nord Africain, a Moroccan holding com- pany that grossed $747 million in 1985 from food processing, mining, importing and other interests. The company’s largest stock- holder, according to reliable busi- ness sources, is King Hassan. It is a situation that exists no- where else in the world: an Arab ruler who for years has protected the local Jewish community and at the same time has recruited Jews as royal advisers and business asso- ciates. The results jar many outsiders’ reconceptions. In Morocco, at east, Arabs and Jews can coexist and even work together. The explanation lies partly in Morocco’s French culture, its histo- ry of tolerance, and its distance — 3,500 miles — from the Israeli front lines. “There is a tradition of the Mo- roccans protecting the Jews here,” says Serge Berdugo, a construction contractor and vice president of the Moroccan Jewish Community. King ‘a master balancer’ But clearly the most important factor is Hassan, who for 25 years has been temporal ruler and “com- mander of the faithful” for Moroc- co’s 99 percent Sunni Moslem popu- lation. Berdugo and other Moroccan Jews say Hassan is one Moslem leader who follows the Koran’s teaching that Jews are to be treated respectfully, as “people of the Especially in the last decade, Hassan has made repeated gestures to signal his personal approval and protection of Moroccan Jews. There has been occasional veiled criticism in conservative political party newspapers, but no general Arab backlash. “The king is a mas- SETS EXAMPLE: Morocco’s King Hassan ll for years has protected the Jewish community. ter balancer,” one diplomat says. “He knows exactly how far he can go.” . One of Hassan’s signals came late last year when he awarded Mo- rocco’s prestigious Medal of Merit to David Amar, who was not only the leader of Morocco’s Jewish community but also the head of the board of directors of Omnium Nord Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 3, 1986 > Morocco Africain. About two months ago, Amar sold his block of shares to Hassan at the king’s request, according to business sources. The two reported- ly had joined in purchasing the company in 1980 from the French bank Paribas. Assaraf, Amar’s long- time assistant, has stayed on to run the company, although Amar has re- signed as a director. Hassan’s gestures have gone well beyond favors to people he knows. In 1984, he allowed Jews from around the world, including Israel, to attend a Jewish congress in Mo- rocco. In 1985, he sent his son, Ra- shid, to a Yom Kippur ceremony in Casablanca. : The freedom to be Jewish goes well beyond the 20 synagogues oper- ating throughout the country. Jews publish literature in He- brew, operate primary and second- ary schools in Hebrew, and train rabbis at a yeshiva school. When Jews have legal disputes about marriage, divorce or inheri- tance, the cases are heard by rab- binical judges who are civil service employees of the Moroccan Justice Ministry. Moroccan Jews can travel free- ly to Israel and return without diffi- culties. And before Morocco’s annu- al Jewish pilgrimages, the Moroccan government sends consul- ar officials to an airport in Spain to issue special travel documents to planeloads of returning Israeli Jews of Moroccan origin. In the old Jewish quarter of Ca- sablanca, butcher shops are marked in Hebrew, Arabic and French. The meat is prepared in the ko- sher section of Casablanca’s city slaughterhouse, which produces about 25 percent more meat than Jews consume. The rest is pur- chased by Arabs, both at Jewish and Arab butcher shops. Most Jews have emigrated Jewish leaders say they cannot recall the last time a Jew was in- sulted or struck by an Arab. If an usly incident ever was go- ing to happen, evening services on a recent Friday night at Temple Beth Israel in Casablanca’s 10-block Jew- ish quarter seemed a likely time. It was only three days after the con- troversial Peres-Hassan summit meeting, which had led to the burn- ing of the Moroccan Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, As local Jews had expected, nothing happened. There wasn’t even a police barricade. Outide the synagogue, a dozen Arab teenagers were kicking a soc- cer ball, and scores of Arab men sat in coffee shops. They paid no at- tention to the 100 Jews who entered the synagogue in twos and threes over a one-hour period. es | Back in 1948, when Israel was created, there were 360,000 Jews and 7 million Arabs in Morocco. The Arab population in Moroceo has swollen to 23 million, while all but about 9,000 Jews have left. The first wave of Jewish emi- gration took place in 1948. Other waves followed in 1956, when Mo- rocco became independent, and in 1967 and 1973 after the Arab-Israeli. wars in those years. The unexpected factor is that the Jews who have chosen to: stay, not only are tolerated but allowed to thrive. | Only a handful are as well off, 80- as Assaraf, Berdugo and Amar, who live in villas.

Durban apparently was the only port in southern Africa with the proper unloading equipment to deal with the specially prepared 40-foot- long containers. The Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, which is Zam- hia’s main alternate port, was only equipped for 20-foot containers, the businessman found. It is too early to tell whether the sanctions war will result in a full closure of the border between South Africa and its outspoken black neighbors to the north. Since the opening shots were fired by Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and five other Common- wealth leaders Monday, the only change has been the introduction of new South African border proce- dures that ‘have delayed some ship- ments to Zambia and neighboring Zimbabwe These include a requirement that Zambian ire put down 125 percent of the customs fees South Africa would charge if the same goods were being imported into South Africa. The South Afri- cans have said the money will be refunded, but they have not made clear when. But here in Zambia, a land- locked black nation already suffer- ing @ near depression from its low copper export prices, everyone from taxi drivers to Cabinet ministers are thinking back to the hard days of the early 1970s, That's when Zambia cut off its southern railroad link to Rhodesia, and the South African ports farther south, as part of the struggle by the black “front line” states against the white-minority regime of Ian Smith. “The problem is going to to be very serious,” said Milimo Puna- bantu, Zambia’s minister of national guidance, information and, broad- casting. Roughly 35 percent of Zambia’s imports — ranging from sophisti- cated mining equipment to cars to the liquid concentrate to make Coca-Cola — are manufactured in South Africa. | Another 35 percent or so travels from abroad through South Africa on the old 1,350-mile railroad line built in 1909 during the British colo- nial era, The line is still perhaps the most efficient in Africa.

(Dar es Salaam is the capital of Tanzania.) He answers his own question. “Maybe 12 a year. Why, we sell 150 in Johannesburg on a Saturday morning.” Like the other 9 million citizens of this young, predominantly black coun on South Africa’s northern border, white banker Silavecky is figuring that it won’t be long until South Africa turns the screws on Zimbabwe. Ever since Zimbabwean Prime Minister Robert Mugabe joined five other Commonwealth heads of state on Aug. 4 in announcing sanctions against South Africa, this capital has been abuzz with meetings. Capitalist businessmen and Mugabe’s Marxist-minded advisers are calculating, and in some cooperating, on how economy can ~survive a everyone says will come. The government line is can-do optimism.

But there is no question that Zimbabwe will be in deep trouble if South Africa decides to carry. out full-scale economic reprisals.

Each time technicians have patched the holes without disrupting the flow. But if a future attack hits a pum pias station, the country’s oil supply could be cut off. Even if the oil keeps flowing, most Zimbabwean factories are vul- nerable, because they are geared to use South African-made spare parts, chemicals and lubricants.

This could be done, optimists say, by pushing through rapid im- ts im the deteriorated rail line built by the former Portuguese colonialists who fled Mozambique in the mid-1970s. Dennis Norman, a white busi- nessman and a confidant of Mu- gabe’s, heads a private Zimbabwean group trying to raise $280 million from investors and aid agencies to fix the Beira railroad and harbor. “There has been little enthusi- asm shown until about last week, and suddenly every company wants to be involved,’?

He predicted that by the end of the year — Mugabe’s deadline for the start of Zimbabwe’s sanctions against South Africa — the Beira corridor will be able to handle 3 million tons of cargo a year. U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz hinted broadly in congressional testimony July 25 that the administration is prepared to help finance the Beira project, which he said “could be vital to the future economic growth of the region.”’ One complication, though, is that the United States and mba- bwe barely are talking to each oth- er.

        "ocr_text": "Pressed by rebels, Mozambique is a nation up for grabs By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution Correspondent BEIRA, Mozambique — Pressed to the wall by right-wing guerrillas, the Marxist government of Mozam- bique is encouraging Western capi- talists to exploit resources in rebel- held regions under the protection of private armies and foreign troops. _ Mozambique’s growing depen- dence on outside forces is a sign of the disintegration of a country whose 1,200-mile coastline makes it a key to the future of southern Afri- ca. Twelve years after gaining inde- pendence through the collapse of the Portuguese empire, Mozambique is a nation up for grabs. “It is self-service,” marvelled entrepreneur Harvey Lynch of Winnsboro, La., who traveled into Mozambique in mid-August to check out a shrimps-for-export deal. During his meetings with a member of Mozambique’s industrial commission, Lynch said, he also was told that enormous tracts of timber were available at bargain rates, if. he would supply his own security to get the logs to the coast. Experiences similar to Lynch’s have been reported by at least five other Western businessmen who vis- ited Mozambique in recent months, according to Western intelligence sources contacted elsewhere in Afri- ca. Two mercenary-led security forces have been formed in the past year, one by Exxon and one by the British-based Lonrho Company, the intelligence sources said. And at least 5,000 regular troops from neighboring Zimbabwe have been deployed in Mozambique since 1983 to help the ineffectual Mozambican army fend off rebel at- tacks on a strategic 200-mile trans- portation corridor between the port of Beira and eastern Zimbabwe. The Beira corridor — consisting of an oil pipeline, a poorly main- tained single-track railroad, and a pothole-pocked road — is viewed by the six black “front-line” countries bordering South Africa as vital to surviving economic pressures brought to bear by while-ruled Pre- toria. Lynch, who used to own a chain of black-oriented radio stations in the United States, says Marxist Mo- zambique has offered attractive conditions for Western capitalists, including the right to take out prof- its. He is investigating two ventures near the coast, one in exporting fro- zen shrimp and the other in produc- ing table salt. But he said any venture that =\\ TANZANIA hi: uses, wiv declined to be quoted by name. Yet other, much larger opera- | tors already have gotten into the } mercenary game with the assent of the government of Mozambican President Samora Machel, accord- | ing to the Western intelligence yas Sa <Ag, vo teu - ft “> B =N would require a private army would be too risky. “I wouldn't touch it,” he told a visiting Western journalist. A Zimbabwean businessman sit- ting beside Lynch on the tiled porti- co of the Don Carlos hotel, one of the relics of Beira’s Portuguese co- lonial elegance, agreed. “You are going to have private armies fight- ing for control of the country,” said sources. Exxon was among the first. When it wanted to drill an explor- atory oil well near Pemba in north- ern Mozambique last year, the com- i reportedly recruited a veteran S. Army intelligence officer, Lt. Col. James Stitt, who was retiring from the service after a tour as military attache at the U.S. Embas- sy in neighboring Zimbabwe. Well-informed Western sources said Stitt, with the assent of the Mo- zambican government, took com- mand of roughly 500 ragtag Mozam- bican troops and all access routes to the well site during nearly a year of drilling. With new boots, uniforms and other equipment provided by Stitt, the Exxon-financed battalion came to be viewed by outside intelligence experts as one of the few competent units in the Mozambique army. The results of Exxon’s exploratory well have not been disclosed. British industrialist “Tiny” Row- land, whose company, Lonrho, is Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 31, 1986 > \fMozambique up for. thought to be the largest foreign in- vestor in Mozambique, reportedly has fielded one private force al- ready and is recruiting officers for Among RENAMO’s recent suc- cesses, according to the intelligence. sources, was an attack on the out- skirts of Beira a month ago in which not only Mozambican soldiers ~ but also some Soviet and Cuban ad- say the Lonrho force consists of local blacks led by whites who used to fight in the Rho- desian army before Rhodesian white-minority rule ended in 1980 and the country became Zimbabwe. Rowland reportedly is seeking other ex-Rhodesian mercenaries to lead a considerably larger force to reopen a 400-mile-long railroad cut by the rebels between the sugar- producing nation of Malawi and Mo- zambique’s northern port of Nacala. Aside from the economic woes common to the poorest third of Af- rica, Mozambique’s government has been unable for 10 years to gain control of the countryside from well-financed guerrilla fighters. The guerrillas, who call them- selves the Mozambique National Re- sistance, or RENAMO, have sur- prised Western intelligence officials this year by showing they can orga- nize their scattered units into a sin- gle 1,000-man combat battalion when necessary. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 31, 1986 (Continued) visers were killed. There have been at least four. attacks on the Beira-to-Zimbabwe pipeline in the last month, repeated ; destruction of electricity lines, and. a series of costly, inconclusive bat- tles against Zimbabwean troops de- ployed in Mozambique to assist gov-, ernment forces. RENAMO was formed in 1976, one year after Mozambican indepen-. dence, by a handful of Mozambicans, who were left out of the new gov. ernment despite participation in a 10-year underground struggle against the former Portuguese rul- ers. RENAMO’s original patron was the Rhodesian Central Intelligence. Organization, which reportedly. trained, paid and equipped the ini- tial RENAMO force as a means of destabilizing its hostile black-ruled. neighbor, Mozambique. After the downfall of the white Rhodesian regime in 1980, South Af- rican security forces took over as rabs § main outside conduit of me ‘a supplies. South irlese support dimin- ished in 1984, when Mozambique and South Africa signed an accord eae not to help guerrillas in $ territories. But in the a year, according to Western in- telligence sources, South African support for RENAMO has picked up. A RENAMO representative in Washington has sought to win back- ing from the Reagan administration comparable to Washington’s covert aid to the UNITA rebels in Angola. But the administration has kept RENAMO at arm’s length, prefer- ring a policy of trying to wean Mo- zambique’s government from its So- viet backers. Some U.S. conservatives think otherwise, A report by the British Broadcasting Corp. said last week that the Heritage Foundation, a con- servative Washington think tank, was seeking to encourage an anti- Marxist alliance between RENAMO and a Zimbabwean splinter faction opposed to Zimbabwe's left-wing government. Western sources believe that an- other main source of support has been conservative Portuguese busi- hessmen, \f"

For the next 100 miles, the river races and rests. Sometimes it runs down through foaming, roaring rapids no wider than 30 feet. In other spots river widens ipabout 200 feet, forming pools and eddies.

Two of the three rafts were pilot- ed-by young Zimbabweans licensed as‘river guides.

        "ocr_text": "A letter from the editor of Cox Newspapers By Charies E. Glover EDITOR-IN-CHIEF COX NEWSPAPERS Stolen Childhood, a series of articles on child labor, is the first comprehensive look by a team of American journalists at this acute global problem. To get their story, Cox reporters traveled 65,000 miles, making two full trips around the world. In nine months they interviewed more than 200 people in 11 countnes on five continents. Their first report appears today in the Dayton Daily News and Journal Heraid The series continues for the next five days. The reporters are Joseph Albright, the Rome-based chief foreign correspondent of Cox Newspapers, and special corre- spondent Marcia Kunstel, his wife. Rick McKay, illustrations editor for the Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau, accom- panied them on many of their travels. Almost everywhere the team went, dip- lomats, local government officials and so- cial workers said they could not see — let alone photograph — young children doing potentially harmful work. The reason: Fac- tory owners, brothel operators and others who employed children knew that what they were doing was illegal. Nevertheless, using techniques learned on the police beat, Albright and Kunstel got the story — from the factories of Mo- rocco to the back alleys of Bangkok. Mc- Kay got the photographs. Albright and Kunstel have covered the war in Afghanistan, the TWA hijacking in Beirut, the Philippine revolution, the tur. moil in South Africa and the American bombing of Libya. Albright has been Cox Newspapers’ chief foreign correspondent for four years. He is a former Cox national correspondent and a winner of the Sigma Delta Chi award for Washington correspondence. Albright grew up in Chicago and graduated from Williams College. Kunstel has been a free-lance foreign correspondent based in Rome. She is a former reporter for the Atlanta Journal ana Constitution, Kunstel grew up in Chardon, Ohio, and graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University. The Stolen Childhood project was con: ceived by Ed Crowell, an editor for The Aus. tin (Texas) Amencan-Statesman. Crowell and Andrew J. Glass, the Cox bureau chief in Washington, were the editors.

It was built five years ago when her company was broadening its foreign markets with the aid of loans from a government development bank. Hiyat would have to tie one strand of wool- en pile onto the loom every 2.43 seconds to keep up with what her supervisor says is the factory’s pace of knotting. Because she is learning, she is a little slower. Mocary supervisors wouldn’t say how much, if anything, Hiyat earns. Throughout the carpet industry, apprentices commonly re- main unpaid while learning. She earns at most 15 cents an hour, judging from government figures on rug workers’ piecework rates. The monotony tears on her. “I wanted to stay in school,” she said, ‘“‘not work here.”’ Hundreds of millions Many governments acknowledge privately that children are being exploited, but don’t know what to do about it, according to Dr. M.A. El Batawi, chief of the World Health Organization’s office of occupational health in Geneva. Their dilemma, as he described it at an in- ternational conference two years ago, is: “If you say, ‘Let’s ban child labor,’ what are you going to do with the millions of kids? There are not enough schools to put them in.”” What they do, Batawi says, is “close their eyes to it, and the situation goes on with chil- dren being maimed and dying.”’ In 1979, the United Nations’ International Labor Organization estimated that 56 million children between 11 and 15 served in the world’s work force. Last year, the ILO raised that estimate to 88 million. The ILO figure doesn’t include many forms of children’s work, such as piecework in the home or street peddling. Nor does it count any children under 11. If “informal” child labor were counted, “the estimate would run into the hundreds of millions,”* a UNICEF staff pa- per reported last year. Sweatshop tide Little wonder. Since 1950, the world’s pool of potential child workers has nearly doubled as* Third World population has soared until now there are 1.1 billion children between 5 ard 14 years. Cheap health techniques, including mass vaccinations and oral rehydration for diar- rhea, are keeping multitudes alive who would have died in their first year a generation ago. New schools are not being built fast enough to stay ahead of the tide of 15 million extra sc -age children every year. And for what sort of life are these millions being saved? They are growing up as the race for devel- World Health Organization and the ILO sug- gest that children who take on factory, con- struction and other heavy jobs grow more slowly, suffer from work-related diseases and never learn to read. “They tend to be disadvantaged throughout their lives,\"’ said Assefa Bequele, the ILO’s chief specialist on child labor in Geneva. Disadvantages come in _ gradations, of course. Four out of five children work in fields, not cities. Ultimately, a boy who hoes 12 hours a day will be better off if he’s working his fa- ther’s plot, which he may later inherit, than if he’s working a landlord’s plantation. Defining exploitation Some child workers go to school, some don’t. A girl who sells cigarettes on the street after school gets a far better start on life than a girl who runs a sewing machine and never goes to school. Exploitation needs a narrower definition than merely children working. To Britain's Anti-Slavery Society, exploitation involves children working under conditions which are harmful to their maturing. To Francis Blan- chard, director-general of the ILO, it’s “the denial to children of their right to play, to learn, to enjoy a normal childhood.”’ Definitions such as these fit in countries where children's toughest challenge is getting into college. They don’t work, however, in Third World countries where a Western-style childhood is a luxury for a tiny elite. A more tangible definition — one which contains less Western cultural bias — comes from the Geneva-based advocacy group De- fense for Children International. It defines child exploitation this way: a of excessive profits from a child’s labor; @ Using child labor in a way that could in- flict physical or mental suffering or damage; @ Denying a child its liberty or access to its A Moroccan carpet, pro- duced by Mocary SA using . child labor, is sold in Macy's for $499.

How does the hand-made carpet industry in Morocco measure up against that standard? King Hassan II’s government says it has all but eliminated child labor in carpet making over the last two decades. “There are very rarely girls less than 12 years old,”’ Fouad Lahlou, secretary general of Morocco’s Ministry of Handicrafts and Social Affairs, said in an interview. “‘Very rareiy.”\" During 1985 and 1986 there was noc a single Prosecution in the carpet industry under Mo- rocco’s law against hiring children under 12, Lahlou said. To check whether conditions had really changed, Cox journalists visited 14 Moroccan carpet factories in five Moroccan cities, in most cases without making any advance arrangements. Eleven of the 14 welcomed the visitors and arranged tours. In all 11 factories, children who looked unmistakably under the age of 12 were found working on looms. Grimness common Roughly 350 rug-knotters under 12 were counted, out of an estimated 2,500 total of girls and young women found working in those factories. For Yebbous, labor inspectors are no deter- rent against hiring his 7-year-olds. Asked if inspectors ever interfered with his use of children, Yebbous said, “‘No, not at all. They don't try to force their way in here.”* The conditions in all the factories, large and small, were similar: areas too dimly lighted to work without strain, fat wool fuzz balls skit- tering across the floors, the dank odor of wool and dye. In some, light shafts breaking through a window defined the haze of dust that the young workers breathed.

Plant supervisor Mohammad Benour of the. 600-employee Martex SA carpet factory in Sale said in an interview: ‘“‘To do this work you have to have experience. It’s better if we can get them when they are 7.”’ Hiding the girls In contrast to such forthrightness, Hiyat’s bosses at Mocary tried to hide their employ- ment of under-age children. When the journalists drove up to the factory gates 10 minutes ahead of their scheduled vis- it, a male supervisor was seen escorting three girls who looked about 9 out the front door. Another male supervisor was gently pushing a girl, about 10, into a closet. Another half-doz- en children, including Hiyat, remained at their looms. Half an hour later, as the tour ended, a doz- en of the plant’s temporarily-exiled work force were seen waiting in a field across the street. One girl had her finger wrapped with yarn, a technique many knotters use to protect against cuts. As the reporters were driving away, they watched in their rear-view mirror as the exiles scampered back into the factory. “Oh, I’m sure no one did that,” insisted Mo- cary executive Abdulila El Idrissi when asked why some under-age workers had been re- moved from the factory. He maintained all of Mocary’s workers were 13 — even though he had been filling in as the translator when Hiyat said she was 11.

Still, she does not believe child labor can be banned outright. : Pragmatic view “When you think about all the children working in India, it becomes an impossible situation,” she said, maintaining, instead, that attention must concentrate on the 1.5 million children she estimates are working in clearly exploitive conditions. Growing numbers of Indians agree more must be done. Besides taking jobs from adults, they say child labor sabotages the future of the children themselves. “A child starts working at 7 or 8.\" said Neera Burra. a researcher on child labor for UNICEF and for the Indian Social Institute. “He is burned out by the time he is 30 to 35. So he must send his own child to work. It is a vicious circie.”\" Juyal of the Gandhian Institute said child work can be countenanced if the children learn a marketable skill or can combine work with school. Without either, children end up working menial jobs forever, or are unem- ployed as they age. “You use labor and discard them when you don't need them,” said Juyal. The government even gives export subsidies to some industries known to be big users of child labor. Both the giass and hand-made car- pet industries get rebates from the govern- ment equal to 10 percent of the value of what they export. Juyal said it was the government that spurred both the expansion of the carpet in- dustry and its increased use of children. He cited programs beginning in the 1970s in which the government offered low-cost loans to new manufacturers and opened training schools for children who were under the legal age of employment in the carpet trade 150,000 expendables? “Need we sacrifice 150,000 children for the sake of foreign exchange earnings rising at the most to about 1.5 billion rupees ($117 million) per annum?” asked Juyal, speaking of the car- pet weavers. Reading the changing public mood, the gov- ernment of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi did propose and, finally. in January. secured pas- sage of a new child-labor law that mandates limited hours and special benefits and condi- tions for working children. It maintains the ban on factory and hazard- ous work, but the problem. according to crit- ics, is that it makes no effective provision for enforcing either the new standards or the old ones that have been ignored since they were enacted 35 years ago. - June 22, 1987 (Continued) >  HE GLASS WORKS OF FIROZABAD 500 miles CHINA INDIA BANGLADESH Population: 760 million — 83 percent Hindus, 11 per- cent Mosiems, 3 percent Christians, 2 percent Sikhs 55-year life expectancy.

These wretched little boys in rub- ber-thonged sandals cannot be found darting around the furnaces of Boro- sil Glass Works, the Indian affiliate of Corning in Bombay. Indian technicians wearing labora- tory coats, safety shoes and protec- tive glasses work on Borosil’s spot- less floors, just as the Corning safety teams from the United States demand. The children work instead for a Borosil subcontractor whose primi- tive factory looks like a tintype in a Moscow museum of capitalist horrors. Every year, the Corning affiliate orders thousands of test tubes, bea- kers and other laboratory glass from the subcontractor, West Glass, whose factory is in Firozabad, 650 miles northeast of Bombay. Borosil then sells the Firozabad glass, without labels, to customers in Africa, the Middle East and South- east Asia. Cheap Rajesh J. Vyas, the marketing manager of Borosil, said buying glass from Firozabad enables him to fill a niche in his overall export strategy: meeting the demand of “countries where price is the main criterion, such as Egypt or Kenya, which have foreign exchange problems.” Borosil manufactures in its modern Bombay plant about 98 percent of the glass it sells to its domestic and for- eign customers. Chemically identical to Corning’s Pyrex and pharmaceutical lines, glass carrying the Borosil label doesn’t crack when heated and isn’t corroded by laboratory acids. Its one drawback is that it is too expensive for some Third World markets. Borosil gets the remaining 2 per- cent of what it selis from Firozabad, exclusively for export customers. It is cheap laboratory glassware made of “soda glass,’ the same material used in tumblers and beer bottles everywhere. Laboratory vessels made of soda glass are neither heat-resistant nor etch-proof nor accurately calibrated. But they are cheap. It's only a sideline for Borosil. For Corning — a blue-blood company that last year sold $1.9 billion worth of products ranging from fiber optic cables to Steuben vases — the impact on bottom line is infinitesimal. Ethical? Is it proper for Corning and its af- filiate to derive any benefit from the illegal labor of li-year-old boys? There was no hint in conversations with Borosil executives in Bombay that anyone had ever considered this to be an ethical question. Back in the United States, John Abrams, manager of corporate infor- mation for Corning, said in a tele- phone interview: “The child labor which is utilized in Firozabad is done with the full knowledge of the Indian government and as far as we know complies with Indian law ... As of now, we have no reason to believe the child employment laws are being flouted” at West Glass. After an exchange of messages be- tween Corning headquarters and Borosil, Abrams said that as far as he knows, the youngest employees at West Glass are 14 years old. It's clear that the Borosil orders make a huge difference to one ambi- tious factory boss in Firovabad — both in profits and prestige. His face wreathed with smiles, the proprietor of West Glass, Bihari Lal Sharma, told visiting reporters in Fir- ozabad that Borosil is one of his most important customers. He said at times fully 20 percent of his 1,500 workers are making labora- tory glass for Borosil and that he re- ceives at least $100,000 worth of or- ders from Borosil every year. West Glass may well be, as Sharma boasted, ‘the biggest compa- ny in Firozabad, quality-wise, diver- sity-wise and labor-wise.\" But it is not the sort of place where the lumi- naries on Corning's board, including civil-rights leader Vernon Jordan and former World Bank chief Robert Mc- Namara, would feel comfortable. Arsenic In the factory, a visitor flinches from unexpected surges of heat on the back of the neck. The heat radi- ates from orbs of molten glass car- ried by Indian boys criss-crossing the crowded factory floor. Breathing is another worry. Among the chemicals the factory uses to make colored glass, Sharma volunteered, is arsenic. When pressed about the use of arsenic, he changed the subject. About one-third of the 500 work- ers on duty looked no older than 12. The factory proprietor at first ac- know ledged hiring boys under the le- gal minimum age of 14. He said boys are “at least 11° when they come to work. He amended that by saying, “at least 13 or 14.\" It can be no surprise to Borosil that its supplier illegally hires under-age children. Borosil officials have visit- ed the West Glass plant periodically on buying trips, as both Sharma and Vyas of Borosil confirmed. Vyas estimated that every year Borosil exports about $250,000 worth of goods made by subcontrac- tors. The “bulk” of the goods consists Dayton Daily News - June 22, 1987 (Sidebar) of soda glass ordered from the West Glass factory, Vyas said. Borosil views itself as closely affil- iated with Corning. Even though Corning owns only 39.5 percent of the Borosil stock, Borosil manufac- turing manager Ranjit Mehra called this “controlling interest.” Indian investors, many of them now or formerly part of the company management, hold the non-Corning shares. Corning aware “Corning is very, very conscious about safety,” Mehra said. “They keep coming here to personally in- spect our safety practices. We have to send them periodic audits on safety.” Mehra said the 1984 disaster at Union Carbide’s Bhopal chemical plant led Corning officials to demand that Borosil change the way it cali: brates the scientific instruments it makes. “After Bhopal, Corning came down on us like a ton of bricks,\" Mehra said. “They told us that il you're using mercury, you've got t stop or else shut down the plant.” A Borosil catalogue says the com: pany was incorporated in India in 1963 “with technical and financial collaboration from Corning Giasi Works.” A Corning spokesman it New York described Borosil as “a lit tle Corning Works,” adding tha from Corning’s viewpoint it was ; “joint venture.” During its first decade, American from Corning worked alongside Indi an executives in running Borosi!

Governments, businesses and the poor themselves insist they cannot afford to do without the labor and income of children. India — with an annual per- capita income of $260 a year and estimates that one of every five children aged 5 to 15 is employed — is a fitting place to examine conditions and causes of the most abusive child work. Poverty has made a tradition of child labor here. Widespread child labor in India assures that the poor stay poor, partly because many working children fill jobs while millions of adult Indians — often their own fathers — search fruitlessly for work. Children get jobs because they are cheap and docile hires. Mohammad, for example, said he makes 11 rupees a day at the Emkay Glass Works, which comes to about 86 cents a day, even less than India’s meager minimum wage of $1.25 daily. An adult at the same shop working one of the more skilled jobs said he made 150 rupees — almost 12 U.S. dollars —a day. With three day’s pay, Moham- mad could buy his mother enough cheap cloth for one sari and his father one package of local cigarettes. “In the long run, if children are thrown out of jobs, the businesses will have to continue by employ- ing adults at better wages.” said Swami Agnivesh, a well-known Indian social reformer. A large force of child laborers depresses the wage scale as well as perpetuates adult unemploy- ment, he said. It becomes a vicious circle as adults making a pittance look to their children to supple- ment the family income, then have more and more children who not only raise family costs, but contribute to low wages. Employers take advantage of these conditions, Agnivesh said, especially unscrupulous ones who make loans for pledges of work. With usurious interest rates, en- tire families effectively become serfs to a system of bonded indebtedness. Estimates of children working in India vary from nearly 18 mil- lion — the government figure for children aged 5 to 15 who work for wages — to 44 million. Sucial agencies say the larger numbe: is more realistic because it includes children who do piecework jobs with their parents, or are not paid directly by employers for other reasons. Many of India’s 200 million children from 5 to 15 hold occa- sional jobs or else sacrifice school attendance so they can keep house and tend younger siblings while parents work. They are not count- ed in the work force. The only country that may rival India in child laborers is China, which the United Nations’ Inter- national Labor Organization esti- mates has 39.6 million children working between the ages 10 and 14. Since so much of China re- mains impenetrable to Western- ers, it is impossible to gauge inter- nal work conditions there. Dayton Daily News - June 22, 1987 (Continued) \f"

But she wishes the boss wouldn't make her pay for the thread. Eliza is one of hundreds of thousands of 13-, 14- amd 15-year-old Asian children who work marathon hours of drudgery in the same sweatshops where they sleep. Factories such as War Win’s Style shirt factory, where Eliza earns 13 cents an hour sitting at her machine, are supposed to register with the government and obey national labor laws. They don’t, and governments straining for economic development don’t try very hard to find them. It’s a formula for ex- ploitation of children that applies not only STOLEN CHILDHOOD @ THIRD OF SIX PARTS here but in sweatshops by the thousands in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. “Officially, they don’t quite exist,”’ said Jose Gatchalian, dean of the Institute of Industrial Relations at the University of the Philippines. ‘“The owners figure that . they've got to go through a lot of rigama- role, so why bother. If they register, here come the inspectors to see if their condi- tions are right. If they don’t register, that takes care of all the problems.” No inspectors come around to check the War Win’s Style plant, a basketball- court sized building in a Manila suburb. Eliza’s routine six days a week goes like this: Wake up at 6 a.m. on a pile of cloth scraps beside her sewing machine, a stur- dy model resembling those commonly found in many American homes. Make breakfast, usually a bow! of rice and gra- vy. Sweep the sewing room floor. “We start sewing exactly at 7 a.m. We usually get a break around noon. It lasts maybe two hours, but only half an hour if we are on a rush. We start up again for the afternoon and work until about 7 p.m. _- CONTINUED FROM/2 “We stop for about half an hour for dinner. ;*Then we start sewing again. Usually until ~ “midnight. Sometimes it is until 3 a.m. In De- i _cember, we go right on through, just takirg a ““catnap.” ““\" Eliza said she often daydreams through the hours she sews. But “‘you can get hurt if you “are not careful or when you are sleepy,” she r+ “acknowledged. _ Bounded compassionate. _ ‘No choice’ — work them |... “Sometimes they get ill,” she said. “Some of » them have suffered anemia from lack of sleep. ; <especially in December,’’ when orders for the ‘, holiday season must be filled. Cruz, who lives next door to the factory, . «Said if she wants to succeed in the garment children long hours. “We have a strict shipping schedule,’ she said. “If we fail to deliver, there will be no gvork to be done for the next two weeks. So they have to finish, even if they have to work ;, 23 hours a day.” ~ as There are no clocks to tell the workers how -. long they have been stitching. ‘“‘We find out the next day when one of the women comes in ° and tells us, ‘Oh, I got home at 1, 2 or 3 a.m.” »That’s how we know how long we worked,” +, said Eliza. week to her grandmother’s house, about two * miles from the factory. - As for the factory’s thread policy, Cruz said: at let the sewers purchase the thread. That ‘ “way they will not waste it.” “~~ Eliza’s predicament “‘is not an isolated case -*{n the Philippines,” said Aura Sabilano, head of the Labor Ministry’s bureau of women and minors. She said President Corazon Aquino’s administration hopes to stop such labor abuses. But she isn’t optimistic. “The very sad reality is that we’re part of the Third World,” she said. ‘“‘We're part of the dumping ground where cheap labor is the main attraction. For investors, cheap labor is the main attraction of the Philippines at this point in time.”’ inevitable, many say Sabilano’s remarks reflect a mind-set shared by a good many intellectuals in the ‘T°Third World: that cheap labor and child ex- -*ploitation may be inevitable as the country -struggles to keep up with competing Third “World nations.

The casualties included a 13- year-old, who was injured; a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old, who were killed. “ Thai fire investigators found that an electri- ‘cal short from a defective outlet ignited a glue “pot after the purse makers had gone to sleep on the floor following a 16-hour workday. The ‘workers were trapped inside the factory be- hind locked doors and metal window shutters. tt Evidence suggests that child labor has in- creased in the 1980s, at the same time that ‘Thailand's economy has surged. Visiting Cox Newspapers reporters found that Thai children in their early teens com- ‘monly work 75 hours a week in factories for ‘less than seven cents an hour. That's about “one-fifth of Thailand’s minimum wage, itself “among the lowest in the world. _Feed them, control them “Sometimes I don't get a day off for .weeks,\"” said Sarapa Nasap, who wraps toy Uzi machine guns in a plastics factory. She said she works 10-to-14-hour days six days a week and usually an 8-hour day on Sunday. The live-in factory system is such an accept- ed part of Thailand's labor patterns that it _ didn’t embarrass one of Sarapa's bosses to talk about the arrangements. “If we give them meals, then we can control ,-them very easily,\"’ said Komol Trairattanapa, export manager of Siam Asian Enterprises Ltd. Having the workers sleep in a factory dormitory behind large metal gates also helps . exert control, he said. Komol maintained that none of his workers was under 17. As he was saying this in the _.front office, a girl who looked about 11 was -being photographed in the back workshop. Sarapa, 15, said she is paid a monthly salary of $20, plus a bonus of 20 cents each night she works later than 10 p.m. Spread out over the to 90 hours a week she says she works, her pay would average six cents an hour. Some Bangkok sweatshop children would have to double their pay to reach six cents an hour. Among nine children whom reporters succeeded in interviewing away from their bosses, the pay ranged from 3 to 16 cents an hour. Pennies buy more in Thailand and the Phil- ippines than in the United States. But not much more. After sending nearly three months’ salary home, a 13-year-old factory gem polisher who called himself only Prasert said, “‘Por this, my parents can buy a water buffalo.\"” The $36 he had earned in the sweatshop was perhaps enough to purchase a calf. B Had an American boy worked the same { 1,000 hours at an American minimum-wage job, he would have earned enough money, at U.S. prices, to buy five full-sized beef steers. In the Philippines. Eliza would have to work three hours at 13 cents an hour to buy a loaf of bread. The highest-paid child worker reporters found in Bangkok, Siraporn Chookaew, 14, earns 16 cents an hour running a sewing ma- chine at plecework rates in a Bangkok skirt factory. Her monthly earnings sometimes run as high as $70. But to make that much, she work 15 hours a day, seven days a week. ome Bangkok sweatshop children would have to dou- ble their pay to reach six cents an hour. Among nine chil- dren whom reporters succeeded in interviewing away from their bosses, the pay ranged from 3 to 16 cents an hour. More typical was Boon Mee Norakot, 13, encountered in a suburban Bangkok live-in furniture factory whittling a piece of rattan propped between his toes. He said he earns a straight salary of $16 a month, plus room and board. Working 85 hours a week, he pulls in about four cents an hour. 3 cents an hour Lowest paid of all was Somsuey Siritoh, 14, who sews-buttons in the same Bangkok skirt factory where -her friend makes 16 cents an hour. Somsuey, still an apprentice, is paid $12 a month — which comes out to less than three cents an hour. r Most children said they were tired and bored, but at the same time proud to do their duty to their parents. , The pittances: paid-to these nine children were not aberrations. At a seminar on child labor in Bangkok last September, Voravaun Thanaphibul of the Thai Interior Ministry said working children usually earn between $12 and $60 a month = .‘‘much smaller wages than adult workers,” as she put it. More than half of the. products made in Asian sweatshops are “sold for local consumption. ~~~ But tons of other cheap goods are also made specifically for export. In Thailand, Sarapa’s toy factory sells its toy machine guns in Eu- rope. Siraporn sa&ys-her skirts are made for markets in Singapore and the United States. Prasert’s artificial gemstones and Boon’s rat- tan are made for export as well, although they said they didn’t know the destinations. An unpublished 1985..study for the Thai government by the United Nations’ Interna- tional Labor - Organization traces the recent increase in non-farm work by Thai children to Thailand’s export boom. Buyers from Western department stores deal either with expatriate export brokers based in Bangkok, or’ with big, clean, respect- able Thai manufacturing concerns that don’t hire children. The big factories are pleased to show West- ern buyers their modern plants where the workers are young women wearing spotless uniforms. What they don’t show is their hid- den minor league of unlicensed subcontractors that churn out low-cost merchandise. Links also exist between child labor and the export market in the Philippines. Among the ‘longest-established Philippine exports to the re oa are rattan sre ture aeacensine d-embroidere - June 23,1987 (Continued) > \fa I — Links also exist between child labor and the export market in the Philippines. Among the longest-established Philippine exports to the United ‘States are rattan furniture, decorative baskets and hand-embroidered baby dresses. About 70 years ago, when the Philippines was a U.S. territory, American entrepreneurs began contracting with Filipino women in Ma- nila suburbs for production of baby dresses in their homes. The Filipino contractors, called cabecillas, subcontracted the work to their neighbors, who in turn subcontracted the work down to lower and lower levels of subcontractors. By 1930, embroidered articles had become one of the top 10 exports in the Philippines. Then, as now, much of the work was done by children. Baby dresses are still being exported to the United States, and by some of the same ex- porters, including Manhattan's Feltman Broth- ers, who have been active since the 1930s. The wages Philippine children earn for sew- ing in their homes range from one cent to five cents an hour, according to a 1985 study by the Institute of Industrial Relations at the Univer- sity of the Philippines. Most of the children found by researchers worked between 15 and 30 hours a week. Depressing pattern The profits from child labor are often ob- scure. When they can be traced, the pattern is the same as in the Moroccan carpet industry: Little people toiling, big people making money: @ War Win’s Style factory in the Philip- pines earns roughly four times as much in profits from selling a dozen shirts as Eliza earns for making them. Owner Josie Cruz says she pays Eliza a piecework rate of 75 cents for every dozen shirts she sews, The factory's profit margin is about $3 on a dozen shirts, judging from fig- ures provided by Cruz. Cruz says in a busy week the 25 sewers and silk screeners in the factory and 20 more seamstresses who work at home can make 360 dozen shirts, suggesting a potential profit of up to $1,000 a week. Eliza says it takes her about six hours to make a dozen shirts, netting her 13 cents an hour BWThe factory where Sarapa makes six cents an hour also appears to be a miniature money machine. Export manager Komol said he expects to export one million plastic toys this year. He said the company charges 48 cents wholesale for its biggest seller, a 16-inch-long plastic Uzi machine gun, With cheap material, only 25 employees and high Volume, the factory would have a diffi- cult time losing money. If it makes even a 2 percent profit margin, its yearly profits should run well into the thousands of dollars. WConsiderably larger profits accrue to some middlemen who don't directly employ child labor, Export broker Raymond Eaton, an Australian living in Bangkok, is one example of such a middleman. WConsiderably larger profits accrue to some middlemen who don't directly employ child labor, Export broker Raymond Eaton, an Australian living in Bangkok, is one example of such a middleman. Eaton said his Export Development Trading Corp, last year arranged $44 million in sales of Thai garments, toys, rattan furniture, tennis shoes and other merchandise to Western buy- ers. His largest client is the Splegel mail-order nouse in the United States, he said, Both the Philippines and Thailand have laws written to protect young workers, but that doesn’t help children such as Eliza and Sarapa. Both countries set 48 hours as the maximum any factory worker can be made to work in a week without overtime pay. Both have a mini- mum wage — $2.75 a day in Manila, $2.92 a day in Bangkok. As for hiring minors, Philippine law says it’s illegal to hire children under 15 unless they are directly supervised by a parent, and there is no interference with a child's education. Thai law permits children up to age 12 to work in light jobs such as flower selling, newspaper delivery, and waiting on tables. However, it bars factory work before the age of 15 without governmental permission. But, in both countries, laws are one thing and enforcement is another. In Thailand, Vor- avaun of the Interior Ministry said she knows of only three cases in 1985 where employers were charged with working young employees for excessive hours. Shortage of inspectors There are not enough factory inspectors to go around. By a 1982 count, Thailand had 40,951 licensed factories and uncounted thou- sands more illegal shophouses. It had only 115 factory inspectors. Sabilano of the Labor Ministry says the Aquino administration has at least taken a step in the right direction by recognizing that child labor exists in the Philippines and should be monitored. In Thailand, the government says the oppo- site — at least when dealing with outsiders. “Now the situation of child labor is not a worry,” asserted Voravaun, who is in charge of the Thai Interior Ministry's women and child-labor division. “We cannot find a lot of child labor. Sometimes we look and inspect the factory all day and they cannot find children.\" 1986. ak :} PHILIPPINES ; j Se ee Population: 55 million — 83 percent Roman Catholics, 9 percent Protestants, 5 per- cent Mosiems. 63-year life expectancy.

ANGKOK — For thousands of Thai children, the Hua Lampong train station has : been a gateway to exploita- . tion. Once a year itis a gateway out. The_ happy time is the Chinese ‘New Year, when ethnic Chinese ‘owners of shops and factories givea ‘holiday to their workers, many of . whom are migrants from debt-ridden farms or landless families in the im- _ povertished northeast. ' Seven girls clustered on a bench were going home last January for the _first time in the year they had been working at a tiny Bangkok garment factory. Not_ only was it their first trip back: This was their first full day off in a year. Ladda Pimwan, 15, leaned against a girtfriend. The seven had arrived early, and had yet to endure a nine- hour train ride and then an hour's bus drive to their village of Baan As Kaew. It would be a wearying trip, but yes, Ladda nodded shyly, before turriing her face into her friend's shoulder, she couldn't wait to see her family at the end of the line. The girls came to the city, they said, because their families need the ‘money. Their wages were only about $24 a month — a little more than seven cents per hour for working 74- hour weeks — but one girl said she managed to send half of it home. Prowling for hires The outbound trains were filled with youngsters like Ladda last Chi- nese New Year. The rest of the year. especially during the dry season, when northeastern families become desperate for even meager earnings, children travel inbound to jobs that sap their strength for pennies an hour. The Hua Lampong train station is often the interchange that gets therm from the farm to the factory. 3 Ae outbound trains were filled with youngsters like Ladda last Chinese New Year. The rest of the year, especially during the dry season, when north- eastern families become desperate for even mea- ger earnings, Children travel inbound to jobs that sap their strength for pennies an hour. The Hua Lampong train station is often the in- terchange that gets them JSrom the farm to the Jactory. That is when it becomes the gate- way to exploitation.

These agents prow! the piatform when the dawn train pulls in from the northeast. “Fisherwomen” are kind to the new arrivals, offering to help them find work. Too often, they find them jobs with 15-hour work days. They and Bangkok employers know the children will be cheap hires. The brokers may be independent agents. But, more likely, they repre- sent one of the dozen joh apencies which line grimy nearh, str Newspapers here periodically re- port stories such as the rescue by po- lice last year of 18 girls working ina textile factory. The girls, most aged 12 to 14, said they worked 15 hours a day for food scraps and a few cents pay, and were locked in a room to sleep. The owner, who was arrested on charges of child slavery and false im- prisonment, told police he got most of the children from a job agency near the Hua Lampong station. 6 a.m. to midnight A year earlier, 64 children aged 13 to 15 were rescued from a mosquito net factory where they had labored from 6 a.m. to midnight every day. The train station agencies were re- ported to have paid the nts $80 to $160 for each child, which commit- ted the children to a year's work in the factory. The few job agency bosses who agreed to talk to reporters ali claimed they place only young people 16 or older in factories, in compliance with Thai law. Thongma Sonboonom, wife of the head of Swai Job Agency, said her biggest problems are with the girls she places, not the employers. “A lot of times giris don't keep their con- tracts,” she complained, so the agen- cy must replace them at no charge to the employer. She said her agents do find young workers among the migrants at the train station, which is just around the corner from her second-story office at the top of a filthy. unlit stairway. Her agency was cited in a human rights newsletter as placing a 10- year-old girl in a factory, where she vorked for seven months. Then she became a domestic servant and was raped by her boss. Asked about her age policies, Thongma said: “I never place anyone Dayton Daily News - June 23, 1987 >  in a factory whois under 16.\" Sexual advances She does send younger children tc domestic work, Thongma said, ther volunteered that employers some times make sexual advances towarc the girls. She maintained the bosse: never do anything too serious. “Nobody I’ve ever sent has eve been raped,” she said. The Center of Concern for Chil Labor in Bangkok has found that in dependent brokers make $11 to $1! for each child they bring from rura villages to a Bangkok job placemen agency. Brokers who work directh for an agency payroll get half the ser vice charge the agency collects fo placing a child.

RICK McKAY/COX WASHINGTON BUREAU Chupeta, 10, in ‘bed’ — a park bench; his country, Brazii, has 7 million homeless children Street kids are wily fighters in savage ‘war’ By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE SAO PAULO, Brazil — Chu- Peta, 10, was on the lam. He ran like an unleashed fox across the tree-lined city plaza and out of sight, fleeing from the family he and his buddy had just robbed of a $30 watch. The exile was brief. Marcelo Veiera, known by the nickname Chupeta, and his young partner in crime were back to their pleza routine half an hour later, playing in the fountain and begging food and cigarettes while awaiting the next heist. They had just made $7 to split between thern. “I'm a street kid. I'm a thief,”’ Chupeta had told a reporter a few days earlier. “‘I smoke marijuana. STOLEN CHILDHOOD @ FOURTH OF SIX PARTS I smell glue. I'm tough.” He was being matter-of-fact. not boastful. Chupeta steals to live. He has no parents, no home. He does have a fence, an adult who sells what he steals. That is who made the most on the morn- ing’s watch robbery, roughly $10 or $15 in low-risk profit. Chupeta said most of the pro- ceeds of his thefts go for getting of survival Marcelo ‘Chupeta’ Veiera high on glue. He was asked what else he buys. SEE STREET KiDS/4 \f Street kids -. “I buy food. You know what my food is? Glue,” he said with a laugh. “I have lunch or dinner here or there. But if I don’t have any food, that's OK. I just sniff glue.” Chupeta’s fence is like other adults around the world who turn poor children into thieves, burglars or prostitutes because the authorities neither stop them nor find the children a bet- fer way to live. In cities such as Sao Paulo, in fact, some . police seem to vie with criminals to make the ‘most off street children. “If a boy doesn’t have enough money to give a cop, he may beat him,” said Gerlene Veras, counselor at a shelter for street children. With » the proper payoff, she said, a kid can keep out of the reformatory. Or he can keep his space on the park bench for another night. Analto Jose Galvao, who works with juve- ~ niles released from the reformatory, said chil- dren also get squeezed by crooks. “Sometimes adults force the child to do it,” he said. ‘They put a knife to the boy’s ribs and threaten to kill him if he doesn’t steal.” Meal might be enough , Few children require such extreme persua- __ Sion. A meal might be sufficient. Adult crimi- ., Mal gangs have good reason to draft child ac- complices. They are quick and wily, desired _ attributes for street theft and house burgiar- _ des. They are attractive also for high-risk jobs _ such as drug smuggling because they cannot be sent to prison. Until age 18, the worst they face is a few months in the reformatory. , Chupeta is one of 7 million Brazilian chil- . dren who are considered abandoned, estimates . by government officials show. The majority of them live, literally, on the streets. Plying the streets beside them are other poor children who are not homeless but are in search of money for family survival. _,. The World Health Organization says 80 mil- _ lion street children exist around the world. . They mass in cities as diverse as Istanbul, Ma- __ mila and Mexico City. . In some cities they are well-organized, such as the children who pose as beggars in Italy . and France, then pick the pockets of unwary tourists. These thieves are trained and run by adult criminals, who may have kidnapped them or bought them from their parents in _ Yugoslavia. The lives of street children differ little from one country to the next. They are, like Chu- peta, tough. They also are destitute, detached _ and exploited. “The street is their space. The first week it is a novelty, but after that it’s a war,” said Sister Maria do Rosario, who heads Pastorale do Menor, a conglomerate of projects for treet children in Sa The cycle begins when a farm family moves to the city in search of work, but lacking the necessary skills and unprepared for the high cost of urban life. “Physically, the transition takes only two weeks. Culturally, it is a transition of 200 years,” said Sister Rosario. “What happens is the women get jobs as maids and the men are unemployed. Either they drink and become al- coholics at home, or they just leave the family behind.” Everyone must contribute to the family pot. Children are sent out to the streets. Chupeta said his family came to Sao Paulo from the town of Rio Claro in the neighboring state of Minas Gerais when he was a baby. Somewhere along the way, he lost both parents. “Some guy shot my father. My mother died of a heart attack,\" he said. He has been on the streets for years. Street worker Maria Dos Santos, who has known Chupeta a year, has seen no sign of a family or a home. Chupeta himself said the park bench is his typical bed and that home is the plaza of foun- tains and trees and broad walk ways sprawling around the main downtown church, the Ca- thedral of the Assumption. The busy plaza serves equally well for beg- ging or for stealing. Tourists here invariably visit the church and park-like surroundings and so do thousands of locals a day. The plaza is a magnet for poor children with y nothing to do during the day and for a smaller, ever-changing troupe of habitues, like Chu- peta, who have nowhere to go at night. Boys like this do not always begin their street time by stealing, but rather by begging or cleaning windshields or selling candy or fruit. Good intentions “He has good intentions in the beginning, to do these little odd jobs,” said Gildo Datre, chief investigator in Sao Paulo’s downtown police precinct. “Usually these indigent boys are guided by the intrujoes. They introduce the boys to crime.” The Portuguese word intrujoes, which translates as “intruders” or “deceivers,” com- monly is used here to describe adults or older teenagers who run small, informal syndicates of child thieves, burglars or prostitutes. They lead the children into crime, sell the fruits of their work and pay them a fraction of the take. “These guys are the receivers,” Datre ex- plained. ‘They stay on the side streets or are on the plaza selling fruit or clothes. When a boy steals a watch, he runs to one of the intru- joes and quickly throws it on his stand to get rid of it.” Chupeta, who ran from the plaza crime scene that day with speed unexpected for his spindly frame, said he gets a flat rate of $7 for each watch he steals. “I get what I should,” he said, expressing no dissatisfaction with the fence system. He said he thinks the watches resell on the black mar- ket for only about $14. Datre said they are re- sold for $20 to $300, depending on the quality. At first, Chupeta wouldn't talk about who sells his hot goods, which include radios, cal- culators and gold chains — claiming in one conversation that he is an independent operator. Later, he opened up a bit. “Mother India is behind me. I give her some stuff. She resells it,” he said, refusing, howev- er, to talk more about “Mother India.” Finding a fence in the human stew that melds at the plaza isn't difficult. The network of kids is surrounded by companion networks of prostitutes, vendors and itinerant minstrels. Yet another window on the criminal world, for those who want such an entry, are the men who walk the main city squares with signs on sticks advertising ouro. It means “gold,” and they aren't selling, they're buying. More exactly, they are agents who will lead a seller down nearby alleys to an unmarked pawn shop, where deals are made. “I know about this problem,” said Alda Marco Antonio, the newly named secretary for minors in Sao Paulo state. “When the boy gets the necklace, he chews it immediately to see if it's gold,” she said, speaking of boys who snatch chains. “Then he goes to the guy with the placard and sells it. But he gets very little for that.” Layers of intermediaries may separate the young thieves and the buyer. Sometimes, said one worker at Pastorale do Menor, the pawn broker himself may urge children to steal for him, promising a big return, but paying as little as $2 for a gold chain. The numbers of minors sent to the Sao Pau- lo reformatory as lawbreakers have more than tripled between 1975 and 1985. The institution does not even admit first offenders under the age of 14. Nazih Meserani, president of FEBEM, the government foundation responsible for both abandoned and delinquent children, said: “Ten years ago we saw more attempted crimes. Now more of the crimes are successful. We also are seeing more repeaters. And the age group of those committing crimes is going down.” Dayton Daily News June 24, 1987 (Continued) > \f When kids like Chupeta and Kuiel and Anna e Street kids Luisa grasp for a life preserver here, most often it is a can of glue.

Although the north has been a disfavored stepchild in Thailand, the women there traditionally are held to be the most beautiful in the country. The combination makes them beacons for exploitation. Pen and Joy The cases of two girls found at Baan 150 in Pattaya, about 75 miles south of Bangkok, il- lustrate how the system works. Pen became an unwilling hooker at age 13. An agent came to her village last year and told the families about jobs for their daughters in the cities. Her debt-ridden peasant father grasped at the chance for cash and climbed on the bus with the agent and Pen. He left her at ‘he house in the honky-tonk beach resort of Pattaya in return for the local equivalent of $240. Pen spent three-and-a-half months servic- ing Baan 150’s tourist clients — mostly men from Arab countries and Asian neighbors, with a smattering of Europeans and a few Americans. Then the debt was declared paid off and Pen returned home. But not for long. “My father said, ‘You have already sold yourself. Don’t embarrass us by being here. Go back.’ \"’ And so, she said, he sold her services to the same house in Pattaya again, this time for $400. Although Pen was let out of Baan 150 to spend nights with customers at hotels and beach houses, she said she was afraid to flee and didn’t know where to go. She finally got out with the help of a cus- tomer, an Arab man who asked about her sad- ness and found her story too compelling to ignore. He brought her to Bangkok and turned her over to a private children’s welfare group. Not all the girls are coerced into lives of prostitution, at least not physically coerced. Khomnoi “Joy” Yajai, 16, was found among the crew of prostitutes at Baan 150 by a Cox photo-journalist, who went there to photo- graph the interior of the place and to pay to get out a girl who might be interviewed. Joy agreed to be interviewed about herself and life at Baan 150. Joy's story was different. She, too, came from a poor family in a northern village, but voluntarily entered the sex business when she was 15 to help her relatives. “I sold my virginity, at Sattahip,” she said, referring to the coastal town with a Thai naval base. Joy got $200 upon arrival, which she said she immediately sent home to her father. She said her bosses never explained the pay sys- tem at that brothel, but when she asked the management to settle her account five months later, she was $80 ahead. She took the money and went home. $240 loan, 100 men A month later, Joy met a woman agent from Pattaya, who recruited four girls from her vil- lage to work at Baan 150. Joy was one of them. “When we arrived, the agent was paid 10,000 baht ($400)” for the four girls, Joy said. Joy calculates she has sent her father at least $800 from loans she took at Sattahip and at Baan 150, then worked off. The management of Baan 150 made an esti- mated return of at least 12-to-1 from Pen and more than 2-to-1 from Joy, who kept close watch on the books. Pen arrived as a virgin. Her childlike, inno- cent looks brought higher-than-normal fees. Pen said she usually was sold for $60 a night. She worked for three-and-a-half months on her first stint. She estimated she went to bed with nearly 100 men before the original $240 loan to her father was declared repaid. Even if she had slept with only 50 men, Baan 150 would, at that rate, have made $3,000 from its original $240 loan to Pen’s father. Pen, who personally received only tips giv- en at the whim of customers, said she thinks the management often failed to credit her debt account. That is why, she says, it took her so long to work off the debt. Joy, by contrast, kept account of her loans and made sure she was credited for all her work. Apparently because she was older, the boss decided he could only charge $20 for each all- night session. Of that amount, Joy said, $6 was credited to her account and the house kept $14. Joy took loans totalling $680 over six months at Baan 150, which means she made an average of $113 a month for her work, and the house made $264. RICK McKAY/COX WASHINGTON BUREAU as customers peruse them At least 50 girls were used by Baan 150, the two girls said. If the 50 worked as much as Joy — and watched their accounts more closely than Pen — the math suggests the house should gross nearly $160,000 a year. The girls were fed two meals a day and given floor mats for sleeping. But they had to buy their own clothes, makeup and birth-con- trol pills from tips, as well as pay for medical checkups. So who got the profits? Honored family Files in Pattaya City Hall show that Arkhom Thephasadin Na Ayudhya of Bangkok had reg- istered the house number known as Baan 150 in 1980. The title Na Ayudhya is an honor granted to a family by Thailand’s royalty. Arkhom was described by a Thai criminal investigator as a 61-year-old businessman who runs a string of small shops in Bangkok and who is known as “‘a very charitably mind- ed person” involved in the Red Cross. In a Bangkok interview, Arkhom acknowl- edged he still owned the house called Baan 150 and that a man named Sayan manages it. Told that there were young girls working at the house, Arkhom asked a reporter, “How many girls are there there?” “About 50. They are prostitutes,” porter replied. Arkhom, not disputing that prostitution went on at Baan 150, asked, “All very young?” The reporter said, ‘Some young. Some not.” Arkhom said he would talk to Sayan about the young girls there, and thanked a reporter for his concern. Col. Sornsee of the Thai police said there isn't much that can be done about child prosti- tution, nor about the people who profit from it. “In 99 percent of the cases, the parent sold the re- \fthe children,” he said. “If it is like this, who will make the complaint to police?” The girls themselves seldom will testify against their bosses, and almost never against their parents, he said. They are silenced by the strong bond of family loyalty. The Children’s Rights Protection Center in Bangkok, where Pen was first taken upon es- caping from Baan 150, confronts the same problem of girls refusing to make complaints. The center’s director said in Pen’s case, for example, he had no doubts about her story, but would take no further action once she was safely placed. “Her conditions were not so bad. She had some freedom. Some can't ever see any sun- light. They never go outside,” said the direc- tor, named only Sanphasit. “Even in the bad brothels, where they keep the girls inside day and night, I cannot do anything. So I can’t act against this one.” Only in the worst cases of coercion will Sanphasit try to get police action, he said, and usuaily that is limited to freeing the youngest girls. His group rescued 19 girls from brothels in the last half of 1986, the youngest of whom was 12. The previous year, they freed an 11- year-old. But Sanphasit said he seldom can move against the owner or get a place shut down. “Most of the police are sympathetic to brothel owners,\" Sanphasit said, charging bribes are passed to police throughout Thailand. “We know it happens,” said Col. Sornsee, when asked about police bribes. He said the penalties are severe — up to life imprisonment Prostitution profits paying for new house By Marcia Kunstetl COK NEWS SERVICE AE KHAO TOM, Thailand — The new wooden house on stilts back from the dirt road is a tribute to the 16-year-old gir! — but that harsh penalties have not stopped police corruption anywhere in the world. In addition to worrying about sadistic men who slap them around, young girls such as Joy and Pen must worry about venereal disease and now about a client bringing AIDS to their country. “This type of disease doesn’t affect Thai people, does it?” Joy asked an interviewer. She admitted knowing only a little about AIDS, from reading the newspapers. Management at Baan 150 never talks to the girls about those things. It worries more that the girls won't please the customers. If a cus- tomer does complain, both girls said, the pros- titutes may be fined $20 by the house. Degrading system In one extra bit of titillation for the clien- tele, Baan 150 uses a kind of Pavlovian system to gather the youthful troops for inspection by prospective customers. The madam rings a loud bell, and the girls in common street clothes crawl on hands and knees into the viewing room through a waist-high door Then they sit on stair-stepped benches, a num- ber pinned to their chests so the customer can identify his choice. “I am used to it,\"’ Joy said with a sigh. “It's automatic. No matter what I'm doing — I may be eating or sleeping — if I hear that bell, I have to drop everything and go.” But, she was asked, do you ever not want to go? “Oh, yes. Very often,\" she replied. ““Almost every day I don’t want to go in there.” sitting RICK McKAY/COX WASHINGTON BUREAU Joy, 16, at Baan (House) 150; ‘I sold my virginity at Sattahip,’ a naval town whose snapshots are tacked on the wall inside “This is not completely built yet.

These days, the youngest “child laborer’ who lives at the hostel is 17. It is a testimonial to how far South Korea’s drive for mass education has gone in one de- cade toward wiping out the shame of child exploita- tion in the workplace. “Ten years ago, the child laborers were 12 to 13 years old.”* said the Rev. Cho Seung Hyuk. “Now the child laborer we are talking about may be 18 to 20.\"\" Cho, who heads the workers hostel, is a Korean labor rights activist who has been arrested 15 times for his labor activities. Education statistics tell the same story. Ninety per- cent of Korean children now go to school until they are 16 — a higher ratio than in Great Britain or Sweden.

Another critical factor is that Kenya has managed to field a more aggressive and honest labor-inspection corps than India, Thailand, Morocco and much of the rest of the Third World. “You won't find a Kenyan child in a fac- tory,” said child advocate Philista Onyango. “The labor inspectors are very straight.” South Korea and Kenya — separated by wealth, continents and cultures — provide two avenues of hope that child labor is not » some natural Darwinian stage that all coun- tries must endure for a few centuries before they can hope to take off as newly industrial- - ized countries. They show it is possible to combat the worst forms of child exploitation without waiting for poverty to wither away. . Few below 16 Under Korean law, the labor ministry theo- retically can permit 13-year-olds to work, but in practice few Koreans enter the work force ; Sy they finish compulsory schooling at age 16. In Kenya, the child-labor law prohibits chil- -dren working below the age of 16 in industry , and the maritime trade. There remains a hidden minority of school , dropouts in both countries who work on the fringes of the economy beyond the reach of factory inspectors. The pay and working con- _ ditions for working dropouts are just as odious as in a Bangkok purse factory. In Seoul, waiter Chang June Keun, 13, said he earned $3.90 a month — or one cent an -jhour — for working 15 hours a day, seven “days a week. In Nairobi, Elizabeth, a 10-year- _old housemaid, said she earned $20 a month — or 5 cents an hour — for working 13 hours a _ day, seven days a week. But the millions of other Korean and Ke- nyan children who do sit in classrooms send the rest of the world a message: that the best way to attack child labor over several decades “is to dry up the supply of little ones who can be . * pressed into working. ’ Sweatshops dry up ‘ Mass education is what took children out of the textile mills in Britain and the United ' States a century ago, and it is is keeping most of them out of sweatshops in South Korea and Kenya today. Research by the World Bank has found stark differences in what countries with the ’ same level of national income can achieve in '- educating their populations, even when they devote the same proportions of their wealth to school budgets. ~ Some educational systems, it turns out, are ' much more efficient than others in spreading literacy. Witness the differences between Morocco and Jordan, two Arab countries with roughly similar economic profiles, both ruled by mon- archies, neither enriched by oil. Morocco’s educational system has been . geared for three decades to educating an elite. ' The result is that only 70 percent of school-age . boys and 46 percent of school-age girls go to primary schools, according to United Nations Statistics. Korea, Kenya King Hussein of Jordan set out on another path, that of delivering mass education to his desert kingdom swollen by Palestinian refu- gees from what is now Israel and the West Bank, As a consequence, 91 percent of Jorda- nian boys and 88 percent of Jordanian girls are enrolled in primary schools. It is no surprise that Morocco’s little girls work in factories and Jordan's little girls do not. The surprise is that Morocco spends a high- er fraction of its gross national product on education than Jordan, partly to pay for Mo- __Tocco’s expensive universities and partly to keep up the tradition of tying Moroccan pub- lic-school teachers’ pay to French salary scales. Honesty pays off In the long run, education can reduce the supply of factory children. But the law of sup- ply and demand also provides another solution for the short run: Honest enforcement of fac- tory laws can dampen some of the demand for child labor. Children work in sweatshops because em- ployers look for the cheapest, most trouble- free workers. If enforcement of child labor and overtime laws already on the books makes it bothersome to hire children, employers will have more incentive to hire adults. The benefits of labor-law enforcement can be magnified if the inspectors begin by polic- ing industries that hire children in hazardous jobs or under the age of 12. Some families will suffer from loss of chil- dren's income, but other families should come out ahead. “If small children work, this definitely cuts the number of jobs available for adults,” said Indian social reformer Swami Agnivesh. “A child can work for much less than an adult wage, for longer hours and with very little resistance against exploitation.” In India alone, 15 million adult jobs would be created if child labor could be ended, Indian legal scholar Luqmanul Haq has estimated. What, if anything, can the West do to help push this transformation? The answer from the gut is to stop buying products of child labor. But humanitarian trade boycotts have sel- dom worked, even when the intended benefi- ciaries were articulate and neatly concentrat- ed in one country like South African blacks or Soviet Jews. Moreover, it is hard to argue that child labor in foreign countries is putting thousands of Americans out of work. Betamax VCRs from Japan, Hyundai cars from South Korea and other big-ticket contributors to the U.S. trade deficit are made by adults and robots, not children. The U.S. government faces another obstacle in contemplating whether to apply any pres- sure to help working children abroad: Most countries where child labor is prevaient — including Morocco, the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, India, Egypt, ates and Pakistan — are Wages of youth Eliza Luathati, 15 sewing machine operator War Win's Style shirt factory Taytay, Philippines 30-110 hours a week 13¢ hr.

Human-rights issue One answer is to elevate the child labor issue into a first-rank human-rights issue, on a par with torture of prisoners in South Ameri- - jails or denial of emigration to Soviet ews. Congress, pushed by the AFL-CIO and led by Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, has moved in that direction over the last three years as a byproduct of a broader campaign to spotlight harsh labor conditions abroad. In 1984, Pease got Congress to insert “workers rights” language in a trade bill re- newing the Generalized System of Prefer- ences, which allows some goods from 114 de- veloping countries to enter the United States without customs duties. Among the “workers rights” the Pease amendment requires is that countries must have some minimum age for the employment of children to qualify for duty-free privileges, The Pease child-labor language sets forth a human-rights issue, but there is little prospect that it could actually get a country’s trade privileges cut off. It merely calls on countries to enact some minimum age law, without specifying what age is acceptable. Almost ev- ery country in the world already has done this, some of them decades ago. Even Morocco, which fails to enforce its own law prohibiting children under 12 from working, is not barred from receiving duty- free privileges in the United States. In fact, the White House trade office now is negotiating a “handicraft agreement” with Morocco under which hand-made carpets — such as those made in factories by girls as young as 4 — are due to be added to the list of duty-free com- modities later this year. A more important trade bill now before the Senate contains a new Pease amendment which would let U.S. companies file “unfair trade practice” cases before the U.S. Interna- tional Trade Commission if they believe their businesses are harmed by competition from foreign countries which don't observe speci- tied “workers rights.” ‘COX NEWS SEI This amendment’s child-labor section also would have no more practical importance. It, too, calls only for countries to have a mini- mum age law, without defining what age is acceptable. Protection, not protectionism Even so, business groups and the Reagan administration have fought all the worker rights standards in the Pease amendments, and most U.S. diplomats abroad don’t go out of their way to apply the language already on the One U.S. diplomat in Thailand was passion- ate on the subject. “It's just protectionism in disguise,” he said. “It's a way of avoiding the free market system in wages.” Clearly, the key to widening the band of consensus on overseas child labor abuses is to extricate the issue from the AFL-CIO’s more ambitious agenda of trying to cushion Ameri- can workers from unfair foreign competition. If exploitation on the job can be treated as an issue of children’s protection instead of trade protectionism, then it is not hard to find ways to apply leverage: @ Western department stores and multina- tionals could adopt a set of principles aimed at discouraging child labor, in the same way U.S. made in violation of local child-labor laws. @ The US. Congress could insist on-accu- rate descriptions of child labor in foreign countries in the human-rights reports it al- ready requires annually from the State Department The human-rights report does cover each country's labor conditions, but the coverage tends to be thin and inaccurate.

CONTINUED FROM/1 Korea, Kenya [aah We = formed Congress this year when it reported that child labor abuses in Thailand “are con- fined to” small manufacturing enterprises pro- ducing “for the local market.” The U.S. embassy in Bangkok, which draft- ed the statement, had reason to know this was wrong. The embassy’s files contained a 1985 report to the Thai government by the United Nations’ International Labor Organization which said explicitly that child labor had grown in Thai- land as a direct result of the expansion of ex- ports. The human-rights report cited the ILO document to make a different point but ig- nored the description of children working in export-oriented factories. The skimpiness of the labor sections con- trasts with the State Department's franker, more effective reporting on political prisoners, treatment of refugees and press liberties. In some countries, just the prospect of a critical report has been enough of an incentive for leaders to lighten repression. @ Western governments could signal:their disapproval of child exploitation whenever they get the chance. This doesn’t always happen. Last October, for instance, Nancy Adams, the head of the Middle East branch of the White House trade office, held a two-hour seminar for businessmen in Fez, a center of See ee ee a Te Moroccan carpet making, on how carpets and other Moroccan handicrafts could be exported to the United States duty-free. Adams did not, she confirmed later, mention the U.S. legal requirement that countries have a minimum age for work in order to qualify for duty-free trade. She said the U.S. embassy in Morocco had not briefed her on widespread child labor in Fez carpet factories. The Navy also could send more signals. It could, for instance, declare off-limits to sailors on shore leave certain hangouts — suchas the Baan 150 house of prostitution in Thailand and the Firehouse girlie bar in the Philippines — which have been shown to hire 13-year-old girls. ‘ @ Above all, UNICEF, the world agency de- voted to protecting children’s rights, could put the issue of exploited working childrem back on the world’s agenda. , UNICEF posters in the 1970s used to call attention to children working in factories. But in the last five years UNICEF has turned its attention almost exclusively to less controver- sial issues, such as spreading vaccines and oral rehydration therapy against diarrhea. With its size and prestige, UNICEF is-in a position to apply leverage to help eliminate well-documented outrages such as open child prostitution or 7-year-olds weaving in carpet factories. Why not UNICEF? Kenyan sociologist Onyango says, “The In- ternational Monetary Fund does it, the World Bank does it, why not UNICEF? If I could influence a situation, I would try to do it. I would tell Morocco to clean up its act (in the carpet factories) or else. We should not treat these people gently.” UNICEF executive director James P. Grant disagrees. He prefers to direct UNICEF’Ss ef- forts toward less controversial health projects that reach more children. “Where you have to really bring about structural change, where people will fight you in the process, it is obviously going to take much more effort than in those areas where you can bring tremendous progress to children where there is relatively little outright opposi- tion,” Grant said.

Ofte: they are runaways who are easy targets for pimp! or pushers | One area still controversial is work that keeps children on the streets to sell candy or kitchen wares or to deliver newspapers, These jobs often are regulated by less-stringent state laws, The em- ploying companies are too small to come under fed eral law or, as in the case of newspapers, have been exempted, Managers of sales networks often do violate even the most permissive state laws, using children who are too young or keeping them out too late at night, Legally-run operations still get criticized for taking young children to strange neighborhoods to knock on strange doors with no adult protection nearby, In the case of newspaper delivery, old questions of children’s exposure to crime and traffic may be more urgent in today’s high-crime, high-speed society, A survey of newspaper carriers of California's San Jose Mercury News found one-third of them had experienced at least one “scary” situation on the job. Two newsboys from the Des Moines Regis ter in Towa have disappeared since 1983, and are presumed kidnapped, That problem is withering for other reasons, however, as newspaper circulation departments In- creasingly turn to more reliable and available adult carriers and as coln boxes gain popularity. Whatever the job, work conditions in the United States rarely degenerate to the scandalous dangers, low pay and endless hours of work suffered by children in places such as India and Thailand, But it Wasn't 80 long ago that they were as bad It's the law Improvements in the United States have been Critical just in the last 80 years, since the days when children labored in Pennsylvania coal mines and glass-manufacturing plants across the country, It has been only 49 years since the Fair Labor Stan- dards Act set a national minimum work age of 16 for normal work and 18 for dangerous jobs covered by federal law The law says teen-agers 14 and 15 may work for limited hours in various jobs, but not in manufactur: Ing, mining and most processing work, Younger children may deliver newspapers, perform as actors and work In non-hazardous jobs In their parents’ husinesers Federal laws cover non-farm employers in each state who do more than $362,500 in business a year or who are involved in interstate commerce. They also cover farms with an employee work force large enough to require federal minimum wage pay. State laws regulate other employers, and in about half the states are stronger than the federal laws, While many occupations have been declared off- limits for children, one new job has appeared for youngsters in recent years. Fast-food restaurants hire teen-agers in droves, Reverse trend It is the burger bins and chicken shacks of the country that helped spawn efforts to reverse the long trend of giving more and more protection to young workers, So far, moves to set a lower minimum wage for teen-agers and to lengthen the hours they may work have failed, A 1982 proposal by the Reagan administration to extend work hours for 14- and 15-year-olds drew quick, wide opposition, Within days after the De- partment of Labor presented its plan to Congress, resolutions were filed in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to prohibit it from taking effect. “That was when everyone was talking about Reaganomics,” said Gordon Claugherty, the depart- ment's director of farm and child labor programs, “They accused us of practicing ‘Faginomics,’” The reference was to Fagin, the oily old crook in Charles Dickens’ novel Ol/ver Twist who made money by training pauper boys in crime, The department dropped its proposal. Sometimes the courts also have acted in chil- dren's behalf. Federal law, for example, empowers the Labor Department to grant waivers for children under 12 to be hired for farm work. But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington ruled the depart- ment cannot issue waivers unless it shows there is no danger to children from pesticides, “We don’t know the effect of chemicals and pes- ticides, especially on young kids,” Claugherty said, “Unless the grower shows he doesn't use any chem- icals or can prove there is zero risk, we won't grant a waiver.” There are no waivers in effect now.

In the fields That does not mean there are no small children in the fields, Young Fermin in McAllen is an example. His mother said a crew leader had warned her that morning not to bring her children again, but that is not always what happens, Pressures often bear on migrant farm workers from landowners or crew leaders who want fields stripped quickly. In Homestead, Fla., for instance, social workers tell of one crew leader who will give housing only to people with at least six workers in the family, If there are enough children, they can take turns going to school. The great majority of farmworker children do not labor fulltime during the school year. But sum- mer work often begins for them In April or May and sneaks on into September or October. “They come late Into the system and leave early,\" sald Wendell Rollason, director of the Redlands Christian Migrant Association in Florida, “The first time the kids hit school may be in November,” Most are Hispanics whose families have retained cultural traditions and speak Spanish as their first or only language, which also contributes to school dropout rates among Hispanics as high as 45 per: cent in Texas. Pedro Gomez, 17, who lives near McAllen, is one of the boys who quit school because his family was desperate for money. His father had léft home and his mother could not earn enough In farm work to keep up with the needs of four children, Gomez dropped out when he was 15, before he even entered high school. “They tried to keep me in school, but I told them Wwe needed the money,” he said, At least the work of her older children may save the future of her youngest. Gomez sald with some pride that her year-old daughter Maribel has bares ly worked at all, \f"

        "ocr_text": "Exposing horrors of child labor vindicates much-maligned press The New York Times TLANTA — Those who have been lamenting the replacement of quality reporting by keyhole journalism will have to wait a little longer, thanks to two exceptional series published recently in the Cox newspapers and the Christian Science Coretta Monitor. Cox’s “Stolen Scott King Childhood” (June 21-26) and the Monitor's “Children in Darkness” (June 30 to July 8) together form an unprecedented and comprehensive exposé of the exploitation of children around the world. They recall the best work of the muckraking journalists who sparked the movement for labor and social reforms in the early decades of the 20th century. The Cox series, which merits Pulitzer Prizes for both writing and photography, is probably the more exhaustively researched of the two. Authors Marsha Kunstel and Joseph Albright logged some 65,000 miles for “Stolen Childhood,” interviewing more than 200 people in 11 nations and five continents. They found a shocking pattern of abuse and exploitation. They met ragged, barefoot Indian children under the age of 12 who, with no protective gear, toted molten glass in dark, grimy factories for less than $1 per day. In Morocco, the Cox team visited 11 carpet mills, which employed an estimated 350 rug-knotters under the age of 12. Most of them earn less than 25 cents an hour; some ““apprentices” work as long as a year without any Pay. In a toy factory in Thailand, they found young girls working with toxic plastics for 6 cents per hour 90 hours each week. The children in these sweatshops invariably work long hours with few, if any, days off; many even sleep in the factories. They are often neglected and abused and their employers are seldom held accountable because of corruption and lax enforcement. Rick McKay, the Cox Washington bureau's Photographer, took heart-wrenching pictures of children being ruthlessly exploited. He shows us a 3-year-old Indian girl breaking rocks alongside her mother in a quarry near New Delhi. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, he photographed exhausted, homeless orphans employed by organized crime sleeping on sidewalks in broad daylight as passersby tread around them. He depicts a group of child prostitutes on display in a floodlit room in Pattaya, Thailand. The Monitor series, eloquently written by Sara Terry and Kristin Helmore and photographed by Melanie Stetson Freeman, covers some of the same ground as “Stolen Childhood.”’ The Monitor team also addressed the issue of child conscription into the military, which is being practiced in at least 20 nations, including Iran, where young boys are being used as human mine sweepers in the war with Iraq. The Cox and Monitor teams point out that reforms in child-labor practices are obstructed by a variety of factors, such as the pervasive, demoralizing poverty that feeds corruption of child labor-law enforcement. Still, there is hope for the world’s 88 million child laborers in the form of non-profit and community action groups that are emerging. Such organizations as CHILDHOPE, based in Guatemala City, Child Relief and You (CRY) in Bombay, India, and London’s Anti-Slavery Society are educating the public, lobbying for reforms, mobilizing and training volunteers to run shelters and help exploited children. Governments in the industrial nations could help address the growing crisis of global child exploitation by increasing foreign assistance for children’s shelters or linking forgiveness of international debt to the reduction of military spending in impoverished nations. Albright and Kunstel have suggested that multinational corporations adopt an ethics code, which would discourage purchase of goods illegally manufactured by children. Neera Burra, an Indian sociologist and expert on child labor, has suggested that children be paid to go to school, an idea that may be economically feasible given the low hourly wages paid to child laborers in many countries. Churches and religious institutions, however, will have to play a much more assertive role in addressing the moral weaknesses of society that lie at the base of the exploitation of children.

        "ocr_text": "Articles on abuse of child labor spur change by Corning By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution Correspondents WASHINGTON — Corning Glass Works Inc. has announced that its affiliated company in India is ending all glassware purchases in Firozabad, India, because of recent disclo- sures in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other Cox Newspapers of illegal child labor in antiquated glass factories there. “Corning was surprised and is genuinely disturbed by the disclosure that a company with which it is associated would be even in- directly involved with the employment of un- derage children,” John Loose, the Corning vice president in charge of Asian operations, said in a phone interview last week from company headquarters in Corning, N.Y. Corning owns 39 percent of Borosil Glass Works Ltd., an Indian company that makes precision laboratory glass in a modern Bom- bay factory. In an obscure sideline business, Borosil also has purchased and exported small lots of glassware from West Glass, one of the Firo- zabad factories where reporters found young boys working with molten glass. Borosil’s break with India’s major center of glass manufacturing is expected to cause a —— $e) eee Borosil’s break with India's major center of glass manufacturing is expected to cause a stir within that country’s glass industry, be- cause Borosil and Corning are respected in India as industry pacesetters. stir within that country’s glass industry, be- cause Borosil and Corning are respected in India as industry pacesetters. But Borosil was never a major glass pur- chaser, Its ban on orders is not likely to put economic pressure on Firozabad, a city of 2.3 million where an estimated 200,000 people work at glass-related jobs, Borosil’s action was made public last week by Loose, Corning’s representative on the Borosil board of directors, after he had conducted a two-month investigation touched off by the Cox article, one of a series on working conditions of children around the world, Loose released an Aug. 7 letter from Bor- osil’s chairman, J.C. Setna, declaring that Borosil's policy is to abide by the laws of In- dia and also “to expect the same behavior from our suppliers.” As for the glass manufacturers in Firoza- bad, the Setna letter said, “We will not do business with any of them directly and will make every effort to. be sure that we are not doing business with them indirectly.” Loose also disclosed that V.C. Nanavati, Borosil’'s chief executive officer and executive vice president, had been “reprimanded se- verely” by Setna for ordering the postdating of a document. It was a letter that Nanavati had requested from West Glass on July 3 de- scribing the commercial dealings between the two companies. In the postdated letter, West complained that Borosil had made no purchases since 1985 and also asserted that West gives jobs to needy boys 15 and older. (The legal age for Indian factory workers is 14.) The postdating came to light after Cor- ning’s public relations office sent a photocopy of the letter to Cox reporters in July as evi- dence that the article contained inaccurate figures on Borosil’s purchases of glass in Firozabad. When the original West Glass letter was examined at Corning headquarters July 28, reporters found erasure marks and signs of the insertion of a new date using a second typewriter. When this was pointed out to Loose, he said he would investigate. Loose said Nanavati has acknowledged that he solicited the letter from the propri- etor of West Glass on July 3, after an urgent request from Corning for answers to the Cox article. “I don't know if Borosil dictated the letter word for word, but I think they proba- bly came pretty close,” Loose said last week. The Corning vice president said Borosil will retain an Indian auditor to determine the extent of Borosil’s purchases from Firozabad glass manufacturers in the past five years. The issue arose in June when one article in the Cox Newspapers series “Stolen Child- hood” said Corning “makes small change for its stockholders from the labor of 11-year-old factory workers in India.” That article cited a range of estimates on how much business Borosil did with West Glass, based on Cox interviews in India and the United States. Borosil marketing manager Rajesh Vyas said Borosil annually exports about $250,000 in goods made by subcontractors, with “the bulk” coming from West Glass in Firozabad.

        "ocr_text": "House wants studies of child labor abroad By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives, reacting to disclosures by Cox Newspapers of child labor abuses in Third World countries, has passed leg- islation that would direct the State De- partment to make country-by-country reports to Congress on “child labor rights.” “We should not be forced to rely on hearsay evidence or press reports for our information,” said Rep. George Miller, D- Calif., one of the sponsors. “Whether young girls are weaving rugs in Morocco, ragged boys are handling molten glass in India, or peasant children are polishing gems in Thailand for days on end, we must know about it,” Miller said. “We must have a government mech- anism for regular analysis of child exploitation.” Miller, along with 101 other Democrats and three Republicans, had introduced a more far-reaching bill to ban the importa- tion of products made by children in vio- lation of “internationally recognized” workplace standards. With his bill stalled, Miller supported a less controversial provision calling for an- nual reports on child labor overseas. The compromise language was adopted unan- imously in a night session Thursday as an amendment to the annual foreign aid au- thorization bill. However, Senate aides said Tuesday there is little chance of Senate ac- tion on a parallel bill until next spring. With a Christmas recess due in a few days, the Senate was expected to avoid writing a new foreign aid bill by instead lumping foreign aid into a broader continu- ing resolution on spending. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, one of the chief proponents of the report- ing amendment, said it was only a partial answer. “There is no single easy solution to the problem of the global exploitation of children.” The examples of child labor abuses that Miller and Hall cited to their colleagues were taken from a series, “Stolen Childhood,” which appeared in the Austin American- Statesman and other Cox newspa- pers in June. One instance mentioned by Miller involved an 11-year-old girl in Morocco who was photographed while weaving rugs in a carpet. fac- tory that supplied handmade car- pets to Macy’s, the U.S. department store chain. Two months after the series ap- peared, G.G. Michelson, Macy’s senior vice president for external relations, declared in an interview that Macy’s did not intend to stop purchasing from the Moroccan fac- tory as long as the carpet met cus- tomers’ preferences. Michelson said it was up to the U.S. govern- ment, not Macy’s, to set policy on what products can and cannot be imported. Last week, reporters revisited the Macy’s store in Manhattan and found a display of about 50 hand- made Moroccan carpets on sale for prices of up to $1,500. One change was evident since the reporters had visited Macy’s rug department on four occasions prior to publication of the series: It was no longer possible to examine the labels on a carpet and trace whether it had been made in a fac- tory that employed children. - - Although the labels used to name Mocary SA — Morocco’s largest carpet manufacturer — as the Macy’s supplier, the newly de- signed labels omit the manufactur- er’s name. 5 The change in labeling apparent- ly does not, however, reflect a deci- sion to drop Mocary. Reached by telephone in Morocco on Tuesday, an official of Mocary SA told a re- porter “we continue to sell rugs to Macy’s.” Austin American-Statesman - December 16, 1987 \f"
