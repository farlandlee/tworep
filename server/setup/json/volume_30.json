As seen by train, the countryside, with no modern farm JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Cox Newspapers equipment, clashes with modern cities’ glass skyscrapers, Wal-Marts and migrant shantytowns. A report from China By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS he omnipresence of the Chinese people is even more striking than the numbers betray. Every bit of land exposed dur- ing our 1,482-mile train trip through China bore the footprint of humanity. Mile after mile of cities, villages and cultivated earth flashed past the windows, not once interrupted by untouched open space. It is the on-the-ground translation of a 1.24 billion-person population crammed into a land mass the size of the United States. This impression overpowered all else in our introduction to Chi- na, where we have been assigned to open a new Asia bureau for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other Cox newspapers. We started with a 32-hour train ride cutting north from Hong Kong through the nation’s heart- land to Beijing. During those 32 hours, 75,000 babies were born in China. Population alone will make China worth news coverage: More than one-fifth of all the peo- ple in the world comprise not only a potential Eldorado market but also a nuclear-armed, nation- alistic giant that will collide in unpredictable ways with Ameri- ca’s future. This potent force already is roiling as China presses toward modernization and deepening interaction with the rest of the world. China is strengthening its dominance in Asia as well, some- times to the benefit, sometimes at the expense, of its neighbors. As we watch the change, we especially will try to chronicle the efforts of Americans and of American enterprise to find a role compatible with the often polar reverse principles of this culture matured through 4,000 years of history. And we will try to understand how the Asians themselves — both leaders and ordinary people — are grappling with their transi- tions. Rush to the big city While the mountains and plains of western China are more sparsely settled by a variety of ethnic groups, this eastern half we bisected by train is what the historian John King Fairbank termed “China proper” — crowded home to the Han Chi- nese and the ruling elite. As early as 1272, the Italian explorer Marco Polo was said to be surprised at the modernity of China’s urban centers where he discovered paper money circulat- ing. As seen from our train car windows, the contrast between urban and peasant life yawns even larger today. In the Chinese countryside, trappings of mankind were strangely antiquated. Green fields, waterlogged plots and pink-flowered fruit trees of spring were tended — always — by hand and by hoe. at un eeh PT See ahd ae ate GREG BAKER / Associated Press The modern Chinese cities such as Beijing, where Western culture is flooding in, are a sharp contrast to the rural areas. We noticed not a single farm machine at work. On the few roads outside the cities, horse- or ox-drawn carts seldom were joined by anything with a motor. In the instant modern city of Shenzhen, the Special Economic Zone across the border from Hong Kong, the glass skyscrapers and Wal-Mart Supercenter gave way to a migrant shantytown, populated by peasants no doubt seeking a better life than that of the straw-hatted farmers we saw an hour into the countryside culti- vating paddies knee-deep in water. The rush to big cities is an unwelcome, nationwide phenome- non. The official Chinese news agency Xinhua recently reported the government's success in fight- ing back the huge “floating popu- lation” of migrants, at least in the capital city. It said 300,000 people not native to Beijing were forced to leave the city last year for lack of a legal employment certificate. ‘Changed for the better’ Our traveling companions on the train provided a microcosmic view of some other broad changes spawned by the reform move- ment defining a new China. In the dining car we shared a table with a woman and her 13- year-old daughter traveling in a Hong Kong Chinese tour group. At least two such groups were on our train. The woman, in her 40s, teaches English in primary school. She said her name is Mrs. Mak, giving her first name as the equivalent of “Shirley” in English. This was her first visit to “Peking,” she said, using the old pronunciation still favored by Cantonese- speaking Hong Kong Chinese. _ “T wanted to see where our Chinese people came from,” she said We asked if things have changed much in Hong Kong since the handover from British to Chinese rule last summer. “Not so much. A Westerner might say it has changed for the worse, but as a Chinese, I think it has changed for the better. There is no less freedom than under the She added that she is “just Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 16, 1998 >  JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Cox Newspapers Chinese laborers work on a rail line next to the tracks carrying the train that runs from Hong Kong to Beijing. Much of the labor in China is done without machinery. small potato,” implying the changes being protested by some don’t affect her. She was proud enough of Hong Kong’s return to the Chinese fold to begin lessons in Mandarin, China’s official lan- guage. Bringing success home From the numbers of Hong Kong Chinese on the train, it was evident she was not the only one in search of her roots. Another strain in the currents of today’s China we found in the person or ruuan Lang, one or the “overseas Chinese” who has done well enough in America to bring some wealth home. A chemist who in 1980 became a visiting scholar at Illinois Insti- tute of Technology, Lang eventu- ally started his own business in America. His food additive com- pany — it makes artificial sweetener — was successful enough for Lang to open a China branch in 1986, just as economic reform got underway. He has expanded into several locations around the country, employing relatives, friends and colleagues from school days. Lang lives outside Los Angele: and comes back periodically to visit and check on business. He likes the train. “T can get a feel for how the countryside has changed,” he said. The long ride also lets Lang talk to resident Chinese to learn what people are thinking and ho\\ they feel. Would he ever come back to live? “T think about it. We have so many friends and relatives here. This is our culture. But I worry about some things.” Crime and corruption are among his concerns. There are others. “The pollution is very bad,”’ hi added. “I was born in Beijing. I grew up there and went to schoo Twenty or 30 years ago, I could drink water from the tap. Today no one can drink the water. . . . You have to change your T-shirt twice a day.” Lang worries about the gap in wealth that capitalism is buildin, at the same time the old Communist-mandated services are shrinking. He cited one young train worker, a dining car server who told him he makes 500 Ren- minbi a month. That is a little over US$60 — not enough to get an apartment or to marry. Yet Lang and his family care- fully preserve their homeland ties. He said his 15-year-old son is anxious to finish school. “He wants to come back and help China.” Shattering disaffection One moment of excitement on our $127-per-ticket train trip came around 9 p.m., a couple of hours south of Beijing in Hebei Province. Passengers resting in their sleeping compartments were roused by a crash. The double-paned window of our car had exploded, bursting into a thousand pieces in the aisle. Our attendants said someone outside had hurled something, maybe a rock, at the window. The Chinese passengers shook their heads. It was a warning sign, they said, of disaffection with life in the countryside. ABOUT THE WRITERS Joseph Albright, 61, has been a journalist nearly 38 years. This month, he and his wife Marcia Kunstel opened the Asia Bureau for The Atlanta Journal- Constitution and other Cox news- papers in Beijing, China.

        "ocr_text": "Chinese activist gave in to exile as health failed Al By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — ‘Remaining in China and devoting myself to the advancement of Chinese society is my unshirkable duty,” China’s most famous dissident, Wang Dan, wrote in 1994. “I have no other choice.” But the last 18 months in the dank Jinzhou Prison in China’s north persuaded Wang to choose exile over martyrdom. His health apparently was too frail for him to hold out much longer. Almost every month since he was sentenced in October 1996 for “conspiring to subvert the government,” his family had spent $110 — more than an aver- age Chinese monthly wage — to buy train tickets to visit him in prison. His mother, Wang Lingyun, would return from the 20-hour round trip to Liaoning province with increasingly grim accounts of his condition. . First it was stomach, throat and back ailments. Then came troubles with his prostate. Final- ly, because of his recurring head- aches and failing eyesight, his mother wrote a letter to the U.N. Human Rights Commission demanding that her son be given a brain scan. When Chinese authorities released Wang on Sunday for medical treatment in the United States, they were ridding them- selves of the only dissident still in jail whose name rings a bell with many typical Chinese. Wang, who grew up in a Beijing academic family, burst onto the public consciousness by grabbing a megaphone and lead- ing demonstrations for democ- racy during the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989. He already was known as the organizer of an informal pro- democracy ‘“‘salon’’ on his cam- pus. But during the monthlong Tiananmen demonstrations, he risked the wrath of Communist authorities by founding a larger, more outspoken group, the Beijing Autonomous Students’ Federation. Wang, then 20, became the sub- ject of a nationwide manhunt. He was caught, arrested and impris- oned a few months after Chinese tanks crushed the uprising on June 4, 1989. He served 3% years. Then he was released as a goodwill ges- ture on the eve of a February 1994 visit to China by an inspec- tion team from the International Olympic Committee, which was reviewing China’s_ ultimately unsuccessful bid to host the 2000 Olympics. Freed at 24, Wang risked fur- ther trouble by blossoming into a prolific critic of Chinese curbs on free expression. ‘I have been liv- ing under 24-hour surveillance and am constantly followed, even when I traveled as a tourist to Mount Lu,” he wrote. Over the next 14 months, Chi- nese authorities counted 30 arti- cles allegedly written by Wang in Hong Kong, Taiwan and in the Western media. : Public security officials were particularly outraged when Wang wrote that the four “basic princi- ples” of the Chinese Constitution were “like a paper horse that falls at the first touch.” Another black mark in Wang’s official dossier was his article in a Hong Kong newspaper charging that China’s Communists were a “lost and confused party” led by a “lost and confused generation.” He was jailed for investigation in May 1995 and 17 months later was given a pro forma subversion trial. The prosecutor charged that his foreign writings amounted to a conspiracy to overthrow the Chinese government. Wang also was accused of accepting money to fund dissident activities from two American organizations, the Greater Los Angeles Front for a Democratic China and _ the Boston-based Fund for Democ- racy in China, to fund dissident activities. He was convicted under a stat- ute that carries a maximum pen- alty of death. He got 11 years. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 20, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Shrouded in dan gerous air, Beijing chokes on progress ‘Dirty’ coal puts Chinese capital on worst polluters list By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — The scrappy woman in the alleyway was fuming about the sulfurous haze penetrating her neighborhood. “Tf I hang white clothes out to dry, they turn black,’ snapped Liu Xiaojian, 68, who lives in the foulest corner of one of the world’s most pol- luted cities. So she drapes wet laundry inside her apartment, which sits literally in the shadow of a coal-burning power —* plant and the giant Capital Iron and Steel Co. on the western edge of Beijing. “Sometimes it’s so dark, you can’t see the sun at all,” said Liu, a retired steel factory clerk living with the family of her son, who still works at Capital Steel. Air pollution in Beijing is proba- bly the worst in her neighborhood, but in all corners of the city it smarts the eyes and has people young and old spitting to clear their chests. After two decades of dizzying devel- opment, Beijing now rivals Mexico City, New Delhi and Jakarta as the planet’s most air-polluted metropolis. Although Liu and her neighbors remain skeptical, Chinese authorities finally are attacking the pollution pervading this city of 12.5 million, from shutting down polluting facto- ries to creating thousands of acres of green space. From the upper floors of a hotel in Beijing’s center, the gracefully curved red roofs of the Forbidden City are frequently too shrouded by gray to be seen, even though they are only three blocks away. Never mind the mountains on Beijing’s western outskirts. They pop onto the horizon MARCIA KUNSTEL / Cox News Service A noxious haze blankets the graceful curved roofs of the Forbid- den City and totally hides the mountains looming in the distance farther to the west. On a rare clear day, one can see a whole array of high-rise buildings just beyond the arene but in this picture they have all but disappeared from the horizon on an exceptional day once every few weeks. The burning of 28 million tons of sulfur-laden coal a year — in every- thing from steel cauldrons to primi- tive apartment cook stoves — has combined with auto exhaust to make Beijing so polluted. And Mother Nature can make things worse. Occasional spring winds whip up sand from the Gobi Desert out west, commingling it with local pollution to unleash mudstorms like the one that splattered mucky grit across Beijing during a thunder- shower earlier this month. Every- thing got layered brown. The numbers are telling: @ Sulfur dioxide pollution from fac- tories and power plants in ing is nine times greater than in Ai 's Fulton County. a@ln urban districts of Beijing, the average concentration of automobile pollutants has reached or exceeded those of the smoggiest American cit- ies, and the levels keep rising. One Chinese official estimates that nitro- gen oxide concentrations have been jumping by 52 percent a year and carbon monoxide by 16 percent. @ More than 70 percent of the city’s energy comes from coal, and 95 per- cent of that is high-sulfur “dirty” coal. @ Reported lung cancer cases have gone up by 200 times in two decades, and respiratory disease is the lead- ing killer nationwide. Judging from World Bank calculations, air pollu- tion causes about 200 premature deaths in Beijing every week. It is no secret why a clear sky so seldom opens over Beijing. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 27, 1998 Xie Zhenhua, administrator of China’s National Environmental Protection Agency, said this spring that factors exacerbating pollution include the near tripling of industrial development in Beijing, the work at 4,000 construction sites in the city and a rapidly rising population that includes a “floating population” of 3 million illegal migrants. With paltry green areas to absorb it, the swirling dirt from construction permeates city streets. On top of that comes soot from factories such as Capital Steel, which only last year started installing pollu- tion controls. Just as nasty as the coal burned in factories are the briquettes people fire up in tens of thousands of homes day after day to cook and to heat themselves in winter. The growing population and additional migrants, mostly poor job-seekers dependent on the cheapest energy they can find, fill their cramped apartments with dangerous doses of carbon monox- ide and drive more and more sulfurous smoke spi- raling through the city. While economic development brings pluses such as modern, cleaner technology, it also puts an esti- mated 15 percent more cars on city streets each year, That means the 1.25 million vehicles on Beijing’s already congested streets are likely to dou- ble in the next five years. The fact that such figures have become available — mostly in the past year — attests to a new open- ness on the part of Chinese authorities, who are beginning to assault the pollution afflicting China. “Objectively, our environmental problems are getting worse and worse, but our government is pay- ing more attention to such questions,” said Liang _ Congjie, president of Friends of Nature, one of the few independent environmental organizations in China. “For instance, this year from January 1, Beijing is using all lead-free gasoline.” The city also is phasing in catalytic converters, City officials have announced plans to create nearly 1,300 acres of green space in the city this year and to put another 69,000 acres of trees around the outskirts. Some polluting factories are being shut down; others are being moved to the city’s perimeter. Pipes for clean-burning natural gas are being lai in the city center, but former Energy Minister Huang Yicheng estimated that China’s much- malt plan to bring natural gas from the west into the city can replace 3 million tons of coal at most. Pa consumes nearly 10 times that. Environmental advocates say the government must find more gas and price it low. More import tant, it must make available more eco-friendly, higher-energy clean coal if it wants to take a big bite out of pollution. Liang’s group tries to make the Chinese more aware of environmental issues, so they wi become pollution watchdogs and will support, if not: demand, government efforts that may end up cat ing them money. “This is the price we pay for socalled modernity,” he said. { \f"

        "ocr_text": "Auto parts firm joins forces with Chinese company By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Shanghai, China — With balloons and the pop- Ping of more than 18,000 Chinese firecrackers, Chi- na’s largest car air-conditioning manufacturer on Tuesday celebrated the opening of a joint manufac- turing business with Troy, Mich.-based Delphi Automotive Systems. “Our joint venture will have brilliant prosperity,”’ predicted Bai Yuegiang, the president of a rela-. tively modern Shanghai factory with 920 workers and a yen to penetrate the world market. Jeff Day of Delphi’s Harrison Thermal Systems, heading a contingent of Delphi executives, stressed the new joint venture’s aim of satisfying the poten- tial future demand for cars in this rapidly industri- alizing nation of 1.2 billion people. “The Chinese automotive industry has experi- enced unprecedented growth over recent times, and Chinese auto buyers are becoming as sophisticated as their counterparts elsewhere,’’ Day said. Executives of the Chinese joint-venture partner, the Shanghai Automotive Air-conditioning Factory, chose to emphasize the long-range potential for exporting air conditioners from China, once the domestic Chinese market has been ‘‘reinforced.’’ *“‘We should go to the world market to compete with our counterparts in their sector,’’ said Yu Shu- li, the general manager of the new joint venture, Known as Shanghai Delphi Automotive Air- Conditioning Systems. Yu said Shanghai Delphi has already begun ini- tial marketing efforts in the international arena. “IT am sure that in two years, the international market will occupy 30 percent of our total sales,’’ Yu said. Asked which parts of the world seem promising for Shanghai Delphi’s exports over the next five years, Yu said: ‘‘Our first target is the North Ameri- can maintenance and repairs market — the after- market. Also, we will enter the European market.’’ Delphi will now share ownership of the 8-year- old Chinese factory that supplies most of the air conditioners used in Chinese-made Volkswagens, Jeep Wagoneers and Isuzus. Its newest customer will be its sister company, Shanghai General Motors, the GM joint venture expected to begin later this year manufacturing Chi- na’s first luxury car, the Buick. To prepare for producing Buick air conditioners, Shanghai Delphi is rushing to complete a new, more JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Staff Assembly line workers put together auto air conditioners at the Shanghai vanture partly owned by Delphi Automotive Systems. modern air conditioner factory in a nearby sector of Shanghai. The old-line American auto parts maker Delphi is also one of China’s most active investors. hi operates 15 ventures in China, including 11 jeint ventures and four wholly owned, as well as service centers and a training institute. It has also licensed Delphi technology for spark plugs, brakes and other components to seven Chinese-owned companies. Of the initial $24 million in equity invested in the new venture, Delphi is contributing $8 million. Del- phi is also assuming an unspecified amount of the outstanding debts of the former Shanghai air- conditioning plant, which was built in January 1990 in the early days of China’s automotive business. General Manager Yu announced the Chinese partner in Shanghai Delphi will own 66 percent of the equity in the new joint venture and will nomi- nate six of the nine members of the board of directors. Delphi’s stake, 34 percent, will entitle the Michigan-based company to nominate three diréc- tors, two of whom will serve as vice chairman and financial director. Despite the ritual hoopla marking the unveiling of the joint venture’s plaque Tuesday, both sides know they are starting operations at a time when Chinese auto sales are not growing. One factor is several big and overcrowded cities, including Shanghai, have clamped a limit on the issuance of new license plates. China Daily, an official newspaper, reported Tuesday that nationwide sales of autos totaled just 105,800 in the first three months of this year — down slightly from a year ago. “If the downward trend continues, the auto sector will fail to fulfill its sales plan this year to sell 1.57 million vehicles, including 550,000 cars,’’ adanes Daily said.

        "ocr_text": "Clinton to be frank in China Albright says the president will discuss human rights publicly, risking giving offense. - By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — From the country- side to Tiananmen Square, Presi- dent Clinton is planning an “unprecedented grand tour with at least six stops in China next month, culminating in a televised talk touching on human rights that could reach more than 500 million Chinese. “The president very much wants to put a human face on U.S.-China relations, so I think that during his trip here, you’ll see a lot of outreach on his part to the Chinese people,” said a senior U.S. official traveling here this week with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. How China’s proud and prickly leadership will receive any such public human rights critiques is an unknown. Judging from Chi- mese leaders’ reactions to previ- ous American presidential visits, they could well become irate. One focal point of Clinton’s late June trip is expected to be at least one speech or “town meet- ing,” in which the president would enunciate an optimistic vision of Sino-U.S. relations stretching into the next century. However, the Clinton television speech inevitably will contain criticism of China’s record on human rights. Clinton’s speech in China could be among the most widely viewed events of his presidency. In China alone there are 300 million house- holds with television sets and 900 television stations. Chinese rulers seldom have tolerated foreign visitors publicly airing embarrassing questions on Chinese soil. Even so, the White SHIZUO KAMBAYASHI Aasockatacd Press Winding up her visit to prepare for President Clinton’s June tour, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright meets Thursday in Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. House expects that Clinton’s full speech and much of his visit will be televised in China. In 1984, Chinese officials cen- sored several passages from a televised speech during a visit by President Ronald Reagan, in which he had sought to praise American democracy and criti- cized the Soviet Union for its 1983 downing of a South Korean airlin- er. The last American president to visit China, George Bush, was lambasted by his Chinese hosts for inviting three Chinese dissi- dents to a banquet also attended by the top Chinese leadership. Early plans call for Clinton to spend several days touring telege- nic and politically noncontrover- Sial sites south of Beijing before reaching the capital and China’s obligatory arrival ceremony for foreign heads of state in Tianan- men Square. Tiananmen alone will be touchy for Clinton, since the June 1989 massacre of young protest- ers in the huge square immedi- ately produced icy relations between the two countries that only recently have begun to thaw. That bitter event has resulted in U.S. investment sanctions that are still in place. But Albright, noting an improvement in China’s human rights record and Sino-U.S. rela- tions, said the United States may lift trade sanctions imposed after the massacre. Among less complicated back- drops under consideration for Clinton’s first days in China: Suzhou, whose ornamental rock gardens have been famous for 1,000 years; Guilin, scene of the Picturesque Li River cruise, and Xian, site of the one of the 20th century’s most famous archaeo- logical discoveries, the buried army of terra cotta warrior fig- ures guarding a 3rd century B.C. tomb. After several days of talks in Beijing, Clinton is likely to visit Shanghai and Hong Kong. “We want an opportunity for the president to see China him- self,” a U.S. official said at a background briefing at Albright’s hotel. “This will be his first visit to China. We’d like him to see something other than the inside of a meeting room, formal arrival ceremony and a state dinner.”’ Simply mixing and mingling is unlikely to cause offense. But Clinton must consider how much he would embarrass his hosts by telling a broad Chinese audience of America’s concerns about repression. Yet if Clinton ignores a tele- vised opportunity to speak out about such restrictions, he will be lambasted by congressional crit- ics and human rights activists. Albright raised human rights issues during a two-day visit to lay the summit groundwork that ended Thursday. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 1, 1998 \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS } eijing — You can click on the , Shanghai City Internet site and find up-to-the-minute prices on the Shanghai stock exchange. Plus the beeper number of a “beautiful and available” Russian girl. Plus Elvis Presley’s birthday. .Probably nowhere in the world is the ‘Internet evolving faster than in this behemoth of a nation, where the econ- omy is hurtling into the future while free expression is stalled by security curbs from the past. The Internet lives inside a strange cocoon of rules that threaten harsh pun- ents for anyone “spreading rumors,” moting feudal superstitions,” or “in- the reputation of state organs.” Penalties include fines, jail or confisca- tion of the offending computer. ~:Yet, in the name of economic progress, President Jiang Zemin’s government is stimulating the Internet to expand at an astounding rate. It is China’s great elec- tronic leap forward, and nobody knows how long it will last. China has designated information technology as a “national pillar industry” and is spending tens of millions of dollars to:create Internet hubs across the coun- try. Simultaneously, it is pushing Chinese industry to multiply the number of Chinese-language Web sites and to use the Net for “e-commerce.” . Though the Internet is still mainly -accessible to a young, affluent urban elite, it is growing so fast that already the central government has effectively lost ‘its monopoly on the flow of information -> something all Chinese governments have guarded for centuries. ‘In just two years, the number of Chi- nese with Internet connections has jumped from 20,000 to 900,000. By December, users will hit 1.5 million, according to official projections. By 2000, some visionaries project 10 million users MARCIA KUNSTEL / Cox News Service At the Internet Cafe in North Beijing, manager Zhang Donghai (at right, in foreground) surfs the Net on one of the cafe’s computers. — possibly even 20 million. That com- pared with an estimated 25 million Amer- icans currently with access to the Inter- net. “This is like the Wild West,” says Chi- nese businessman Edward Tian, 35, a Texas Tech-trained ecologist who in the past three years has become one of Chi- na’s leading Internet entrepreneurs. “Our problem is that we cannot keep up with demand.” If you want to be mystified about where China is headed, check out what is already accessible from an Internet dial- up point in Beijing. You can visit a “free-Tibet” Web site promoting an anti-China rally in Wash- ington. But you cannot access the Human Rights in China Web site in Hong Kong: That one is blocked by a Chinese censor’s electronic filters. You can read all the news from Time Magazine, the Wall Street Journal and the British Broadcasting Company Web sites. But on most days, the censor’s fil- ters won't let you connect with the news Web sites of CNN, The Washington Post, The New York Times and Reuters. That is, unless you know how to set up your Netscape or Internet Explorer browsing software to bypass the Chinese filters. Many in Beijing can. 4,000 PCs a day If you do set your browser to bypass the censor, you'll find that CNN and most of the other blocked Web sites pop up on your screen just as quickly as they do in the United States. It doesn’t take a hack- er’s ingenuity to evade the filters — it is a trick that appears in many user guides. In 1991, the number of personal com- puters in China was about 2,000, most of them locked inside closed scientific insti- tutes. Now, about 4,000 new PCs are sold in China every day, of which 2,000 come equipped to make an Internet connection. One factor fueling the blazing demand for PCs is China’s one-child-per-family policy. Even though a $1,000 Pentium IT computer can cost an affluent parent three months’ salary, many are eager to spend the money to propel their child into the best university. In Beijing, some Chinese students without rich parents slake their Net- surfing thirst by dropping by one of three Internet Cafes operated by Internet pro- moter Edward Zeng, 35, a former State Statistical Bureau employee. “We have targeted a hundred loca- tions,” an optimistic Zeng said of his growth plans. His cafe in North Beijing’s university district suggests that the Internet has already gone far beyond the business promotion uses the government origi- nally had in mind for the Internet. “T have very few friends, and so I go to the Internet to meet people. I used to just go home after work and that’s all,” said Su Ying, a frank 21-year-old. Coaching her on her Net-surfing tech- niques was her boyfriend, whom she met while cyber-talking in Chinese charac- ters in an Internet “chat room” she accessed from the Internet Cafe. Su, whose business is selling universal power sources for an electronics compa- ny, said she also finds customers through the “chat room.” Biology student Ye Qing, 25, said he uses the Internet to pursue his studies on genes in archives outside China. He also hunts down e-mail addresses of Ameri- can universities so he can apply to gradu- ate school. “A more important reason is to learn some news from abroad because here, news, unfortunately, is very limited,” he said. “Internet news is very fast. I use Yahoo search. I think it is very surprising and interesting.” The cafe manager, 23-year-old Zhang Donghai, said the predominance of English on the Net prevents many Chi- nese from using it. “It’s changing,” said Zhang. “Now China is a big market for foreign compa- nies like Microsoft. They are beginning to explore the Chinese market and establish Chinese sites.” Another constraint is expense, espe- cially considering China’s low wage scales. A Chinese computer owner who has a dial-up account pays 10 yuan — about $1.25 — for an hour of Internet connect time. American-style flat-rate monthly Internet accounts are unavail- able. At the Internet Cafe, the computer and dial-up connection is provided and the cost is 30 yuan per hour, about $3.75. Su, a young, well-paid professional who still lives with her family, feels she can indulge. She said she spends two- thirds of her $375 monthly paycheck at the Internet Cafe, and doesn’t begrudge a jiao (about one penny). Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 3, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "China battling a STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — For 48 years, the Chinese gov- ernment has defied the spiritual power of the Dalai Lama and even fought off CIA- - backed guerrilla forces in Tibet. What China has not managed to contain is modern guerrilla warfare from Hollywood. The clamor for freedom in Tibet has ech- oed in a remarkable string of three high- profile films, and for the Chinese it has been an unwelcome lesson in the power of free expression. A wave of Western interest in the plight of Tibetans has rippled in all directions, apparently even reaching the White House. But agitation that China loosen its grip over the high Himalayan plateau has only stiff- ened Beijing’s resolve to keep close control. China’s leaders have refused to meet the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s political and spiritual leader in exile, most recently when requested to do so last month by the Clinton administration. “The high degree of autonomy advocated by the Dalai Lama is in essence a two-step strategy for Tibetan independence,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guo- qiang, in dismissing the American call for dialogue. “Its purpose is to fool interna- Once they glimpsed the attention Holly- wood was stirring, China’s leaders stepped up denunciations of the 1989 Nobel peace prize recipient and maligned the movies.

The CIA began covertly training Tibetan guerrilla fighters in India and at a U.S. Army camp near Vail, Colo., to con- tinue resistance. But Chinese forces beat back the movement, and CIA help was reportedly terminated in 1972. Objective view is difficult The Communist regime has moved thou- sands of ethnic Chinese into Tibet and imprisoned Buddhist nuns and monks, and political activists believed to be loyal to the Dalai Lama. Simply displaying his photo- graph has drawn punitive action. While critics claim China is erasing the religion and cultureof Tibet, getting an objective view is difficult. Tourists may visit permitted sites, but journalists seldom are granted permission to enter Tibet and cannot travel freely if they do. This month, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has floated the possibility of taking foreign journalists there sometime before President Clinton’s visit. But even a guarded expedition reportedly has both supporters and foes within the ministry. Foreign correspondents are balking at a guided tour that they fear will show model towns and prisons rather than real life views of the country.

The force of free expression in the West, especially regarding Tibet, made a direct hit on China’s President Jiang Zemin during his visit to America last October. Thousands of protesters gathered by free-Tibet forces demonstrated in Lafayette Park across from the White House while Jiang and Clinton held formal talks. Human rights groups also staged a “stateless din- ner” in a nearby hotel while Clinton was hosting a state dinner for the Chinese lead- er. While growing popular pressure in the West has made China more stubbornly unbending, officials of the Clinton adminis- tration admit the higher profile of Tibet has moved the topic up on their agenda. When U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was in China late last month to lay the groundwork for Clinton’s summit trip in June, she got nowhere with her request that China begin talks with the Dalai Lama. A government spokesman later ruled out a meeting, questioning the sincerity of the Dalai Lama’s acceptance of autonomy rather than independence. The spokesman also chastised the Americans for appointing: a State Department special coordinator on Tibet as interference in China’s internal affairs. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Indo mesia Contuimts dlead as Sutfharto weishs resismnatiomnm By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Indonesia ith the embattled President Suharto in seclusion, his glittery capital turned into a ghost town early today as residents hid indoors after four days of riots that left at least 200 dead. The streets in this city of 12 million were eerily empty. Suhar- to’s vaunted military was scarcely visible. Nor were the placard-waving university students and rock- throwing slum dwellers whose protests fused this week to ignite this country’s worst rioting in the 32 years of Suharto’s strongman rule. ‘Suharto remained closeted with advisers, giving no hint of how he intended to respond to mounting calls for his resigna- tion. The Kosgoro faction of Suharto’s ruling party, Golkar, announced it was withdrawing support and asking him to step down. Meanwhile, the city began counting the dead, and it appeared that the toll would be far worse than previously thought as bodies were discov- ered in the burned-out shells of stores and shopping malls _ set ablaze during the rampage. The ghastliest scene was at the five-story Yogya Plaza shopping center in East Jakarta, where 175 burned bodies were discovered Friday. The victims are thought to have been looters who entered the mall before it was set on fire. The White House said that more than 10,000 U.S. troops, including members of a Marine Corps expeditionary force, were taking part in exercises off the coast of Thailand and could help evacuate Americans from Indo- nesia if necessary. The U.S. Embassy plan to airlift Ameri- cans from the riot-torn capital before dawn today met an unforeseen obstacle: Too many wanted out. The U.S. government said Fri- day it had chartered two jumbo jets to evacuate Americans unable to get tickets on commer- cial flights. Word spread quickly through Indonesia’s American community of about 8,000. But few anticipated the announce- ment would spawn such an exodus. As quiet settled over Jakarta, virtually the only signs of life were neon signs advertising Western multinationals, garishly aglow atop skyscrapers aban- doned by their expatriate staffs. Some ethnic Chinese mer- chants, whose businesses were prime targets for looters, remained in downtown luxury hotels, along with a smattering of Western businessmen who couldn’t get out of Jakarta when rioting reached a crescendo Thursday. Early today, a few daring taxi drivers reopened the desolate superhighway from Jakarta’s air- port, racing at 60 mph through toll plazas abandoned by their Indonesian staff. Just 24 hours earlier, the highway had been blocked b i ing Chinese merchants and Western- ers from reaching flights to safety. It remained to be seen whether Suharto’s rollback in the price of gasoline, increased as part of an economic reform package insisted on by the International Monetary Fund, would take any heat out of the public anger. Reu- ters News Service said the IMF had removed its staff from Jakarta. Several members of Suharto’s family reportedly fled after loot- ers Thursday torched buildings associated with the first family. Among them: an auto dealership owned by Suharto’s second son, Bambang Trihatmojo, and a supermarket owned by the presi- dent’s youngest son, “Tommy” Mandala Putra. The question on everyone’s mind was whether Suharto, 76, was also on his way out. He stunned the political establish- ment here by remarking during his just concluded visit to Cairo: “If I’m no longer trusted to lead the country, there’s no problem at all. I will not use force of arms to stay in office. I will become a pandito [sage] and endeavor to get closer to God.” One of the country’s most respected centrist figures, House of Representatives Speaker Haroko, said the chamber would convene next week to discuss Suharto’s suggestion that he might step aside. But there was skepticism about whether Suharto was really prepared to cede power after 32 years, since he has made similar vague prom- i in the past. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 16, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Rioters in Jakarta targeted Chinese Anger in the streets: Protests over Suharto erode into Muslim attacks on foreign ‘interlopers.’ By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT - Jakarta, indonesia — On one side of Ciledug Street, a cluster of Indonesian Muslim men and boys was prying open the shutters of one of the neighborhood’s last Chinese-owned shops to escape five days of rioting. Across the geglass-strewn thor- oughfare, about 30 camouflage- clad, rifle-bearing troops of Gen- eral Suharto’s army were lounging in the shade with cans of soft drinks in their hands. - This was the scene Saturday afternoon a few hundred yards down the street from Ciledug Pla- za, a Chinese-owned shopping complex where police and volun- teers were trying to remove the bodies of up to 187 Indonesian Muslims caught in the flames of a building they were trying to loot. ' Until last week, Ciledug Plaza was the biggest, most modern building in this pleasant lower middle-class neighborhood where Chinese and Indonesian Muslim shopkeepers rubbed shoulders for years. Now it is a symbol of ethnic cleansing that has become the most wretched byproduct of a power struggle over whether the 76-year-old Suharto should cede power. The agonizingly slow removal of Ciledug Plaza’s bodies helped push to nearly SOO the official death toll in five days of Indone- Sian rioting. It also raised questions that remain unanswered about why Suharto’s well-armed, sometimes brutal security forces have remained relatively passive in the Past week, as Muslim mobs vented anger on the property of their Chinese neighbors. “When the burning started on Wednesday, I tried many times to call the police, but I could never get through because all the num- bers were engaged,’ lamented Jerry Laluyan, 62, one Muslim neighbor. ‘“‘Even the people who still live here feel they have no public protection.”’ To see how weeks of genteel, high-minded campus protests against Suharto suddenly exploded into a brutal spasm of anti-Chinese ethnic cleansing, there is no better place to visit than Ciledug Street, a route that takes its name from two bucolic- sounding Indonesian words mean- ing “‘waterfall.”? Now it is one of the capital’s worst riot corridors, leading Jakarta’s southwestern suburbs toward the _ relatively unscathed downtown area. From what could be recon- structed on Saturday, it was clear that this street was not set ablaze by some mindless wave of terror. Rather, it was a gradual, selective attack by Muslim neighbors against the Chinese merchants that took place over several days. If there was a specific local erievance that sparked Wednes- Gay’s first fire on Ciledug Street, nobody could remember it. Wit- messes agreed that once the loot- ing started, it fed on itself and became self-perpetuating. Virtually unhampered by police, the mostly young Muslim attackers have looted nearly 100 Percent of businesses along a 2- mile stretch that are owned, or suspected of being owned, by Indonesia’s ethnic Chinese minority. If any Chinese merchants were killed on Ciledug Street, no one was around to tell the story. The Chinese owners have vanished, probably some of them to the safety of downtown luxury hotels and others on flights to Hong Kong, Singapore or elsewhere. Almost none of the Muslim- owned shops were touched in the Ciledug Street rioting. The street was alive Saturday with thousands of shoppers, gawkers and souvenir-hunters from Indonesia’s Muslim majori- ty. Hundreds of Muslim-owned shops were open for business Sat- urday, selling everything from secondhand tires to groceries. Residents said everyone in the neighborhood had a duty to spare those stores carrying hand- Painted signs pronouncing that they were not Chinese-owned. Some of the signs read: ‘“‘Milik Pribumi”’ (Owned by Original Cit- izens) or “Toko Muslim” (Muslim Shop). Or “Allah Akhbar” (Allah be Praised). For almost all Muslim mer- chants, such warnings proved bet- ter than a guard dog. One of the few exceptions was a looted, fire-damaged McDonald’s restaurant that car- ried — perhaps too late — a large “Milik Pribumi” sign. The McDonald’s shared a block-long building with two other Western fast-food compa- nies, Dunkin’ Donuts and Ken- tucky Fried Chicken. They, too, bore black scars of fire attacks. Ever since the 19th century, Indonesia’s history has been stained by recurrent race riots growing out of the notion that the Chinese — who now make up 5 percent of the population and con- trol more than two-thirds of the Private wealth — are interlopers in a country belonging to the Muslim “original citizens.”’ This fundamental element of the local folk wisdom is_ what saved the livelihood of a 44-year-| old merchant named Suwarno, when rioting engulfed Ciledug Street. Suwarno operates a tiny fruit and cold drinks stand just outside a two-story Chinese-owned build- ing that came under mob attack. “Hundreds of people were break- ing in, burning everything,” recalled Suwarno. “I wasn’t touched because everyone knows that I am one of the original citizens.”’ The starkest symbol of the self- destructive effects of the rioting is a pileup of 32 torched and over- turned minibuses that clogs traf- fic near the foot of Ciledug Street. The 32 minibuses were owned by the KWK company, a private firm of presumed Chinese owner- ship that provided cheap transit in Ciledug and nearby neighborhoods. Recently, the company raised fares from 6 cents to 10 cents a ride, the consequence of a government-imposed jump in fuel Prices. Some residents said the Price rise was the spark that caused rioters to destroy the minibuses that provided a sizable Part of the neighborhood’s trans- portation system.

There is nothing monotonous about twisting wires eight hours a day for the innards of Chevy Suburban door panels, insists Delphi’s champion Chinese auto worker, Dai Lijun, 36. ““Everything is easy,’ she smiles. ““There is nothing difficult about the job.”’ .-Dai, a hearty-faced woman with unerring hands, has a per- fect factory attendance record.

And, as always, to assemble perfect bundles of wires to fit inside the doors of C/K-series GM pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles such as the Tahoe, Yukon and Suburban. ““It’s a matter of strict discipline,’” explained Dai, who works in the Delphi Packard Electric Shanghai Co. Ltd. joint venture in suburban Anting Township, an hour’s drive north of Shanghai. -Who imposes the discipline? —**I do,’”’ she replies. ‘‘It’s a mat- ter of honor to have my team be the best team.”’ -For the last three months, Dai’s 44-member team has out- worked the other teams in her 1;790-worker plant.

Beijing University professor might earn, not counting housing benefits. But on an absolute scale, Del- Phi is paying its Chinese workers 71 cents per hour — compared to, say, the $8 to $20 an hour Delphi Pays its factory workers in Day- ton, Ohio. GM executives insist China’s seemingly limitless pool of high- quality, low-wage workers was mot what attracted the world’s largest automaker to China. The decisive factor, they say, is the company’s determination to seize a strategic opportunity to sell cars in one of the biggest poten- tial markets of the 21st century. “General Motors is here because of China’s growth,”’” said Rudolph A. Schlais Jr., the former Delphi executive who is President of GM ’s China opera- tions. ‘“You’ve got a 15-20 percent [annual] growth in the rate of automobile sales in China, and you’ve got 1.2 billion people. If you even look at 1 percent of that, think of how many people could buy a passenger car.”’ Chao, the top Delphi executive in China, says, “‘Our slogan at Delphi is ‘follow the customer.’ Where the customer is, we go.”” Five years ago, Delphi’s foot- hold in China consisted of three lonely expatriates working out of an office in the Beijing Hotel near Tiananmen Square. Since then, GM and its Delphi Automotive Systems subsidiary Ihave created a diversified auto Parts manufacturing network throughout China with major stakes in 17 car and auto parts factories with more than 8,000 Chinese workers. Suppliers say GM ’s is already the largest Western manufactur- ing operation in China. If GM’s hopes materialize, in another five years GM China could turn out to be ome of the largest American manufacturing operations any- where in the developing world. This spring, GM and its Chi- mese venture: partner, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp., are finishing a giant modern factory with a reported capacity to make 150,000 cars a year, located in Shanghai’s Jingiao Export Pro- cessing Zone. The Shanghai GM factory cov- ers 230,000 square meters, according to China’s Xinhua news agency. That is nearly the size of SO American football fields, and more than three times the size of GM?’s vaunted new sports-utility vehicle factory in Moraine, Ohio. This December, GM China is due to unveil the new Shanghai factory when its first made-in- China automobile rolls off the assembly line. It will be a modified Buick Regal — a luxury car designed mainly for foreign executives and for official use by the multitude of Chinese provincial officials, deputy ministers, factory bosses and other midlevel bureaucrats whose state organizations can afford a VIP car for the boss. GM hopes to sell i5,000 to 30,000 Chinese Buicks in 1999 and up to 100,000 Buicks a year by the year 2002. GM won’t reveal its expected sticker price. Among Shanghai taxi drivers, the rumor is Chinese Buicks will sell for about 300,000 yuan, or $36,500 each. One company official said Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 17, 1998 > \f4uutomaker insists it’s most attracted by a growing market, nota quality work force that makes 71 cents an hour. while the price remains a secret, it ‘“‘makes sense” for the Buick to undersell its main competitor, the Audi, the other Chinese-produced luxury car. Audis are quoted in Shanghai as costing about 350,000 Chinese yuan, or about $42,000 apiece. The first 50 prototype Chinese Buicks have already been made and are now being subjected to Shanghai road tests.

        "ocr_text": "Calls for Suharto to quit grow Massive protests loom: ‘Top general reportedly may side with students. By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT indonesia — Increas- Indonesia’s privileged establish- ment today as activists turned up the heat on the country’s isolated Muslim leader Amien Rais, who heads the 28 million-strong Muhammadiyah alliance, pro- claimed plans to bring millions of People to the streets Wednesday demanding Suharto’s resignation. And on university campuses, stu- dents were arranging potentially incendiary gatherings in front of the parliamentary complex early in the week. But the most striking develop- ment was the increasing known senior scholars to risk arrest by publicly calling for Suharto to step aside. “We urge President Suharto to resign and return the mandate of the People’s Consultative Assembly,’’ declared one of doz- ens of statements, this one quoted in today’s Jakarta Post from 1,296 lecturers and professors. - Muslim scholar’ Nurcholish Madjid called for Suharto to resign and surrender to the state all the personal wealth his family amassed during his 32-year rule — a trove that the CIA once esti- mated at more than $40 billion. The 76-year-old Suharto, who has not addressed the public since riots swept the country and left at least 499 people dead last week, received a delegation of security chiefs and Cabinet mem- bers late Sunday to assess the damage at his palace. Delegation members, briefing reporters, said Indonesia faces severe financial disruptions in coming days because the rioters managed to loot or damage 534 banks and 220 automatic teller machines across the country. The public is aware that the banking system ‘has lurched to a halt, and block-long lines of Indo- mesians could be seen today wait- ing for hours in front of ATMs that were rumored to be reactivating. - *‘Many commercial borrowers may be rendered unable to repay their bank loans, thereby increas- ing bad debts within the banking system,” said Economy Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita, one of those who met with Suharto. Another visiting the palace was the recently installed defense minister, General Wiranto, the 51-year-old career army officer who has emerged as a potential replacement for the president because of his remarkably sympa- thetic treatment of the wave of anti-Suharto student protests. On Sunday, Indonesian news- Paper reports said Wiranto sug- gested using army trucks to trans- port student protesters from Salemba, a University of Indone- sia campus, to parliament buildings for a mass protest. Wiranto’s cautiously populist stands — backed by more aggres- sively anti-Suharto rhetoric from retired commanders — report- edly have drawn the ire of the Palace guard of Suharto loyalists, led by the president’s longtime business and golfing partmer, Minister of Industry and Trade Mohammed ‘‘Bob’’ Hasan. The South China Morning Post reported today that Suharto may dadump Wiranto and form an emer- gency military committee to sup- press protests and restore order. If that happens, Suharto might be able to wield more direct control over the military through his son- in-law Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subian- to, commander of special forces.

        "ocr_text": "Indonesian ruler’s fortune on line If President Suharto waits too long to step down, his family could lose billions. By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Indonesia — If President Suhar- to, Indonesia’s billionaire strongman, leaves power gracefully, he and his multimillionaire children may well live to enjoy the most bounteous golden parachute in history. If Suharto clings on too long, he and his offspring could lose the bulk of the multibillion-dollar fortune they have amassed since the former army general seized power in the oil- and mineral-rich archipelago in late 1965. “Most of their assets we know of are in banks, factories, buildings and other fixed property,” said longtime Suharto wealth watcher Christianto Wisibono, who heads the Indonesian Business Data Center. “These things could be nationalized pretty easily by Associated Press anew government.” From toll roads to telecommunications — and from Jakarta’s luxurious Grand Hyatt Hotel to the legendary Freeport-McMoRan gold and copper mine on Irian Jaya — mem- bers of the Suharto clan have their fingers in almost every pot in Indonesia. If they can keep what they have amassed, it would probably rank as the fattest sever- ance package any ousted chief executive has ever enjoyed. Just how fat is unclear. No outsider knows how much Suharto, a 76-year-old widower, holds in his portfolios. No outsider knows how much of the family fortune has been transferred into foreign enterprises that would be difficult to nationalize. In the late 1980s, the CIA reportedly esti- mated the Suharto family wealth at $40 bil- lion, but since then the family’s wealth has been somewhat curtailed by the fall in world oil prices and the collapse of the Indonesian currency.

        "ocr_text": "Indonesia’s ca Students de call to cance mass protest By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Jakarta, Indonesia urmoil rolled through this capital today as_ uncer- tainty reigned about a mass protest in National Monu- ment Square, in the heart of the city and a few hundred yards from the presidential palace and the Defense Ministry. Tanks and armored cars were guarding access to key buildings. ‘“‘Hang Suharto, hang Suharto,” young demonstrators chanted out- side parliament Tuesday, voicing their disappointment at the 76- year-old president’s pledge to leave office after future elections without setting a timetable. They vowed to remain there until Suharto gave up power. Throughout the country, as many as 1 million protesters were said to be prepared to call today for the departure of the veteran leader. With 15,000 protesters on the grounds of the parliament build- ing, delegates in Suharto’s rubber-stamp House of Represen- tatives rejected the president’s announcement that he would stay in office to preside over the lengthy choice of his successor. Leaders of the four House fac- tions have called on the president to step aside immediately. They also discussed calling an ‘“‘extraordinary session’? of the People’s Consultative Assembly to demand that Suharto account for his actions. ‘“‘Suharto must go right now — not tomorrow, not tonight,” said Baby Hama Siregar, a 21-year-old public relations major demon- strating outside parliament. ‘“‘He’s just trying to stay around so his children can keep their businesses.”’ “He’s simply buying time to consolidate his power,’ said Mus- lim scholar Amien Rais, whose 28 million-strong Muhammadiyah Muslim alliance had called the mass demonstration commemo- rating the 90th anniversary of the movement that liberated Indone- sia from Dutch colonial rule after World War II. But early today Rais canceled the new demonstration planned for outside the presidential pal- ace. Speaking on national radio and television, Rais urged his fol- lowers to stay home and avoid clashes and bloodshed. Students were likely to con- tinue with their protests despite Rais’ appeal. He has supported their rallies, but has exercised lit- tle daily control over them. But Suharto’s guarded pledge to leave office won him the sup- port of several more conservative Muslim leaders and kept the top military commanders in his cor- ner — at least for now. Indonesian investors reacted bullishly. Though most banks and money-changers remained closed after last week’s destructive riot- ing, those who were working marked up the value of Indone- sia’s currency by 10 percent. pital boiling On the Jakarta Stock Exchange, there was a spurt of buying in Bimantara Citra and Astra International, two conglom- erates known to be controlled by sons of Suharto. This pushed up the stock index by 6.4 percent for the day, brokers said. Yet fear of renewed rioting hung in the humid Jakarta air this morning. One symptom was the “Dear Guest” notices slipped under the doors of everyone staying in the fortress-like Jakarta Hilton Hotel, three miles from Monument Square. “Due to the current political situation here in Indonesia, we kindly advise you to stay calm, remain in your room, stay away from all windows/balconies and garden,” the notice said. And the respected Jakarta Post editorialized: ‘““Given the appar- ently unresolved antagonism that exists between the president and his critics, it looks as if we may be heading toward a time of mounting pressure, growing’ dis- order and economic distress and a further corrosion of Indonesia’s image abroad.” Suharto’s pledge to leave office drew cautious support from some Asian capitals, but not from Washington. State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin _pre- dicted a delay in the next $1 bil- lion pay out, due June 4, of the International Monetary Fund’s bailout package to Indonesia. “Indonesia needs both political and economic reform to solve its problems [which] should begin as soon as possible,” Rubin said.

        "ocr_text": "Sulharto as good as zone Indonesian leader to give up power to vice president By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Jakarta, Indonesia As U.S. Marines waited offshore to evacuate remaining expatriates, a Cabinet member and two Indonesian newspapers reported today that embattled President Suharto was on the verge of leaving office. Suharto will be succeeded by the current vice president, Baharuddin Jusuf Habibie, said Saadilah Mursyid, state secre- tary in the Indonesian presiden- tial palace. Habibie is expected to lead a transitional government until new elections. ‘‘Nation Awaits New Government,’’ headlined the respected Jakarta Post. It cited unnamed ‘informed sources’”’ as saying Suharto would hand over the presidency to Habibie at the State Palace at 9 a.m. today. There was no confirmation, and Jakarta woke up to become the rumor capital of the world as thousands of Indonesians with cell phones and beepers filled the airwaves’ with speculation. Just two days ago, the 76- year-old president pledged ina national TV address that he would stay in office until after a fresh set of parliamentary elec- tions — a period that could stretch until next year or long- er. His failure to set a timetable for stepping down after 32 years in office was widely con- demned, even among his own parliamentary supporters. Indonesian reporters camped out near Suharto’s residence reported a meeting that extended into the early morning hours between the president and three advisers. Another national paper, Kompas, said it expected Suharto to turn over power soon to Habibie after naming a new Cabinet team to reform Indonesia’s political system. Kompas told its readers that as many as 11 of Suharto’s Cabinet members already had submitted their resignations. These reports ech- oed a claim by Mus- lim opposition leader Amien Rais, who told The Associated Press that a “friend in the government” had told him Suharto would resign soon, possibly today. Rais said Habi- bie would turn over power for a six-month transition period lead- ing to new elections. “It is time for us to say goodbye to our national leader, who for 32 years has ruled this country,” Rais said. Rais spoke on the telephone at least once Wednesday with the vice president, who happens to be his friend and former colleague on the government-sponsored Indonesian Association of Muslim Intel- lectuals. The opposition leader had been trying unsuccessfully Wednesday to arrange a personal meeting with Habibie. On Wednesday, a majority of Suhar- to’s handpicked members of the ruling Golkar faction in parliament voted to convene an extraordinary session that could result in Suharto’s impeachment INDONESIA THAILAND. as early as next week. Meanwhile, the parliament grounds continued to be occupied by tens of thousands of protest- ing students. Today is a state holiday and many people stayed at home, leaving the often traffic-clogged freeways extraordinarily quiet. Banks and ATM machines remained closed, and many families are running out of cash. During the night, the Army withdrew to thieir barracks many of the heavily armed troops that seized the city center 24 hours earlier to block a huge planned anti-Suharto rally. Somewhere  off- shore, a force of 12,000 U.S. Marines waited on alert aboard the helicopter carrier Belleau Woods and two other amphibious assault ships to evacuate civilians, including hundreds of American oil workers still in Indonesia. “Yes, they are prepared, and do have contingency plans to execute an NEO [non-combatant evacuation order] to assist;) hopefully it would not be opposed,” Marine Gen. Charles Krulak said in Washington. Four arson or looting incidents were reported by Jakarta police overnight, the most serious involving the torching of a restaurant and two shops in the Kaebay- oran Baru district. But the episodes were scattered throughout the city, and a police spokesman said, “No fatalities have been reported so far.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 21, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Muslim scholar is man to watch By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Jakarta, Indonesia — Amien Rais, Muslim scholar who once studied Marxism at the University of Notre Dame, has emerged as a likely leader of Indonesia, now that President Suharto has been driven from power. Respected by anti-Suharto student demonstrators, Rais endeared himself to tens of thousands of Indonesian par- ents Wednesday when he abruptly called off a potentially explosive rally near the presidential palace. For a proud man such as Rais, 54, it was a bitter decision to go on national radio and television at 4 a.m. to call off what would have been the biggest rally of his political career. But it won him points among senior military commanders, who have been dubious about Rais because of his lack of military service. Instead, Rais spoke to 30,000 protest ers who had gathered at the House of Representatives to pressure Suharto to quit. He urged the president to resign “as soon as possible” and for his family to “give back the billions” accumulated during Suharto’s 32-year rule. The military didn’t interfere with the students at the House, a step seen as a trade-off for having canceled the marct on the presidential palace. Rais, who depicts himself as a mod- erate, said he changed his mind about holding the rally after a major general warned him that bloodshed would result. He said the general passed him a warning, through a mutual friend, that if the demonstration wasn't scrubbed, the army was poised to suppress the students in the same forceful way as the Chinese military reacted to student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. That warning came just 13 hours before Rais pledged to assemble a million pro- esters in the heart of the capita Jakarta, to demand Suharto’s ouster. “He said that a kind of Tiananmen could take place; that’s exactly what he said,” Rais said in an interview. He declined to name the general. Around midnight, tens of thousands of Indonesian troops rumbled into downtown Jakarta and used barbed- wire barricades to seal off more than a square mile around the intended rally site. At 2a.m. Wednesday, Rais and a few associates drove and walked around the darkened, heavily guarded streets, and they realized the protesters would fail to reach the assembly point near the presidential palace. Two hours later, Rais told TV crews camped in his headquarters that stu- dents should stay home and pray rather than demonstrate. Rais, a political lecturer at Gajah Mada University in the central Jav- anese city of Yogyakarta, is chairman of Indonesia’s second-largest and most politically active Muslim organization, the 28 million-member Muhammadiyah Muslim alliance. Since last summer, Rais has been among the most outspoken in urging Suharto to cede power: And since last fall, Rais has said, “God willing, I will be ready for the presidency.” Asked to describe his ideology, Rais said, “Don’t get me wrong, I am not a fundamentalist. I am a good Muslim, a practicing Muslim, but . . . I know what democracy stands for. I know the ABCs of democratic life. I believe that Islam can accept democracy as our political system. I don’t want to see the estab- lishment of an Islamic state.” There is no question Rais takes his spiritual life seriously. For the past eight years, he has fasted every other day during the daytime. “It’s to main- tain his moral and psychological stabili- ty,” explained a friend, Ahmed Mareef. In his Muhammadiyah headquarters, unarmed guards in camouflage outfits idle away the long hours watching a badminton championship on TV. The civilian staffers, more men than wom- en, are young and smartly dressed. TATAN SYRANA) Aasocaed . Revered by students opposed to Suharto, Amien Rais flashes a peace symbol Wednesday. He urged that . Suharto not flee the country. About half the female staffers wear pantsuits rather than traditional floor- length gowns. All but one of the female staffers wore Islamic head scarfs, but none was veiled. Rais was born in 1944 in Solo in a Javanese-speaking region. He studied in Islamic schools through the univer- sity level and went abroad to continue Muslim studies at Al Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. Later, from 1972 to 1974, he studied political science at Notre Dame, earn- ing a master’s degree in Marxism and Soviet studies. His U.S. professors left him with an intense distaste for com- munism, said his friend Maraef, who is vice president of Muhammadiyah. After teaching for years in Indonesia, Rais returned to earn his doctorate at the University of Chicago in 1981. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the history of the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Egypt. Rais owes his start in national poli- tics to a 1990 decision by Suharto to support the formation of the Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals Association in an effort to gain Muslim support in the world’s largest Muslim country. He grew into one of its most articu- late participants. However, Rais fell into official disfavor in January 1997 by asking the Indonesian government to block the giant mining operations in Irian Jaya of a Louisiana-based compa- ny, Freeport-McMorRan Copper and Gold Inc. “Freeport’s mining activities have mostly benefited foreign investors,” Rais said at a Muslim gathering, noting that the Indonesian government got 10 percent of the mine’s earnings, while the U.S. company got more than 80 per- cent. A month later, Rais was forced out of the Muslim intellectuals association at Suharto’s behest. Since then, he gradu- ally has built his own political base for an eventual run for the presidency. Asked how a new Indonesian govern- ment would treat Suharto, Rais said, “It’s better for him to stay in this coun- try, and it’s also better for his children not to go abroad. “They should just stay in this country to be investigated. It will be a fair, legal investigation, and then a fair trial must be given to them. “But especially for Suharto, I think there could be some special treatment,” Rais said, “because he has made a good contribution to this country since 1966, when he saved the country from the communist coup. “But of course, we do not want to for- get the corruption, collusion and nepo- tism that [were] so prevalent all over Indonesia during his term,” he said. “We have to be very fair and stick to the legal process, to the fair trial given Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 21, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Torching of mall may be ill omen By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Karawaci, Indonesia — Before anti-Chinese rioting broke out last week, the oasis of luxury in Jakarta’s western outskirts created by James Riady, the bil- lionaire investor and President Clinton’s one-time fundraiser, employed some 20,000 Indonesians. Now the sprawling Riady supermall, with its Wal-Mart and Pizza Hut and seven-screen movie theater, is no more than a gutted hulk. After the mayhem ended, the bodies of 79 rioters were pulled from the wreckage. Many of the mall’s former cus- tomers, mostly ethnic Chinese, have fled abroad. Unfortunately for Indonesia, the consequences of the bloody riots are just now bearing down on the economy — here as well as at hundreds of other gutted sites across this vast land. On Wednesday afternoon, the bank branch had to shut early after running out of rupiahs because the Indonesian Central Bank had announced a two-day “technical closure.” Fortunately, Thursday was a holiday. The next blow is due to fall Monday. Among others, it will hit Mie ina Bl gre Danang, a who on Thursday did good busi- ness selling slices for six cents apiece to Riady's cleanup crew. Danang and his customers sub- sist at the bottom of the economic food chain in this luxury model town that Riady and his father, Muchtar, built since 1993 at an overall cost of $1 billion. What Danang and others won’t be told until next week is that the 4,000 low-level supermall employees will be laid off, begin- ning on Monday. Gordon Benton, a 66-year-old T tried to get them to stop. I told them, ‘You are going to be looking across the table at your sister, and neither of you are going to have a job.’ ” GORDON BENTON Town manoger a Scotsman who works for the Riadys as the town manager, said he watched as looters drove up in trucks and broke into stores, say- ing they were hungry. “T tried to get them to stop,” he said. “I told them, ‘You are going to be looking across the table at your sister, and neither of you are going to have a job.’ ” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 23, 1998 Benton said James Riady has been in Lippo Karawaci, as the site is called, this week, joining executives’ meetings on how and when to rebuild. “James just lis- tens to us discussing it and then he makes up his mind,” said Ben- ton. “So far, he hasn’t given us the indication of what is next.” Riady’s decision, and that of other ethnic Chinese investors at other projects, will be crucial to the pace of Indonesia’s recovery. Although Chinese Indonesians were only 5 percent of the popu- lation before the riots, they con- trol two-thirds of the Indonesian wealth in private hands. The housing complex catered mainly to ethnic Chinese and Western expatriates who could afford $125,000 for a condomini- um. It was bordered by four mod- est Indonesian peasant villages where chickens scratch in front yards and children run barefoot. The town managers thought they had cemented good relations by hiring workers from the neigh- boring towns. But that did not deter the looters. In the village of Kampung Dadap, which lies just beyond the back fence, a 37-year-old unem- ployed man named Dono said he doesn’t care who is president. “All we care about is the price of food,” he said. “In the last year, the cost of cooking oil has gone up by three times. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Student protesters expelied By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Jakarta, Indonesia — In the darkness early this morning, army troops loyal to newly appointed President B.J. Habibie burst into the Parliament com- plex and ended a five-day *‘people power’’ occupation, flushing out some 2,500 student demonstrators without bloodshed. The student movement that caused the downfall of President Suharto two days ago was thus brushed off center stage as Indo- nesia’s military and political elite reclaimed full control of the country. The student factor is likely to be further diffused next week as many Indonesian univer- sities begin summer breaks. **Reject Habibie, reject Habibie,’’ shouted the last stu- dents as they were loaded aboard buses by soldiers at 2:15 a.m. The demonstrators had been trying to force a special session of Parlia- ment to authorize fresh elections to replace Habibie, 61, whom they see as a Suharto crony. Just before midnight, troops armed with M-16s erupted through a rear entrance of the House of Representatives com- pound. About 100 unarmed stu- dent guards fled from the gate after hearing a shouted order to “attack”? from the military ranks, the Jakarta Post.reported. Within minutes, the soldiers pounded on the doors of the House of Representatives cham- ber with truncheons to awaken hundreds of students who had been sleeping inside. Officers in red berets and camouflage uni- forms told the students the build- ing had to be repaired so Parlia- ment could resume its work. The students put up no resis- | tance and were herded out of the | building singing and shouting. Several hours of commotion ensued as some 200 students staged a sit-down in the parking |’: lot, insisting they be allowed to leave in a single caravan of buses. The military precision of the takeover then broke down as the military had to spend nearly two hours rounding up the necessary buses. There was little bitterness, however, as students shook hands with soldiers and traded smiles and victory signs. Students wav- ing the red-and-white Indonesian flag and singing the national anthem stood atop buses as they were driven away. The student ranks in the parlia- mentary siege already had been depleted, as several contingents of anti-Habibie students withdrew Friday after their leaders heeded calls from parents and college administrators to avoid a threat- ening situation. Their departure was provoked by a series of scuffles and shouted arguments on the Parliament grounds Friday between the anti- Habibie students and a rival pro- .government group that tore down slogans criticizing the new president. The retaking of Parliament was masterminded by the 51-year-old army chief of staff, Gen. Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. He was also the key figure in persuading Suharto to step down. Wiranto further consolidated his authority by replacing his former rival, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, who is Suharto’s son-in- JUANITO HOLANDEZ / Knight Ridder Tribune Ayoung Indonesian takes part in a demonstration Friday against new President B.). Habibie, Troops later ousted student protesters from Parliament, but there was little violence. law, as chief of the army’s special forces. Prabowo was ordered to a new post outside the capital as head of a military officer’s school. The Indonesian crisis is far from resolved, however. The Indonesian central bank’s reserves of foreign currency is expected to be exhausted as early as next week. Even before last week’s anti- Chinese rioting and the sudden evacuation of most foreign busi- nessmen, Indonesia’s currency reserves had dwindled to $14.6 billion — critically low for the world’s fourth most populous country. If Indonesia cannot obtain emergency financing, it won't have the dollars it needs to finance vital food and medicine imports. And it will start default- ing on foreign debts estimated at more than $145 billion. The International Monetary Fund said it was sending its top Asia expert back to review the situation. Asia director Hubert Neiss will travel next week to meet with Habibie and his eco- nomic team. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 23, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Suharto makes his safe, dignified exit > He was never accused of being crazy, just of knowing how to get what he wants. my By Joseph Albright QOX NEWS SERVICE - JAKARTA, Indonesia — Nobody says Indonesia’s fallen leader is crazy. Indonesians may blame Suharto for greed or cun- ning or nepotism. But even at the low point in his life, Suharto showed that he knows how to get what he wants. . ‘ ‘By Wednesday, what Suharto wanted above all was a dignified and safe exit. So as Suharto was reading his resignation state- ment inside Merkeda Palace, an aide was sent to unbolt the presi- dential license plates ‘“‘Indonesia 1” from the big black bulletproof Mercedes limousine that has been as much Suharto’s symbol of power as an American presi- dent’s Air Force One. The ‘Indonesia 1” license plate was quickly affixed to the vice presidential limousine assigned to Jusuf “B.J.’’ Habibie, the man Suharto appointed to replace . him. Then Suharto was seen roaring off in a motorcade inside his trademark bulletproof Mer- cedes. Before he left, someone bolted on an anonymous replace- ment plate: “‘B 2044 AR.” Instead of flying off by helicop- ter to ignominious exile in the manner of the late Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos, Suharto simply had his chauffeur drop him off at the presidential bungalow in downtown Jakarta called Sedana, where Suharto has lived for decades. At last word, senior diplomats said Suharto was still in Indone- sia and so were “‘some”’ of his six children. But after a decent inter- val, Suharto may fly abroad for medical treatment, leaving his children to have to fend for them- selves. Since 1994, Suharto has been treated for hypertension, heart Dayton Daily News - disease and kidney stones. By some accounts, he has also recently suffered a mild stroke and requires kidney dialysis. Why hasn't Suharto been arrested? Partly, it’s a matter of culture. For millions of Indonesians, who grew up steeped in Javanese culture, Suharto’s coddling of his six money-minded children doesn’t seem quite as outrageous as it might to many Westerners. Here in Java, the most popu- lous central island of Indonesia, fathers are expected to coddle their children, and children are expected to honor their fathers. If a father didn’t protect his chil- dren, notes American anthropol- ogist Clifford Geertz, ‘‘then he would be no good as a father.” Suharto also benefits from ~ another bit of Javanese culture: they are courteous in the extreme. The Javanese consider it extremely bad manners to dis- play one’s displeasure in public. Nor is there much precedent for a financial inquiry of the sort that followed Marcos’s flight from Manila. The Ronald Reagan dictum “trust but verify” would strike a Javanese as insulting. When someone hands you a wad of rupiahs to pay a debt, you are expected to put it in your pocket with a smile and then count it lat- er, in private.. Beyond that, the Suharto chil- dren should be heartened that if they are trying to extricate theg- . selves and their money, they . probably have the time to dois) Arresting thern would be viewed a grave insult to Suharto, many in Indonesia honestly regard as ‘Pak Harto,”’ the eer of their country. Before making even minor decisions, Javanese tend to take what many Westerners think is a very long time. It is a tenet of Javanese culture that decisions are made slowly, through elabo- rate consultation within an ~ extended family. a And. in this case, Suharto’s family seems to be all of Indorie- sia.

        "ocr_text": "Doing business with China Georgia delegation cozies up to movers and shakers in Beijing By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Beijing — The seating arrangements at last week’s final official luncheon for a Georgia trade delegation proved the point of the mission. Scientific-Atlanta, which is angling to expand its sales in Beijing of equipment and services for satellite and cable television net- works, had a chair next to the official from the new Ministry of Information Technology. The vice president of Trackmobile Inc., the LaGrange manufacturer of mobile railcar movers, was matched up with a Chinese offi- cial from Sinorail, a company focusing on intermodal transportation that gets railway cargo to and from trucks or other transport. “Our purpose here has been to get busi- nesspeople together,” said Randolph Cardoza, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism, “to get business out in the open, to do a little deal together.” The 12-member delegation didn’t strike any new deals during five days of working meet- ings in Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing and Beijing. But the executives said they gained a closer look at the possibilities and obstacles to commerce, met potential clients or even got to know their current customers better. The absence of Gov. Zell Miller, who bowed out of the trip after his daughter-in-law was seriously injured in a car accident, lowered the trade mission’s profile to the point that the highest Chinese officials canceled meetings. The Georgia group did meet with mayors and province leaders in this country, where the government still strikes the big deals with foreign companies. The mission seemed most beneficial to the medium-size and small company less likely to be known or to have a presence already in “Our purpose here has been to get businesspeople together, to get business out in the open, to do a little deal together.” RANDOLPH CARDOZA Commissioner, Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism a China. “Anything that provides entree to higher [Chinese] officials is useful,” said James Cod- lin, vice president-marketing for Trackmo- bile. “We’re a small company. Anything that raises your status helps, and when you travel with a delegation like this you have better access.” Codlin has been doing business here for a decade and knows a seller “has to attack on two levels,” reaching both the end user — the technical person who knows what he needs — and the ministry officials who still control the purse strings. On Friday,, the Georgia delegation joined Codlin for a ceremony marking the sale of a Trackmobile 4250TM, a machine costing in the $200,000 range, to the North China Power Group for use at its Beijing No. 1 Heating and Electric Power Plant. “They'll think we’re really important now,” Codlin joked after the formalities in the power company’s cavernous conference room, which included an exchange of plaques and pre- sents, viewing a Trackmobile video narrated in Chinese and the typical photographs and less typical videotaping. Having a state commissioner and group of fellow executives on his side of the long con- ference table in fact was a boost to Codlin in a culture that pays as close attention to per- sonal relations as to position in the pecking order — in government, in business and in family life. Trackmobile’s experience exemplifies the pattern of doing business in China. In 10 years, the company has sold a handful of machines. Now this sale to a major govern- ment power group — North China’s network supplies a population of 140 million in five regions — well may be a breakthrough lead- ing to more business. “If we have good experience with your truck, you will have very good advertise- ment,” said Mei Xiaoming, the Beijing plant director. The lesson of patience and quiet persever- ance was not lost on delegation members like F. Stevenson Brice, director of strategic research initiatives for Columbus-based Syno- vus Financial Corp. “There are 1.2 billion people in China. Obviously that’s the allure of this market,” said Brice, whose company has no operations here now. “We're looking at this as a long- term prospect. From what we understand it takes a lot of time to build the relationships and get to know the people.” “Historically in China, you have to start small,” he said. “I have a healthy respect for the amount of groundwork that has to be done to do business here.” And that groundwork, as the Georgia dele- gation learned, covers a variety of cultural and professional practices foreign to the American way: from the two-handed manner of presenting business cards to the expecta- tion that one politely tastes the dishes served at a dinner. Even when that means eating snake, as the delegation did during their visit. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 26, 1998 \f"

However, it turned out that expatriate West- erners made up most of the first lunchtime Schlotzsky’s ~ cus- tomers. : “Great bread!” exclaimed Brit- ish publishing executive Natasha Millen, 25, after she had paid the equivalent of $2.98 to eat a Chi- nese-made “The Original.” It isa clone of the trademark sandwich sold in more than 673 Schlotzsky’s restaurants around the world. “Tt was a taste of home; it was perfect,” exclaimed 46-year-old Elaine Polk, who is from Waller near Houston but who has lived in Beijing for two years because her husband works for Lucent Tech- nologies here. : Her father, 70-year-old Jack Smith, who was returning as a tourist to Beijing 54 years after he visited the city as a young U.S. Ma- rine, said, “I can tell you one thing, they didn’t have a Schlotzsky’s here back then — it was just a bunch of little shacks and tin houses.” - Schlotzsky’s target audience is not foreigners but China’s emerg- ing middle class. The few Chinese who turned up for the first Schlotzsky’s lunch- its Beijing deli, three of whom are shown here, said it took them a while to figure out how to eat the Texas-sized sandwiches. AP time business said they liked what they tasted. Some also said they were puzzled about how to attack | Texas-sized Schlotzsky’s' the portions. “We had three kinds of pizza and two kinds of sandwiches,” said Ni Jing, 30, one of a table full of office workers from a Chinese book importing firm next door. “The taste was good, but I wish they had knives so that we could have shared the food among us.” “Chinese people like to share their food with other people,” agreed her friend Chang Yilin, 40. “Too bad there were no knives.” Beijing Schlotzsky’s manager Roland Liu acknowledged that it will take time to educate Chinese customers in the art of eating deli sandwiches. “Many people in China are not accustomed to eating their food from their hands,” said Liu, who went through a Schlotzsky’s train- ing course in Austin several months ago. “We plan to put pic- tures on each table showing how to hold a sandwich in your hand and eat it.” Liu, who said he is certain the Schlotzsky sandwiches will be- come popular in China, plans an official grand opening in a few days and another advertising campaign in June. “Maybe our nighttime business By JosePH ALBRIGHT AND Marcia KuNSTEL American-Statesman Intemational Staff BEIJING — Launching a business in China is no picnic, Schlotzsky’s Inc. dis- covered on Tuesday. Selling thousands of little round piles of salami and Cheddar on toasted sourdough buns in a market of 1.2 billion Chinese sounded like a sure-fire marketing concept six months ago, back in Schlotzsky's board- room in Austin. And who knows, Schlotzsky's scenario of opening 50 to 75 upscale fast-food restau- rants in China in the next five years could well yield delectable dividends. But when the doors opened for lunch Tuesday at the first Schlotzsky’s in China, customers were as scarce as forks in a Chi- will be better,” said Liu, a former member of the Coca-Cola Co. mar- keting staff in China. “I hope that tonight we'll have a lot of Chinese guys who'll come in and have a sandwich and listen to the music.” Beijing has the only Schlotzsky’s in the world offering an upstairs bar with live music. John White, head of a three- member Schlotzsky’s team from Austin that helped open the res- taurant, said Tuesday was always meant to be a “‘soft opening” to al- low the new 132-member restau- rant staff to practice interacting with the public. “We don’t want to have thou- sands of people coming in here on the first day, because it just puts too much pressure on the employ- ees,’’ said White, who was dis- patched here after presiding over the launch of Schlotzsky’s in Casa- blanca, Morocco, several months ago. : ‘Morocco was kind of a rush job, but Beijing was much smooth- er,’” White said. “Here, the em- ployees have had time to practice, practice, practice.” One of the handicaps for the first Beijing Schlotzsky’s is that the restaurant is situated several hundred yards from the. nearest large intersection, in the middle of a long block that has little foot ita miere is less than red-hot nese restaurant. Between 12:15 p.m. and 1:15 p.m., just 27 customers crossed the red-carpeted thresh- old of the big two-story, 4,500-square-foot Schlotzsky's restaurant in the Embassy Dis- trict. Nine were “lookers” who left without eating. Inside at the shiny new cash registers and nearby cappuccino bar, fresh-faced young Chinese servers outnumbered the cus- tomer's by 3-to-1. Because Austin-based Schlotzsky's has virtually no name identification in China, its Chinese partners had sent out street barkers to distribute 50,000 flyers in Chinese over the past two weeks, saying the restau- rant was going to open soon. Then on Monday, an ad appeared in the To reach Schlotzsky’s, most pe- destrians have to walk past two heavily patronized fast food out- lets, a McDonald’s and a Kentucky Fried Chicken. _As Schlotzsky’s anticipated, both of its competitors were offer- ing cheaper prices Tuesday. For the $2.98 price of one of Schlotzsky’s signature “Original” sandwiches, a McDonald’s cus- tomer could buy a Big Mac, a me- diuim-sized order of fries and a medium-sized Coke, and have about 50 cents left over. The KFC outlet was matching the McDonald’s offer with a pack- age including two fried chicken legs, a potato, salad and a roll. During a visit here from Austin three weeks ago, Karl Martin, Schlotzsky’s senior vice president for concept development, said the Schlotzsky’s restaurants will de- liberately appeal to a slightly old- er, “more sophisticated” Chinese . customer, one who is willing to spend a little more for good food and ambiance. “Our position in the market- place has moved into what we call ‘fast casual,’ ” Martin said. “We are positioned between fast food — the McDonald’s and Wendy’s of this world — and what is called ‘casual dining’ — restaurants like TGI Friday’s and the Hard Rock Cafe.” Austin American-Statesman - May 27, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "China still won’t discuss day of horror 9 years after massacre, dissent remains stifled Albri and Marcia Kurstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — A muted remark by a rick- shaw driver may turn out to be the most ringing commemoration anyone dares to utter here this week about the bloody, con- fusing events nine years ago known as the Tiananmen Square massacre. “In my personal opinion, our govern- ment may have gone a bit too far in con- trolling the students,” said Zhao Zhenqi as he pedaled his three-wheeler through the cavernous squire where the treads of Chinese tanks crunched through the tents of 5,000 pro-democracy students on the searing night of June 3-4, 1989. Zhao is no dissi- dent. And the few dissidents who still live in Beijing have no known plans to stage a public memorial this week for the 500 to 1,000 pro-democracy demon- strators gunned down or crushed to death by tanks, mostly on the routes leading to Tiananmen Square. Nor is the People’s Liberation Army likely to commemorate the soldiers, prob- ably numbering in the dozens, who were beaten to death that night by enraged Rane Area shown Beijing civilians or who suffocated in their burning tanks after being hit by Molotov cocktails. With President Clinton due at Tianan- men Square in three weeks to receive Chi- na’s ritual greeting, Chinese officials seem intent on guaranteeing that the massacre’s ninth anniversary will pass without notice. Security agents reportedly have placed dozens of former protesters and their fam- ilies under intense surveillance. It was only in China's semi-autonomous region of Hong Kong that critics felt safe enough to speak out about the Tiananmen anniversary. They held a march Sunday and plan a candlelight vigil Thursday. Much of their criticism targeted Clinton's decision to participate in an offi- cial Chinese welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square. Clinton will be the first U.S. president to visit China since the massacre, which caused the administra- tion of President George Bush to impose sanctions, which are still in effect, on mili- tary and other transactions. Bush traveled to China in February 1989, several months before the Tianan- men Square incident. Sensitivity about the still vivid images of Tiananmen and the brutal use of force against the demonstrators has created an awkward situation for the Clinton White House. Some voiced fears that Clinton's visit will amount to a Western declaration of absolution for China even though the Com- munist government continues to hold hun- dreds of Tiananmen demonstrators in prisons for ‘‘counter-revolutionary crimes.” TIANANMEN SQUARE cre Hackmticn beers cee remains an open sore.

Several thousand other Hong Kong residents marched Sunday in a noisy but peaceful protest through the downtown streets from Victoria Park to the Hong Kong government office complex. Chinese police made no effort to block the protest, which was the first major street demonstration in Hong Kong since the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule last summer. The critics in Hong Kong were trying to train the world’s outrage on one of the more influential but perplexing historical events of the 20th century. Even nine years after the mas- sacre, historians around the world are uncertain about exactly what happened that night in Tianan- men Square. Clearly, events started to build toward crisis on April 17, 1989, when a few thousand students from Beijing University rallied in Tiananmen Square to mourn the liberal Communist leader Hu Yaobang, who had died of a heart attack. Emboldened when authorities didn’t interfere, the students began to decry corruption and nepotism in the Chinese Commu- nist Party. This escalated the next day into a student sit-in near the Great Hall of the People. By mid-May 1989, the crowds grew to 1 million, and the govern- ment declared martial law to reclaim control of the square. Most students left. But a dedi- cated core of about 10,000 encamped in tents. Soon they began to attract mass support from ordinary Beijingers, who took to the streets in the hundreds of thousands and set up barri- cades to try and stop military con- voys heading for the square. After weeks of hesitation, troops loyal to Communist leader Deng Xiaoping began converging on Tiananmen Square around 10 p.m. on June 3. At first, unarmed civilians blocked their passage. Then troops opened fire and killed scores or hundreds as they punched their way eastward along the Avenue of Eternal Peace toward Tiananmen. Han, the Hong Kong labor activist, remembered being awak- ened at 11 p.m. in his tent in Tiananmen Square and seeing the pink streaks of tracer bullets against the night sky. Two hours later, as the troops were almosi upon him, Han heeded warnings from a group of students and made his way eastward out of the square. “I saw a man trying to lift a bicycle,” Han remembered. “He was using only his left hand — the ght side of his body was all Even nine years later, histo- rians are uncertain about exactly what happened that night in Tiananmen Square. bloody.” At 1:30 am. on June 4 — around the time Han left the square — Chinese troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers reached Tiananmen, the world’s largest public square. A controversy still swirls about what happened then. Angry accounts by some Chi- nese dissidents would later speak of massive bloodshed inside Tiananmen Square, caused when troops with AK-47s opened fire directly into unarmed crowds of students. A quite different eyewitness version came from Robin Munro, a 37-year-old Chinese-speaking Scottish observer from Human Rights Watch, who happened to be one of the handful of Western- ers who stayed in Tiananmen Square throughout the five-hour army takeover. His account — now accepted by many Western China-watchers — suggests that by far the bloodiest episodes of the ‘Tiananmen Square massacre” actually occurred on access roads well outside the 100-acre square. Within the square, he found few killed. Munro said the students’ medi- cal tent in Tiananmen received about 10 to 15 dead or wounded, and doctors told him many of the injured were carried in from out- side Tiananmen. , “T saw a long thin line of troops advancing into the square,” Munro remembered in a Hong Kong interview with the Cox News Service. “They leveled their rifles and opened fire. I dropped to the ground behind a pile of bicycles and so did the students near me. Then I saw them get up and run toward the south. I believed at the time that the troops must have been firing blanks. But I later decided they must have been fir- ing slightly over the heads of the students.” Munro said that after a three- hour standoff, the remaining sev- eral thousand students took a voice vote and marched out of the square, many of them in tears. Munro said it was then — about 5 am. — that a line of Chinese army tanks began rumbling southward through the square. He recalled the tanks crushing the 33-foot-tall Goddess of Liberty statue and then rumbling through the student tent city that appeared to him to be virtually empty.

In a ceremony dramatized by thunder and lightning amid the sweet, sad tones of traditional Chinese music, a crowd that organizers estimated at 40,000 carried off a peaceful rally in Victoria Park.

He thanked them for braving the lousy weather and expressed hopes that he one day will be permitted to join demonstrators back in his homeland to mark the June 4 massacre. \f"

It will create a mammoth reservoir 370 miles long and produce electric power equivalent to the output of 18 nuclear plants. But the water will cover 66,700 acres of farmland By Marcia Kunste: and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Three Gorges Dam, China Every day 18,000 Chinese mobilize to build the most power- ful — and most disparaged — hydro-electric dam in the world. Within five years, the Three Gorges Dam will stretch 1.4 miles across the Yangtze River and cre- ate a mammoth reservoir 370 miles long. Some Chinese call this dam the modern Great Wall. But it is not a place politically cautious visitors like President Clinton — soon to spend nine days in China — will come and admire as a new national icon. The dam is suffused in contro- versy as thick as the river mists enfolding the construction cranes angling high over the river. Workers will not only reconfig- ure this site but also flood the beautiful Three Gorges canyons that have inspired Chinese poets for centuries. And they will trig- ger the eviction of more than a million Chinese along the river. “China is still a poor country,” Lu Youmei, general manager of the China Three Gorges Project Corp., said. ‘To catch up to mod- ern conditions in developed coun- tries, we may need half a century or even a century. The Chinese have many things to do.” Lu is convinced the state- constructed hydroelectric dam will boost China in its run toward modernity, producing electric power equivalent to the output of 18 nuclear plants, diminishing the threat of floods and making navi- gation more efficient. MARCIA KUNSTEL / Staff Two women watch the construction of the massive Three Gorges Dam. When the water reaches its ultimate height 575 feet higher than the present level, it will flood the mystically beautiful Three Gorges canyons that have inspired Chinese poets for centuries. It also will trigger the eviction of more than | million Chinese who fish and farm and trade along the river that carries their liveli- hood and sometimes their destruction. Opponents who think they still can stop the Three Gorges Dam — warning of environmental dev- astation and social dislocation — had better think again. Thou- sands of Chinese already have been relocated, as new towns rise on riverbank heights to replace the low-lying buildings exploded into rubble. In five years, Lu’s corporation has spent $3.7 billion, harnessed the Yangtze into a channel to drain a river bed building site, planted one stout end of the dam and blasted a massive stair- stepped pit into the reddish- brown earth where shipping locks will carry multi-ton vessels past the dam.

STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Shanghai, China — Fearing that the Chinese Central Bank will finally buckle in the face of the Asian financial crisis, inves- tors unloaded shares in Chinese “red chip” state enterprises Wednesday as their computer screens showed pessimism in vir- tually every Asian financial cen- ter within 1,000 miles. Just 15 days before President Clinton is due to land in China for his already controversial state visit, markets from Taiwan to Australia jiggled downward on fears of a Chinese devaluation. The Shanghai Stock Ex- change’s index of Chinese state corporations open to restricted foreign stock trading fell 3.6 percent. The decline was more pro- nounced in Hong Kong, where the index of mainland Chinese- backed “red chip” shares tum- bled 5.08 percent, on top of an 8.S2 percent fall Tuesday. Despite this, central bankers and many economists are confi- dent that strong fundamentals in the United States and Europe will shield them from any worsening of Asia’s economic crisis. But markets and investors are having a tough time buying into this sanguine outlook, given the Persistent weakness in Japan’s yen and the growing threat of currency devaluations throughout the region. What might explain these sharply differing views is an assessment of how Asia’s troubles could be transmitted quickly to economies that are otherwise healthy. For the more optimistic, the economies in Europe and the United States appear well- insulated, given their long- stan: monetary policies that have facilitated growth. - currency Although the sliding yen will make Japanese exports cheaper and therefore more competitive in North America and some other markets, most experts agreed that the advantage to Japan will be marginal. On the other hand, the fall in the yen will make Japa- nese imports more expensive and above all will heighten the anxi- ety of Japan’s consumers over the way their economy is performing. The Chinese government fears the yen’s fall could have a severe impact on China’s economy, reducing Beijing’s exports and lessening investment from abroad. China and Japan are major trading partmers, and the Chinese are worried that Japan’s financial problems will lead Tokyo to cut its investments in Chinese industries. Though China desperately wants to Keep its currency stable in the runup to Clinton’s June 25- July 3 visit, it has been forced to admit that the Asian crisis has dimmed its 20-year economic miracle. After months of rock-solid Chi- mese pledges that there will be no devaluation of the Chinese cur- rency under any circumstances, Chinese Central Bank governor Dai Xianglong told a Beijing financial seminar Tuesday that the persistent decline of the Japa- mese yen had caused “very unfa- vorable effects’”” on the Chinese economy. Dai insisted that the Chinese “remains stable.” But traders across Asia were dubious after a Reuters news report dis- closed that Dai had omitted a standard boilerplate passage from his prepared text, which usually contains the assurance that the Chinese yuan’s exchange rate “will not change.” Taiwan, whose entrepreneurs have invested billions on the Chi- mese mainland, was one of a half- dozen Asian storm centers buf- feted by market pressures Wednesday. The Taiwan dollar slid to its lowest mark against the American dollar in 11 years, while the Taiwan stock market fell to a seven-month low. Australia, heavily invested throughout Asia, saw its dollar whacked by heavy selling pres- sure that sent the currency to ape me all-time low against the The local currencies in Thai- Signifying rush by the rich of Asia to park their liquid assets in U.S. dollars. China is caught between two strong, contradictory pressures. The drop of the Japanese yen and other disorders in the econo- ries of Asian neighbors are push- ing China toward a decision to chop the value of the yuan, also known as the renminbi, to save its own economy. At the same time, Western leaders have been lauding China as the world’s chief hope for stav- ing off even more widespread Asian financial chaos by keeping the Chinese currency steady. In an interview Wednesday, Shanghai Deputy Mayor Zhou Muyao cited three impacts of the Asian financial crisis on China: mw China has “encountered some difficulties” in its exports of tex- tile products and other labor- intensive goods. w@ The influx of foreign capital, 2specially from Southeast Asia, ‘is reducing.” = The numbers of tourists from Asian countries “are plummet- ing.” ““People in China in all walks of life are paying attention to this development [the drop of the yen],” Zhou said, while express- ing confidence that the trouble in Japan will not force China to bring down the value of its cur- rency to regain a competitive edge. Western praise for China’s defense of its currency has been abundant. Former U.S. President George Bush, in Beijing at an economic conference this week. was quoted by the official China Daily newspaper as saying, “Chi- na’s action in dealing with the cri- Sis is responsible and bold.” It was at the same meeting that bank governor Dai gave what Asian traders took as hints that China will ultimately be forced to devalue. “We hope the Japanese govern- ment can adopt effective mea- as to stabilize the yen,” Dai said.

        "ocr_text": "Prosperity gaining on poverty outside China’s urban centers By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Guo Yuan, China — Gazing down over green rice shoots that forever have been the Chinese peasant’s sweaty handhold on life, Zhan Hanjuin couldn’t dis- miss the broad grin that had played across his face all afternoon. It was still hard for him to believe he was standing atop his _ own new, two-story house with a fish pond on the roof, a Volkswa- ' gen Santana in the garage and a ' six-foot-high air conditioner in the parlor. Just 25 years ago, Zhan and his new bride shared a house with his parents, two brothers and their families. They worked on a col- ' lective farm and didn’t have elec- ' tricity, much less electronics like ‘ the television and stereo orna- » menting Zhan’s year-old house. ; Zhan, 48, is a top-of-the-line “peasant.” But millions of Chinese fami- lies have pulled themselves out of . exhausting poverty since land ' reform began handing them con- | trol of China’s rice paddies and’ grain fields in the early 1980s. “Peasants can arrange their work and living schedule on their ; own,” he told a visitor. “In their spare time they have the freedom to look for opportunities to earn a lot of money.” About 50 million mostly rural Chinese remain overwhelmed by | deep poverty, according to gov- ernment statistics, but that is dra- _ matically less than the 250 mil- lion in 1978. Back then the Zhan family was among the poor. The grain farmers of northern China accrue less from reform than farmers in this south-central rice bow], where tiny plots of land ’ give lucrative yields. Yet peas- . ants throughout the country are ' seeing lifestyle improvements at the very time urban workers are suffering from growing unempl ent. A ride through Hunan Prov- ince shows what that means in the rice paddies patchworking the countryside. The verdant landscape is flecked with two-story homes in the same white, brick-sized tiles that cover Zhan’s house. Some tiled roofs make orange-red splashes on the landscape. Many are additions built onto older adobe or concrete slab buildings, and many still are under construction. The majority of peasants in Hunan Province, population 62 million, look to be living in spa- cious, if rather basic, comfort. How to explain this agricul- tural success story, when the other giant of collective farms — Russia — has been almost totally unable to retreat from the com- munist style of communal farm work and continues to experience a draining slump in output? The biggest difference is that China eliminated collectives and divided the land among families. Chinese farmers don’t have full ownership, since they cannot sell, develop or lease the land allotted them. But the crops are theirs to keep or sell. And they expect their grandchildren to farm the same fields. MARCIA KUMNSTEL / Cox Mews In Hunan Province, 70 percent of farmers no longer live in pov- erty, said Wu Hedging, a province spokesman. “Today peasants spend 25 per- cent of the time they used to [spend] farming the land,” said Wu. “Now they have incentives to work, because they get every- thing they grow. And now they can engage in business in their free time. That used to be prohibited.” A smooth blending Under the collective system, peasants were paid according to the number of days in the fields. Working slowly was to their advantage. Now farmers get in and cut of the fields at full tilt, so they can make money working in small factories or running their own businesses. The Guo Yuan Township Vehicle and Parts Factory molded itself seamlessly to the changes. Employing 43 people when it started producing small tools and plows in 1971, the enterprise now has 700 to 1,400 workers hammering together bright blue farm trucks. Plant director Jiang Yitian said the factory rolls out about 10,000 trucks a year. He finds the cycli- cal nature of farm work compati- ble _ with the - - Wealthier im their work: Zhan Hanjuin and wife (right) stand by the new house they built, with comforts made possible by ris-— ing rural incomes. demand for trucks. Both require part-time workers. “When we have orders they come to work. Then when they’re free they go back to the land,” Jiang said. His factory hands earn an average of 500 yuan ($60) a month, about as much as low-end urban workers. China’s dense, double-crop cul- tivation of rice has enabled farm- ers here to prosper even with small land allotments. The dirt road leading back to Huang Jianxia’s place, for exam- ple, passes a rice paddy so tiny it looks scarcely big enough to feed his family a year of dinners. Yet with three of those small fields called mu — each mu is about one-sixth of an acre — Huang manages harvests totaling more than four tons of rice every year. Adding the income from the pigs his wife raises, this becomes another “peasant” family that no longer qualifies for the moniker. “In the past we got only 600 kilograms (1,320 pounds) of rice for each mu we farmed,” said Huang, 45. Huang also is a carpenter, though he said selling his tables and doors and beds is harder these days since neighbors buy so \fAgricultural success: The rural poor of this populous nation are seeing lifestyles improve. | cheaply in the city. Still, his family income aver- ages 1,500 to 1,660 yuan a month, or about $180 to $200. Though low by Western standards, 1,500 yuan a month is an enviable wage in China. Recent government statistics show that even in the biggest cit- ies only 8 percent of the workers earn 1,500 yuan or more. Local officials described Hua- ng’s household as about median income for province farmers, and this tallied with observations in the Hunan countryside. His quarters aren’t as lavish as those of the Zhan family, but Huang, his wife and 16-year-old son enjoy a comfortably large house with spare furniture, a tele- vision, a refrigerator, a ceiling fan and perhaps most importantly an electric pump that carries well water to an indoor standpipe. “We don’t hold much hope to buy a car, but we do hope to have more household appliances. And more in the bank,” Huang said. Zhan has done better for two reasons: he has six mu of land in rice and orchards, double Hua- ng’s holdings, and off-season he does lucrative construction work. His family’s income averages 2,500 to 4,200 yuan a month. At the upper end, that equals $508 or nearly $6,100 annually. It isn’t easy money. Zhan and his wife do all the farm work now that their two grown sons no longer live at home, but the farmer said he still has plenty of energy to do construction engi- neering in the city between crop demands. “We are sure that if the world will stay peaceful,” Zhan said, “the life of peasants will become better and better.” Chinese peasants show entrepreneurial spirit By Marcia Kunstel STAFF Shaoshan, China — The adobe house where Mao Tse-tung grew up is a shrine not just to the father of Communist China, but to the spirit of the peasants who helped him fight a revolution.

        "ocr_text": "China market: Motorola ‘reaching Pouring in investment: U.S. electronics giant is opening doors on new offices and new opportunities. By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS ’ Beijing — Multicolored con- fetti fluttered in the breeze as Motorola’s board chairman hosted a grand opening party Thursday for the tower that is an emblem of the company’s growing $1.1 bil- lion investment in China. “China and Motorola — Reach- ing For the Sky,” read a red-and- white banner draped on a wall outside. The new 18-story Motorola North Asia Center, a curved sky blue glass tower in the heart of Beijing’s most prestigious busi- ness district, will house 1,000 of Motorola’s 10,000 employees in China. The occupants, many of whom moved into their offices Thursday, include beeper sales managers, trademark piracy law- yers and Iridium satellite engineers. Motorola also opened the doors on a museum inside the head- quarters featuring a 10-foot-tall mock-up of a Chinese Long March 2C rocket. The display depicts launching a pair of Motorola com- munications satellites for the company’s nearly completed Irid- ium global satellite phone network. China already has launched six of the 72 satellites for Iridium and is due to shoot up two more Irid- ium satellites within a month. “This building is a reflection of the distance that Motorola has traveled in China in a relatively short time, just over 10 years,” Motorola chairman Gary Tooker told his Chinese employees. Although the yearlong Asian financial crisis has whacked Motorola’s profits and forced the company to cut its worldwide payroll by 15,000 jobs, Tooker’s presence symbolized the compa- |». ny’s bullish outlook on this technology-crazed nation. Today, Tooker plans to host a second grand opening, to which Motorola customers and Chinese government officials are invited. In 10 days, Motorola plans a third high-profile appearance during President Clinton’s visit to China. Either Tooker or another top Motorola executive will partici- pate in a June 29 deal-signing ceremony with Chinese officials at the Great Hall of the People, Motorola officials said. One of at least two Motorola deals set to be signed is the ratifi- cation of a $225 million invest- ment disclosed last November in Motorola’s Leshan-Phoenix joint venture in Sichuan province. That’s where Chinese workers already manufacture 1.4 billion semiconductor components per year. Motorola Vice President Shelagh Lester-Smith, chief spokesperson for the Asia-Pacific region, said Motorola’s employ- ment in China has been rising at the same time the company has “reduced its head count” in the Philippines and Singapore. “It would be totally inaccurate to think we are building up ow numbers in China at the expense of employment elsewhere in the world,” she said. “What we are doing is looking to serve our mar-. kets in the way they need to be served.” Since the company arrived in China 11 years ago, Motorola (China) Electronics Ltd. has established ventures in provinces around the country and grown into China’s largest wholly owned Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 19, GREG BAKER / Associated Press American corporate subsidiary. The Wall Street Journal has reported that China generated $3.5 billion in revenue for the Motorola parent company last year. Motorola has created seven joint ventures and four coopera- tive projects, ranging from the production of automotive elec- tronics in Shanghai to software development at Beijing’s Qinghua University. “With more favorable tariff reductions on imported equip- ment for high-tech manufacturing and-other indicators of long-term growth, Motorola expects to have invested [in China] a total of $2.5 billion by 2000,” the company declared in an annual report on its China operations passed out Thursday.

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE Beijing f the news coverage surrounding President Clinton’s trip to China Thursday through July 3 intrigues you — perhaps even sinks a hook in your wanderlust — make a plan and goforit. . You'll find that China offers spectacu- lar travel — riveting vistas, exotic cul- tures embracing thousands of years and enticing food on almost every corner of every city. But while China is more tourist-friendly than ever, you should also recognize that this still isn’t a coun- try for the haphazard traveler — except one who is very experienced, very patient or well-versed in Chinese. The tourist infrastructure is still build- ing, which means the Chinese working the taxis, trains and hotels often aren’t equipped to meet the needs of the trav- eler without a group or a guide. You will be hard-pressed to find an English speaker even at a place as cos- mopolitan as the Beijing train station. (Our lessons in Mandarin proved critical the first night we arrived in Beijing. Our train was two hours late, and the travel agent who was supposed to meet us at the train station had deserted, leaving us to track down luggage in an unmarked back room, then negotiate a little-used customs office and find a midnight taxi at a remote corner of the station.) And few cities outside Beijing and | Shanghai bother to transliterate street ' signs into pinyin, the Latin equivalent of Chinese characters that enables western- er's to follow a map. That said, even the most inexperi- -enced tourist can select from the huge palette of sites available in China and create a wonderful vacation. It requires Adventurous? Take the China challenge some groundwork, but then so does most foreign travel. (“Fodor's China,” $20, may be the most helpful guidebook for the American tourist, but the ones from Lonely Planet, Rough Guide and Blue Guide are also good.) Taking a package tour or traveling independently may be a harder decision in China than elsewhere. You will almost certainly run into glitches if you go it alone. The question is how easily you can adjust to complications. Your American travel agent can make bookings if you opt out of a group trip, but normally cannot hand over to you in advance the tickets for internal China transportation. Foreign travel agencies must rely on the government’s China International Travel Services, which tries hard but may fall short of success. Minutes before flight time, we have been handed tickets with the wrong return flight. We’ve also encountered other travelers who either got incorrect tickets or were missing tickets when CITS delivered them to the hotel. CITS insists on parceling out tickets as you travel through your itinerary, rather than issuing a full set when you arrive. That leaves scant time for fixing errors. Another alternative is arranging trans- portation as you go. It sounds daunting, but is easy. Travel agencies have offices in most major hotels and can write air and train tickets on the spot, though mak- -ing such late reservations carries a small tisk of your chosen flight being booked. .One pitfall: You will probably find the departure city and the destination writ- ten in Chinese characters. To get around this, ask the travel agent to give you a computer printout of the itinerary. You don’t need a guide to walk you through major airports, since signs and announcements are in both Chinese and English. Flight attendants also use both Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 21, 1998 > languages, but communication much beyond “coffee” or “beer” might strain the relationship. Air travel is a confidence-building experience. Many airlines use Boeing jets on internal routes, and all follow: international standards — no goats on board or passengers sitting on suitcases in the aisles, as happens in Russia. Another consideration is whether you can handle a flight that gets diverted. We ran into a Canadian couple who related the harrowing experience of making an unscheduled landing at a small regional airport near Chongqing due to weather. No one spoke English, and local Chinese verged on a brawl because even they could get no information for hours on when flights might resume. But these chance complications are minimal and normally can be overcome with patience. Many travelers prefer such risks to the homogenization of group travel. We would rather spend time harassing a CITS agent than waiting for 200 people to get on and off the buses. Especially if you're traveling outside a tour group, you may well find it worth the cost to stay at an internationally rec- ognized hotel. The guidebooks list plenty, and your travel agent can add hundreds now that good hotels are proliferating across China. Outside Beijing and Shang- hai, a nice room costs about $120 a night. One easy pick is Holiday Inn, which is not the priciest and offers two dozen hotels in China. These are true havens when you come back exhausted from crowded, dusty streets, having seen one fried chicken foot too many, and find yourself longing for a chef's salad in front of an in-house movie in English. Yet the Inns carry a local flavor, includ- ing their Chinese restaurants that are as savory as those on the street and have more reliable sanitation standards. The Holiday Inn is so attuned to west- ern needs that it is the only hotel we’ve seen with conspicuous signs in every room warning not to drink the tap water. Our advice: Never drink tap water any- where, unless your hotel tells you water has been safely purified in its own plant. A western hotel also can help arrange a city or museum tour, whether they have such excursions scheduled or must ring an agent to find you a personal guide. For the latter you may have to pout a bit, but there usually is an English-speaking concierge who can be convinced to help. As for restaurants, they’re every- where, and we have yet to stumble across atruly bad one. You do, however, want to take care in ordering. Chinese cuisine in China isn’t necessarily the same as what appears on the table in Atlanta. At one of — our favorite places in Beijing, the wait- ress jokes about bringing us snake — and she wouldn’t have to go far because they’re sitting in the window tank next to the eels, Unless you read Chinese, you ought to ask if a restaurant has an English- language menu. What you want is a “ying-wen de cai dan.” Otherwise, you may end up with pig ears or the ubiqui- tous chicken feet. Neighborhood restaurants are usually much better, as well as much cheaper than most hotel eateries with dumbed- ° down cuisines. Two can dine out for less than $10. Consider at least one leg of travel by boat or train. Either will give you a close-up view of the countryside where two-thirds of China’s 1.2 billion people live.

        "ocr_text": "languages, but communication much beyond “coffee” or “beer” might strain the relationship. Air travel is a confidence-building experience. Many airlines use Boeing jets on internal routes, and all follow: international standards — no goats on board or passengers sitting on suitcases in the aisles, as happens in Russia. Another consideration is whether you can handle a flight that gets diverted. We ran into a Canadian couple who related the harrowing experience of making an unscheduled landing at a small regional airport near Chongqing due to weather. No one spoke English, and local Chinese verged on a brawl because even they could get no information for hours on when flights might resume. But these chance complications are minimal and normally can be overcome with patience. Many travelers prefer such risks to the homogenization of group travel. We would rather spend time harassing a CITS agent than waiting for 200 people to get on and off the buses. Especially if you're traveling outside a tour group, you may well find it worth the cost to stay at an internationally rec- ognized hotel. The guidebooks list plenty, and your travel agent can add hundreds now that good hotels are proliferating across China. Outside Beijing and Shang- hai, a nice room costs about $120 a night. One easy pick is Holiday Inn, which is not the priciest and offers two dozen hotels in China. These are true havens when you come back exhausted from crowded, dusty streets, having seen one fried chicken foot too many, and find yourself longing for a chef's salad in front of an in-house movie in English. Yet the Inns carry a local flavor, includ- ing their Chinese restaurants that are as savory as those on the street and have more reliable sanitation standards. The Holiday Inn is so attuned to west- ern needs that it is the only hotel we’ve seen with conspicuous signs in every room warning not to drink the tap water. Our advice: Never drink tap water any- where, unless your hotel tells you water has been safely purified in its own plant. A western hotel also can help arrange a city or museum tour, whether they have such excursions scheduled or must ring an agent to find you a personal guide. For the latter you may have to pout a bit, but there usually is an English-speaking concierge who can be convinced to help. As for restaurants, they’re every- where, and we have yet to stumble across atruly bad one. You do, however, want to take care in ordering. Chinese cuisine in China isn’t necessarily the same as what appears on the table in Atlanta. At one of — our favorite places in Beijing, the wait- ress jokes about bringing us snake — and she wouldn’t have to go far because they’re sitting in the window tank next to the eels, Unless you read Chinese, you ought to ask if a restaurant has an English- language menu. What you want is a “ying-wen de cai dan.” Otherwise, you may end up with pig ears or the ubiqui- tous chicken feet. Neighborhood restaurants are usually much better, as well as much cheaper than most hotel eateries with dumbed- ° down cuisines. Two can dine out for less than $10. Consider at least one leg of travel by boat or train. Either will give you a close-up view of the countryside where two-thirds of China’s 1.2 billion people live.

        "ocr_text": "China trip: Much pomp, fewer goals President to spotlight pace of change, trade By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Xian, China — President Clinton arrives here Thursday to kick off the longest presidential visit to any country in nearly 80 years, a trip overshadowed by controversy and foreshadowed by limited expectations, Since President Woodrow Wilson steamed to Paris in 1919 to midwife creation of the League of Nations, no American president has made such an extensive tour of a single foreign country. Clinton is sure to be trailed by congressional crit- icism of his policies, from human rights to technol- ogy transfers, But his nine-day trip carries limited stated ambitions, and he is not likely to face the risk that Wilson took — and lost. The idealistic Wilson spent more than two months negotiating in France, then for his trouble got a con- gressional thumbs down on American membership in the new international assembly he was convinced could insure world peace. Two of the other lengthiest presidential sojourns also were to China. President Richard Nixon ended a quarter-century of hostility with the Chinese dur- na, is an ideal place to open his nine-day tour. Dur- ing the Tang Dynasty in 900 A.D., Xian (pronounced Shee-an) welcomed foreign dignitaries with the same pomp and color that will greet the first family Thursday when drummers, pipers and lavishly cos- tumed dancers perform before the romantic back- drop of the walled old city’s south gate. Better yet, Xian is not the focus of a single con- gressional gripe over administration policy, Nor has it been the seat of government for the last 1,100 years, 80 the president can put off for a couple of days the talks with China’s steel-willed leaders that aren’t expected to produce much substance. “At least there’s a ceremonial significance,” said Charles Wu, general manager of IBM China Co., Inc. “It may even surpass the results the Reagan visit was able to generate.” But Wu said he would be surprised at any big immediate breakthroughs, such as clinching an agreement that would allow China to enter the World Trade Organization. Wu said he would be happy if Clinton’s tour creates sufficient good feel- ings for the Chinese to “shorten the cycle times” for U.S. companies to get approval to conduct and expand operations. On the Chinese side, weapons expert Shen Dingli, director of international programs at Shanghai’s Fudan University, said he believes the Americans will be denied a priority item on their wish list — China’s signature on the Missile Technology Control ing his seven-day visit in 1972. President Ronald Regime Reagan made a six-day trip in 1984 that was per- ceived as mainly symbolic but led to an unprece- dented era of warming in the two nations’ relationship. Clinton 8 y is aot ina erosscurent of dnd . Missiles of an China had provisionally accepted the missile regime when it prohibited transfer or sale to another country of missiles with a range of more than 180 miles and capability to carry weapons of mass destruction. The updated protocol applies to ange, which China has resisted, “A missile can deliver warheads, conventional or nuclear-tipped. A jet can also deliver bombs, So why only restrain missiles and not other types of delivery techniques?” Shen asked, referring to the US. F-16 fighter jets that America sometimes sells abroad. “You [Americans] can afford not to export mis- siles because you can export warplanes, even to a part of China,” said Shen, raising another, and prob- ably the primary, reason the Chinese are unwilling to join the MTCR. Refusal is a bargaining tool to get the Americans to stop selling F-16s to Taiwan, the island province that broke away from China after the Communist revolution. One potential agreement Shen cited is the addi- tion of a verification article to the protocol on bio- logical weapons control. In Washington, talk also has focused on the possi- bility of both sides agreeing to de-target nuclear missiles aimed at the other. And in Beijing, a proposal is circulating for stabi- lizing the precarious nuclear arms situation in the Indian subcontinent after both India and Pakistan exploded nuclear weapons last month. The plan would end sanctions against Pakistan — a friend of China — and give the country incentives to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The assumption is that helping Pakistan upgrade its conventional weapons capability would convince it to freeze its nuclear program. Whether deals are struck or not, one clear aim of the White House is sending Americans a new view of fast-changing life in China, which the administra- tion hopes will dilute criticism of Clinton's policy of engaging with China despite its continuing poor record on human rights. From Xian, Clinton will head to Beijing, Shang- hai, Guilin and Hong Kong. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 24, 1998 \f"

He’s become a tourist attraction for visitors to the nearby city of Xian, and he sits for hours signing auto- graphs for lines of tourists. Friday, Yang’s fame is likely to go global. He has been invited to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton and tell him how his shovel helped open an archaeological attraction that rivals the Greek Parthenon and Egypt's Val- ley of the Kings. “Many visitors like to meet the dis- coverer,” said the director of the terra cotta warriors museum, Wu Yondi. The museum staff has erected a red-carpeted staircase to allow the Clintons to be the first foreign visitors since 1993 to descend into the 700- foot-long underground “Pit No. 1” con- taining the most perfectly preserved of the 7,500 terra cotta warriors. Queen Elizabeth and President Ronald Reagan were granted access to the same pit floor in the 1980s. But in 1993, the pit was closed to all outsid- ers to avoid the risk of damaging the artifacts. Recent tourists and state vis- itors have viewed the warriors only from an elevated platform. What Yang the Discoverer is pre- paring to tell Clinton is a modern ZHAO XIAOGUANG / Special Yang Zhifa was drilling a well when he hit something unusual — the first of thousands of terra cotta warriors, dating from China's first emperor. legend — one confirmed as authentic by archaeologists. In 1974, Yang was one of 400 mem- bers of the Xiyang “production team,” as villages were then called. “They needed someone to drill a well because the wheat needed water very much, so they asked me and another man,” Yang recalled. They struck water on their first try and were told to drill a second well. After digging for two days, they struck a layer of red dirt they thought looked baked. “I was confused,” he said. “Here, the earth is yellow.” Then “my shovel hit something,” Yang remembered. “We thought it was a piece of pottery because it was open at the top, like a vase.” They had dug through the top of an earth-and-wood structure built by Chi- na’s first emperor, the ruthless vision- ary Qin Shihuang. Determined to achieve eternal life in an underworld of his own creation, Qin dragooned tens of thousands of artisans to craft an underground city as his tomb. Some chroniclers claimed it was complete with a bronze floor and with rivers of flowing mercury. Hundreds of workmen allegedly were killed later to keep the secret of what was inside. Though Qin’s fabled city of the afterlife hasn’t been fully excavated, Yang stumbled on something that will be hard for any later discoverer to match, It was the buried war machine Qin planned to command in his next life: an army of terra cotta figures, complete with chariots, swords and bronze arrows tipped with lead poison. Yang foresaw none of this when his shovel hit the first warrior’s neck. All he could tell was that this was a very strange-looking pot. “When we started digging from the neck to the shoulders, the earth became very soft, easier to dig.” They soon uncovered an almost- intact terra cotta warrior. They acci- dentally broke the left leg during the digging, but they did manage to uncover the head that had gotten sepa- rated from the neck. They also found a buried trove of ancient bows and bronze arrows. The village was just 200 meters away, and word began to spread when the two peasants walked home for lunch. Around the middle of that first day Yang and his partner decided it would be best to lift the statue out of the hole so they could go on with their task of well-digging. Unable to lift it — the warriors weigh 240 to 660 pounds each — Yang and his partner hacked the terra-cotta statue into pieces with their shovels. It wasn't long before an elderly woman neighbor, a Buddhist, warned that this was probably a buried figure of Buddha. That’s when village opinion turned against Yang and his partner. “We thought it was not good to break a god,” he said. The next day, Yang’s boss at the production team reported the strange discovery to cultural officials in Lintong County, who ordered Yang to send in the statue fragments for analy- sis. The pieces filled three big wheelbarrows. The well hole was turned over to the archaeologists, who were given urgent orders to excavate the site without delay. Five years after the discovery of the first warrior, the Chinese public was allowed into a big hangar-like museum structure that by now holds hundreds of terra cotta warriors, lined up in sol- emn rows to battle on behalf of the spirit of Emperor Qin.

        "ocr_text": " President denounces exclusion of reporters STAFF CORRESPONDENTS President Clinton kicked off a nine-day China tour Wednesday, but not before assailing the coun- try’s harsh press controls. Beijing, he said, is waging ‘a losing battle” in attempting to manage an open economy with a repressive government. Clinton criticized Beijing in a hastily called White House inter- view with three journalists China has barred from covering the Ppresident’s visit. He told the reporters two Americans and one Indian, who work for Radio Free Asia that China had “made a mistake” in revoking their visas over the . weekend, and he said the move illustrated a chasm between the * United States and China. “It’s a losing battle to try to “keep ideas that are contrary to ‘ Official dogma out of the public debate,”? Clinton said. “Oppres- “sive government, in the end, will “be resisted by people and, in the end, is inconsistent with develop- ing a free economy.’’ . Clinton made the remarks in a 45-minute Oval Office interview, while the presidential helicopter, Marine One, waited on the South Lawn to take him, first lady Hill- ary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, to Andrews Air Force Base, Md., for their Air Force One flight to China. Clinton is to arrive today in the ancient city of Xian, becoming the first American president to visit China since troops crushed a democracy movement at Tianan- men Square on June 4, 1989.

But the Radio Free Asia flap underscored the continuing dif- ferences between the two Pacific giants. “It shows you the downside of the government over in Beijing,’’ said Radio Free Asia’s executive editor, Dan Southerland. “Despite all the talk of change, and they have opened up in many ways... there is still a lot of information that is not available to the Chi- nese people.’’ Radio Free Asia is funded by the U.S. government in an effort to counter China’s state- controlled media with alternative news, often laced with critiques of Beijing’s repressive human rights Practices. 4 Meanwhile in China, former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, ousted in 1989 on the eve of the bloody crackdown on dem- onstrations in Tiananmen Square, has written a letter asking the party’s current leaders to admit that the move against the student- led protests was a grave mistake. Zhao’s letter said the killing of hundreds of civilian pro- democracy protesters was “fone of the biggest human rights prob- lems this century.’’ Clinton is under fire from many members of Congress and human rights groups in the United States for agreeing to attend an official welcoming cer- emony next to the square. White House aides have said that Clinton will speak up about human rights problems in China during his trip, but that he will not attempt to meet with any Chi- nese dissidents.

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — Mao Tse-tung’s ghostly portrait beamed down on Tiananmen Square as China pre- pared an ear-splitting 21-gun salute Saturday for President Clinton. Clinton began his China tour with robed dancers and heart- thudding drumbeats at China’s old imperial capital of Xian on Thursday night, but the events Saturday at Beijing’s infamous downtown square will be the centerpiece of his nine-day visit. “If China will cooperate with America, then nobody can defeat China,” said Wei Wenging, 86, on the day Clinton became the first U.S. leader in almost a decade to land on Chinese soil. The gnarled pensioner was out for an afternoon walk on the exact spot where Clinton is due to receive the ceremonial Tiananmen Square greeting that the U.S. House of Representa- tives has urged the president to refuse. J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE / Assotlated Press Greeted by Chinese children with Netiaien: President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rod . Clinton arrive Thursday in Xian, China's ancient impaganeaginns® begin'a congener VME; x Workers could be seen polish- ing the brass doors of the Great Hall of the People. This massive parliament building, which resembles an overgrown Soviet- built subway station, will be the television backdrop as Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin stride down a formation of People’s Liberation Army soldiers on the eastern edge of the world’s biggest public square. If China’s past practice is fol- lowed, the troops Clinton reviews will be carrying highly’ polished fixed bayonets. Following the 15-minute out- door ceremony, Clinton and the 71-year-old Jiang are due to mount a set of stone steps lead- ing into the Great Hall of the People for the first session of their Beijing summit. The 21-gun salute Clinton will receive is an honor China reserves for a rarefied group of fore leaders it regards as Bulgarian President Petur Stoy- anov last month. Except for hauling in some extra flower pots, the Chinese seemed to be making no effort to prettify the square that to many in America symbolizes the Chi- nese Communist Party’s cold- blooded suppression of the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement. Along one of the main streets bordering the square hangs a big blue propaganda billboard say- ing in English and Chinese, “Devote Our Great Efforts To Build Up The Socialist Spiritual Foundation.”’ Whether Clinton will make any gesture in memory of the victims of the Tiananmen crack- down is one of many questions hovering over the summit. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 26, 1998 > The official welcome Saturday will be a stiff and formal affair compared to the glorious extrav- aganza the Chinese staged Thursday night, little more than an hour after Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, flew into Xian, China’s 600-year-old former imperial capital. Chinese state television broke into its main evening news show at 7:15 p.m. China time to announce that Air Force One had landed. Until that interruption, the news anchor hadn’t meh- tioned the Clinton visit, and the 10 p.m. news didn’t give it very good billing — it was the fifth item reported, after news about such momentous events as Prime Minister Zhu Rongji’s visit to a drug exhibit and a performance by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. At the colorful Xian show in front of the city’s towering old South Gate, which featured huge red lanterns, lithe dancers in gauzy dresses and perform- ers marching through billows of smoke, Clinton made oblique reference to some of the political controversies studding his trip before it even began. “Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America’s strength and success,” he told the select crowd of about 1,000 invited onlookers, raising thoughts of the human rights issues so sensitive in China.

        "ocr_text": "' By Marcia Kunstel and joseph bright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — Tiananmen Square was as quiet as a mausoleum early this morning. The world’s biggest public square looked flat and broad and nearly empty, a circle of red flags high on central poles waving under gentle breezes. Not a kite flier was there to float a brilliant-colored dragon or bird through the sky. Absent were the crowds of Chinese who daily come from the provinces to snap photos at their country’s famous memorials. It was a people’s square that blocked out the people for half of one hot morning. Instead, two soldiers walked two German shepherds up and down the gray paving stones, sniffing for anything that might spoil the soon-to-come moment of glory for China’s leaders and many of its common people. A short row of soldiers in green stood at attention for more than an hour behind eight cannons lined up below the flags, near the Monument to the People’s Heroes at center square. The subway was closed. The streets were closed. The cars and bicycles and pedestrians were held at bay by soldiers or police standing like ramrods at every conceivable entry point to the vast space. On this particular Saturday morning, this was the square with TIANANMEN - QUIETED FOR CLINTON CEREMONY the Chinese govern- ment in full control, sending the message that this is not a gov- ernment to trifle with. That was the mes- sage because this was the ceremony for President Clinton, and he soon would become the first American presi- dent to visit this place since the hor- ros of 1989, when tanks rolled the streets and into the square and mowed down hun- dreds of Chinese. The ceremony began sharply at 9 a.m. when Clinton and his wife and Chi- nese President Jiang Zemin and his wife appeared on the smaller plaza adja- cent to Tiananmen Square fronting the monstrously big Great Hall of the People. It was sober and solemn once the four of them finished glad- handing the other dignitaries who came: a couple of dozen Chinese VIPs and hundreds of Americans invited to drop their normal activ- ities as students or teachers or business executives and come watch their president. Clinton and Jiang stood on a Fielding questions on the rumors, national security adviser Sandy Berger calls China’s alleged detention of dissidents “unacceptable.” a red-carpeted podium with brass rails and listened to the military band play their national anthems GREG GIBSON / Associated Press Beijing hoopla begins: President Clinton and wife Hillary meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his wife during an arrival ceremony today at the Great Hall of the People at Tiananmen Square.

It was majestic, somber and As the two presidents walked past in review of the troops, Clinton was stiff and serious, almost looking pained, though he never seemed to look over the heads of the soldiers and into the square beyond that symbolizes the ki g of a notion of freedom.

The visit revived some uncom- fortable images. Inside: Extended coverage of the president's visit, A8 Clinton, Jiang agree to turn aside missiles By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Hime | STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing - is face somber, President Clinton stood mute today as People’s Libera- tion Army cannons roared out a 21- gun Chinese welcome in flag-decked Tianan- men Square. This was the television picture China had hungered for, the visible evidence that the world’s last remaining superpower, the United States, was finally looking beyond the searing memories of more than 500 unarmed Chinese protesters massacred on the access roads to Tiananmen nine years ago. Then Clinton went on to achieve some- thing he had wanted. Following three hours of private talks, Clinton and Chinese Presi- dent Jiang Zemin announced a long-sought “detargeting agreement’ by which the two countries agreed they “will not target strate- gic nuclear weapons under their respective control at each other.” Clinton achieved less tangible, success on human rights, where the two leaders settled for a promise of “candid dialogue,” while acknowledging that “the two countries have differences.” On Tibet, Clinton urged China to resume dialogue with the exiled Dalai Lama, Tibet’s exiled ruler, “in return for a recognition of Tibet as a part of China.” The initiative brought no immediate result. Earlier, with a big American flag flutter- ing on the flagpole in front of the Great Hall China: Polite sentiments at a tragic spot of the People, a Chinese army band struck up the “Star- Spangled Banner.” Then, at six- second intervals, the Chinese army guns boomed from the cen- ter of the 98-acre square that Mao Tse-tung cleared in the mid-1950s for military parades and million- man mass mobilizations. Clinton, who was just 2 years old when Mao came to power in 1949, stood at attention looking eminently presidential in a dark blue suit and dark golden tie. Beside him stood a beaming Pres- ident Jiang Zemin, and in the background the two first ladies, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Wang Yepin. After the last strain of the American anthem, the band launched into “Onward Righteous and Brave Army,” the anthem of the People’s Republic of China. Then Clinton and Jiang set off on foot along a five-minute rect- angular red-carpeted walking route as they reviewed an honor guard of troops from the Chinese army, navy and air force. By then, Clinton’s initial serious, almost blank expression had given way to an occasional grin as the smiling Jiang — who stands a full head shorter than Clinton — carried out a running dialog in English with the American president. The two leaders’ agreement to stop aiming missiles at each oth- er’s countries is largely symbolic. But it might help ease the criti- cism of Clinton for allowing American satellites to be launched from Chinese rockets. , As the two men sat down with “their Cabinet members to talk, Clinton thanked Jiang for the “open and honest relationship that we have.” “I know I speak for the vast majority of Americans when I say that this effort to improve and strengthen our relationship is very welcome,” Clinton said. Jiang replied: “The improve- ment and the growth of China- U.S. relations are an inevitable development of history and are irresistible by any force on Earth.” Never in the five-and-a-half- years of his presidency has Clinton stirred such powerful pas- sions by performing a purely cer- emonial act, and the pained reactions from 1989 Tiananmen survivors is surely far from finished. Just three weeks ago, 35-year- old Hong Kong labor activist and Tiananmen survivor Han Dong- fang said, “I hope when Clinton stands there and walks in front of the army, he can hear the shoot- ing and the people crying and see a picture of the blood in his mind.” The closest Clinton has come to describing his thoughts about the welcoming ceremony came eight days ago. As Clinton sat in the Oval Office preparing to leave for China, a correspondent asked him what he would be pondering as his motorcade pulled up to the Great Hall of the People. “Well, obviously I want to see Tiananmen Square,” Clinton replied, “and I will think about what happened there nine years ago. “But I also will be thinking about the last turbulent century in Chinese history and the fact that whole setting there has been nese public life Fears now.’ the center of for probably Tiananmen Square: American and Chinese flags wave Friday over Beijing's historic area, controversial as the scene of the crushing of a pro-democracy dem- onstration by Commu- nist troops in 1989. Hours later, President Clinton received a military-style welcome at the site. GREG BAKER / Associated Press The setting for the Chinese welcome was a football-field- sized stone courtyard in front of the Great Hall of the People, the gigantic columned structure on the western edge of the world’s largest public square. The build- ing, propped up by a dozen 80- foot-tall gray marble columns, was built in 11 months by a legion of “volunteers” in 1959. After the welcoming ceremony, Clinton and Jiang ascended a red carpeted stone staircase leading into the Great Hall for a day of private talks. Despite the symbolism of an emerging friendship, the opening of talks was overshadowed by a row over China’s detention of dissidents. When news reports told of three or four Chinese dissidents arrested on the day of Clinton’s arrival for sightseeing in the ancient Chinese capital of Xian, the White Hoye reacted with harsh words. “People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor, and we have expressed our concern about this to the Chinese government,” National Security Adviser Sandy: Berger told reporters before the presidential entourage flew to Beijing. “It’s unacceptable ... for peo- ple to be detained in connection with an event like this,” Berger said. He predicted Clinton would pass on the same message today in private talks with Jiang. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman angrily denied that anyone had been “arrested,” but left open the possibility that some potential protesters may have been held in Xian for questioning during the Clinton visit. “We are opposed to any foreign country using the human rights issue as a pretext to interfere in China’s internal affairs,” the Chi- nese spokesman said late Friday.

Once Clinton’s airplane left Xian, Chinese authorities released two of the local activists who had reportedly been held in custody. Yang Hai, 29, insisted he had been “kidnapped” by police to prevent him from meeting with [ foreign television journalists.

Clinton flew into Beijing on Friday in hopes of wrapping up a nuclear weapons “detargeting” agreement by which both sides would pledge not to point their missiles at each other. “We would certainly like such an agreement,” Berger told reporters in Xian. Some of Clinton’s home front critics have called a “detarget- ing” deal meaningless, arguing that a missile’s targeting coordi- nates can be secretly updated in less than 20 minutes. Clinton has replied that such an agreement could prevent an accidental world war. “If you detarget, yes, you can always go retarget a missile, we all know that,” Clinton said last week. “But it fakes some more Square: U.S. and Chinese flags fly Friday over Tiananmen Beijing’s historic area, controversial as the site of the crushing of a demonstration in 1989.

So the possibility of avoiding a mistake, om even back- ing down from a conflict, is dra- matically increased with detargeting.” Clinton reached America’s first “detargeting” agreement with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1994. Then Russia signed a similar “detargeting” agreement with China in 1995. But for the last year, China has resisted American entreaties to join in a mutual “detargeting” pact. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman insisted again this month that the United States must first sign a “no-first-use” pledge, under which no future American president could threaten nuclear strikes to deter a non-nuclear ground or sea attack.

        "ocr_text": "DAY ONE IN CHINA: THE SCRIPT GOES AWRY By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS . Beijing — It was a scene so disagreeable that nobody could have predicted it: a tough Chinese security man bellowing at two White House valets on the tarmac outside Air Force One. It happened Friday at the airport in Xian as President Clinton was nearing the end of a day that already had the marks of a public relations fiasco. Before Air Force One reached Beijing, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry was accusing the Chinese security man of mistreating the Clinton valets because “these guys looked Asian.” Day One in the Middle Kingdom had been scripted by the White House advance team as a glossy series of upbeat photo ops about mod- ern China. Apparently the idea was to give Americans the tastiest possible appetizer Friday in advance of today’s mouth-puckering images of Clinton in Tiananmen Square. Events started going off course when the big international news wires began humming with reports that three or four dissidents had been locked up in Xian around the time of Clinton’s arrival. The reports originated with a Chinese exile living in Hong Kong. He is Lu Siqing, 35, a computer programmer who makes a sidelight of faxing reports to Western news agencies about dissidents harassed in China. Lu’s organization consists of his network of contacts, a cell phone and a beeper, as he hap- pily acknowledged in a recent interview. But his faxes carry a large-sounding letterhead: the Hong Kong Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.

The Clintons’ first day in China was planned as a glossy series of photo operations, but a jittery Chinese security agent and reports about dissidents got the trip off on the wrong foot. ° Fielding questions on the rumors, national security adviser Sandy Berger calls China’s alleged detention of dissidents “unacceptable.” @ With Clinton in China, the wires moved small items Friday morning on Lu’s uncon- firmed information about the Xian dissidents’ detention. The story escalated when a White House pool reporter asked Clinton about it during a visit to discuss village elections at Xiahe. If true, the news stories were “disturbing,” Clinton said. This one word swelled into a sandstorm of correspondents’ questions during a news briefing by White House officials at Xian’s Shangri-La Golden Flower Hotel. That was where National Security Adviser Sandy Berger let fly with charges that China’s deten- tion of the dissidents was “unacceptable.” The Clintons had finally smiled their final farewells in Xian and ascended the big ramp onto Air Force One when an American radio pool reporter heard some loud shouting on the tarmac. It was a Chinese security man shouting at two Filipino-American valets who are mem- bers of the White House staff. With Air Force One about to take off, there wasn’t time for the White House press pool to straighten out exactly why the Chinese secu- rity man was upset. What was clear was that the valets had been trying to load the Clintons’ garment bags onto the plane when the security man tempo- rarily prevented them from boarding. The uproar seems to have ended when a Chinese-speaking American staffer showed up and vouched for the two valets. “The Chinese security guy said the baggage was the problem,” McCurry said after Air Force One was airborne. “Our security people said it didn’t look to them like that was the problem. It looked to them like the problem was that those guys looked Asian.” If McCurry’s interpretation is accurate, it suggests the Chinese agent may have been afraid the president was sneaking dissidents aboard the presidential jet. Another possibili- ty, of course, is that the valets were suspected of smuggling out some of Xian’s famous antiquities. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 27, 1998 (Late Edition Sidebar) \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — From the sanctuary of China’s largest Protestant church, President Clinton preached a message of religious unity today to a nation where Christian leaders have been jailed or harassed by the government. “I believe that Chinese and Americans dre brothers and sis- ters as children of God,” the pres- ident told the congregation at Chongwenmen Church. “We come here in that spirit today.” Clinton said, “I believe our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world of different races and backgrounds and creeds.” Churchgoers sang “Golden Breaks the Dawn,” heard the Scripture and repeated the Lord’s Prayer before Clinton had his turn in the pulpit. Clinton already had made blunt comments about China’s human rights practices on Saturday, dur- ing an exceptional televised news conference in which he and Chi- nese President Jiang Zemin pro- nounced their summit a success.

She welcomes any res- toration of open religidGus practice. “It’s quite free for people to worship. There are many peo- Ple who believe in religion now,” said the diminutive white-haired woman leaving the service at Dong Tang, around the corner from Beijing’s Forbidden City. But she sighed when asked about her church’s break with the Vatican, which China’s Communist government : directed after the 1949 revolu- tion in order to expel foreign influence from a potent social force. Will China’s Catholics ever return to Rome’s fold? China special- ists speak of a possible break- through in informal talks qui- etly going on between intermediaries for the Vatican and the Chinese government. In a possible compromise, the Vatican would end diplo- matic recognition of Taiwan and agree Rome would not appoint archbishops in China. Even if those conditions could be met, the Holy See would face repeated compro- mises in reuniting with the Chi- mese church under current gov- ernment controls. At least 4 million Chinese Catholics agree with parishio- mer Dong that the constraints are not too onerous, and they worship in the officially sanc- tioned church. Another 10 mil- lion Chinese participate in the Protestant churches registered with the government. But 30 million or more are estimated to gather in under- ground churches in defiance of government regulations, pray- ing in apartments or caves or . fields. - June 28, 1998 > \fwors Local enforcement of the national policy is uneven. Some unregistered churches remain fairly free of harassment, said Nina Shea, director of the Cen- ter for Religious Freedom in Washington, D.C. Other churches are not. “The Chinese have been ter- ribly efficient in wiping out dis- sent,” said Shea, referring to the labor union that brought down Poland’s Communist regime and the underground Publications that criticized Soviet life. Dissent, according to West- ern watchers, is exactly what the Chinese government fears religion may foster, especially with today’s increasing unem- Ployment and economic turmoil. Traditionally in ‘China there have been religious sects that have arisen, especially in the countryside, and eventually moved to political ends, said Brent Fulton, managing direc- tor of the Institute for Chinese Studies at Wheaton College in Illinois. An example was the 1850-64 Taiping Rebellion, led by a charismatic Chinese who declared himself a brother of Jesus called by God to save China from the oppression of the Qing Dynasty’s Manchu rul- ers. His evangelism attracted legions of followers, who mounted civil war and took over much of central China. Only with the aid of French and British forces did the Manchus quell the uprising. Today, religious activity with political overtones is_ closely monitored in Tibet, where authorities suspect the exiled Dalai Lama wants to return to lead Buddhist followers to inde- pendence. Muslim activists in mountainous Xinjiang province along the western border are likewise monitored. Even in mainstream ethnic Chinese areas, however, devia- tion from accepted religious lines spells trouble. From across the country come reports of religious leaders being Atlanta Journal-Constitution (Sidebar Continued) JOSEPH P.

Chinese officials say charges of religious persecution, includ- ing those made in the latest U.S. State Department Human Rights Report, are wrong. Yet when three prominent American clergymen toured China this year to assess the status of religion, a key question concerned the fate of 30 Chinese religious leaders believed detained for reasons of faith. Wheaton College’s Fulton, who was in the delegation, said authorities did not deny reli- gious figures have been imprisoned. “The official version is they were causing trouble or getting into political affairs,”’ he said. RELIGION IN CHINA Here’s how China’s personality for the last two millennia has been shaped by religions: @ 200 B.C.-200 A.D. — The human- centered phi of the Chinese thinker Confucius (551-479 BC), who stressed duty to the state and to “moral behavior accord- ing to status,” is adopted by Chinese imperial ru as a state religion. @ Ist century — The teachings of The Bud- dha, who pease Sepa sere 7h century B.C., are imported from India and spread lly, eventually eclipsing Confu- cianism during the golden age of Chinese Buddhism in the 5th-9th centuries. @ 2nd-6th century — Tacism, a native mystica! philosophy rooted in the sayings attributed to a Chinese hermit named Lao Tzu, thrives as an alternative to rigid Confu- cianism. It stresses contemplation and “drop- ping out.” @ 8th-9th centuries — Arabian camel cara- vans on the Silk Road introduce Islam, which takes hold in present-day Xinjiang province of western China. — Jesuit priests enter Chi- Mi @ 1807 — Nearly 150 years of increasi open Christian proselytizing arnong the ee ee oe eee Salanhervery arrives from Britain. m 1843 — Americans arrive.

        "ocr_text": "Clinton firm in decrying, _ ‘liananmen | President states case in China TV debate Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Palm Beach Post Staff Writers BENING — In Villa 18 of the Diaoyutai Guest House, President Clinton was still restless, It was late Friday night. Bothered by his allergies and unsettled about his controver- sial rendezvous at Tiananmen Square set for the next morning, the president was polish- ing a single paragraph. He was trying to perfect what turned out to be the major accomplishment since he ar- rived in China. Clinton hoped to say on Chi- nese state television Saturday that Chinese leaders had been wrong to brutalize pro- democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square nine years ago. “He wanted to state it in a very respectful way to the Chinese people,” said White House spokesman Michael McCurry. “He wanted his words to have a maximum impact on the people of China.” For weeks, Clinton's emissaries had been pressing the Chinese for assurances he would be allowed to talk on Chinese televi- sion. They'd had favorable hints from the Chinese, but nothing was pinned down. The word finally came at 10:30 a.m. (Chi- na time) Saturday, two days after his arrival in China. McCurry said that’s when Clinton | learned that his joint press conference with China’s President Jiang Zemin would be broadcast live on nationwide Chinese televi- sion a half-hour later. Because of his late-night text polishing, Clinton was ready with a polite introductory passage reciting Tiananmen’s historical im- portance for the past eight years. Sandwiched inthe middle was one stinging sound bite that criticized in no uncertain terms China’s bloody suppression of the 1989  pro- défocracy movement. ‘For all our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning of what happened there,” Clinton said. “I believe, and the American | people believe, that the use of force and the tragic loss of life was wrong. I believe, and the Ameri- can people believe, that freedom of speech, association and reli- gion are, as recognized by U.N. Charter, the rahe of people ev- erywhere and should be protect- ed by their governments.” : Jiang, seated next to Clinton oh a gold-trimmed dais, had a cémeback ready. * First the Chinese president qhoted Dong Zhongshu, a phi- Idsopher of the Han Dynasty more than 2000 years ago: “Of all the living things nurtured be- tween heaven and the Earth, the most valuable is human beings.” Then he said the 1989 pro- democracy movement amounted tq “political disturbances” that had to be dealt with through “resolute measures.” Otherwise, he said, “we could not have en- jayed the stability that we are en- jaying today.” Prisoner release ; Clinton suggested that China rélease some of the prisoners ar- rested “for offenses no longer on the books in China.” He referred to the sweeping law against ceunter-revolutionary activities under which thousands of Chi- nese have been arrested. . Jiang reiterated the Chinese stand that the aim of maintaining ogder and _ stability was para- nyount. : Asked about the arrests of dissidents just prior to Clinton’s arrival — acts that drew critical cémments from Clinton and oth- et White House officials — Jiang s4id_an investigation “shows that there was never such a thing. * The American side deemed L. very response “unaccept- able” on Friday, but it was trying to paint the summit in a golden glow by Saturday, when it simply ignored the fact that Chinese au- thorities still appeared to be stonewalling the question. ;. The Chinese president him- self also raised the charges in America that the Chinese gov- eimment had made illegal cam- paign contributions to the Dem- otratic National Committee, call- ing them “absurd and ridiculous” and “sheer fabrications.” * “China can never do such a thing,” he said, “and China never interferes in other country’s in- tdrnal affairs.” : China’s ambassador to Washington Li Zhaoxing told Cjinton aides that as many as 500 njillion Chinese heard the live Ainton-Jiang press conference on TV and radio. ‘truly historic’ chance * White House National Secu- ry Adviser Samuel “Sandy” Berger, summing up the day’s achievements, said the chance to speak openly about Tiananmen at alive press conference was “truly historic” and “extraordinary.” *~Berger was able to generate less enthusiastic words to de- seribe other achievements, though the traveling White House staff did pass out a 14-page fact sheet entitled “Achievements of the U.S.-China Summit.” The fact sheet contained just one specific deal. It was a one- sentence nuclear weapons “detargeting” agreement, in which the United States and Chi- na promised at some unspecified time in the future to stop pointi strategic nuclear missiles at eac other's territory. A long list of other topics proved too controversial for solu- tion, at least during the first day of suimumnit talks: @ Missile exports: China, which has long supplied short- range missiles to Pakistan, re- buffed the Clinton Administra- tion’s efforts to shut off an arms supply relationship that China considers strategically and com- mercially important. The White House said China and the U.S. will continue missile export con- sultations later in this year. @ Trade: The two summit partners remained divided on terms for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. China still wants to be classified as a “developing nation,” which would allow it to keep high tariff barriers on imports. The American side insists that China is an advanced country that should lower the trade barriers. “There was clearly progress made, but clearly it did not go far enough,” said ite House Na- tional Economic Adviser Gene Sperling. @ Tibet: Clinton publicly urged Jiang to “resume a dia- logue” with the exiled Dalai La- ma, in return for the Tibetan leader’s recognition “that Tibet is a part of China.” Jiang seemed to open the door for direct talks with the Dalai Lama, but only if he first declares that Tibet is an “inalienable part of China” and ‘Taiwan is a province of China. Later, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao pitched icy water over the prospects of Tibet talks in a strong critique of the Dalai Lama. “He has laid obstacles to the contacts between the two sides and all this has shown the Dalai Lama has no sincerity in dialogue with the central government,” Zhu said. “And the responsibility for the failure of the dialogue be- tween the two sides rests fully with the Dalai Lama’s side.” @ Taiwan: At the press con- ference, Jiang remarked that the Taiwan question is “the most im- portant and the most sensitive is- sue at the core of China-U.S. re- lations.” Clinton gave a notably brief reply, saying he had reaf- firmed erica’s “long-standi one China policy” and ha “urged” China to resolve the Tai- wan issue through “cross-strait discussions.” Clinton’s statement fell far short of the full-scale reiteration of U.S.-Taiwan policy that Chi- nese diplomats wanted. Yet for no apparent reason, the Chinese spokesman Zhu de- livered a surprisingly positive as- sessment of Clinton’s Taiwan po- sition, saying Clinton had “reiterated the relevant commit- ments” on Taiwan.

        "ocr_text": "Muman rights universal, Clinton tells China youth By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — President Clinton told a mass of Chi- nese listeners today that the freedom to speak, worship and select their own leaders constitutes universal “birthrights” of people around the globe. Speaking at the free-thinking campus called the “Harvard of China,” where Mao Tse-tung once worked as a librarian and where art students con- structed the famous “Goddess of Democracy” for Tiananmen Square, the American president said: “T believe that everywhere, people aspire to be treated with dignity, to give voice to their opinions, to choose their own leaders, to associate with whom they wish, to worship how, when and where they want,” Clinton said in his prepared text. “These are not American rights, or European rights, or developed world rights. They are birth- rights of people everywhere.” At Clinton's urging, Chinese authorities broad- cast the address live. He spoke on the main Chi- nese television channel called CCTV-1, which has a potential audience of up to 600 million. The Chi- nese audience heard a simultaneous translation of Clinton's speech by a Beijing University student rather than a U.S, State Department translator. Beginning Day Five of his China expedition, Clinton used his strongest language about human rights to address elite students and faculty at Beijing University, the longtime center of Chinese liberal thought that was the intellectual birthplace of Communism in the 1920s and the 1989 pro- democracy movement, Gently but unmistakably, Clinton took issue with his host, President Jiang Zemin, who just two days ago defended China's human rights record on national television by saying that China is a “devel- oping country” that has to give top priority to “the right to subsistence and the right to development.” “Economic security is an essential element of freedom,” Clinton acknowledged. “In China, the extraordinary strides you have taken in nurturing that liberty and spreading of freedom from want will be a source of strength for your people in the 21st century.” But then Clinton added: “True freedom must mean more than economic opportunity. In Ameri- ca, we believe that freedom itself is indivisible. .. . In the global Information Age, freedom is a power- ful engine of progress.” Theoretically, China’s 1.2 billion citizens enjoy most, if not all, of the “birthrights” that Clinton called for. The Chinese constitution already guarantees the freedom of peaceful assembly. But as the U.S. State Department human rights report on China noted in January, “the gov- ernment severely restricts this right in practice” by banning any activity that challenges Communist Party leadership or infringes upon “interests of the State.” The Chinese constitution also guarantees freedom of religion, and a section of the Chinese criminal law provides prison sentences for any government employee who ille- gally deprives citizens of the right to worship. However, the U.S. State Department knows of no Chinese official who has ever been punished under this provision, and millions of Chinese are routinely harassed for trying to worship in “unregis- tered” churches. “There are those in my country who question whether working with China is in our interests,” Clinton said, in a passage that seemed directed at an audience back in America. “There are those in China who ask whether closer relations with the United States makes sense for China. But everything we know about the way the world is chang- ing and the challenges for your generation will face tell us that our two nations will be better off work- ing together than apart.” On Sunday, that relationship was criticized as neighboring India slammed Clinton’s attempt to use weekend summit talks with the Chi- nese government to cool the Pakistan-India nuclear arms race. “India categorically rejects the notion of these two countries arro- gating to themselves joint or indi- vidual responsibility for the main- tenance of peace, stability and security in the region,” said , an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman. India, which exploded five nuclear test devices underground in early May, vented its anger at a “presidential joint statement on South Asia” issued Saturday by Clinton and Jiang. The Indians seemed outraged by a passage urging India and Pakistan to “adhere immediately and uncon- ditionally” to the international nuclear test ban treaty, and to refrain from turning their nuclear test devices into deployed weapons. “It is most ironic that two coun- tries that have directly and indi- rectly contributed to the unabated proliferation of nuclear weapons and delivery systems in our neigh- borhood are now presuming to pre- scribe the norms for nonproliferation.” India’s unusually harsh state- ment was issued first in New Delhi late Saturday and then echoed Sun- day in a second statement by the Indian embassy in Beijing. Tensions turned into violence Sunday on both sides of a 430-mile- long U.N.-supervised cease-fire line that divides Indian and Pakistani sectors of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. Clinton remained silent on the Indian flare-up as he rejoined the Chinese president Sunday night for a private dinner at the Communist Party’s Zhongnanhai leadership compound off Tiananmen Square. But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, accompanying the president in Beijing, said the Indians are behaving as though “ev- eryone is out of step with them.” “They had better stop dismissing statements like this because they are dismissing what is a very evi- dent signal from the rest of the world that what they are doing has not gained them stature,” she said. On this sweltering Day Four of his nine-day China excursion, Clinton seemed to be going to con- siderable lengths to avoid saying anything controversial, especially about his Chinese hosts. | At the Chongwenmen Protestant church Sunday morning, the Presi- dent and Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, sat on the front row through the service. Then Clinton rose to a podium and spoke for two or three minutes, praising the growth of Christianity in Chma. “We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith in China, and we rejoice to hear Reverend Shi [Zesheng] cite the numbers of churches and other places of worship where people are practicing their faith today,” Clinton told the congregation, referring to the minister's earlier comment that China has 12,000 churches and 25,000 places of worship. Although Clinton and his aides earlier said he would address the issue of religious freedom in China, he did not mention the issue of reli- gious oppression. White House spokesman P.J. Crowley explained later, “It was extremely hot in the church and the pastor made a wonderful ceremony that went on for quite a long time, and so under the circumstances the president decided to drastically shorten his prepared remarks.” The rest of Sunday was a first- class touring day for the Clintons. They ventured through the For- bidden City in the center of the capital and walked along the Great Wall at Badaling, an hour from downtown Beijing. Both places, which routinely draw thousands of tourists daily, were closed to the public for the Clintons’ visits. “What is there to say? It’s an amazing place,” said Clinton as he walked along a cobblestone court- yard in the Forbidden City. After walking along the top of the Great Wall, Clinton stopped to write in a visitors’ book: “Thank you for showing the Great Wall to me, my family and our American party. It was ever more magnifi- cent than we thought it would be. William J. Clinton.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 29, 1998 \f"

Thorns in the form of genera- tor glitches continue to torment the reliability of Southern Co.’s giant Shajiao C power plant in China’s booming southern indus- trial strip. Elsewhere throughout the con- tinent, nettles from the Asian financial crisis have stung the Prospects of three out of the four largest future power projects Southern took on when it bought control of its Asian subsidiary two years ago. “We have been out here in times of turmoil, and if you’re sit- ting back in the United States, you would probably look out here and say, ‘Asia is not the place where you would like to be,’ ’”’ said F.D. ‘Rick’? Kuester, who was sent from Mississippi Power to become a top executive in Southern’s Hong Kong-based Asian subsidiary, Consolidated Electric Power Asia. Yet dreams about electrifying the Orient still drum loud in Southern’s psyche. “If you look at the per-capita consumption of electricity com- pared to anywhere else in the world, you can see tremendous opportunities for growth,’’ ester said. ' Hence the announcement Mon- day in China that Southern is teaming with Johnston Develop- ment Co. in a joint venture with the Chinese government to build a million power plant in the province. The coal-fired plant, which would begin produc- ing power in 2003, would be near the mouth of a coal mine in the northern province of Shanxi, 150 miles west of Beijing. Generating profits Southern’s fire-breathing opti- mism about Asia is not without reason. Its shareholders have just tasted their first Asian profits, less than two years after South- ern invested more than $2 billion to btry into a Hong Kong billion- aire’s Asian power enterprise. The initial payback on one of the biggest investments in South- ern’s 75-year history was some- thing short of gargantuan. An earnings report for January through March showed Southern collected $15 million in Asian profits, or about one-twentieth of its worldwide earnings. Nonetheless, Southern says this is a felicitous omen because its Asian venture wasn’t expected to add to per-share earnings until 2000. So far, the happiest tidings have come from the Philippines. CEPA’s midsized Philippines plant, the 73S-megawatt coal- fired Pagbilao Power Station, has been churning out virtually all of the Asian profits Southern has reported. Unlike the Shajiao C plant in China still hampered by start-up litches, the Philippines’ Pagbilao VINCENT YU / Associated Press Workers head to their jobs at Southern Co.’s giant Shajiao C power plant in China’s booming southern industrial strip. plant ran smoothly enough to generate 100 percent of its con- tracted electrical generating capacity from January through March. Southern’s much bigger 1,200- megawatt Sual coal-fired power station in the Philippines, now under construction, is on sched- ule and near completion on the island of Luzon. Its first unit will enter commercial operation in June 1999, the company says. Just last week, Southern signed an agreement to invest about $100 million in Thailand to purchase 28 percent of a nearly completed 1,400-megawatt coal-fired power station on the Thai west coast. Final details are expected to be wrapped up this summer, South- ern’s Asia chief executive, Ray- mond Hill said late Friday. For Southern, the most chal- lenging aspect of its venture into Asia has been expanding beyond the footprint of power plant investments it bought from Hong Kong entrepreneur Gordon Wu in October 1996. Especially frustrating has been China, which Southern viewed as its most promising patch for building new, power plants because of the country’s explosive growth and its 1.2 billion potential Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 30, 1998 > \fSOUTHERN CoO.’S VENTURES IN ASIA _ Southern’s Hong Kong office now acknowledges a S-year-old joint venture that predated the Wu transaction, a plan to build a coal-fired plant in China’s Jiangsu Province, “has been shelved for the time being.” The Shanxi project is the first one announced in nearly two years, and it comes in the midst of President Clinton’s visit to the countrv. Southern had been pursuing the Shanxi deal for about six months in partnership with former U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston’s (D-La.) Washington- based energy company, Johnston Development. About three weeks ago, South- ern’s Chinese partners are known to have suggested the Shanxi deal be signed during the Clinton visit. Southern even ordered contin- gency plans for a Beijing signing ceremony. On June 10, a report on China’s official Xinhua news agency appeared to boost Southern’s chances for the Shanxi deal. It disclosed Shanxi Province has budgeted $8.4 billion to expand 10 coal-fired power plants and make the province a major electricity exporter over the next three years. Earlier this spring, Southern dispatched a technical team to visit two existing Chinese coal- fired power plants in coastal Shandong province as part of a broader, more ambitious plan to invest in generating power for that fast-growth region between Beijing and Shanghai. Though the deal was fairly close to comple- tion in late May, the recent tur- moil in the Hong Kong stock mar- ket reportedly has bumped any announcement until this fall or later. “Coal is expected to continue to provide 70 percent of the coun- try’s energy needs well into the next century as China has few alternatives to satisfy fast- expanding the Xinhua report said. Slow going at first That is the kind of cheery intel- ligence that first attracted South- ern to open a small-business development office in Hong Kong in 1993. The first three years of South- ern’s Asia business prospecting yielded meager results. So in October 1996, Southern Chairman A.W. “Bill” Dahlberg decided to risk a quantum leap by conclud- ing a $2.7 billion contract to buy 80 percent of Wu’s CEPA. That was the year Southern’s profits were so robust Dahlberg could tell shareholders Southern was the “900-pound gorilla’ of the American power business and was intent on becoming a global “1,800-pound gorilla.”’ Wu, who needed cash to pare | debts from other heavily lever-— aged ventures, received $2.1 bil- lion from Southern, plus a $600 million one-time cash dividend from CEPA’s treasury. At first, Southern to operate CEPA indefinitely in partnership with Wu, who was counted on to add his vision and his Rolodex of power industry contacts to Southern’s base of technical expertise. But the Asian financial crisis, starting with last summer’s tsu- nami of Asian currency devalua- tions, pressured Southern and Wu to part ways. Though the full story of their breakup remains tightly held, one seed of tension was their diverg- ing appraisals about the future profitability of CEPA’S Tanjung Jati B power project in Indonesia. Wu, who insisted Tanjung Jat: B would ultimately yield $20 bil- lion in gross income, had pressed Southern to deliver a $138 million contingency payment that had been part of the original $2.7 bil- lion CEPA price tag. But Southern said no, on grounds the Indonesians had not made a binding commitment on how much they would pay for Tanjung Jati B’s electricity once the plant was built. Just as the Asian currency cri- sis was starting to explode last July, Southern bought out Wu's remaining 20 percent of CEPA for $150 million in cash, plus Southern’s share of the CEPA rights to develop the disputed Indonesian Tanjung Jati plant. For Southern, this second deal with Wu came in the nick of time. Within weeks, Indonesia’s econ- omy was sucked into a whirlpool that would squeeze out three- quarters of the value of the Indo- nesian currency and help cause this spring’s ouster of President Suharto. The Tanjung Jati B plant, now back in Wu's portfolio, is on indefinite hold, and Southern is one of the few international elec- tric power companies that emerged from the Indonesia debacle unscathed. Indonesia’s state-owned electricity distributor declared this month it “has no money” to pay foreign-based power companies for contracted generating plants in Indonesia. Rightly or wrongly, Wu has congratulated himself on getting the better of the deal in the two- stage takeover by Southern. “When we sold CEPA, it was based .on: this principle: We already had completed contracts, and there was a whole bag of receivables on hand,” Wu told the South China Morning Post last November. “The comment at the time was that I had sold the family jewels. At $18.50 (the price per share Southern paid for CEPA), I was a happy seller. I’d be lucky to get half that price today.” Southern’s Hong Kong execu- tives prefer not to publicly dis- pute Wu’s judgment about what CEPA was really worth. However, a footnote in South- ern’s 1997 annual report informs stockholders Southern’s $2.1 bil- lion net cost for acquiring 100 percent of CEPA “exceeded the fair market value of net assets by approximately $1.6 billion.” The annual report explained the excess over market value in buy- ing the Asian subsidiary — $1.65 billion — was entered onto South- ern Co.’s books as an “increase in good will.” Chances have increased South- ern may never receive a payback on three out of the four biggest future Asian power plant projects that were on Wu’s drawing boards when he sold his company to Southern. In addition to Indonesia’s Tan- jung Jati B that Wu reclaimed, the potential nonperformers are: WA proposed $1.6 billion Keti Bandar coal-fired power plant in Pakistan. This Wu-initiated plant “is basically at a_ standstill,” Kuester acknowledged in an interview. “They [the Pakistanis] don’t need any more power, they don’t want any more power, and we are not pushing ahead on that because it doesn’t make sense for the mega-plant in India. Kuester said the new Indian govern- ment has signaled a willingness to proceed with some electricity mega-plants. But the India ‘‘memorandum of agreement’’ that Southern inherited from Wu was not a fully negotiated deal. “We still have to stand back and assess the situation — is that a project that makes sense for us, economically?” said Kuester. W When Southern bought CEPA, it also acquired a billion tons of coal reserves in a remote mine in Austria. Southern is weighing construction of a coal-fired power station near the mine, which would convert the coal into revenue-producing electricity without today’s high transporta- tion costs. Prickly though Southern’s path has been, Kuester believes the American utility giant is gradu- ally becoming more comfortable in its new Asian habitat. “It is not so different in Ala- bama or Mississippi or Georgia,” Kuester said. “You don’t walk into somebody’s office and all of a sudden do a business deal and make friends. It takes a while to develop a relationship. ... The fact that they didn’t know who we were and didn’t trust us when we walked in the door, and that it took some time, that didn’t sur- prise me.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 30, 1998 (Continued) \f"

American-Statesman International Staff SHANGHAI In a_ wide- ranging discussion this morning with Shanghai community lead- ers, the top bishop in China’s state-sanctioned Catholic Church told President Clinton that he thinks there are no religious re- strictions in China. “People often ask if the Chinese __—— Catholic Church ' Editorial. A8 is cooperating with the Com- munist Party,” said Bishop Jin Luxian, who spent 27 years in prison under the com- munist regime for religious ac- tivities. ‘“‘The answer is simple: Why should church believers here do something that is against our government?” Clinton did not pursue the issue after Jin refuted widely docu- mented reports of religious re- pression in China. The bishop, who belongs to a . Catholic church officially sanc- tioned by the Chinese govern- ment, told Clinton that religious leaders should cooperate more with the government rather than challenge its control of churches. “T believe. Mr. President, you are here to have more dialogue with us, with the Chinese govern- ment, not tocontend with us,” said Jin. “I believe all the church be- lievers, religious believers, they should have dialogue instead of having conflicts with the government.” The comments came during a round-table dialogue with Chi- nese leaders in the arts, business, media and religion. Bringing the Internet to grade schools, protecting consumer rights and educating young people to deal with China’s fledgling market economy were some is- sues Clinton discussed during the session — billed as “Shaping Chi- na for the 21st Century”— in Shanghai, mainland China’s most progressive and biggest city. “The greatest change that has happened in China is the values of people, because of the changes in livelihood,’”’ said Wang Xiaoying, 51, a novelist who participated in the round-table discussion with Clinton, assuring him that she can write any books she wants, that the only difficulty she faces comes from publishers, not the government. “The younger generation will always have quite different views from our views,” she said, adding that the advent of videos, compact discs and other audio-visual en- tertainment has made it much harder for writers to crack the Chinese market. Clinton began day six of his China sweep with the round-table talks at the new Shanghai Library. It is one of the 10 largest libraries in the world and features 13 mil- lion books and manuscripts along with state-of-the-art information technology. “‘Everyone understands there is a new China emerging in the world that is more prosperous, more open and more dynamic,” Clinton told the group in opening their discussion. ‘“This is the first time we’ve had a chance to meet such a diverse group of citizens” in China. Clinton heard a law school pro- fessor explain how badly Iawyers are needed in China now that pri- vate enterprise is growing and state control diminishing in her country, while a consumer advo- cate questioned Clinton about whether such activists in America “would be criticized as immoral. “Some of our state and city governments actually have their own consumer Clinton responded. “‘By and large, consumer advocates enjoy a very favorable position in American advocates,”’’. Joe McDonald/AP| People look out Monday across the Huangpu River toward buildings in the city of Shanghai. Once the business capital of the Far East, Shanghai) Pudong, a new development zone seen as a financial renaissance for has retained much of its rapport with Western capitalism and culture. When Clinton left Beijing for Shanghai on Monday evening, he left official government meetings to focus on business and a more informal schedule of meetings with community leaders, Chinese and American business execu- tives, and talks with average Chi- nese, including an appearance to- dayon a live radio callin show, which his Chinese hosts promised not to censor. The Shanghai People’s Radio talk show, “Citizens and Society,” reaches 100 million Chinese. The first caller, a Shanghai businessman, asked about the Asian financial crisis. Clinton re- sponded that China has been ‘‘a force of stability’ in Asia’s finan- cial crisis and said it was vital to restore economic growth in Japan. “‘We cannot see growth restored in Asia unless it is restored in Ja- pan,” the president said through a Chinese interpreter. The radio program might be Clinton’s best opportunity in Chi- na to hear from Chinese people ~ who have not been thoroughly prepped for an exchange with the U.S. president, since the people present at all his other stops have been carefully screened. Earlier, responding to a key question by a participant in the Shanghai Library roundtable dis- cussion, Clinton carefully spelled out U.S. policy on Taiwan, a vola- tile issue since China regards Taiwan as a renegade province. Adhering to finely worded diplo- matic language, Clinton said, ‘““We don’t support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan, one China.” On Monday, Clinton was hit with a similar pointed inquiry during a live, nationally televised J.

One student, criticizing U.S. arm sales to Taiwan, asked Clinton how he would like it if China sent arms to Hawaiian leaders in a hostile frame of mind. The president responded that arms sales to Taiwan were for de- fense only and that he hoped one day to see “the peaceful reunifi- cation of China and Taiwan.” Most of the Beijing students’ questions were critical, a fact that Clinton noted. “They have helped me to un- derstand how what I say is per- ceived by others... the questions were far more important than my speech,” he said.

        "ocr_text": "Clinton challenges U.S. firms in China Help China curb industrial practices that hurt the environment, the president says. Shanghai — President Clinton appealed today to American firms here to help China sever an “iron unbreakable link” between eco- nomic growth and industrial age energy practices that could lead to environmental catastrophe. “T have no right as president of the United States to ask China to slow its economic growth,’’ Clinton told the American Cham- ber of Commerce in Shanghai. ‘I don’t have a right to do that. “But as a citizen of the world, and as a leader of our country, I have a responsibility to ask us all to work together for a planet that our grandchildren can all enjoy living in,’’ Clinton said on Day Seven of his China tour. In his only major meeting with American business leaders, Clinton warned that China already is besieged with pollution crises. Every major body of water in China is polluted, the water table is dropping around the nation, and respiratory illness is the biggest cause of death. Clinton said Shanghai, the most developed industrial and finan- cial center of mainland China, can be “the center of an energy revolution in China’? with the help of the American businesses that are important investors and producers here. He said clean growth can lead to faster growth and less resources spent on cleaning up the pollution mess later, as well as on taking care of people who get sick from pollution-related disease. Keeping engaged in China also is essential to the growth of America’s economy, he said. “We have, after all, in the United States just 4 percent of the world’s population, but we pro- duce 20 percent of its wealth,” Clinton said. ‘Clearly, we must do something with the other 96 percent of the people on this small planet, in order to maintain our standard of living and our ability to stand up for our values around the world.” The presidential visit has not been a stellar success from the point of view of American business. The White House bypassed vis- its to any American factories here, despite heavy pressure from U.S. firms hoping Clinton would showcase their operations. Busi- ness here is still complicated and restricted, and few American cor- porations generate notable prof- its. A visit by Clinton might impress shareholders. Corporate America got several other disappointments from Clinton’s nine-day tour of China. The White House waffled for weeks before deciding not to include a business delegation as part of Clinton’s official entou- rage. That would have given com- mercial relations a high-profile role in Clinton’s trip through five cities. Nor did Clinton and his admin- istration achieve an agreement on China’s admittance to the World Trade Organization, which busi- ness leaders listed as a No.1 pri- ority of this summit. As a WTO member China would have to reduce tariffs and loosen tough controls over foreign firms doing business here. General Motors especially Ps. appealed hard for Clinton to stop by its new joint venture factory that will turn out a version of the Buick Regal here in Shanghai, a daring project that carries the risk of falling flat for lack of big- car demand. GM was still hopeful by mid-month, but a major strike in the United States made a presi- dential visit a bad publicity risk. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wil- liam Daley also said at a briefing Tuesday that no progress had been made on reducing China’s trade deficit, with the American side saying China sells about $50 billion more than it buys from the United States. New figures show the deficit has jumped by another 13-14 percent in the first five months of this year. “The bottom Iine is, our exports have not grown anywhere near the degree that their exports to the United States have,’’ Daley said. And he said no “concrete steps” have been taken in the past five days to shrink the deficit. Recognizing the concern over the deficit and over the existing barriers to doing business here, China’s official news agency Xin- hua this week put out an article trumpeting the country’s profit- making possibilities. “China remains the largest potential market on earth,’’ President Clinton addresses U.S. business leaders in Shanghai, China, today. Clinton spoke with the business leaders in the atrium of a high-rise hotel J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE / Associated Press Xinhua said, underscoring that some companies have mistakenly viewed China as ‘‘a big nation but a small market.” It said the State Statistics Bureau found consumer spending in China has been growing two to three percentage points more ae gross domestic product since 1996. This visit did not even generate a huge total of new business. On Tuesday Americans and Chinese signed $2 billion in deals at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, an event Clinton did not attend. Xinhua reported another $1.1 billion the previous week. Most of the deals had been expected: for months, and some even previously announced. So there were few surprise contracts like the big $6 billion package announced when Chinese Presi- dent Jiang Zemin visited the United States last fall. Among the “new” deals was $800 million worth of passenger planes that China is buying from Boeing. That was part of a deal for SO planes announced last fall, though Boeing said a new letter of intent also had been signed to sell another 10 aircraft worth $400 million. Another big contract was General Electric’s sale of a $161.7 million integrated steam turbine system to the Chinese. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 1, 1998 \f"

STAFF CORRESPONDENTS — American corpo- rations lobbied months for Presi- dent Clinton to visit their facto- ries in China, but today he will bypass the chance to be photo- graphed next to eager, low-paid Chinese workers making goods for export to the United States. “A lot of companies talked about trying to get the president to do a whole host of things, visit their plants, visit schools that they support, and a whole host of them,” a member of the Clinton entourage, U.S. Commerce Secre- tary William Daley, said Tuesday. But Daley said the closest he expects Clinton to get to any American business is at a half- hour speech this morning to the should be a member in any orga- nization for which statehood is a requirement.” That is precisely what China’s President Jiang Zemin said he wanted from Clinton, but did not get until Tuesday morning. Earli- er, without giving specifics, Clinton said vaguely that he sup- ports the existing U.S. policy. “The United States and Chi- nese communists have no rights and are in no position to conduct bilateral negotiations on anything related to our affairs,” Taiwan foreign ministry spokesman Roy Wu told reporters. White House press spokesman Mike McCurry tried to downplay Clinton’s comment, calling it “merely a reiteration of long- standing U.S. policy.” He said there was no particular reason Clinton finally made the comments Chinese leaders had called the most important aspect of his trip. Clinton may have waited until leaving the Beijing seat of government in an effort to diminish the impact of his state- ment, and he also may have with- held it until seeing how the Chi- nese would respond to some of the administration’s desires. J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE / Associated Press Taking calls: President Clinton speaks during Shanghai Radio 990’s “Citizens and Society” talk show on Tuesday, hosted by American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. As the day with the least-crowded schedule, Wednes- day was the most likely target for a factory visit. Daley said a “symbolic visit” to a U.S. factory wouldn’t have nearly the impact as Clinton’s overall message “of greater coop- eration” between China and America. Corporate America got several other disappointments from Clinton’s nine-day tour of China. The White House waffled for weeks before finally deciding not to include a business delegation as part of Clinton’s official entou- rage. That would have given com- mercial relations a high-profile role in Clinton’s five-city tour. Nor did Clinton and his admin- istration achieve an agreement on China’s admittance to the World Trade Organization, which busi- ness leaders listed as a No.1 pri- ority of this summit. As a WTO member, China would have to reduce tariffs and loosen tough controls over foreign firms doing business here. General Motors especially appealed hard for Clinton to stop by its new joint venture factory that will turn out a version of the Zuo Aniong (seated, back). Buick Regal here in Shanghai, a daring project that carries the risk of falling flat for lack of big- car demand. GM was still hopeful by mid-month, but a major strike in the United States made a presi- dential visit a bad publicity risk. Daley also said at a briefing Tuesday that no progress had been made on reducing China’s trade deficit, with the American side saying China sells about $50 billion more than it buys from the U.S. New figures show the deficit has jumped by another 13 percent to 14 percent in the first five months of this year. “The bottom line is, our exports have not grown anywhere near the degree that their exports to the United States have,” Daley said. And he said no “concrete steps” have been taken in the last five days to shrink the deficit. Clinton quickly shifted the mood of this trip from official meetings to more informal visits with Chinese people as soon as he got to Shanghai. On Tuesday he held a round- table discussion with intellectuals and sat through call-in questions during an hourlong radio talk show. He walked in the lush Yu Gardens with his daughter Chelsea, fed the fish and bought some ice cream. In the round table discussion, Clinton made one comment in a rather off-hand way that will make China’s top leaders sit up and take notice back in Beijing. It also caused dismay in Taiwan. Clinton finally repeated specif- ically the “three no’s” that Chi- nese have wanted him to commit to upholding in regard to U.S. pol- icy on Taiwan. In official meetings earlier in the trip, Clinton said, he had a chance to reiterate the American policy, “which is that we don’t support independence for Tai- wan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan-one China,” he said. “And we don't believe that Taiwan After getting two live televised appearances broadcast on Chi- nese television, which had been a high administration priority, Clinton delivered the sought-after statement that cements U.S. pol- icy as coming from the govern- ment’s highest source. In Shanghai, Clinton largely achieved the kind of informal give-and-take he had hoped to experience in China, as part of his effort to give Americans a better understanding of the country that well may be the economic power- house of the 21st Century. The toughest talk show ques- tion probably was the query about which team he thinks will win the World Cup. “I’m not an expert in soccer, but I think the Brazilians are always hard to beat,” Clinton said. Show host Zuo Anlong won- dered whether America couldn't adapt the “ping-pong diplomacy” that opened the door to China into “soccer diplomacy” and open a route to better relations with Iran. “I think it could be possible,” Clinton said.

But since Mao's death in 1976, provincial “reform” Communist leaders have closed 49 of the worst polluters along the Li. They also have built sewage plants that treat 40 percent of Guilin’s waste- water, according to an official Chinese tally. Clinton’s theme for his eighth day in China was that “the Chi- mese must be a part of any solu- tion to global environmental prob- lems,” Steinberg said. Clinton was expected to expand on an idea he enunciated in his Monday speech at Beijing Univer- sity: “In the near future, if present energy use patterns per- sist, China will overtake the United States as the world’s larg- est emitter of greenhouse gases, which are the principal causes of global warming.” Following his day trip to Gui- lin, Clinton was scheduled to wind up his China visit in Hong Kong on Friday.

        "ocr_text": "China should balance growth, environment, Clinton says By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT AND Marcia KUNSTEL American-Statesman International Staff GUILIN, China — Amid the mist-shrouded mountains and winding rivers of Guilin, which many Chinese consider the most beautiful place in the world, President Clinton warned this morning that the environment should not be sacrificed for eco- . nomic growth in China, one of the most polluted countries on Earth. Clinton told Chinese environ- mentalists that even in the United States “‘there is a big fight” over environmental protection ~ be- cause “‘there are always people who are afraid if we take any step it will hurt the economy.” He said that, if Guilin wants tourists to come, “you have to have a clean environment. If you want a strong economy, you have to produce healthy children. So at some point we have to see these things together.” Clinton picked this picture- postcard village to urge China to shed its reputation as one of the most polluted places on Earth and to pledge U.S. support for those efforts. “You have long related prob- lems with the number one health problem in China (respiratory ill- ness) because of air pollution,” he said in an interview with Chinese state television expected to be broadcast nationally today. “Your major waterways have pollution; the water table is down. We have to find a way to grow the economy and replenish the envi- ronment,” he said. “I predict to you, 10 years from now, people will look back and say that’s one of the biggest things they did.” The interview was _ taped Wednesday in Shanghai, White House spokesman Michael McCurry said, but held a day so it wouldn’t interfere with TV cov- erage of Chinese President Jiang Zemin’s arrival in Hong Kong to celebrate the first anniversary of the Chinese takeover of the former British territo Greg Gibson/AP During a tour of a Shanghai, China, housing development Wednesday, President Clinton smiles at 4-year-old David Ren as the boy’s mother, Shaoping Liu-Ren, left, watches. Clinton has said that Chinese pollution threatens people around the planet because China is about to surpass the United States as the top producer of the smokestack and tailpipe emissions linked to global warming. China has re- fused to sign an international agreement __ to curb those emissions. Clinton and his advisers say that China has signaled new in- terest in cleaning its environ- ment. Beijing, for example, re- cently banned leaded gasoline. China also has pledged a $54 bil- lion investment in the environment between 1996 and 2000. “There has been a sea change in attitudes here,” said Deputy Na- tional Security Adviser James Steinberg. - Clinton announced _ several measures to help China do more, including an Environmental Pro- tection Agency program to help China accurately monitor its air quality, a $50 million loan from the Export-Import Bank to help de- velop clean energy projects and a contract to develop cleaner uses of coal. Both the Chinese and Clinton, who has openly criticized human rights conditions in China, were determined to close out the presi- dent’s visit without generating new controversy. The guest list for Clinton’s meeting in Guilin with Chinese environmentalists didn’t include author Dai Qing, China’s best- known environmental activist. “We can’t get everyone into this (meeting), but certainly we are in contact with her,” Steinberg said. Dai, a longtime critic of the government’s controversial Three Gorges Dam, was jailed for months for her environmental writings after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. When fin- ished in 2003, the Three Gorges project on the Yangtze River will be the most powerful hydroelec- tric dam in the world, but it will submerge 66,700 acres of farmland and displace almost 1.9 million people. The White House was taking steps to make Clinton’s next stop, in Hong Kong on Friday, as free of controversy as possible. Though he is due to meet pro- democracy legislators in Hong Kong, the White House refused requests by to let TV cameras re- cord all or part of the meetings. In the most sensitive encounter, Clinton was scheduled to meet Martin Lee, Hong Kong’s leading democratic politician. Meeting opposition leaders pri- vately, without cameras ‘“‘is more or less our standard practice,” insisted Steinberg. In his TV interview taped Wednesday in Shanghai, Clinton made vague references to freedom and democratic principles, but he didn’t repeat last Saturday’s sharp critique of China’s crackdown on the Tiananmen Square  pro- democracy movement in 1989. “I think this whole democratic process, in my view, is very, very important to make society work when things are changing as quickly as they are now,” Clinton said. When queried on America’s role in the world, the president said that one of his most difficult tasks is handling the nation’s post-Cold War role “‘which is temporary — it won’t last forever — as the only superpower in the world.” On Friday night, the president is to board Air Force One for the trans-Pacific flight scheduled to bring him home in time to see the dawning of the Fourth of July on US. soil. As a sign that the president’s staff is already thinking ahead to U.S. controversies, McCurry of- fered the first riposte on Chinese soil about the Monica Lewinsky controversy. When asked at a briefing about Linda Tripp’s grand jury testimo- ny, McCurry cracked: ‘‘The pres- ident has been concentrated on one trip, and it’s China, not Linda.” Austin American-Statesman - July 2, 1998 \f"

        "ocr_text": "For 50 years, progress added up to pollution Joseph Albright avd Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — In just a _ half- century, China has doubled its population, multiplied its facto- ries and vastly increased its pol- lution. Here’s how: w 1949 — Backward Is _ Beautiful. When Communists take over in 1949, China is an impoverished, crowded country. Only one-tenth of the 540 mil- lion inhabitants live in towns and cities. Many waterways are polluted with human waste, but the air is clean. Beijing is famous for its azure sky. mtLate 1953 — Modernization. Com- munist leader Mao Tse-tung launches China’s first Five Year Plan, aiming to yank China into the industrial age using Stalin’s model. China’s coal mining is ordered to double by 1957, cement manufacturing to triple, internal com- bustion engines to increase tenfold. The plan succeeds in kick-starting eco- nomic growth. @ Mid-Fifties — Soviet Aid. Huge, inef- ficient coal-fired factories sprout on the edges of every Chinese city, most designed by Soviet engineers. Smog and water pollution increase around Chinese cities, but the measurements are secret. Among the biggest and dirti- est factories is the massive Capital Iron and Steel works in Beijing’s western suburbs, which three decades later would cause up to half the city’s smog. @ 1958 — Great Leap. Mao Tse-tung launches the “Great Leap Forward,” a revolutionary scheme to multiply Chi- na’s industrial and moral strength by @preading small-scale mines, mills and ‘factories throughout the countryside. One result: a jump in water and air pol- lution from the poorly made factories. Another: a disastrous fall in food pro- duction, causing a mass famine in which 20 million Chinese die. w Late ’50s-mid °60s — Baby Boom. China’s population surges to nearly 750 million — up by almost 40 percent in the 15 years since Mao’s takeover. One- sixth of Chinese now live in towns and cities, up from one-tenth in 1949. w@ 1974 — Cold War. Warnings from Western demographers about a Chinese “population explosion” are dismissed in Beijing as anti-Communist propaganda. m 1979 — Village Industries. Leader Deng Xiaoping loosens economic les, enco villagers to build rural factories and power plants. While allowing millions to escape poverty, the small-scale factories and dirty power plants multiply pollution of the Yangtze and other rivers. Smog, already perva- sive in cities, soon becomes noticeable Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 2, 1998 in the countryside. m@ September 1980 — One Child. Pre- mier Hua Guofeng announces that each Chinese family must strive to bear just one child. China soon revises its mar- riage law to ban teenagers from marry- ing. But population keeps rising. w 1982 — One Billion. China’s most accurate census shows that the popula- tion has crept over 1 billion. Life expectancy has increased dramatically, and there are now 265 million women of child-bearing age. The government toughens population control measures, ordering compulsory IUD insertion for women with one child. Sterilization is compulsory for either husband or wife after the birth of a second child. Some women who get pregnant without per- mission of their work units are forced to have abortions. wm 1990s — Acid Rain. China’s cheap, abundant coal produces 70 percent of the country’s energy. China’s coal has a high sulfur content and less than one- fifth of Chinese coal is de-sulfurized before smoke goes up the stack. By mid-decade, China consumes 1.3 billion tons of coal annually, one-third of all coal burned worldwide. And China is the world’s largest sulfur-dioxide emit- ter. Resulting acid rain erodes China’s soil, kills trees and damages wetlands and grasslands. Japanese scientists also find effects of Chinese acid rain. @ 1996 — Realization. China appeals to the World Bank for help in arresting environmental degradation. In a star- tling acknowledgement, China’s top environmental official Xie Zhenhua says the country’s ecosystem is in “grave” condition. He predicts China will have to spend $SO billion in five years to control air and water pollution. @ End of 1996 — China’s population reaches 1.236 billion and is increasing by at least 13 million every year. @ Mid-1997 — Car Threat. China’s increasingly wealthy middle class is just starting to acquire private cars. Most buy Chinese-made cars that pro- duce 10 to 15 times as much pollution as cars sold in Europe or America. With the number of cars on Chinese roads increasing by 10 percent a year, China bans the sale of leaded gasoline in Beijing and Shanghai. But few cars sold in China are equipped with catalytic converters because unleaded gasoline is sold only in a few cities. w@ Feb. 28, 1998 — Secrecy Pierced. Beijing, along with 38 other Chinese cit- ies, begins issuing weekly air quality statistics that have hitherto been state secrets. China’s state-controlled media and TV blossom with articles highlight- ing the long-range risks of pollution. \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright _ STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Hong Kong — President Clinton’s low- key meetings today with Hong Kong oppo- sition legislators gave him his only chance to hear critics of the ruling Chinese Com- munist regime during his nine-day trip to China. Preparing to fly home late in the day for a Fourth of July greeting at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington at dawn Saturday, Clinton spoke about how Hong Kong’s still-limited democracy can influ- ence the long-term future of the rest of China. In a dinner toast a few hours after arriv- ing Thursday night, Clinton said the future “will be difficult, but most of it will be very good’”’ if China is able to ‘‘stay on the right side of history.”’ He referred to his remarks last fall when he told President Jiang Zemin that defending China’s 1989 crackdown on democracy advocates put him on the wrong side of history. Clinton was exchanging toasts with Tung Chee-hwa, the Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong who imme- diately abolished an elected legislature last summer after Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control after more than 150 years of British rule. Today, Clinton was scheduled to meet privately with the leader of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party, Martin Lee, and other democratic activists working for multi- party democracy in the only bit of China where any high-level democratic elections are permitted, Lee, a fiery lawyer, told journalists, ‘‘I was impressed by the president’s joint press conference with Jiang Zemin and believe the fact that it was televised live in China was a significant development for the Chinese people.” Only a third of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council members are elected now. The rest are appointed by pro-Beijing GREG GIBSON /Associated Press Waving to residents, President Clinton on Thursday visits Yucan, China, during a boat trip on the Li River. The famous Guilin Peaks rise in the background. professional and social groups. Clinton’s talks with members of what in Hong Kong is a tolerated opposition fall short of qualifying as a meeting with dissidents. : The White House had vacillated in the days before Clinton left for China over . whether he would have face-to-face talks with dissidents, who could face arrest or labor camp terms for speaking out against Communist Party rule. As it turned out, Clinton met with nei- ther political dissidents nor leaders of Chi- na’s burgeoning underground churches. His ostensible aim was to protect the dissidents from harassment. But the deci- sion also was calculated to spare his Chi- nese hosts the negative publicity that would attend such a meeting. The White House even tried to down- play the meetings with Lee and others in Hong Kong’s elected opposition, refusing to allow American or Chinese television to film any part of the sessions. Especially in Hong Kong, Clinton could have met some of the most effective human rights monitors keeping track of what is happening to dissidents on the mainland Lu Si Qing, for example, runs a shoe- string operation called the International Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movements in China, which alerts journal- ists by fax or cell phone about Chinese dis- sidents who are arrested or simply disappear. Clinton’s arrival in Hong Kong came one day after the special autonomous region celebrated the first anniversary of the handover to China. Chinese officials opened the new Chek Lap Kok International Airport in conjunc- tion with the anniversary Wednesday. Air Force One was the first plane with passengers to land at the airport Thursday night. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 3, 1998 \f"

This is the movable fount of knowledge where 250 of the world’s most proficient, most exhausted journalists are forced by the iron laws of deadlines to get most of their first-hand China impressions. As we tap this story on our laptop, it is midafternoon in Shanghai. This is the delightful daily interlude when editors back home, a half day behind us, are sleeping. Only about 50 of the 200 chairs in the filing center are occupied. Even so, everyone is watching out of the corner of their eyes. If a competitor picks up a valuable tidbit from the strolling White House assistant, who knows if it could lead to a dreaded “callback” from an editor?

Because of filing deadlines, we had to give back to the press office the cre- dentials that would have allowed us to witness two of the most important events of the trip: Clinton’s joint news conference with President Jiang Zemin in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People and his speech at Beijing University.

Correspondents complain about “bubble fever.” But once a presidential| trip begins, few have time to escape from the “bubble” long enough to develop a story the presidential press office hasn’t put in the “bible.” This is the detailed, semi-secret press sched- ule for traveling journalists that is marked “not for release or publica- tion.” (For China, the “bible” came in two parts, the first 89 pages long, the second 38 pages.) Because of limits on press access — imposed by the Chinese or the White House or both — most all the stops on the president's daily rounds in China are so-called “pooled events.” That means the 200 traveling jour- nalists take turns getting “pool” cre- dentials to witness the actual events. Then they turn over “pool reports” con: sisting of video footage, radio feeds or typed-up notes to their colleagues. The White House press office doesn’t cen- sor the content. but it is responsible fo~ disseminating the results. While the few journalists with the “pool passes” are “pre-positioned” to await the president’s arrival, the rest o! the press corps waits in the press room until a photocopied “pool report” is passed round the room by a low-level White House aide. Thanks to the fabled efficiency of the White House Communications Agency, the press filing center is also the place where White House corre- spondents can “see” or “hear” presi- dential events as they unfold, without even leaving their laptops. Sound “feeds” from each of the half- dozen presidential appearances each day are piped into the press room instantaneously, often accompanied by live TV images. About half an hour after the presi- dent finishes talking, a White House aide will come around the filing center and deposit a neatly typed transcript cranked out by the traveling White House steno pool. Given the way every city’s traffic gets paralyzed during an American - president’s visit, the press room is also about the only place where a corre- spondent can soak up what’s going on, - write it and not miss deadlines. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK For a news organization accredited to cover the White House regularly, it probably costs about $20,000 per corre- spondent to cover Clinton’s China trip. About half of this is the pro-rata share of the $1.1 million that the White House travel office is paying to charter from Cathay Pacific Airlines the Boeing 777-300 stretch jet that serves as the traveling press plane. The balance is hotel bills, the charges for the interna- tional direct-dial phones arranged by ATT and the cost of the round-the-clock filing center buffet. We started this piece in Shanghai, when the center of the bubble was perched for three days on the fourth floor of Shanghai's Portman Ritz- Carlton Hotel. We had to put it aside to write dead- line stories. By the time we could get back to it, the bubble had decamped 800 miles south to the ballroom of the Gui Shan Hotel in Guilin, China. Unless exhaustion interferes, we'll file this in an hour from our laptop's modem in the Guilin press center, using a Chinese long-distance phone line to hitch into a dialup modem in Hong Kong, Beijing or Tokyo. By the time our editors wake up anc Start editing the story, the bubble will have taken off and alighted once again This time, it will be at the Grand Hyat Hotel in Hong Kong, where we'll hope to find a pool report telling us what Clinton was up to while we were flying from Guilin to Hong Kong. No matter where the bubble moves, the remarkable thing is how similarly laid out and superbly efficient are the transmission paraphernalia. Every- thing has been pre-set for us by White House and U.S. Information Agency advance teams before our arrival. - In the front left corner of most ever filing center, two technicians from the White House Communications Agency sit behind a sound console taken from a blue steamer trunk. It’s WACA’s job to transmit a sound “feed” of every public word uttered by the president to those in the bubble. Outside the door of every filing cen- Signaling his rousing wel- come from Chi- nese students fol- lowing remarks at Peking Univer- sity on Monday, President Clinton called for more human rights for a generation that will lead China in the next century. The president raises (below) with former Chinese GREG GIBSON / Associated Press ter is a nonstop buffet. It is so ample, varied and quick that few people bother ever to leave the bubble to eat at real Chinese restaurants. There are no checks to sign — the cost eventually gets pro-rated to the various news orga- nizations by the White House travel office. That, at least, isthe theory. . Today in Guilin, the buffet features a side of American roast beef, tofu and mushrooms, stir-fried broccoli and some remarkably good Chinese steamed dumplings. For the faint- hearted, there is a platter of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches — on white bread with the crusts removed. . As the White House well knows, cor- respondents have families, and families expect trinkets. As we were starting this story in Shanghai yesterday, a White House aide bustled to the front of the filing - center. “White House press shopping tour leaving,” the aide called out. “Meet at the transportation desk on this floor’ . at 1 p.m.” It was time for the Huai Ha Zhong Lu market press tour, achance for ~ journalists to escape from “the bubble” for a few hours before press secretary “Pearls, silks, fans, Chinese art,” read the notation on the White House signup sheet. About a dozen journalists and technicians rose from their over- worked laptops and made a beeline for the chartered buses. , We skipped shopping so that we could get ready for something really important: a riverboat cruise that the White House press office has laid on to let correspondents experience the _— mythic Li River, said to be the most beautiful spot in China. Clinton will cruise the beautiful Li in a red, white and blue riverboat called the Panorama an hour or so ahead of - the press boat. If it is mythically beau- tiful enough for the First Traveler, it is good enough for us. Sorry, dear reader, this is the end of the story. Someone from the White House staff has dropped a p ied sheet on our desks in the bubble. . It says: “NEW TIME: Press Bus . Ride. Board Bus Here 1:30 P.M. Buses © Gone 1:45 p.m.” This one we are not going to miss. Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel are staff correspondents covering Asia. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 5, 1998 (Continued) \f"

Though air travel has been diminished by the Asian financial crisis, more than 30 million pas- sengers a year are expected to pass through the soaring white glass-and-steel terminal that is described as the world’s largest public building. Following nine years of plan- ning, the most crucial hours in opening the airport were the final 13 leading up to the first commer- cial flights. Starting at 5:30 p.m. Sunday, thousands of workers undertook a massive transfer of airport load- ing ramps, fueling trucks and other equipment to the new air- port. The Chinese news agency Xinhua called the move from Hong Kong’s old Kai Tak airport the biggest peacetime transfer of materiel ever. Hong Kong roads were closed, hundreds of police called out to keep the order and curious locals shooed away from the 18-mile road corridor separating the two air fields. More than 1,000 vehicles in 16 convoys were enlisted to haul the apparatus necessary to make Hong Kong International func- tion, from tractors and pallet pushers to 70,000 sets of silver- ware for the catering service. One of the airport's attractions is the Airport Express, a rail link that connects passengers at speeds of up to 81 MPH with two downtown check-in terminals in Hong Kong center and Kowloon. The train takes just 23 minutes to reach the airport, which is built on the island of Chek Lap Kok in the South China Sea 18 miles west of the city. While landing, passengers will look down on a single gigantic Y- shaped terminal three-quarters of a mile long that resembles the profile of an airplane in flight. Once inside the terminal, they will be under a giant lightweight vaulted roof big enough to contain 85 American football fields. The terminal’s top level is for check-in and passport control, the middle level is for duty-free shops and departure gates, and the bot- tom level is for arrivals and bag- gage carousels. “To know where to go, you sim- ply follow the roof,” the British architect Sir Norman Foster has said. ““You follow the lines of the vaulted arch structure, and although you are moving through — a variety of spaces, you always know where you are.” Curiously, Foster has told local journalists that his design was inspired by an old aerial photo- graph of Atlanta’s wedge-shaped airport terminal in the 1930s. He said he was trying to capture the “simplicity” of the old Atlanta airport and “achieve that simplic- ity in an international airport.” The new Hong Kong Interna- tional, which is designed mainly for jumbo jets, has 38 terminal- side “air bridges” that can handle Boeing 747s or European Airbus- es. It is building 10 positions for the 600-passenger Airbus super- jumbo jets that are now under development in Europe. Although Hong Kong is under Chinese sovereignty, passengers will find that Chinese censorship rules do not apply here. One of the books prominently displayed in an airport bookshop is “The Private Life of Chairman Mao” by Li Zhisui, the private physician of the late Communist leader Mao Tse-tung. The book was banned in mainland China because of its frank revelations about Mao’s personal life, including his sexual adventures with many young women. On its opening day, the new Hong Kong airport expects about half the traffic volume of the world’s three busiest airports, Chicago O’Hare (69 million pas- sengers in 1996), Atlanta’s Harts- field (63 million in 1996) and Dallas/Fort Worth (S8 million in 1996). But within a decade, Hong. Kong airport authorities plan-to open a second huge terminal, this one X-shaped, that they say will increase the passenger capacity to 89 million per year. paid LAP KOK sik ad area — 554, Check-in counters — - 28& - Walting — 12,530 — Source: hkairport.com, __ the airport's official website.

        "ocr_text": "China pats itself on the back On National Day, Communists praise Jiang for ‘people’s war’ against deadly summer floods. STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — In one of China’s most stridently nationalistic interludes in a decade, the nation’s rulers are pulling out the stops to glorify the once pallid President Jiang Zemin and pro- claim the dominance of Commu- nist Party rule. With a single-mindedness that would have heartened the late leader Mao Tse-tung, Communist Party propagandists recast Thursday’s National Day to praise Jiang for his brilliance in a “people’s war” to van- quish this summer’s heavy floods. campaign’s most visible symbol is a 20-foot-long photo montage featuring Jiang with a megaphone inspiring legions of flood-fighting troops as they stand shoulder-to-shoulder pro- tecting sand-bagged river dikes. Thousands of Chinese holiday- makers viewed the giant Jiang poster as they trooped into the Museum of the Revolution, just off Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, to see an urgently arranged exhi- bition of flood-fighting photo- graphs. The campaign, which seems to be playing very well with the peo- ple, also is symbolized by the lav- ishness of the party’s daily self- congratulatory rhetoric on radio and television. The tone harkens back to the heady years not long after Mao declared the founding of a “new” nation — the People’s Republic of China — Oct. 1, 1949. “History has eloquently proved that the Communist Party of China is a great, glorious and cor- rect party,” Premier Zhu Rongji told 1,000 party leaders and for- eign dignitaries Wednesday at a banquet on the eve of National Day. Zhu, who has enjoyed an LI JUNDONG / Associated Press Flood’s heroes: Zhu Jianming and Wang Ping (both in foreground) and others salute the flag Thursday in Beijing. Zhu and Wang were named outstanding commanders in the efforts to battle flood waters earlier this year. overseas reputation as a pragma- tist, has emerged in recent weeks as one of the Communist Party’s chief drum-beaters in the propa- ganda campaign to celebrate what is repeatedly referred to as Chi- na’s “flood-fighting spirit.” “The socialist system has incomparable superiority and vitality,” Zhu said in his first National Day speech since becoming premier in March. “Our people will be able to advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in all areas.” The state media have been laden with almost identical slo- gans from other party luminaries, led by Jiang himself. “The anti-flood campaign proves that the Chinese Commu- nist Party is a great, glorious and correct party,” the president said last month in a visit to the flood- damaged town of Jiujiang in east- ern China. “The socialist system has great superiority. The army is trustworthy. The Chinese people are industrious and courageous.” Two days ago, Jiang height- ened the rhetoric when he lik- ened China’s victory over the floods to its conquest of pro- democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. “In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we stood up to the interna- tional and domestic political dis- turbances to defend the great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and successfully withstood a severe test of political risk,” Jiang said. “This time, we conquered the assaults of the extraordinarily serious flooding . . . and withstood a severe test of natural disaster.” It remains a mystery just why the Communist party hierarchs chose this year’s floods as a pre- text for such an extended barrage of patriotic and pro-party propaganda. One theory is that following President Bill Clinton’s midsum- mer trip to China, the ruling party leaders were worried about a stir- ring of support for ending the Communist Party’s political monopoly through the creation of a legal opposition party. The “flood-fighting spirit” cam- paign also arose at a time when the image of the People’s Libera- tion Army leadership was tattered by reports of corruption. Mean- while, the party was grappling with how to explain the slowing of China’s economy, following two- decades of near double-digit annual economic growth credited to Jiang’s predecessor, the late Deng Xiaoping.

        "ocr_text": "China, Taiwan taking tentative steps toward peace A tenuous sortie: Meetings this week are not even formal, but they could be the first on the road to settling a half century of conflict. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Beijing — Mighty China and fortress Taiwan once again have tucked away their guns and this week and will make another ten- uous sortie into the realm of peacefully settling half a century of conflict. Divisions still are huge be- tween the Communist mainland and the island that broke away after civil war 49 years ago, ulti- mately to evolve into a raucous little democracy 100 miles off China’s southern coast. The delicately choreographed talks that begin Wednesday are not even formal negotiations. They will not be conducted by government officials and so far don’t seem to have much of an agenda. But when Koo Chen-fu, head of the Straits Exchange Foundation, comes over to meet Chinese ‘ counterpart Wang Daohan, presi- dent of the Association for Rela- tions Across the Taiwan Strait, the two octogenarians will have the futures of their people on the table. These are the highest-level talks since the same two men held breakthrough discussions in Singapore in 1993, then saw missile-rattling disrupt the dia- logue. “It is important in the sense that the Wang-Koo meeting implies that the two sides ‘nor- malize’ their relations,” said Zheng Yongnian, a fellow at the East Asian Institute in Singapore who follows cross-strait relations. Both sides have stepped gin- gerly in recent weeks in order to do exactly that: Pave the way for more normal and continuing con- tacts after Koo’s six-day visit that is scheduled to include an Oct. 18 meeting with China’s President Jiang Zemin. Taiwan’s military, for exam- ple, canceled exercises set for this week in order “to cultivate harmony and positive progress in cross-strait relations,” according to news reports from Taiwan. Taiwan’s troops would have employed their most sophisti- cated weapons, including Ameri- can F-16 fighter planes and Knox-class frigates, the sales of which so raised the ire of Beijing’s leaders. On the Chinese side, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan recently promised Taiwan “will enjoy greater autonomy than Hong Kong and Macao” if it reunites with the mainland. The former British colony of Hong Kong became part of China in 1997, and Macao is due to end four centu- ries as a Portuguese territory when it rejoins China next year. A Chinese government spokes- man later explained that Taiwan would maintain its own armed forces and get guaranteed posi tions in the mainland government Hong Kong and Macau wer offered neither but do hold guar. antees to keep personal rights anc. freedoms, as well as their capital: ist economies under the “one Chi: na, two systems” formula. There have been reports 0! other possible concessions by the mainland, such as replacing the red Communist flag and changing the country’s name to “China’ from the current People’s Repub. lic of China, which was created when the Communists took com- mand 49 years ago. The 1993 China-Taiwan talks were likewise promising, but the dialogue didn’t last. Beijing can- celed a major follow-up negotia- tion in mid-1995 in response to Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui’s “unofficial” trip to the United States. It was viewed as promot- ing Taiwan’s independence. Relations deteriorated. When China for a second time fired unarmed missiles near Taiwan in March 1996, the United States sent an aircraft carrier battle group to the South China Sea to warn China to sheath its weapons. Two years of fence-mending finally produced this new set of talks, but the path to resolution is hardly clear. Today many Taiwanese are edging toward a declaration of full independence. Potentially, that could provoke an armed response from the mainland state that the United States recognizes as the sole legitimate Chinese government. To remind his mainland coun- terparts that radical sentiment is gaining strength among the island’s 22 million people, negoti- ator Koo reportedly has included in his delegation several Taiwan- ese of the pena faction backing depend Taiwan’s ruling Kuomintang Party, which founded the Taiwan government when it fled losing battles against the Communists in 1949, has been more amenable to some form of reunion that would preserve Taiwan’s autonomy without status as an independent state. But even in the Kuom- intang, voices rarely can be heard accepting the mainland’s formula applied to Hong Kong and Macao. So far, Taiwan has not even publicly accepted Beijing’s demands that the talks immedi- ately home in on the tough politi- cal questions of reunification. Taiwanese leaders keep pro- moting discussion of less momen- tous economic and cultural issues first, to facilitate the already heavy exchanges of people and capital across the strait. For instance, Taiwan wants an under- standing on how to treat Chinese or Taiwanese refugees who reach the others’ territory. That doesn’t much interest the mainland side. President Jiang has consolidated his power on the mainland and is under pressure by some Communist Party ele- ments to flex his strength and bring the island back. “He has to do something regarding the Taiwan issue,” said Zheng of the East Asia Institute. Jiang’s position was enhanced this summer when President Clinton for the first time enunciated what Chinese officials call the “three no’s,” committing America not to recognize “two Chinas” or “one China, one Tai- wan;” not to support Taiwan seek- ing independence; and not to endorse Taiwan’s membership in international organizations whose members must be sovereign states.
