        "ocr_text": "Senate aide fears Rocky remark hurt By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — A young Sen- ate aide has expressed fears that despite Vice President Nelson Rockefeller’s extraordinary retrac- tion, his career might have been harmed by the Vice President's hint that he was a former Commu- nist. ' Richard Perle, 34, said, *‘More people than you would think will take an allegation like this serious- ly. My very ability to do my job depends on people having trust in my loyalty, and anything that casts doubt on it is obviously very dam- agineg.”’ Perle, who is Senator Henry Jackson’s expert on the Soviet Union, was not completely molli- fied even after Rockefeller took the floor of the Senate Tuesday to apologize for having ‘“‘engaged in unsubstantiated speculation about eo of Senator Jackson’s staff.”” A second Jackson aide, Dorothy Fosdick, would make no comment, referring reporters instead to Jack- son's own comments on the Senate floor. Adopting a milder line, Jack- son accepted Rockefeller’s apology and added, “as far as I am con- cerned, on behalf of my staff as well as myself, this is the end of this matter.” The Vice President’s unexpected retraction headed off a confronta- tion with the Senate leadership which had been building rapidly as a result of a story in the Atlanta Journal by political editor David Nordan last Wednesday disclosing that Rockefeller had questioned the backgrounds of two Jackson aides in a private meeting with Georgia Republicans. Even so, there was some reason to believe that Rockefeller may face further trouble because of his remarks. According to a friend of the two Jackson aides, there is a possibility that one or both may consult a lawyer about filing a slander suit against the multi-mil- White House spokesman Larry Speakes said President Ford had no advance word on Rockefeller’s de- cision to apologize. Speakes said the President learned of Rockefel- ler’s Senate appearance later in the day, while aboard Air Force One. Fosdick was the only one identi- fied by name in the Atlanta Journal account, which said several Repub- licans recalled Rockefeller describ- ing her as an aide to Alger Hiss at the 1945 conference that drafted the United Nations charter. She has since acknowleged working at that rene but not as an aide to ss. ; The Journal also reported that Rockefeller made more serious re- marks about a second, unnamed Jackson aide — that he was a one- time “avowed Communist’ who had subsequently ‘‘converted.\"’ Time magazine this week report- ed that Perle, who works in tie same office as Fosdick, was the second Jackson aide Rockefeller was describing. Me? Perle, ‘who is known on Capitel Hill as a hardliner on policy ‘to- ward the Soviet Union, has clashed behind the scenes with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on a se ries of U.S.-Soviet issues on which Jackson and Kissinger disagree. x “ Perle was instrumental two against his wishes, to negotiate ar understanding with the Soviet Union under which Soviet Jews$ concessions.

Nearly all the Democratic delegates have now been picked. Technically, 192 of the 3,008 delegates are yet to be named. But, in most cases, their votes on the first ‘ballot must reflect the results of presidential primaries already held in their states. THE ONLY ACTUAL contests ahead are for 71 delegates in five state conventions later this month: 11 in Colorado, 12 in Delaware, 17 in Missouri, 13 in North Dakota and 18 in Utah.

This informal survey by Cox newspapers found little trace of the “softness” among as of now they would vote for Carter, Only 12 said they would stick with the incum- bent with the rest Some Democratic powers, including House Majority Leader Thomas “Tip” O'Neill, reportedly urged Carter to se- lect a Catholic running mate like Sen, Edmund Muskie of Maine to offset Carter's potential weakness in the eth- nic neighborhoods of the Catholics which the Carter Northeast. v1 ign's own pollster, Pat ddell, discovered through- - the country in polls taken prior to the convention, Political scientist Stephen Salmore of Rutgers Univer- sity regards Sayreville as a barometer of Democratic standing among blue-collar ethnic voters in this key Northern state.

On Friday, the day after Carter’s acceptance speech winding up the Democratic convention, a reporter found that 69 out of 100 shoppers at the small Sayrewoods Shop- ping Center said they would voter for Carter, Another 20 said they would vote for President Ford, if he is the Republican nominee. There was one vote for the Socialist Labor party, and 10 others undecided, 4 hope ee is eng to vote for Carter,” said Joseph Svetics, a 67-year-old metal worker of Yugoslavian origin, “One thing I like about Carter is that he is not a law- yer,” said Peter Fierro, a salesman. ‘Tm for Carter — he worked for a livi = tre others didn’t,” said = pap a inset ple in ninths  redetal ian surrounded by chemical plants and factories, are Cath- olics, Of the 67 shoppers they were Catholics, 49 said who said: But as of Friday, at least, there is no evidence here that a Catholic running mate would have won Carter any more votes than he was get- ting already, “T was hoping Muskie would get it,” said Mrs, Annette Lenci, a 51-year-old sales clerk. But she intends to vote for Carter anyway, him “another John Rooney. ” Al Brancisi, a draftsman, plans to vote for Ford. “If Carter had picked Muskie, I oo have cared less,” he said, Carter supporter Mrs, Myra Mervin, a Methodist, said a knew very little about Mon- dale. But she is sure Carter’ made the right selection be- cause “he knows more about rane, in public office than me 0.” e survey did not resolve the question of whether Presi- dent Ford or challenger Ron- ald Reagan would stand a bet- ter chance of beating Carter in New Jersey. Mrs, Marie Feeney, a Cath- olic housewife, said the Democratic convention “stunk,” and she has no use in for Ford or Carter. Mrs, Fee- ney said she won't vote for anyone, except for Reagan if’ he is the Republican nominee. Mrs. Madeline H, Nesson, a Catholic whose son went into the Navy when he couldn't find a job, prefers Carter to Ford because “Ford hasn't done anything about unem- ployment.” But for reasons she could not articulate, she would vote for Reagan over Carter. But there seemed to be just as many, if not more, Ford backers who would defect to Carter if ieee gets the nomination, r who declined to give her name said, “that man (Rea- gan) scares the living day- lights out of me, If he got to be president, I would move to Canada.” Aaron Osher, a 35-year-old accountant, said he’ “likes” Carter better than Ford, but still intends to vote for Ford, “The economy has improved — unemployment has come down about 4 per cent — and that is a tremendous achieve- ment,” Osher said. In Sayreville, Ford has not overcome the political dam- age of having pardoned Rich- ard Nixon. Thus Carter found a responsive audience here when he said in his accept- ance that he couldn't see why “big shot crooks should go free while poor ones go to jail.” William Mohrbutter, a brawny truck driver with a George Wallace sticker on his rig, said he was for Carter be- cause “Ford let Nixon go.” He added, “If I did something, they'd put me in jail — why not that guy?” Carter's standing in Sayre- ville could change dramati- ay before November, espe- y the strong fe here that Carter is sincere, honest and a good family man, sit cet th, a housewife, While this was the wide- a“ impression about r among the 100 voters terviewed, there was also an undercurrent of feeling that perhaps there is more about the Carter than meets the eye. “There seems to be some- thing very different about this guy,” said Fierro approvingly, “But I haven't been able to analyze his true character,” Tt seemed possible that the Republicans could recoup somewhat in Sayreville by at- tacking Carter's inexperience in foreign policy.

        "ocr_text": "t’s not always easy keeping lines open By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service KANSAS CITY — Just in case trouble should erupt inside the convention hall, the President Ford Committee has spent months putting together an elaborate, sabotage- preof communications system to rush the latest march- ing orders to the legions of Ford floor lieutenants in 10 seconds or less. The system probably will work, but it has its potential weaknesses here and there. For instance, when Ford scouts arrived to reconnoiter the Republican National Convention hall the other day, someone discovered that all the communication cables from the Ford command post ran directly under Ronald Reagan‘s command post. Though the wires were encased in a metal pipe. the pipe was above ground and exposed to someone, or say. a hacksaw. “‘If someone wants to sab- otage us, it wouldn't be difficult,*\" acknowledges Stanton Anderson, Ford's convention operations director. The command posts of the Ford and Reagan cam- paigns are located in two nondescript trailers just out- side the convention hall. From these cramped enclo- sures, about a dozen top political operatives of the Ford and Reagan campaigns will spend the next three even- ings trying to direct the tactical warfare on the floor of the Kemper Arena. A few weeks ago. both sides were surprised to discover that the Kansas City municipal authorities parked the two trailers only about 20 feet apart — apparently so they could share a common sewage hookup. The Ford scouts, rather than paying to dig up a side- walk to bury the telephone cables. managed to work out an informal no-sabotage pact with the opposition. This happened in early August, when Anderson tele- phoned the Reagan convention director, Lyn Nofziger, to discuss how to regulate access to the two adjacent trail- ers. “‘While we were on the phone. we had 2 long talk on the issue of sabotage,”* says Anderson. “‘We both said we trusted each other, and we meant it since we had worked together in past campaigns.” Nofziger confirms they agreed not to sabotage each other’s telephones. “‘We both agreed that those kinds of things are sort of childish,** he says. But another potential problem for the Ford communi- cators arose last Thursday when White House press sec- retary Ron Nessen announced in Washington that Ford's purpose in arriving here early was “to take personal command of the command post.’ It turned out that Ford meant to exercise command not from the trailer but from the Royal Suite on the 18th floor of the Crown Center Hotel, where White House advance men had already pre- pared a complete presidential office. From his temporary office at the Crown Center, Ford is equipped to stay in instant communications with his military commanders all over the world. Yet if Ford should want to talk directly to his conven- tion floor manager, Sen. Robert Griffin of Michigan, that FE: . © while arranve. There is no direct line between the President's suite and Griffin’s work station on the convention floor two miles away. In fact, if the President should want to tele- phone Griffin or anyone else on the floor, he would have to have someone dial a number assigned to the appropri- ate state delegation — and then hope the line isn‘t busy. If Ford wants to phone someone at the convention im- mediately, he will ce to settle for a chat with the Ford agents at work in the trailer outside the hall. Ford can contact them either on the White House extention phone in the trailer, or by asking a White House rator to con- nect him to the trailer through the Rebublican National Committee's convention switchboard. The only part of the operation which Anderson calls ““sexy’’ is the setup inside the trailer. The heart of it is a white ““command module.”’ which is a telephone console controlling the i4 private lines from the Ford trailer to the 14 Ford phone terminals strategi- cally scattered on the convention floor. The Reagan campaign has spent about $75,000 on com- munications equipment. But at least outwardly the Re- agan forces seem to be relatively uninterestedin the mar- vels of technology. The Reagan trailer. with an Indian blanket on the wall, is more attractively furnished than the Ford command post. It has soundproof booths and —— . for nine re- gional coordinators. It also has a slightly elevated plat- form for campaign manager John Sears and his tele- phone console. Austin American-Statesman - August 16, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Political Veterans’ Eyes Moist As the Reagan Quest Ends Ronald Reagan ..» ‘stay in there’ By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Convention Statf KANSAS CITY — “Don’t get cyni- cal, don't get cynical,”’ said Ronald Reagan, bidding farewell to a nine- year quest for the presidency. Reagan, saving his best political performance for the end, was the titular leader of the Republicans who tried and failed to win places on the national ticket this year. Even a Secret Serivee man seemed to brush away a tear when Reagan spoke yesterday to his inner core of advance men, telephone op- erators and political aides. Dozens of political veterans wept. Reagan himself choked up but the tears did not flow. “You just stay in there,” Reagan said. ‘The individuals on the stage may change, but the cause is there. And the cause will prevail because it is right.” Reagan said not a word about Gerald Ford or Robert Dole or the Republican party. Instead he sounded worried about the fragility of America, urging his staff to realize that millions of Americans shared their vision for the country’s future. “They want it to be a shining city on the hill,” said Reagan. He professed to be upbeat about his own future, “Sure, there's a disappointment in what happened,” Reagan said. “But the cause, the cause goes on. Look, sure, it’s just one battle that goes on as long as we all live. “And Nancy and I, we aren't going to go back and sit in a rocking chair on the front porch and say, ‘Well, that’s all for us.’ ” Reagan has for the last few days been talking about a future that in- cludes resuming his radio broad- casts, his newspaper columns and his lecture circuit. “The individuals on the stage may change,” he told his staff yesterday “The cause is there,” Reagan came close to deadlocking the 1968 Republican convention be- fore it turned to Richard Nixon. His plans for 1976 were well along when Gerald Ford was thrust into the presidency by the twin accidents of Spiro Agnew and impeachment. Another of this week's big losers, Sen. Richard Schweiker of Pennsyl- vania, followed Reagan to the microphone. “The oe has missed the best leader it has had for many years,” said Schweiker, who must now go back to Washington and seek a new form of accommodation with the Re- publican establishment, California Delegates for Reagan Lea . .. debris of arena for their hotel quarters UPI Telephoto ve Palm Beach Post - August 20, 1976 \f"

Instead of cut ting off funds, the commission stall decided to pursue the auditors’ ques tions during forthcoming audits 0 al 15 presidential candidates who collected matching funds from the Treasury during the 1976 primaries. At Carter headquarters in Atlanta, campaign treasuret Rober Lip- shutz said he was unaware of any such internal recommendation. “Whatever omissions we may have made we are in the process of cor: recting,” Lipshute said. ean also - some comparable reports submited by other cand dates in the primaries, including pon filed on behal! of President ord, But this is only the second known instanceof a move by the fda auditor to withhold matching funds It involved about 11 per cent of Cat: er’s total matching payments, The other instance involved campaign reports filed for Alabama Gov, George Wallace. In Carter's case, the cutoff recom mendation was preceded by two months of correspondence, meetings and phone calls between bookkee- pers at the Carter campaign and working-level officials of the Elee- tions Commission. Finally, on Aug. 11, the head ofthe commission's Re- ports Analysis unit, Al Keema, wrote a short memo on the eve of a scheduled meeting of the commis {Sion ‘The Keema memo, a copy of which was obtained by Cox Newspa- pers, recommended tothe legal staf that Carter “not be certified” for a pending matching payment because of “numerous questions” which the Carter campaign had not answered. The memo stated: “Specifically, Reports Analysis has repeatedly requested certain in formation which was either omitted from the Carter committee's re- ports, or which was not fully dis Closed on the face of reports submit ted. “This information includes not on- ly minor omissions, such as eecupa ton and principal place of business, but also more important omissions of endorsers for loans, outstanding debts, negative cash balances which did not in reality exist, excessive contributions, ete, “Reports Analysis considers these disclosure problems tobe significant questions which need tobe answered in order to achieve full disclosure under the (Federal Elections Cam- paign) Act.” After noting that commission staf- fers had met “repeatedly” with Carter representatives, Keema con- cluded: “Reports Analysis believes that failure to file the requested amendments t0 correct erroneous information or to provide adequate disclosure is, in fac, failure to com- ply fully with the Act,” The legal staff to the commission rejected Keema’s legal conclusion, however, In a one-paragraph memo the legal staff concluded on A 12 that the Carter campaign “substantially” complied with cam- paign disclosure requirements for matching funds, The seven commission members met later that day and routinely ap- proved $386,915 in matching pay: ments to the Carter campaign, which was used to pay off outstand: ing primary campaign debts, (For the general election, the law prov ides a flat $21.8 million subsidy to both the Republican and Democratic candidates rather than allowing pri vate contributions and matching payments.) The Keema memo did not contain a bill of particulars, but from back: up documents, it is evident that the auditors were objecting primarily to delays by the Carter campaign in providing full written replies to a se: ries of inquiries by commission ex i some dated as early as last all Following ate the specific objec: a See ie e responses provided to a reporter thy by Ln ” Endorsers for loans, The commis: sion staff noticed in May that the Carter reports did not list any co- Signers for $275,000 in bank loans, An auditor telephoned for the informa: tion, But two months later the com» mission had not received alist ofthe cosigners, (Lipshute said there were none, One $10,000 loan was guaran: teed by Carter himself and the oth. ers were taken out using future ” matching payments as collateral, Lipshutz siad. Lipshutz said copies of the loan agreements have now been supplied to the commission. urs ape a Te ported campaign debts to Delta Air: lines and the Gerald Katshoon ad- vertising agency were not men- tioned in Carter's May 10 disclosure report, The staff received an oral ex- planation from Carter headquarters that the debts had been repaid, But the commission had not received the needed amendment to the Carter disclosure —statementy. (Lipshute Said this amendment was submitted in mid-August. Negative cash balance, Carter's May 10 report indicated that the campaign was more than $100,000 in the red, when in fact it had money in the bank. The Carter staff has orally explained that the campaign bal- ance sheet did not include a list of contributions raised in California and elsewhere because documenta: tion on the contributors Was en route to Atlanta, But no written amend: ment, which would be available for public inspection, was received by the commission.

        "ocr_text": "HITTING HARD AT CARTER President Ignores Tradition By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT sJournal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — President Ford has just made some history: He is evidently the first incumbent president in at least 50 years who opened his fall campaign with direct, frontal at- tacks on his opponent. Press Secretary Ron Nessen said this week's presidential-level slams at Jimmy Carter were not part of the electoral strategy conceived by Ford and his advisers at Vail, Colo., two weeks ago. “The President spoke out because he felt very strongly,” Nessen explained, “And since he is the 800-pound gorilla, nobody around here is going to tell him what he can’t say.” What provoked Ford to wield a cudgel against Carter so early in the campaign was a newspaper story suggesting ambiguity in the Democratic candidate's remarks on whether FBI Director Clarence Kelley should be dismissed for allowing a window valance to be installed in his apartment by. government carpenters, The con- troversy developed a week ago when Ford de- cided to retain Kelley, after insuring that the FBI director would repay the government $335 for the valance, Carter responded by saying, “Knowing what I know now, I would have fired him.” But when reporters followed by asking whether Carter in- tended to dismiss the FBI director if he became president, he replied, “I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.” At an impromptu press conference on the back lawn of the white house Wednesday, Ford took a return whack at Carter. “T am confused on-the one hand by his flipe j flop on this issue, and I am’ very disappointed at his lack of compassion on the other,” said Ford, The following morning, Ford chose to coun- ter a Carter foreign policy speech to the B’nai Brrith convention here by telling the same audi- ence that Carter's policies would “cripple our ability to supply or sustain our friends.” Turn to Page 18A, Column 1 Atlanta Journal-Constitution September 12, 1976 Ford Frontal Attack ls Tradition Breaker Continued from Page 1A If nothing else, Ford proved -that a President can grab the most news coverage and keep an opponent on the defensive without setting foot away shows, for instance, a reporter with a wrist watch found that coverage of the President's activities — political and otherwise — took up about 20 per cent more air time than Carter coverage in the four days after Labor Day. On NBC, Ford attracted about 10 per cent more air time in those four days. And Jimmy Carter spent many of his precious seconds of news coverage responding to Ford’s attacks. Activities at the White House over the last week left the impression that attacking Carter is but one of at least three strategic tracks on which the Ford campaign is now proceeding. Another, more traditional approach that emerged this week was the President’s series of gestures to voter blocs. Clearly the most important, in risks as well as possible gains, was inviting the execu- tive committee of the Na- tional Conference of Catholic Bishops to the White House on Friday to discuss the church hierarchy’s desire for a con- stitutional amendment ban- ning abortions, After more than an hour with Ford, Archbishop Joseph Bernardin of Cincinnati moved to the podium of the White House briefing room to say the bishops were “encour- aged” by Ford’s willingness to support a form of anti-abor- tion amendment which would allow each state to pass its own laws regulating abortion. Behind Ford’s invitation to the bishops was a conviction in the White House that the “President has a chance of scoring gains among Catholic Democrats in the big indus- trial states. But the risks inherent in the abortion issue were illustrated by an unpublished nationwide poll completed a few weeks ago by an independent poll- taker. It found that only about 30 per cent of voters consid- ered abortion an important issue — 13 per cent who strongly favored a constitu- tional amendment banning abortions, as well as 17 per cent who strongly opposed any restrictions on abortions. As the week progressed, Ford seemed to be devoting tion from North Vietnam on. missing American servicemen and signed a series of bills in the Rose Garden. Ford is the seventh incum- bent to run for. election in the last 50 years. A other check with archivists at presi- gestures ee blocs of ev iption — as feeamabent presidents have done in the past, and as Carter is now doing during his travels. Ford’s activities in Wash- ington this week included: —A meeting with about 20 Polish-American leaders, at which he reportedly  in- structed his aides to ask the Federal Communications Commission to look into TV programs which use “Polish jokes” as part of their broad- cast content. —An announcement that he has asked Jeno Paulucci, chairman of the Italian American Foundation, to make a report on the Italian earthquake relief program. —His at the B'nai Brith convention, at which he dropped a hint that he might support legislation to penalize American firms acquiescing in the Arab boycott against Israel. —A picture-taking session in the Oval Office, at which he gently persuaded the head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to pick “Enterprise” as the name for the upcoming space shuttle, That is urged on NASA in letters from hun- dreds of devotees of the TV serial “Star Trek.” Whatever else he accom- . plished this week, Ford has obviously made headway with the “Trekkies,” as “Star Trek” followers are known. Jim Burns, the 14-year-old editor of the monthly publica- tion “Trek Times,” was quoted as saying, “Ford, I'm sure, has realized that there are many, many ‘Star Trek’ fans in this election year.” The third element of Ford’s strategy that manifested itself during the week was to emphasize the obvious: That he is the President. Tn a week when Carter was shaking hands and. making “speeches, Ford sent his secre- tary of state on a peace mis- sion to Africa, granted asylum to a defecting Russian pilot, expressed the nation’s condo- lences on the death of Chair- man Mao, demanded informa- dential libraries as well as in newspaper indexes, turned up no other instance where the incumbent even mentioned his opponent’s name at this stage of the campaign. / One possible explanation is that no other incumbent in 50 years was as far behind in the polls on Labor Day in an elec- tion year. , Herbert Hoover spent the week after Labor Day 1932 closeted in the White House, In 1936, Franklin Roosevelt, four percentage points ahead in the Gallup Poll, opened his re-election campaign during the Labor Day week with visits to the Great Smoky Na- tional Park and’an orthopedic hospital, as well as a motor- cade through North Carolina. Harry Turman, eight points, behind in the Gallup Poll on Labor Day 1948, began his campaign with a Labor Day whistle-stop tour through Michigan, during which he in- veighed against the “do-noth- ing Republican Congress.” Truman then returned to Washington to meet with the National Security Council over the Berlin blockade. President Eisenhower, with an 11-point Gallup Poll lead on Labor Day 1956, said he would leave it to others to point out the distortions of the Democrats. He spent several aa that week playing golf. Presidents Johnson and Nixon, who had leads of 30 and 28 points respectively in the comparable Gallup. sur- veys, cam) somewhat more actively during the post- Labor Day week. But both left the job of debating the opposi- tion to their vice presidential running mates and other surrogates. Gerald Ford, down by 15 points in the Gallup Poll on Labor Day 1976, evidently felt he could not afford the lofty luxury of letting someone else tear into Jimmy Carter. \f"

        "ocr_text": "$2,500 radio amplifier was the culprit By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau PHILADELPHIA — For the want of an amplifier, a nationwide audience was lost, That was the preposterous but so far undisputed, explanation put forward by officials of ABC early’ today on how the sound went dead for 28 minutes during the first de- bate between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. , Technicians worked into the early morning hours dismantling every piece of equipment that might have gone wrong. When they finished, they had decided the ‘culprit was a $2,500 piece that was virtually within sight of the two debaters as they stood waiting for the sound to be restored. The malfunction occurred in a glassed-in booth inside the Walnut Street Theater, where ABC Radio was serving as the “pool” repre- sentative to provide sound to all radio and TV networks. The booth was about 100 feet from the deba- ters just beyond the TV cameras trained on their faces. : ABC sources said something (possibly a short circuit) knocked out a “distribution amplifier” in that booth, thus silencing Jimmy Carter just as the two candidates were about to present their sum- mations. “The exact cause could have been one of 4,000 things,” said an ABC soundman, struggling to avoid tears. What made the incident all the more embarrassing to ABC was that a “distribution amplifier” is a relatively simple gadget, about the size of a small suitcase, It takes the sound signal from the microphones on stage, ampli- fies it and feeds it into perhaps 4 dozen cables leading to the various radio and television network trail- ers across the street. When it failed at 10:51 p.m. last night, moderator Edwin Newman interruped a Carter response deal- ing with the CIA to inform the the- ater audience that no sound was going out over the air. When the coverage stopped, the debate stopped, also. It did not re- sume until 28 minutes later, when television broadcasting was again possible. After the debate finally closed, League of Women Voters represen- tatives were peppered with ques- tions from reporters on whether the suspension might give minor party candidates an additional legal basis for demanding to be included in any future debates.

        "ocr_text": "|Debate ‘Fallout ‘Little USA?’ Voters Still Like Jimmy By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Constitution Washinglon Bureau FOUNTAIN HILL, Pa.—One day after the great debate, Jimmy Carter was still running well ahead in this barometer community—but only on the strength of a tide of marginal voters who did not watch more than a ig minutes of the televised encoun- er. What makes this interesting is that Fountain Hill (Pop. 5,384) was sug- gested two years ago by pollster Louis Harris as a cross-section “swing” dis- trict that often serves as a bellwether of national opinion. The borough, tucked in the bluffs near the steel town of Bethlehem, has reflected the national voting trends in almost every national election since 1894, “I was busy unloading a trailer,” said Norman Schoenberger, a 50-year- old steelworker, explaining why he missed the first debate. “I was babysitting,” said a 24-year- old woman. “I was so disgusted that I turned it off—they didn’t make any sense,” said Ed Swartz, a maintenance man. “I was listening to the baseball game,” said a 52-year-old laborer. All four said they planned to vote for Carter if they vote at all. A Constitution Washington Bureau interviewer found Carter leading President Ford by 46-26 among 100 eligible voters questioned in a tiny Fountain Hill shopping center Friday. Many of Carter's supporters sounded uninterested or turned off by politics, while Ford’s yoters were more intense in their loyalty. Not one of the 100 people inter- viewed volunteered a comment about the recent controversy over Carter’s interview with Playboy magazine or about the reported golfing junkets Ford allegedly took at the expense of U.S. Steel while he was in Congress. The sample was too small and localized to satisfy a statistician. But it was big enough to suggest that Carter has reason to be worried about See DEBATE, Page 6-A From Page I-A the next television debate in San Francisco Oct. 6. Of those interviewed in Fountain Hill who watched most or all of the first debate, Ford held a lead of 21-16. “I am a Democrat, but I was very favorably impressed with the Presi- dent,” said Irving Hanner, a 73-year- old newspaper distributor. “The Presi- dent seemed self-assured but with Carter there seemed to be something lacking—I don’t know what it is.” Hanner was one of four voters who said they had decided to vote for Ford after viewing the first debate. Two were registered Democrats and the third was an independent. Carter, for his part, won two con- verts, but they were registered Demo- crats to start with. In Fountain Hill, at least, Carter seems also to have fulfilled the expec- tations of his advisers that the debates might solidify the reluctant support of some traditional Democrats. This was so, for instance, in the case of Mrs. Fern Belles, a 44-year-old nurse. She said she planned to vote for the for- mer Georgia governor even though “he looked to me like he had had plas- tic surgery so he couldn't open his mouth.” John Glassic, a 19-year-old factory. worker, said, “I have seen on televi- sion what he has done for Georgia. If he could do that for the United States, we would be all right.” The only strong consensus among the 100 Fountain Hill voters was that the first debate turned out to be a grievous disappointment. Music teacher Richard Schantz, a 47-year-old Republican, complained that he was no closer to making up his mind after watching the full 90- minute debate. “Tt was stiff, unstimulating, une- ventful, colorless,” Schantz said. “It is a very sad commentary to be faced with such ineptitude by the candi- dates.” Mrs. Bonnie Palenchan, a 37-year- old housewife, said, “It was boring, So I switched to another channel (on cable TV) where they were playing The Merv Griffin Show.” Although “he’s not doing the best job as president,” Mrs. Palenchan said, she planned to vote for Ford be- one “he didn’t have a lot to start with.” John Pavel, a 59-year-old steel- worker, said; “I watched about two- thirds of it, and it was a waste of my time. They didn’t show me anything, It's a poor choice.” Those expressing frustration, bore- dom or disgust outnumbered those who were impressed by the debaters by a margin of about 2-1. Only about a dozen voters voiced any strong conviction that either Ford or Carter would make a good presi- dent. One of these, businessman Albert Prosperi, said, “I’m for Carter. He's more for the poor people—he’s going to be able to clean up the country.” But Carter’s thematic appeals to lower- and middle-income voters drew a sharply hostile reaction from Beth- lehem Steel Supervisor Harold Eckert, 56, who said he earned approximately $30,000 a year. “I have a feeling Carter would cost me an awful lot of money,” he said. “We need another welfare program like a hole in the head,” Twenty-four Fountain Hill voters said Friday they were undecided or unwilling to state a preference. The remaining four planned to vote for former Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy, an independent candidate. Among these were Thomas Marzola, 34, who tuned out the debate Thursday after the first few minutes “because they all talk about nothing.” Atlanta Constitution - September 25, 1976 \f"

        "ocr_text": "NEA lobbying for adjournment to kill campaign finance rules By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Gureau WASHINGTON — Lobbyists for 1.8 million teachers were quietly applying pressure on Capitol Hill Thursday to bury hundreds of campaign finance rules for this fall’s election by adjourn- ing Congress one day before the rules can become official. Senate sources said at least six sena- tors, including some facing tight re- election races, received phone calls from the National Education Associa- tion warning that the regulations “would inhibit (NEA’s) ability to con- tribute to this fall’s campaign.” _ Stanley McFarland, chief lobbyist for the NEA, confirmed that he had asked House and Senate members to press for adjournment no later than Saturday so the campaign rules would automatically expire. “LIKE ANY OTHER organization that has a Washington representative, we are trying to represent the attitudes of our members on the Hill,”’ said McFar- land. He estimated the NEA’s five mem- ber lobbying team had contacted ““scores’’ of House and Senate members in the last two days, often pointing out that the regulations would cut down on NEA contributions in some close elec- tions. “*It’s an uphill fight,”’ McFarland said. The NEA is known on Capitol Hill as one of the more generous liberal pres- sure groups. It has endorsed 360 con- gressional candidates this year, thus making each one eligible for a contribution of $500 to $5,000 from the NEA*s political action committee. In August 63 House and Senate candidates 59 Democrats and four Republicans re- ceived NEA contrihutions. The NEA has raised an ample cam- Paign dowry by collecting small amounts usually a dime every month from the paychecks of its members.

Stanley McFarland, chief lobbyist for the NEA, confirmed that he had asked House and Senate members to press for adjournment no later than Saturday so the campaign rules would automatically expire. provisions of the Federal Election Cam- Ppaign Act. The NEA objected to only one para- graph of those regulations.

Teachers are free to ask the union for NEA lobbying “Continued from Page 1. In the first 26 days before Congress, not one mem- ber had raised any public objection to the regulation, which resulted from months of commiission hearings and at least eight revisions of the text.

Election Campaign Act, Congress has 30 legislative days in which to review the proposed regula- tions. If neither House vetoes them, the commission automatically puts them into effect. SATURDAY WILL be the 29th legis- lative day the regulations have been be- fore Congress. And it is also the day House and Senate leaders picked last January as their target date for final ad- journment before the election. Early this week, House speaker Carl Albert and Senate Majority Whip Rob- ert Byrd were informed by aides that the campaign finance regulations would die if Congress adjourned as originaliy scheduled. At a meeting in the Capitol Wednes- day, the two leaders agreed to a pro forma session of both Houses next Monday, thus adding the 30th legisla- tive day that would keep the campaign finance rules from an automatic death. (All that is required at a pro forma ses- sion is for a chaplain to read a prayer.) WITHIN HOURS NEA lobbyists began urging House and Senate mem- bers to press for adjournment no later than Saturday. The lobbyists made no effort to hide their real objective, to kill the election regulations.

The questioners will be Max Fran- kel, associate editor of The New York Times; Henry Trewhitt, diplomatic correspondent for the Baltimore Sun; and Richard Valeriani, diplomatic corre- spondent for NBC. The debate will take place in the Palace of Fine Arts, a structure made of plaster and burlap for a 1915 exposition which looks from the outside like a See DEBATE, Page 15-A From Page I-A poorly reconstructed Roman Temple. This time there will be two com- plete sound systems to insure that a faulty $1 gadget does not again silence the candidates, as happened for 28 minutes in the first debate in Philadel- phia. Jack Kelly of CBS, the pool producer for the second debate, promised there will be no “foulups” to- t. Awakening early Tuesday, Carter took a pre-dawn. walk through the streets of San Francisco accompanied only by his Secret Service guards. Later, he was briefed on foreign policy issues by Zbigniew Brzezinski, a Columbia University professor, and by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., an outspoken critic of Pentagon waste. j Carter told reporters in his hotel room that he “may very well” criticize Ford’s signing of a European security pact in Helsinki last year as a sellout to the Russians. In recent days, Carter has accused Ford repeatedly of insensitivity to basic rights, in foreign policy matters, and Saturday Carter pointedly told 10 repre- sentatives of the Lithuanian-American community in Pittsburgh that U.S. parti- ciapation in the Helsinki agreement , gave Russian Premier Leonid Brezhnev ‘a tremendous diplomatic victory.” “That’s what he (Brezhnev) wanted in foreign affairs, to show that he was able to induce the West to accept the Russian takeover of Eastern Europe fol- mee the Second World War,” Carter said. Meanwhile Tuesday, the President spent the day at the home of John Sutro, a prominent Bay Area lawyer and chair- man of the Ford campaign in northern California. His only appointment was to talk about California politics with S. I. Hayakawa, the GOP Senate candidate. In the opinion of Carter’s Atlanta- based issues staff, the touchiest question he will face is how to carry out his promise to reduce “present defense expenditures” by $5 to $7 billion annu- ally without endangering national se- curity or commitments to U.S. allies. Unemployment is already high in the aerospace industry, particularly here in California where polls show Ford and Carter running almost even. Carter’s issues advisers have de- vised answers that elaborate on “waste” in Pentagon management, instead of specifying superfious weapons systems. Presidential aides have put together a red looseleaf binder, known as “the Carter book,” which recites all the Democratic candidate’s known defense and foreign policy statements for the past two years. | The red notebook is understood to include a Los Angeles Times article from March 1975 in which Carter was described as telling a Beverly Hills news conference that the Ford defense budget could be cut by $15 billion without sacri- ficing national security. The notebook also notes subsequent Carter statements calling for a $5 to $7 billion cut. In one clipping, Carter was quoted as promising to exempt the Navy from any budget cuts. Ford clearly believes Carter is vul- nerable on the B1 bomber issue, for he has scheduled a campaign visit on Thursday to the plant in Southern Cali- fornia where the B1 in being developed. Researchers at the President Ford Committee have sent the White House a series of Carter quotations on the $21.6 billion Bi et on which Congress has delayed procurement until after the November election. Carter spent Tuesday in his room at the Sheraton Palace Hotel, meeting with aides and then practicing his answers with the help of a stop watch and tape recorder, ; Long-time Carter supporters de- picted him as completely confident. “He is on an upper,” said Gerald Rafshoon, his advertising consultant. After the first debate, Carter said publicly that he erred by showing so much deference to the President. . _For the past week, Carter has been poring over three black briefing note- books, totaling more than 1,000 pages, in preparation for the second debate.

Ford Hits the Road Carrying Big Stick By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau COLUMBIA, 8.0. ~ Gerald Ford'Satur- day began his 10-day cross-country dash dis- playing a new campaign style: speak softly and carry a big advertising budget. Dropping for the moment his slashing attacks on Jimmy Carter, Ford fashioned a new inspirational closing to his basic rally speech, asking his Southern audiences six times to “give me your mandate,” With each repetition of the phrase, the President sketched out a promise for the next Ford administration: a fair tax struc- ture, better health care so the elderly need not “go broke to get well,” a restored envi- ronment, improved recreation facilities, a sound economy, a nation in peace, “Not a single American wife or sweet: heart, mother or father, is wondering. whether their loved one will be a wartime casualty tomorrow, and I intend to keep it _ that way,” said the President as he began his first day of post-debate eampaigning in * Richmond, Va, He made roughly the same speech an hour and 20 minutes later at the North Ca- rolina State Fair in Raleigh-Durham, There he added one Dawe of news to the speech: that he had ordered the Agriculture Depart- ment to allow rural residents to borrow money toward home purchases under the Farmers’ Home Administration loan pro- gram, Tn two more hours, the President had been transported by armored limousine and | Air Force One to a football stadium at the University of South Carolina, where he strode onto the field during halftime cere- monies. He viewed the second half in company of the university president, watch- ing the beleaguered South Carolina team losing to Notre Dame, 13-6. Following still another speech in the ‘evening on the grounds of the South Ca- rolina governor's mansion, Ford planned a five-hour flight to Burbank, Calif., to begin a southern California swing Sunday. On Monday, he flies to Oregon, then to Pitts- burgh, This was Ford's last planned appear: ance in what his former campaign manager, Rogers Morton, once referred to as the “Cotton South,” His speeches here, drafted before the Friday night debate, bore little resemblance to the slashing style he used last weekend in Iowa and'Tllinois, Gone was his description of Carter as one who wanders and wavers and waffles and wiggles, 5 “He got that out of his system,” said one senior campaign aide, explaining Ford had been irritated at Carter's implication that Ford had not told the whole truth about his campalgn finances. . Turn to Page 19A, Column 7 resident Hits Road arrying a Big Stick Continued from Page 1A The Ford campaign intends to hit’ Carter instead with another $1.5 million in man- on-the-street television com- mercials, showing interviews with average citizens ques- tioning Carter’s performance as governor of Georgia and his “wishy-washy stands.” This was disclosed Saturday at a news briefing by Stuart Spencer, Ford’s deputy cam- paign manager, as the presi- dential entourage was about to leave Richmond. Spencer said the Ford cam- paign still has $4 million in the bank for all forms of cam- paign advertising, enough to provide “saturation television in all markets, as well as on the networks.” Spencer said reports from his advertising time buyers indicate the Ford campaign will outspend the Carter cam- paign in TV commercials by a ratio of 3-2 from now on. “They decided to spend their money early, and we chose to husband our resources,” said one Ford aide. The Ford briefers also dis- closed plans to spend about $300,000 of their ad budget on a series of five half-hour statewide television broad- casts next week in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York. The late-afternoon broad- casts are something of an in- novation in campaign com- mercials. To some viewers, they may well look like regu- lar news broadcasts, for they are timed to coincide with Ford’s appearances in each of these key electoral states. Each half-hour broadcast will include up-to-the-moment video tape of Ford and his family campaigning in that state, accompanied by conver- sations between Ford and sports announcer Joe Gara- giola , who is said by the White House to be serving for a nominal fee to comply with broadcast union requirements.

But then again, Tues- a was not an ordinary day for Gerald ord, Almost exactly 44 years ago, Her- bert Hoover and his family gathered around the radio at his home in Palo Alto, Calif, and heard that he had been defeated for reelection, When the news of awesome Roose- ‘velt landslide crackled in, Hoover linked arms with his wife and said, “Goodnight, my friends, That's it.” On Tuesday night, the first hours of returns made it obvious to Ford, as he waited at the White House with his wife and friends before television sets, that he had not been buried by a Hoover: sized landslide, But the news was not quite as rosy as Ford had reason to hope two days ago when the Gallup poll showed him leading Jimmy Carter by one percent: age point, irst, the tossup state of South Ca- Aolina fell to Carter about 8 p.m,, then ~ Election At a Glance Here at a glance are the latest elec- tion returns in the race “for president with 61 per cent of the nation’s pre: cinets reporting, Ford 24,147,238 votes — 48% Has won 11 states with 78 electorial votes, , Leads in 15 states with 175 electorial votes.

        "ocr_text": "HOARSE, EXHAUSTED Ford Bends But Refuses to Break By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Constitution Washinglon Bureau WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Gerald Ford, the Jeader of the free world, was reduced by the electorate Wednesday to an exhausted figure in badly wrinkled trousers who was toying with the idea of becoming a political science teacher. Even someone as stable as Jerry Ford could not prepare ychologically for the pain of losing so much by so little, In tie only public appearance he bit his lip, took deep breaths and fidgeted with his thumb and index finger. Despite the ministration of the White House physician, his voice alter- ‘nated between a croak and a whisper. But Ford did not buckle. Instead of pursuing a long-shot New York recount as some of his backers had begged, Ford, who had never lost an election before, woke up Wednesday after five hours’ sleep and decided to concede to Jimmy Carter, — The President was ailing, but he carried his concession off graciously. For that, he—and by extension the country— could thank his wife, Betty. Between 2 a.m. and 3 am, Wednesday, when Mississippi was about to give Carter his aT eat of the two dozen uiests in the family quarters of the White House were press- fhe Ford to fight the election in the courts, One witness reports that Betty Ford, the former fashion model, was the “political realist” of the group, who realized first that the results could not be turned around. : “He (Carter) does not know what he is getting into, Mrs. Ford reportedly told her husband before they retired for ‘the night at 3:15 a.m. Mer the sun came up, eight senior staffers convened in the office of White House Chief of Staff Richard Cheney and rechecked the election results. - They reexamined whether the New York challenge ‘seemed promising, but found Carter was leading by more than 200,000 votes, They also recalculated the totals in every state in which Carter had won, to see if absentee ballots or arithmetical errors might bring them one more state.

A concession statement was mandatory, but how to do it? “The President's voice was really gone at that point,” said Press Secretary Ron Nessen later. Ford left the Oval Office at 10:24 a.m. and walked over to see Rear Admiral William Lukash, the White House physi- cian. Earlier in the week, Lukash had prescribed bowls of eye lcd lad ne pn appearances, — Now Lukash has a more modern treatment: a steam inhalator, a decongestant medicine, and a device for spraying droplets into Ford's throat, known as an ultrasonic nebulizer. With that boost, he was able to initiate and carry off his aaa telephone conversation with Jimmy Carter at 1:04 a.m. Ford was now to concede publicly, but he didn’t have the voice to do it, As reporters waited outside, Ford was joined in the Oval Office by his wife and children. Then the family piled into the press room. “Tt is perfectly obvious that my voice isn’t up to par,” said Ford, as the live television cameras trained on the de- feated President, Then he turned away, kissed his wife on the mouth, and turned the podium over to her. “The President,” she said a little tensely, “asked me to tell you that he President-elect Carter a short time ago and congratulated him on his victory.” Her eyes shone, but she smiled a long-practiced smile as she slowly read her husband’s telegram to Carter: “Dear Jimmy: “It is apparent now that you have won our long and in- tense struggle for the presidency. I congratulate you on your victory. “As one who has been honored to serve the people of this great land—both in the Congress and as President—I believe that we must now put the divisions of the campaign behind us and unite the country once again in the common pursuit of peace and prosperity, “Although there will continue to be disagreements over our goals, I want to assure you that you will have my complete and wholehearted sup- port as you take the oath of office this January. “T also pledge to you that I and all members of my administration will do all that we can to insure that you begin your term as smoothly and effectively as possible. “May God bless you and your family as you undertake your new responsibilities.” \f"

        "ocr_text": "~ House Shopping in Wa By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitutlon Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — It is a very ordinary Victorian townhouse in Georgetown, with about 18 feet of frontage, It has a redwood deck in the rear, but no yard or garage. Last December, a new owner bought it for $95,000, installed new kitchen appliances and plastered over the damage left by a succession of hipple tenants, Now the house is on the market again, for $186,000, That is a sample of the economic realities which await Jimmy Carter's ebeiiarairli ling as it pres pares to move from South Georgia to one the most superheated real estate markets in America, Real estate agent Mary White sounds almost apolo- getic when she quotes the $186,000 price, but is not worried about making a sale, ‘It's the only four-bedroom, three-bathroom house on the market in Georgetown for Jess than $290,000,\" she opin, A competing agent, Richard Bray, told of a young wife who saw and liked a $160,000 house in a slightly less prestigious Washington neighborhood, Her husband was out of town, however, and by the time she reached him, the house was sold, \"My advice,” said Bray, “is that both the husband and wife have got to look at houses at the same time, so both can come to grips with how little they can get for their money here,” In Cleveland Park, which has a certain unostentatious charm that became the rage in the Kennedy era, Bray said prices now range from 0.00 to $350,000, t he warns that a $70,000 Cleveland Park house “would be shocking to anyone who thinks $70,000 should buy sqmething,” Even for $100,000, a we in Cleveland Park can ex ct to get * three small bedrooms, one bathroom, a itchen and a living room, “If the house has been rented, it will be in horrendous condition,” Bray added, Some of the Carter appointees should prepare for cul- ture shock not only in the more Shiner n-town pre- cincts like Georgetown, Capitol Hill, Cleveland Park and Foggy Bottom, In the Establishment suburbs like Bethesda and Chevy Chase, Md,, as well as Alexandria and ae Va., there is nothing unusual about a $200,000 ouse, These are predominantly white neighborhoods, There are also fashionable black neighborhoods off upper 16th Street in the District, where the elms are just as stately and the prices are also in the $200,000-plus range, Even in a standard middle-class suburban develop. ment, houses are outlandishly expensive compared to those in similar suburbs nearly everywhere else, Ryan Homes, a national Renan homebuilder listed on the American Stock Exchange, has a standard split-level three bedroom model it calls the Crofton, Outside Dayton, Ohio, it sells for $30,000, Outside Atlanta, it sells for $38,500, Outside Washington, the price of the Crofton ranges from $46,250 to $54,250. Ryan's price s cheapest in close-in but unchie Prince George's County, Md,, as well as out in the rolling horse country of Frederick County, Md, an hour's drive from the White House, At the top end of the price scale is Montgomery County, Md,, which has the reputation of offering the best shington May Shoc ae me i\" oe \"| AR SAL ublic schools, At the midpoint of the price range is Fair- ax County, Va, James Miller, Ryan's regional sales manager, says the high cost of land and labor is what bloats the price pf housing in the Washington suburbs, , While noting that Ryan will have to raise its prices in this market so next month, Miller sald anyone with a steady job and a 10-to-20 per cent down payment should be able to buy a house that costs about two-and-a-half times his or her annual income, =” “T think you are going to scare people more than you need to,” Mile cautioned a reporter, Real estate appraiser Alfred W, Jarachow, who pub: lishes a newsletter about transactions in Montgomery County, figures the median price of a single-family home k Carterites on the resale market has hovered at about $59,000 for the Jast four months, That represents the first pause in a straight-line in- crease in county home prices that Jarachow has been in wen te pee pl Magner Cy Wi of a typical Montgomery Count: home went up 20 per cent on his charts, ' One v of suburban cheer for the Carterites; Jara- chow says brokers in Montgomery ot have an abun- dance of listings these days, Although prices have stayed firm, Jarachow said, “it isn’t necessary to buy the first thing you see,” For those with no rich uncles and no stomach for suburbia, the solution may be to move into a former slum neighborhood in the District of Columbia that is now undergoing a revival, rou he cy ra estate speculators have been buying up houses in what they regard as fringe neighbor hoods, the normal pattern has been to buy a run-down house for about $18,000, then evict the tenants, remodel the interior and sell it for upwards of $50,000, Once word spreads that a neighborhood is “coming back,” there is often an abundance of young professional couples ready to invest and live in what has traditionally been written off as a crime-prone slum, Among such Washington neighborhoods-in-transition are ine So and Mount Pleasant. And on Capitol Hill, the redeveloped area has crept outward from the few blocks around the Capitol to a large expanse of former slums extending almost to R.F, Kennedy Stadium, Some, but not all, of the Carterites will solve their housing problems through renting, There are apartments for rent, especially in the sub- urbs, But in what are generally considered the safe neigh- borhoods of Northwest Washington, there are many more lookers than finders, Because of the vestiges of rent control in the District, some landlords have converted to condominiums, In other older buildings, the apartment rents are relatively cheaper, But often the apartments are passed on lovingly from friend to friend, without ever being advertised, North Carolina tobacco heir Smith Bagley is one jump ahead of the rest of the Carter coterie, Last spring, Bag- ley bought one of the more elegant Georgetown houses from a retired congressman, who had purchased it in 1953 for $150,000, ' Times had changed: Bagley had to pay $500,000, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 14, 1976 \f"

Last summer, when Atlanta lawyer Jack Watson Jr. was planning the transition, the idea was to use a computer to make sure every job was filled by some- one with the right mixture of abilities, | By election day, Watson's - aides had figured out how to describe each applicant's. past experience in about 1,000 dif- ferent numerical job. codes. They had begun g out exactly what skills each of the key government jobs, would require. 1 8 After the election, Carter dec j 4 ke ided to put his campaign ARE a f Ordan a supreme test of igey, But te, 0 an ington port, Jordan was i the idea of using a computer. The original _ recruiting staff, which Watson titled the Talent Inventory Program (TIP) before Jordan took con- trol of it, is still the main re- pository of all job applica- tions. When a resume comes in the mail, it is read by one of two TIP aides whose names are, mercifully, being kept confidential. “They would be deluged if I told you,” explained one transition aide. These anonymous sorters, both in their mid-30s, have the duty of dividing resumes into two categorites: “prior- ity” and “non-priority.” The “priority” resumes are sent on to one of six “TIP clusters,” which are the six offices in the transition head- quarters responsible for assembling talent for the various groups of government departments. Resumes which have the best chance of being consid- ered “priority” are those which arrive with endorse-. ments from Carter campaign aides. Matt Coffey, who di- rects the TIP program, dis- tributed stacks of referral forms to each transition staff member Nov. 22, inviting comments “affirmative or ‘otherwise’ on each potential applicant. Paralleling the work of the TIP program is a recruiting network made up of Carter's top campaign political staff, which now calls itself the Personnel Advisory Group. This network is headed by Jordan and staffed by veter- ans of the primary wars like Landon Butler, Ben Brown, Phil Wise and Rick Hutche- son. Brown’s responsibility is to assemble resumes of at least several hundred blacks quali- fied to hold high office under Carter, Others on the political staff were assigned to search out possible recruits for par- ticular cabinet departments who were not widely known in Washington. A third, and perhaps more promising, avenue toward em- ployment is the office of Frank Moore, Carter's con- gressional liaison aide. If a key senator asks him to, Moore will submit an appli- cant’s name directly to Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 5, 1976 \f"

According to Press Secretary Jody Powell, the president-elect has not yet de- cided who that trustee will be, but “he may know A his own mind.” rter’s brother Billy told reporters Tuesday that he has the “first option” to buy or lease the business from the trustee, and said he expects he will continue to Oper: ale the business as he has for the past six years. Duncan, a 50-year-old investment banker from Houston, owns 179,000 shares of The Coca-Cola Co, the Atlanta soft-drink manufacturer. Although Coca-Cola is not commonly thought of as a detense contrac: tor, it was listed by the Pentagon last sum- mer as one of 5,000 companies whose mili- lary sales were large enough to trigger present Pentagon contlict-of-interest rules, The company and its affiliates sold the Defense Supply Agency and other military purchasers about $7.4 million worth of Coke syrup, soft drinks, frozen orange juice and other products in the last fiscal year. In Washington, Carter aide Robert Lip- Shutz said no decision had been reached in the Duncan case. He noted that Carter was aware of the problem. ° In response to reporters’ questions ata breakfast Wednesday, Lipshutz said: \"I don't eee the solution to Mr. Duncan's prob- em.\" He sald he had studied the case of David Packard, a West Coast multimillion- aire who put the stock of the defense-ori- ented firm he had helped found, Hewlett Packard, in trust while serving as deputy defense secretary in the Nixon adminisira- tion, but Lipshutz was not certain whether the Packard precedent would suffice under the Carter ethics rules. e 164, Column 1 - Lipshutz is slated to become Carter's While House coun- se Sources in the Pentagon legal office said Duncan prob- - ably could satisfy existing departmental conflict rules by promising to disqualify himself from making any decision in- volving purchase of Coca-Cola products. Carter's new conflict-of-interest guidelines seem to present Duncan with a tougher choice: either sell the stock and pay a huge capita! gains tax or ask Carter to approve a special exemption because of his unique financial circum- stances. As the guidelines were explained at a briefing here Tues- day, they require top-level appointees like Duncan to divest thernselves of all holdings in major companies that are large enough to be affected by government policies. One Carter official who worked on the guidelines said Coca-Cola is clearly a big enough company lo require some form of divestiture. For most Carter appointees, divestiture can be a rela- tively painless process of creating 4 “blind trust,” in which an independent trustee is given discretion to sell or hold the stocks without notifying the owner, . But the Carter guidelines made a point that “blind trusts’ would be acceptable as a means of divestiture only when their contents are limited to cash and “well diversi- fied\" assets, Alt a press briefing, Atlanta lawyer John Moore ex- plained that a trust containing a very large block of a single stock could not be truly “blind” because the owner would know that his trustee could not readily sell all of the hold- ings. For Duncan, the apparent rub is that his shares of Coca- Cola — werth $14 million on the stock exchange — make up ‘such a large asset that his over-all portfolio scarcely can be described as “well diversified.” It was understood that Carter transition officials as well as Defense Department lawyers have begun examining Dun- can’s situation, but no decisions have been reached, Ulti- mately, any arrangement short of an outright sale of the - stock will have to be approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will hold hearings on Duncan's confirma- tron. Through a spokesman, Duncan declined Tuesday night to say whether he intends to'sell his Coca-Cola holdings. oe, Instead, Duncan approved a written statement promising in general terms to comply with all conflict-of-interest guide- lines “al the appropriate time and in the appropriate way,” His new military aide, Col. Harold Coyle, explained that Duncan had made no decision about selling his stock because the Carter guidelines had just been published “and it ts yet lo be determined exactly what the requirements are.” Duncan acquired his Coca-Cola shares in 1904 as part of a multimillion-dollar deal in which Coca-Cola merged with Duncan Feods Co, a coffee importing firm started by Dun- can’s family Since the merger, Duncan has served as a director of Coca-Cola, and corporate proxy statements indicate he owns more shares than any other Coca-Cola director except H.W. Woodruff, chairman of the company’s finance committee. Duncan served as president of Coca-Cola Co. in Atlanta from 1971 until 1974, but since then he has moved to Houston and become board chairman of Rotan Mostle Financial Corp., an investment banking firm. Since Duncan acquired his Coca-Cola shares, their value has more than doubled. By one unofficial calculation, Duncan would have to pay at least $2.8 million in capital gains taxes to the federal gov- ernment if he decided to sell all his shares this year.

Let's say it is April 9, three months from now, and Congress has just passed the $30 billion package of tax cuts and spendi programs which Jimmy Carter ea here back in January, when he was president-elect. So how does it affect you? And what does it do for your unemployed cousin, A News Analysis Jerry Jobless? And what difference does it make for the Curio Palace, Inc, your myth- ical employer?

It will be some- where between $100 and $200, No one yet no knows the exact amount, but it will probably be closer to $100, and it will almost certainly be a flat rebate for all income groups, with the amounts varying only by the size of your family. If your mother is on Social Security, she will get the rebate, too—unless she gets one already by paying income taxes. But if your working-aged brother is too poor to file an income tax return, he may not get a re- bate under current Carter plans, Jiramy Carter hopes you and everyone else will go out and spend your rebate, in- stead of socking it away in a savings bank. That’s what he meant by “stimulation” of the economy—everyone would suddenly spend more money, and that would increase the national demand for all sorts of goods, Turn to Page 12A, Column 6 arter Economy Plan: What's in It for You? ‘Continued from Page 1A : ; Jerry Jobless might just find a job this Summer, producing some of those goods, Gime a. _ he peek get laid off once the extra surge of demands f the ae — is oa a re ‘hat’s where the re’ $19 billion to $23 billion of Carter’s moan fits in.

Result; another $2 billion “stimula- tion” of the economy. % \"The reason you will get a refund then is that the Carter program calls for tax rates to be lowered, retroactive to Jan. 1, 1977, But the new tax withholding table—which will bring about your $2-a-week raise in take-home pay—won't go into effect until half-way through the year, : wi You may remember the prospect Carter held out in announcing the program: “An opportunity for drastic simplification of the entire income tax system, so that with very minor computations, 75 cent of American taxpayers can file with an optimum amount of simplicity.” — What that means will be that every couple will be entitled to a standard deduc- tion’of $2,800. For an individual, it will be $2,400. Right now, as you will find in complet- ing this year’s tax return, it isn’t easy to fig- ure out what standard deduction you can take. It varies according to your earnings, up to a maximum of $2,800 for a family and $2,400 for an individual. _ What Carter’s program does is give everyone, even those in the lowest tax brackets, a maximum standard deduction. For you, the $10,000-a-year wage earner, the tax saving works out to $100 ($2 a week in lower withholdings starting this summer, plus the $50 next spring). For a $5,000 wage earner, the savings would be ‘proportionately greater, although no exact figures are available. For a family of four with earnings above $17,500 a year, there would be no savings from this provision, because the maximum deductions already apply. And what happens if the private sector of the economy refuses to be stimulated into hiring Jerry Jobless?

(“We will Seturn them when they come “back to Plains,” said the driver.) ~ It also snowed a bit on rter, who left his house in te afternoon to walk across thé. highway to visit his mother, Miss Lillian. Along the way, Carter informed re- porters he had felt “kind of sad” on Monday about leaving Plains. He added that his aie spirits had since improved. For most of the day, the incoming President was in virtual seclusion inside his house, with wood smoke trail- ing out of the chimney, as he finished the fourth and per- haps final draft of his inaugu- ral address. Press Secretary Jody Powell said the speech would be “uniquely his address,” in that Carter had personally melded his own ideas and those of his cabinet nominees and speech writers into a 15- minute message that will “state as simply and directly as possible the basic princi- ples and goals of the adminis- tration.” Asked if there was a call for sacrifice in the latest draft, Powell replied without elaboration, “There is.” Carter is scheduled to fly from Albany to Washington Wednesday afternoon and spend the night at Blair House. The following morning he will begin his inaugural day by either attending or watching a telecast of a prayer service at the Lincoln Memorial featuring the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., pas- tor Bruce Edwards of the Plains Baptist Church, and evangelist Ruth Carter Staple- ton, Carter’s younger sister. One distinguishing mark of Carter’s inaugural schedule is that he will step out of his limousine soon after he is sworn in and walk the last two blocks down Pennsylva- nia Avenue toward the White House. Dr. Alan Calmes of the Na- tional Archives said that the last President who walked on his inaugural route was Thomas Jefferson, who went on foot from his boarding house to the Capitol to “to stress simplicity.” This time, although the Se- cret Service wasn’t delighted, Carter insisted on walking. “A limousine symboiically establishes a distance between him and the tators,”” ex- plained Powell. “This shows that the President has two legs, and he can walk like anyone else.” Carter will make his first walking appearance at 10:25 a.m. on Thursday when he strolls from Blair House across Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House to have coffee along with his wife and President and Mrs. Ford. The incoming and outgoing presidents are expected to share a limousine for the 15- minute ride to the Capitol for the formal swearing in cere- mony, which begins at 11:30 a.m. Atlanta Constitution - January 19, 1977 \f"

The new owners have set up a sales office just off the main street of Plains, and two salesmen are busy trying to sell land certificates’ to tourists, Other agents are in- Washington, hoping to sell 3,000 parcels during inauguration week. “They sure stuck me,” said the former owner, Willis Wright, when told by a reporter that the fields he had tilled much of his life were now being advertised on a billboard outside Plains and in vari- ous newspapers. Wright said he used to work the land in Webster County as a share- cropper for Carter’s late father, Earl Carter. About 22 years ago, Earl Carter finally sold him some of the fields and timber land, Wright said. “Mr. Jimmy said if I ever go ready to sell it, he wanted to buy it back,” recalled Wright. “Mr. Billy (Carter) said the same thing.” Nevertheless, Wright said, to some men from Atlanta. The price was $600 an acre. Before agreeing to the sale, Wright said he asked the advice of Alton Carter, the 88-year-old fa- ther of Jimmy Carter's first cousin. \"Mr. Alton told me it was my land and I could do anything I wanted to with it — and I needed a little. money,” said Wright.

Next summer, Gaskin said he and his associates plan to raise peanuts on the five acres and make them into paperweights. “It’s like mining diamonds,” said Gaskin. “They aren't worth as much when you get them out of the ground as they are when you put them on a lady’s finger.” Miami News - January 21, 1977 \f"

What Christensen has to say about “The reserves are perhaps three bil- lion cubic feet of gas, So the price dif- ference —75 cents vs. $1.75— amount to $3 million from the well. What should we do?

        "ocr_text": "There is no proof of plot to force removal of price ceilings Gas producers just being old-fashioned capitalists By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau HOUSTON, TEX. — Trying to make fresh supplies of natural gas flow at cheap prices into interstate pipelines is like trying to make the Mis- sissippi River flow uphill. Powerful price incentives are keeping nearly all new gas finds in on-shore Texas and Louisiana out of the reach of northern and eastern markets, a Cox Newspapers survey indicates. Even in the rich offshore drilling fields of the Gulf of Mexico, where all gas must be dedicated to interstate use, there are major reservoirs at known locations which could be brought to the market on an accelerated basis if the producers found it sufficiently profitable. - DESPITE YEARS OF congressional investiga- tions, there is no proof of any plot among produc- ers to keep gas out of the national market to force Congress to remove price ceilings. Instead, there is an abundance of evidence that gas producers have acted independently, in the best capitalist tradition, to serve the interests of their stockholders. There is precious little evidence, at least in this decade, of comparable vigilance by the In- terior Department and the Federal Power Commission in watching out for the pas consuming public. Two kinds of markets for natural gas exist side by side in America. In the biggest producing states, (“‘intrastate’’) markets, consisting of shorter pipe- lines which sell gas at uncontrolled prices to cus- tomers within their own state boundaries. THERE ALSO IS A national (interstate) mar- ket, based on giant, long-distance pipelines which are limited by the Federal Power Commission in what they can pay producers for their gas. Originally, interstate pipelines paid a few cents more for a thousand cubic feet of gas and were thus able to tie up huge on-shore gas fields under long-term contracts, some of which are still in effect. With the industrialization of the Gulf Coast states, intrastate pipelines now pay the drillers substantially higher prices than na- tional pipelines are allowed by the FPC to pay. It is in a company’s self-interest to do so: ® Early in 1975 the Chevron Oil Co. discov- ered what appeared to be a vast new gas field, erhaps 100 miles long, beneath southern Louisi- ana. By chance, there was an interstate pipeline pperated by Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corp. ithin a mile or so of the Chevron discovery ells. Because of Federal Power Commission inter- state gas price ceilings, Chevron chose to commit there are state-wide the new reserves at a higher price to a Louisiana- only pipeline which was considerably further away. To have done otherwise would have cut Chevron’'s potential revenues from the new False River field over the next 20 years by as much as $5 billion. © In 1973, Louisiana wildcatter Bo Ramsay was on a hunting trip when he noticed some new rigs on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande River, across from Laredo, Tex. Ramsay put together a group of investors and drilled a wildcat well on the American side which hit the biggest new gas fieid in Texas. Ramsay, followed by some major oil compa- nies, was able to sell the Laredo field gas to Texas-only pipeline companies at more than twice the price of interstate gas, a difference that may amount to $2 billion in revenues when all the gas is ultimately recovered. © In mid-1975, Amoco reviewed its drilling budget and decided to cut out a projected $1-mil- lion well in the Gulf of Mexico that was needed to tap a known reservoir containing 17 billion cubic feet of gas. The well was to be a replacement for an earlier well, which had been capped since early 1974 when Amoco production men on the drilling platform detected a mechanical problem they could not fix. The FPC staff estimated that the unproduc- tive Amoco reservoir contains enough gas to meet the requirements of 40,000 homes for the next five years. The replacement well is still not budgeted, Amoco officials say, adding that to drill it now would cause a three-month interrup- tion in the production of other wells on the Amoco platform. IF THE WELL IS drilled, it will bring Amoco at least $25 million in revenues. That is $16 mil- lion more than Amoco would have realized for the same gas, had the first production well not stopped working back in 1974. Unhappily. the nation’s untapped reserves cannot be turned on and off like a shower. One place to look for extra supplies would be the intrastate markets in Texas and Louisiana. This winter, most wells in those states are producing full blast. If they were to keep produc- ing the year around at this high rate, Texas and Louisiana could increase their combined annual production by perhaps 500 billion cubic feet. ANOTHER PLACE TO seek more gas for next winter is in known reserves beneath the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The staff of the Federal Power Commission, not Known as a hotbed of oil industry critics, esti- mated last month that at least 400 billion cubic feet of *“*non-producing dedicated reserves” in the Gulf of Mexico could be profitably produced by various oil companies on an accelerated schedule. Even if drained steadily over the next six years, that set of non-producing reservoirs would add only about one-half of one per cent to the supplies of interstate pipelines. The fields in the Gulf of Mexico singled out by the FPC staff as “unquestionably economic to produce” are under leases held by Conoco, Mobil, Tenneco, Texaco, Odeco Oil Co. and Union Oil. JUST LAST THURSDAY, Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus ordered a full federal! investigation to determine whether gas reserves in the Gulf have been willfully withheld trom American consumers. Companies do not always find it in their eco- nomic self-interest to develop new gas reservoirs quickly. Under the terms of the Department of Interior leases, the drillers are supposed to have five years to start producing oil or gas before having to abandon the property. The five-year drilling term can be extended if the lease owner seeks an exception. A recent U.S. Geological Survey computer printout obtained by the Cox Newspapers lists 46 tracts in the Gulf of Mexico containing sizeable gas reservoirs which were not producing even though five years had elapsed since the date of the original lease. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT officials acknow!- edge that the department never has cancelled a lease for failure to develop its prospects within the five-year initial contract term. However, Secretary Andrus now has promised to take a hard look at future renewal applications for off- shore leases which are not in production within five years after the original lease is signed. The big producers do not take kindly to sug- gestions that they ought to sacrifice a little profit in order to accelerate gas production. ONE OF THE HARSHEST critics of the gas industry has been Rep. John E. Moss (D-Calif.); who heads a House commerce subcommittee. The pane! has issued reports outlining five cases which, in the opinion of a subcommittee major- ity, suggest that some producers have withheld gas from the interstate market. Privately, some of the Moss investigators acknowledge that de- spite their aggressive use of subpoena power, they have yet to find any internal corporte docu- ment which nails down a clear-cut instance where the non-production of gas supplies was aimed at driving up the price. “We are still looking for the smoking gun,” said one Moss investigator.

        "ocr_text": "The Driller. . . By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau LAFAYETTE, La. — Four years ago, Charley Barton struck gas by drilling in the middle of a rice field a few miles south of town. His money problems for the next 10 years could have been over, or so it seems in retrospect. All he had to do was listen to the gas gently whooshing up through his wellhead and into the pipe- line, earning Barton’s tiny company more than $1,000 a day. But Charley Barton is a gambler. He is also a first-rate petroleum geologist, with a working knowledge of geophysics and engineering, who got his start in the drill- ing business by working for a wildcatting company owned by the late H.L. Hunt. So it was only natural that Barton promptly pored over his geological maps until he picked out a new site 3 miles down the road. Dry hole. : Then came another dry hole. Then some six-figure repairs to an oil well he had drilled some years earlier. Before long, Barton had sunk more than $500,000 into the pore and he was waking up in the middle of the night wor- rying about his debts. He saw no choice but to sell many of the oil properties he had accumulated. “You can sometimes make a pretty good living in this business,’’ says Bar- ton. ‘‘But you see an awful lot of your friends in bankruptcy court.”’ Despite his streak of bad luck, Barton still drives around the gas fields in a 4- year-old blue Lincoln Continental, which he calls ‘‘my field car.” “I look on this car as maybe the best investment I have made in the last five years,’ he explains. ‘‘Oftentimes I have to spend the night out in the field, and the seats in this car fold all the way back.”’ People like Charley Barton call them- selves oil and gas producers. As they see it, they are doing their patriotic best to solve the energy shortage by finding petro- leum and selling it to the highest bidder. They range from one-man operations to gigantic integrated oil companies like Exxon. Their critics call them greedy exploit- ers. But whether the rest of the nation likes it or not, America’s continued use of natural gas probably depends on the suc- cess of profit-minded drillers in discover- ing new and deeper reservoirs of gas. The way Barton figures it, he cannot afford to drill a wildcat well unless the potential payoff is $50 in revenue for every $1 in investment. Otherwise, he would go broke paying for all the dry holes. Once he or someone else has discov- ered a new reservoir, he can afford the risk of a ‘‘development well’’ along the periphery so long as the payoff ratio is 10-1, “T don't think there is anything in life that can make you feel lower than a dry hole,’ he says. ‘People try to console you, and you laugh about it. But it takes you a week or so to get over the emo- tional experience. “I never will forget the first well I ever hit after | became the head of my own company. It was back in 1967, and I was deeply in debt. I had made up my mind that if the well was dry, I was go- ing back to my employes and turn in my resignation.” Geologists like Barton test a well by gradually lowering a set of electrodes to the bottom of the hole, measuring the electrical resistance of each layer of the earth. The electrical current traces a pattern on a strip of paper, or “‘log,”’ which looks to an outsider like a heart specialist's electrocardiogram. When the electrodes pass through an oil or gas 3 zone, the ‘‘log’’ corftains unmistakable squiggles. “When you take the log from a well it’s a tremendous emotional experience,’ says Barton. ‘It’s almost like going to a execution block.”’ Barton, 50, still feels those emotions af ter almost 30 years in and around petro- leum drilling in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Illinois. Although he grew up on a farm in Louisiana, he quickly decided farming wasn't for him. He has a degree in geolo- gy from Louisiana State University, and he can sketch every fault line from memory in the fields he is exploring. He is still living — comfortably — off the earnings of the development well in the rice field four years ago. That well — a slender steel pipe that sticks about 6 feet out of the ground and is connected to a series of valves and gauges — yields about 2,500,000 cubic feet of natural gas every day. It's not a very big gas well, but it is enough to heat 5,000 typical American homes. Originally, Barton spent $365,000 to lease the land and pay a drilling contrac- tor to drill the 11,000-foot well at the spot he had selected through his geological and geophysical studies. A Louisiana intrastate pipeline pays Barton 90 cents per thousand cubic feet — which amounts to $2,250 a day — for the gas as it flows out of the ground un- der its own pressure. Out of the daily revenues, he pays about $360 in royalties to the landowner and about $175 in pro- duction taxes to Louisiana. By the time the reservoir is depleted in five years or so, Barton expects the well will have produced about 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas. At today’s prices, that works out to about $3.6 million. “On the surface, it looks like a real bo- nanza situation,’ he says. ‘‘The only trou- ble is that I haven’t hit another well in the last four years.” Palm Beach Post - February 20, 1977 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Work Renews On Canceled Nerve Bomb By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Pentagon weapons designers have quietly resumed develop- ment of a nerve gas bomb which was can- celed in 1969 due to “uncertainties over U.S. policy on chemical warfare,” Several key congressional weapons ex- ao were surprised to learn that Congress ad approved $1.5 million to revive the project last summer as part of the Navy re- search and development budget. “Did that one slip in?” asked Gordon Casey, a chemical weapons expert on the House Appropriations Committee staff, when questioned by a reporter on the bomb, Casey's counterpart on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Douglas Allen, assured a reporter the bomb was nowhere in the Navy's budget — but then checked and found otherwise. However, as Pentagon chemical war- fare overseers noted, there was at least one brief mention of the new bomb project in the seven-volume House Appropriations hearing record published last June. Turn toage 15A, Column Continued from Page 1A The bomb, code-named | “Big-Eye,” is designed to spray approximately 250 pounds of the nerve gas “VX” | from vents which open while the bomb is falling toward the sh sa : ; ne droplet of nerve gas can kill within an hour by paralyzing the nervous sys- tem. Nerve gases were first developed by the Nazis during » World War II, but have never . been used in combat. If Big-Eye goes into produc- tion, it would be capable of spreading a long-lasting poi- sonous aerosol] film covering an area of something less than one square mile, accord- ing to Pentagon estimates. It . takes at least two weeks for » the deadly VX to dissipate. Hints of the Big-Eye project were contained in notices of Navy contracts that appeared recently in a Commerce De- partment publication. Al- though the United States has long renounced the “first use” of chemical warfare weapons, the Pentagon maintains a stockpile of something like 50 million pounds of nerve gas and mustard gas to deter any surprise gas attack by the Soviet Union. About half of the US. chemical — are stored in bulk form. The rest already is loaded into bombs and artil- lery shells which are stored at seven U.S. Army depots in the United States, as well as in | classified . locations _— in Germany and at Johnson Is- land, about 700 miles from ‘Hawaii. U.S. policy is founded on. the assumption that the Soviet Union would tainly” use chemical warfare in the event of a tactical nu- clear war in Europe, Army Lt. Gen. Howard H. Cooksey - told Congress last month. Even in a conventional war, Cooksey testified, the use of chemical weapons “would probably be ordered almost routinely” by the Soviet com- _ manders if their troops ran into a well-entrenched de- fense. The Soviet Union, like the United States, has ratified the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which prohibits the use of poi- son gases. However, both na- tions have reserved the right to use chemical weapons in case others struck first with “almost cer-. The United States aiso use to maintain a stockpile of bio- logical warfare weapons con- taining disease-causing germs. But these were destroyed by order of President Nixon in 1969. Although — chemical weapons were not banned at that time, chemical warfare budgets were cut sharply in the early 1970s in response to the anti-Pentagon mood on Capitol Hill which accompa- nied the end of the Vietnam war, Big-Eye was among the casualties. Lately, the US. chemical warfare budget is making something of a comeback, mainly as a result of discov- | eries during the 1973 Middle East war that Soviet-supplied tanks and armored vehicles contained sophisticated filter- ing systems to operate on a gas-infested battlefield. So far, the Pentagon's emphasis has been on defensive equip- ment, such as improved masks, alarms, and protective suits, But the Pentagon has also gradually increased its re- search and development on a new generation of safer-to- handle nerve gas weapons, of Which Big Eye is the biggest. For the current year, the Pentagon is spending $186 million on chemical measures, broken down as follows: * Defensive $147 million, ® Deactivation of obsolete munitions, $30 million. * Research and develop- ment of offensive wea $8.6 million, fine One worry that has troubled some defense planners is that the locations of the U.S. nerve gas stockpiles has been pub- ed in open congressional hearings, inviting possible raids by terrorist grtupe, One result which surfaced recently is that the Army is paying a contractor more than $100,000 to build heavy concrete barriers in front of the doors of the 87 nerve gas storage igloos at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark. U.S. nerve gas and mustard gas storage sites ~ which are no doubt being accorded simi- lar protection ~ are: Tooele Army Depot, Utah; Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky, Pueblo Army Depot, Colo; Umatilla (Army Depot, Ore.; Yad Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Colo, equipment, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 6, 1977 \f"

Powerful economic inter: ests are arrayed on all sides of the issue. The morning after the FDA's proposal to ban saccha- Tin, executives of the Calorie Control Council — a trade as- Sociation of 60 companies who depend on artificial sweeten- ers — gathered at the head- quarters of the Coca-Cola Co, in Atlanta, Before the day was out, they had fashioned a $400,000 newspaper advertising cam: paign urging readers in the 31 largest American cities to call and write their Washington representatives in defense of saccharin, The advertising Was arranged by the Atlanta office of McCann Erickson, Inc., which handles the Coca: Cola account, A week later, one congress: man reported receiving 250 phone calls and 700 letters, On the other side, the Inter- national Sugar — Research Foundation, a Washington- based trade association fi: hanced by sugar refiners and Growers in 13 counries, has Spent an estimated $250,000 over the last 10 years finane- ing commercial laboratory experiments aimed at show- ing that substitutes for its product can cause cancer or birth defects, Six years ago, one such test Sponsored by the sugar foun- dation at WARF Institute, Inc., in Wisconsin provided the first scientific evidence that large doses of saccharin can cause cancer in rats, Similar results were reported later in an experiment spon sored and controlled by the FDA itself. Although the results were disputed, these two early tests impelled the Canadian gov- ernment to start its own long- term rat feeding experiments, As it turned out, the Canadian results were similar; A 5 per cent saccharin diet fed to pregnant rats led to bladder tumors in 12 out of 50 of their male offspring, The sugar foundation is not alone in sponsoring research, A chief purpose of the Calorie Control Council: is sponsoring its own set of scientific re- searchers, who have produced experiments which indicate that saccharin is not harmful to humans, Despite conflicting interests and contradictory research, FDA officials say their deci- sion to propose the saccharin ban required little — soul searching ~ and no system: atic consideration of alterna- tive steps, Acting FDA Commissioner Sherwin Gardner insisted that his hands were tied by the in- flexible language of the so- called Delaney Clause of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Delaney clause, passed in 1958 over FDA bet, provides that no ingredient can be tolerated in food if it is shown to cause cancer when fed to man or animals, Ronk, head of the FDA divi- Sion of food additives, was in Nebraska last June for his high school reunion when he stopped to see an Omaha can- cer researcher who had been consulted by the Canadian government on its saccharin tests, Ronk quickly informed the top officials of FDA that he had heatd the Canadian tests might be unfavorable to saccharin. But no one else in the U.S government was noti- fied, About six weeks ago, the FDA got a strong inkling that the Canadians were preparing to act quickly against saccha- rin onthe basis of the now- completed rat experiments. Acting commissioner Gardner said in an interview that he made a tentative decision at a meeting in early February to propose a saccharin ban, if the Canadian tests were clear: cut in their findings, The. final decision, an: nounced simultaneously by Canada and the FDA, came on March 9, after FDA scien- tists had traveled to Ottawa to view the Canadian test slides. Gardner says neither the White House nor his su- -periors in Health; Education and Welfare Department were told that a decision on saccha- rin was coming until a few hours before the announce- ment. Gardner says no one outside FDA participated in the decision, Gardner acknowledges that he could have put off action under the Delaney Clause by asking the National Academy of Sciences to review the Canadian experiment, “Since the results were clear and unequivocal, there was no need to explore other ave- nues,” Gardner said, To the letter-writing public, the most astonishing para- graph in the FDA announce ment was the disclosure that a constimer would have to drink at least 800 cans of diet soda to consume an amount equivalent to the tumor- producing dosage in rats, Actually, this sort of high- dosage animal testing is com- monly used by the food indus- try when it seeks FDA ap- proval for a new food additive, In the past, animal tests have proved to be a quick and quite reliable method of detecting sub stances that would cause can- cer in humans. According to the FDA, of 26 chemicals Which could cause cancer in the human diet, 23 also cause cancer in animal tests, The difficulty now facing Congress is some of its most distinguished scientific wit- nesses disagree on whether there is any such thing as a “safe” dose of a cancer-caus- ing compound. They will so testify. Also, saccharin may be an exceptional case, since people have used it with no apparent harm for 80 years. , ‘Indeed, FDA witnesses are likely to tell the Rogers sub- committee Monday about a research study at Oxford University comparing — the bladder cancer rates of dia- betics — who use saccharin regularly all their lives — and other persons whose diets have been relatively free of _Saccharin, The Oxford researchers found that diabetic saccharin. users actually had fewer blad- der tumors than other people, This curious result has been attributed to the fact that dia- betics are less likely to smoke, ‘ Congressmen have intro- duced a range of proposals for dealing with the saccharin controversy. Some would carve out a specific exemp- tion to permit saccharin to be sold, Others would weaken the Delaney Clause by allowing the FDA some discretion to Weigh the risks and benefits of a food additive, A few members resist any changes in the anticancer language. Of all the solutions, perhaps the most ingenious was that of Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D- Ind., who wants to affix the following label to anything containing saccharin: “Warn: ing The Canadians have determined that saccharin is dangerous to your rat's health.” By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Why, one might wonder, did the Food and Drug Adminis. tration propose a ban on saccharin while taking no action against cancer-causing cigarettes? ; ‘The FDA says the answer is simple: It has no jurisdiction over cigarettes, Since they are neither a food nor a drug, True, the surgeon general deter- mined in 1964 that there was a strong correlation between smoking and lung cancer, not to mention heart disease, bronchitis and emphysema, But back in 1908, when Congress passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, members specifically exempted tobacco from its coverage, That law, and its subsequent modifications, is the legal, basis for any action by the FDA. Cons gress has reacted to the surgeon gener: al’s warnings by passing requirements for health warnings on cigarette packs ages and in cigarette advertising FDA Can't Ban Cigarettes; They re Not Food or Drug But no serious effort to ban ciga- rettes has ever been made in The tobacco lobby has been strong enough to block or delay a much less se- vere measure to restrict ine cluding a move in 1965 to bring under the jurisdiction of the FDA, The strongest cigarette opponent, Sen, Frank Moss, D-Utah, went to court in:1974 to compel the Consumer Product Safety Commission to set maximum tolerable levels of tar and nicotine in cigarettes, —Tobacco-state senators quickly reacted to the Moss lawsuit by pushing an amendment through Con: gress which denied the Consumer Prod: uct Safety Commission any jurisdiction over cigarettes, “The thing was done very swiftly, before the health community found out about it,” complained Nat Polster, a lobbyist for the American Cancer Soci- ely.

But no one else in the U.S government was noti- fied, About six weeks ago, the FDA got a strong inkling that the Canadians were preparing to act quickly against saccha- rin onthe basis of the now- completed rat experiments. Acting commissioner Gardner said in an interview that he made a tentative decision at a meeting in early February to propose a saccharin ban, if the Canadian tests were clear: cut in their findings, The. final decision, an: nounced simultaneously by Canada and the FDA, came on March 9, after FDA scien- tists had traveled to Ottawa to view the Canadian test slides. Gardner says neither the White House nor his su- -periors in Health; Education and Welfare Department were told that a decision on saccha- rin was coming until a few hours before the announce- ment. Gardner says no one outside FDA participated in the decision, Gardner acknowledges that he could have put off action under the Delaney Clause by asking the National Academy of Sciences to review the Canadian experiment, “Since the results were clear and unequivocal, there was no need to explore other ave- nues,” Gardner said, To the letter-writing public, the most astonishing para- graph in the FDA announce ment was the disclosure that a constimer would have to drink at least 800 cans of diet soda to consume an amount equivalent to the tumor- producing dosage in rats, Actually, this sort of high- dosage animal testing is com- monly used by the food indus- try when it seeks FDA ap- proval for a new food additive, In the past, animal tests have proved to be a quick and quite reliable method of detecting sub stances that would cause can- cer in humans. According to the FDA, of 26 chemicals Which could cause cancer in the human diet, 23 also cause cancer in animal tests, The difficulty now facing Congress is some of its most distinguished scientific wit- nesses disagree on whether there is any such thing as a “safe” dose of a cancer-caus- ing compound. They will so testify. Also, saccharin may be an exceptional case, since people have used it with no apparent harm for 80 years. , ‘Indeed, FDA witnesses are likely to tell the Rogers sub- committee Monday about a research study at Oxford University comparing — the bladder cancer rates of dia- betics — who use saccharin regularly all their lives — and other persons whose diets have been relatively free of _Saccharin, The Oxford researchers found that diabetic saccharin. users actually had fewer blad- der tumors than other people, This curious result has been attributed to the fact that dia- betics are less likely to smoke, ‘ Congressmen have intro- duced a range of proposals for dealing with the saccharin controversy. Some would carve out a specific exemp- tion to permit saccharin to be sold, Others would weaken the Delaney Clause by allowing the FDA some discretion to Weigh the risks and benefits of a food additive, A few members resist any changes in the anticancer language. Of all the solutions, perhaps the most ingenious was that of Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D- Ind., who wants to affix the following label to anything containing saccharin: “Warn: ing The Canadians have determined that saccharin is dangerous to your rat's health.” By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Why, one might wonder, did the Food and Drug Adminis. tration propose a ban on saccharin while taking no action against cancer-causing cigarettes? ; ‘The FDA says the answer is simple: It has no jurisdiction over cigarettes, Since they are neither a food nor a drug, True, the surgeon general deter- mined in 1964 that there was a strong correlation between smoking and lung cancer, not to mention heart disease, bronchitis and emphysema, But back in 1908, when Congress passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, members specifically exempted tobacco from its coverage, That law, and its subsequent modifications, is the legal, basis for any action by the FDA.

        "ocr_text": "Gas Tax Last-Minute Item By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON—The night before his energy message President Jimmy Carter went through last-minute doubts about proposing a gasoline tax, * Federal workers, “guinea pigs,” will be first to feel energy pinch in United States. Europe already has undergone a Squeeze and is back on the road again—at oa. $2 per gallon of gas. Stories on Pages 7A, 5B. He only pressed ahead with it upon an aide’s assurance that there was a 60-40 chance the tax would never be triggered by big rises in gas consumption. Carter, in blue jeans and desert boots, gathered nine aides in the Cabinet Room While Carter wanted a standby tax in the program as a psychological challenge to induce conservation, he re- portedly made clear that he hoped it never would have to be triggered. Tuesday night for what was supposed to be an editorial critique of speechwriter Jim Fallows’ latest draft of his speech to Con- gress the next day. As it turned out, the discussion consid- ered the merits of the gasoline tax, even though that issue supposedly had been set- tled three days earlier at a five-hour meet- ing between Carter and key Cabinet mem- Carter’s final bout of uncertainty stemmed a controv between his top energy economic advisers, one of countless struggles within the admin- istration that/surrounded almost every para- graph of his energy proposal as it was tak~ ing final shape over the last 10 days. The last-minute problem over the gasoline tax, according to several sources, grew out of differing economic projections on how much a gasoline tax would harm the economy of the 1980s. Energy adviser James Schlesinger, re- portedly the chief proponent of the gasoline tax, had offered Carter computer studies indicating continuing economic growth and minimal inflation even if the nickel-a-year tax on gasoline takes effect beginning in 1979. But Charles Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, had ordered his own computer studies, using different assumptions. Turn to Page 14A, Column 2 Continued from Page 1A The results, which he reportedly men- tioned at the Tuesday night meeting, sounded decidely less optimistic than Schles- inger’s figures. Carter had gone all through these argu- ments three days earlier, on April 16. He and his Cabinet members considered three options—Schlesinger’s standby gasoline tax, no gasoline tax and an alternative form of gasoline tax devised by the Office of Man- agement and Budget, designed to hold con- stant the total number of miles traveled in the future. Among the more ingenious objections presented against the standby gasoline tax was that if it was ever triggered, it would cause a drop in the revenues of those states which depend on collecting their own gaso- line taxes. Even the threat of such a loss would generate opposition from governors and mayors. To.get around this, one official sug- gested opening the highway trust fund to give road repair funds to states where tax receipts have gone down. Carter liked the idea, and it was quickly added to the pro- ram. “This was the showdown meeting,” said one of the participants at the April 16 ses- sion. “In the end, the President said, he wanted the standby tax. Schlesinger won hands down.” (Those who reportedly expressed doubts about the standby gasoline tax ‘included Schultze and an official of OMB who was sitting in for director Bert Lance, then in Atlanta.) But while Carter wanted a standby tax in the program as a psychological challenge to induce conservation, he reportedly made clear Saturday that he hoped it would never have to be triggered. He returned to this point Tuesday night. How much of a chance, he asked a Schles: inger aide, was there that the standby tax would never go into effect? According replied that because of the way th ing mechanism was planned, there was a 60-40 chance that gasoline consumption would never rise to the point where a tax would have to be imposed. Carter eventually resolved his doubts, replying that he would go along with the standby tax, provided that chances were “at least 50-50 we'll never need it.” To the estimated 70 million television- watchers Wednesday, it must have appeared that Carter was presenting Congress a fin- ished package, with all of the decisions laid out in neat order for congressional con- sumption. In fact, all that was finished was a 28- page “fact sheet,” which was written be- tween 1 a.m. and dawn on Wednesday by Schlesinger’s staff. It left many questions unsettled, for the very good reasons that internal deadlines for decisions had been missed by 48 hours. One $75 billion open question was how the various potential car, oil and gasoline taxes would be rebated to consumers—and indeed whether all the money should be rebated. That question was on the agenda for the April 16 meeting, with some arguing for a rebate through the Social Security system and others suggesting a new system of revenue-sharing to help states cut their sales taxes. A third option was income tax credits, like the $50 rebate Carter had just dropped in the face of congressional criticism. But somehow, the, Saturday meeting ended without any resolution. Carter and Schlesinger talked this ques- figure out a “flow mechanism” to make sure the money could get to poor people. who pay no income tax. On Wednesday night, soon after Cart- er’s speech, a reporter asked three key offi- cials how an automobile buyer would: ever receive a rebate for buying a small car. _ _ © By claiming it as a credit the follow- ing year on the income tax, said one expert. * By filling out a form at the Post Of- - fice, said another. ® By looking at the car’s window sticker and making sure the dealer passed along the rebate, said a third. On Thursday, a day after the speech, a White House official was asked how the ro gasoline tax revenue would be “We don’t know yet—we are screwing the lid on that decision right now,” was the reply. One reason these very big questions were left open was that Carter and his staff had to spend so much time on thousands of intersecting little decisions, some of which — been largely unnoticed on the national vel. © Foreign cars: For weeks, Schlesinger and his aides have worried about opposition by the United Auto Workers to any package that included small-car rebates to purchas- ers of Volkswagens and Hondas. 7 At the same time, the State Department feared retaliatory tariffs abroad if the U.S. — a protectionist approach to car re- tes. _._ At the April 16 meeting, on the advi¢e of Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, Carter decided to knock foreign cars out of the “gas guzzler” tax-and-rebate provision, while putting in an urgent call to special trade negotiator Robert Strauss with an as- signment to seek a car import agreement with Japan and other nations. © Natural gas: Leaving aside the 20- year philosophical question about “deregula- tion,” someone had to decide what should be the price of newly discovered gas. Some weeks ago, Schlesinger tenta- tively settled on a proposal of $2.25 per thousand cubic feet. But when the energy package was announced, the price was set at $1.75—an enormous difference in. the eyes of a gas producer. According to one source, the reason was largely to avoid offending Sen. Henry Jack- son, D-Wash., and Rep. John Dingell, D- Mich., two long-time opponents of deregula- tion. “They raised so much Cain about the higher price that Schlesinger figured he couldn't get it ($2.25) politically,” the source said. ® Solar credits: About 10 days ago, the Washington representative of the solar industry learned from a newspaper story that the administration was planning tax credits for solar appliances purchased in 1978 and beyond. “Tf you leave it this way, 80 per cent of the solar dealers will go bankrupt this year while consumers wait for 1978,” the repre- sentative told a solar advocate in the White House. That is why the program, as announced by Carter, made the credit retroactive to April 20, 1977. * Energy standards: Schlesinger had a pet idea that starting at some point in the future, no home should be sold unless it met a certain minimum energy-conservation standard. However, the idea was dropped by Carter at his April 16 meeting with Cabinet members, following predictions that it would stir up states’ rights opposition in It is too soon to know how many subtle adjustments and additions were made to grease the skids for Congress’ reaction to the energy plan, but there were some. One proposal, added by Carter at the behest of House Democratic Majority Leader Jim Wright, D-Tex., and a group of visiting Texas oil executives, was the resto- ration of unlimited deductions for intangible drilling expenses for independent oil and gas drillers.

        "ocr_text": "Bank Got Aid After Loan to Senator By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Three months after agreeing to lend $420,000 to a U.S, senator toward his purchase of a Washington-man- sion, a West Coast bank obtained help from the senator's office with the federal agency that regulates national banks, it has been learned. The senator's top aide, who is also a paid director of the bank, has acknowledged in an interview that he passed along to a subordinate the bank’s request for assist ~\"$én. Adlai Stevenson, D-IIl., hairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, said after hearing a reporter’s summary of the transaction that he would nave no immediate comment. At first, Hatfield said em | phatically that he had neve assisted the bank before any ernment agency. , , when a letter bear- mg his name turned up in the his “knowledge. He said his namé had been signed by a staff member who had stand- ance, and that he knew of the senator's loan application, These unusual circumstances center around Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Oregon, and his $38,000-a-year administrative assistant, Gerald W. Frank, according to documents obtained by Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau. Also involved is the U.S. National Bank of Oregon in Portland, 39th largest in the nation in total assets, and its desire to re- tain a valuable business of selling mi- crofilming services, Hatfield said he would allow Frank to continue serv some penny ante thing that you are trying to create here would be laughable, abso lutely laughable,” Hatfield said. Hatfield said it was ridicu from his office on behalf of z major Oregon corporation as a form of “intervention” be fore the comptroller of the urrency. Referring to the bank, Hat field said: “This is not a one horse operation from Georgia — this is a first-class opera tion of a bank.” Insisting that Frank did no stand to benefit from _ the bank’s affairs, Hatfield said “‘He’s independently wealthy e has proven himself in the ommunity and elsewhere, he doesn’t have to be the big Both Hatfield and the bank insist that there was nothing out of the ordinary about the loan for his new house, However, one component of the loan — a $220,000 second mortgage — has some seemingly unusual features, according to interviews with a federal bank examiner and another banking expert. The mortgage was granted without an appraisal, on out-of-state property and by a bank that does not generally grant second mortgages even in Oregon. “I am totally satisfied there is no con- operator or make himself some man of influence.” Hatfield described his top ‘aide as a wealthy Oregon de- partment store heir who has ‘been his close friend for more ‘than 20 years. Hatfield said Frank used to date his wife, then was a member of their wedding party, and ever since has been “sort of a godfather to our children.” Last Feb. 16, according to files released by Hatfield, U.S. National Bank Vice President Vern Pearson wrote a letter to Frank, along with a six- page memo, outlining what he called a “regulatory problem” facing the bank. The letter began, “Dear Gerry.” The problem, wrote Pear- Son, was that it appeared that .the acting comptroller of the ‘currency might change the :1975 ruling that permits a “subsidiary of U.S. National Bank to sell computer mi- -crofilming services to hospi- tals, stores and other busi- nesses. A group of 11 computer service companies was press- ing the acting comptroller to rescind the ruling on grounds Signed, “Vern.” flict,” Hatfield said in the last of three interviews on the matter. He acknowledges that his office asked the acting comptroller of the currency on Feb. 28 to delay a ruling that would affect U.S. National Bank. But he said it was a routine effort to “assure due process for a constituent” rather than a bid to affect the outcome of the case. Turn to Page 16A, Column 1 ..that microfilming of invoices, ‘reports and other computer- .-ized records is not a banking .service. - Bank officials declined to Say how much they make -from the microfilming busi- “ness. Documents filed with >the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate the ~ bank’s investment in the busi- ness is $1.1 million. “We are particularly con- cerned,” wrote Pearson, “that the comptroller’s office may «look upon this as a small problem which they would like to get rid of as easily as possible, as it primarily af- fects only one bank. This in- creases our concern as we see the comptroller’s office being * in a state of flux until a new ‘comptroller is appointed.” Pearson concluded: “Gerry, I would appreciate your dis- cussing this with Mark to see if there is anything you can do to help us.” The letter was Frank, who is paid $3,600 a receiving the Pearson letter. He said he routinely passed it along with no instructions - to Tom Decker, an aide in the in the matter. “This jeconflict of interest since I handled it routinely,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 3, 1977 \fIn the next few days there was a meeting in Hatfield’s Washington office between Pearson of U.S. National Bank and two Hatfield assistants, Decker and Craig Honeyman. “‘Based on that (the bank’s letter and the meeting), we drafted a letter to the acting comptrolier of the currency,” Decker explained. Another Hatfield aide, Steve Crow, said he later signed Hatfield’s name to the letter without consulting ei- ther Hatfield or Frank. About two weeks after the “Dear Gerry” letter, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Robert Bloom received a two- page letter on Senate station- ary bearing Hatfield’s name. “‘Recently I learned that the comptroller’s office may be re-evaluating a ruling which relates to bank = services known as Computer Output Microfilm,” said the Hatfield _letter, which was dated Feb. 28. While not mentioning the mame of any bank, the Hat- field letter expressed “partic- ular concern” that the comp- troller’s office might be negotiating privately with the 11 computer service compa- nies, which had previously sued to restrict computer mi- crofilm services by banks. The letter concluded, ““Be- cause any change in the ruling could have major impact, I believe the case should be delayed until a permanent comptroller has been _ se- lected.”’ On March 15, Bloom’s spe- cial assistant, Donald Melbye, replied to Hatfield that offi- cials of the comptroller’s office had held a joint confer- ence with lawyers from “the interested national bank” and the 11 computer companies. According to Melbye, they agreed to a five-month timetable of submitting legal documents that would run until August. “By that time,” said Melbye, “‘‘a comptroller may be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.” When asked whether Hat- field’s letter had succeeding in delaying the ruling, spokes- woman Caryl Austrian of the comptrollier’s office replied, “JT can’t answer, I don’t know.” She said that Hat- field’s letter was one of several received from con- gressmen on both sides of the issue. As of late last week, the computer microfilm ruling was still pending and meee dent Carter’s nominee of 26 — John G. Heimann o New York — was awaiting Senate confirmation as the new comptroller of the cur rency. By coincidence, the head o: one of the 11 computer serv ice companies— Microtech, Inc.,of Eugene, Ore. — wrote to Hatfield in April to seek his comptroller’s office. The Microtech letter ex “overwhelming resources” drive the company out of business. company’s request got short shrift. It elicited a 45-word machine-written form lette to an assistant secretary in the comptroller’s office, unde Hatfield’s name, referring the Microtech letter for the agen cy’s comments. Hatfield did acknowledge after examining his corre spondence with U.S. National Bank and Microtech, that “i would certainly appear one was given more attention than the other.” But in neithe case, said Hatfield, did he “i owners of a Sa7e, 000 George- ee gory e bank actually agreed to make the loans by means of a commitment last December, bank officials said. Donald Magnuson, a loan officer at the bank, said the two loans provided the Hat- fields all the funds to buy their new house, as well as to pay off an earlier unsecured loan of about $45,- 000 from the bank. Hatfield, the son of a rail- road construction blacksmith, supplements his Senate salary by giving speeches for ronald nette works as a successful Washington real estate agent. The Hatfields intend to rent out the top two floors of their new four-story Georgetown house in order to help meet mortgage payments, accord- ing to Magnuson. “Sen. Hatfield has banked wi us for a long time,” Md@@§nuson said. “We have mat-\\a number “ loans =e ii means and integrity and character. There is nothing unusual about the terms.” . As Hatfield recalls it, he was given on-the-spot verbal assurance of the loan when he first sought it last summer. “There was no question as to the basis of the loan or to the equity of the whole arrange- ment,” Hatfield said. On the new house is a few doors from a former residence of Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis — the Hat- fields took out a $200,000, 25- year mortgage. The interest rate, said Magnuson is 9 1/4 per cent. To finance the rest of their new house, Magnuson said, the Hatfields obtained what he called a “bridge loan” of $220,000 at 9 3/4 per cent interest, payable in 21 months. This was secured, according to real estate records, by a second mortgage on four Pieces of property already owned by the Hatfields — two rental houses in Washington and a 43-acre piece of vacant farmland nearby, all of which they had acquired for invest- ment purposes, and their old house in a Washington suburb. Magnuson said the Hat- fields intend to pay off the “‘bridge loan’ by selling off the four pieces of property, thus consolidating their in- vestment. Melvin Ekstrom, a federal bank examiner in Portland, Ore., said in an interview that mational banks in Oregon, in- cluding U.S. National Bank, do not often make second mortgage loans. “To the best of my knowledge, it is not normally done, but it depends on individual circumstances,’ Ekstrom said. While declining to discuss any specific loan, Ekstrom said also that national banks in Oregon “normally serve their own area” rather than making loans on out-of-state property. Roger Hawkins, a real es- tate expert in the Washington office of the American Bank- ers Association, said it is nor- mal banking practice to require an appraisal in grant- ing any second mortgage. However, this was not done in the case of the Hatfields’ second mortgage, said Magnu- son of U.S. National. Magnu- son explained that instead of incurring ‘‘the considerable expense” of sending one of the bank’s appraisers to Washing- ton, the bank analyzed a financial statement from Hat- field and determined that he and his wife had a total of in_ the four properties. The second mortgage did mot cover two other Washing- ton investment properties — a row house and an art gal- lery — which the Hatfields purchased last year. On these two properties, which cost a total of $222,000, the Hat- fields have $150,000 in mort- gages from two Washington savings and loan associations. “It is true that generally we don’t make second mortgage loans,’” Magnuson said. “‘“But this isn’t really a second mortgage. It is really a com- mercial loan and should be judged on different standards. I just happen to have it in my department (real estate in- vestments) because it § in- volves a real estate transac- tion.”’ Magnuson said federal bank examiners had recently re- viewed the Hatfield loans during a routine bank exami- mation of the bank’s loan port- folio and had raised no objec- tions. & spokeswoman for the comptroller of the currency declined to discuss Magnu- son’s statement, citing the Secrecy of all bank audits. Hatfield said his aide, Frank, had done nothing to help him obtain the loan from the bank, where Frank has been a director for the last 20 years. Hatfield said Frank had indicated to him that he would rather quit the Senate staff than resign from the bank board, which helps him ties to his home community. As Hatfield noted, a provi- sion of the new Senate ethics code, effective in 1978, specif- ically allows Senate staffers to keep their memberships on any boards which they joined at least two years before their employment by the Senate. Melvin Christman, an offi- cer of Washington’s largest bank, said the bank does not grant mortgages, as a matter of policy, im excess of 75 per cent of the value of the property. Within those limits, the bank sometimes grants second mortgages — cur- rently at an interest rate of 10 per cent, Christman said. A spokesman for Washing- ton’s second-largest bank said, ““‘we do not have second mort- gage loan program now.” A vice president of the third- ranking bank: said his institu- tion offers second mortgages at an interest rate of about 11 Also ran on page 1 Washington Post Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 3, 1977 (continued) \f"

But like his predecessors, hie has found it impossible to abandon the “disgraceful” old code and start from scratch, Although Carter has not settled on the details of his proposal, he has authorized Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal to sketch out the leading options in a series of speeches, Judging from remarks by Blumenthal and other officials and from an early Treas ury Department draft, it appears that the Carter program will include most or all of these elements: | * An end to deductions for state and local sales taxes, gasoline taxes and miscel- laneous taxes, (But deductions. would res main for slate and local income taxes and property taxes.) * Placing a ceiling ~ - perhaps $10,000 — on each taxpayer's total annual deduc- tions for interest on mortgages, installment credit loans and other personal loans, ® Setting lower tax brackets, probably ranging from about 8 per cent for low-in. come taxpayers to a maximum of 50 per cent for the wealthiest. The current rates rise from 14 per cent to 50 per cent on earned income and to 70 per cent on unearned income, * Reducing the socalled “marriage penalty,” a quirk in the present law that taxes a working married couple more heavily than two unmarried wage earners who live together, One possibility is to allow a new tax credit against the wages of the lower-income spouse, Turn to Page 174, Columa 1 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 31, 1977 \fate Cuts Form Of Carter Tax Plan Continued from Page 1A © Restricting deductions for medical expenses and casu~ ality losses to catastrophic situations.

A credit would distribute tax savings evenly to all tax- payers, im contrast to an exemption, which is worth mmore to those in higher brack- ets. © Eliminating the present 15 per cent minimum tax on imcome, while inserting a “dVimitation on artificial losses”’ to restrict real estate, farming and other tax shel- ters. © Relieving the double taxation of dividends. Instead of taxing dividends on a corporate tax return and then again when they are received by an individual, the Carter system would provide some undetermined form of credit to make sure taxes were charged only once. In as h last week in Louisville, Blumenthal said: “If we were to eliminate virtually all deductions, exclu- sions and preferences, we could raise the same amount of revenue with tax rates of 8 to 38 per cent that we now obtain from taxes of 14 to 70 per cent and do it with ap- proximately the same distri- butions of tax burden among income classes.”’ He quickly added that the administration had no inteh- tion of proposing anything so radical as eliminating all tax breaks. . A deduction that is sure to survive, although perhaps with some limits, is charitable gifts. And there seems to be little serious possiblity of end- ing tax benefits now accorded to child care expenses, politi- cal contributions, pension fund contributions and fellowships. Interest from municipal bonds is expected to remain tax free, at least in the short term. But for the future, munici- lities are likely to he offered federal interest subsi- dies so they could afford to issue higher-interest bonds that would be taxable. Elimination of the capital gains preference— which covers nearly 100 sections and subsections of the tax code— is shaping .up as the most con- troversial element of the pro- gram. A capital gain is the orofit on the sale of an asset. hat change is not likely to be - Carter’s advisers as abrupt as it sounds, how- ever. In calculating the gain in the value of a stock (or on the sale of a home), a tax- payer would get credit for price rises resulting from inflation. Otherwise, taxpay- . ers would be loathe to sell any stocks, and gains would be locked in indefinitely. Blumenthal said the admin- istration’s over-all goal is to make it profitable for as many as 90 per cent of tax- payers to claim the standard deduction. E For others who still itemize deductions, he offered the prospect of simpler ealcula- tions and easier record-keep- ing requirements. Revtind the individual tax changes, the administration is fashioning a wariety of changes in the corporate _in- come tax. In the final version, the rhetoric may well be about ‘‘closing loopholes, but the result is liekly to be a lessening of the over-all corporate tax bite. One “loophole” now tar- geted for extinction is the $1.2 billion-a-year domestic inter- national sales corporation (DISC) incentive, originally designed to promote U.S. ex- ports. Blumenthal says, “It costs a lot of money and there isn’t any way you can show an impact on e . corporate tax rates and more generous depreciation rules- The question now before is which Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 31, 1977 (continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Lance hires ‘insider’ Clifford to save his job JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The reputa- tion of Jimmy Carter, not to men- tion that of his friend Bert Lance, is riding today on the wisdom and verve of that quintessential Wash- ington insider — the man with the reported million-dollar fee — Clark Clifford. Over the Labor Day weekend, when the case against him turned suddenly more grave, Lance placed a call to a man who had been ad- vising presidents, and at times presidential assistants in trouble, ever since Lance was 15 years old. Clifford, reportedly accepted Lance as a client only after he determined first-hand that Carter was not op- posed to the assignment. Clifford told Cox Newspapers that Lance will make no apologies and not offer to resign when he ap- pears before the Senate Govern- mental Affairs Committee today. He said Lance will, in his state- ment, present a “full and com- plete” answer to some 1]4 separate allegations, then take questions. If Lance was looking for an ex- pert on graceful exits from high of- fice, he could scarcely have found a more experienced practitioner than Clifford. On the other hand, one cardinal rule of Clifford’s practice is he won't take lost causes or em- barrass presidents, | Arthur Krock’s memoirs record that Attorney General J. Howard McGrath approached Clifford in somewhat similar circumstances 25 years ago. McGrath, whose depart- ment was beset by adverse news ' stories as a result of a mishandled tax case, asked Clifford to find out whether President Truman wanted McGrath out. Clifford, then building his own law firm after five years as Tru- man's White House counsel, told McGrath that Truman saw the press attacks as part of a technique of attacking him through his top aides. So McGrath should stay on. But as the tax investigation wid- ened, Truman changed his mind. By Krock's account, Clifford went to see the attorney general with a message from Truman: “He said he regretted to convey to the attorney general that the President had de- cided it would be best to’ transfer McGrath to another post — Am- bassador to Spain.” McGrath turned down the Madrid assign- ment and was fired. Sixteen years later, when Clif- ford's close friend Lyndon Johnson was in power, Clifford was called in to handle another embarrass- ment. Late in the 1964 presidential campaign, reporters heard that White House assistant Walter Jen- kins had been arrested for commit- ting an indecent act. With astounding persuasiveness, Clifford and another Johnson asso- ciate, Abe Fortas, made the rounds of editors at all the major Washing- ton newspapers and convinced them to withhold publication of the Jenkins arrest for “humanitarian” reasons. Later, a wire service broke the story. Johnson's brother, Sam Houston Johnson, has reported that Clifford was then delegated by the presi- though Truman had vetoed a bill to grant that authority. According to one Clifford tale, which may be apocryphal, a Mid- west corporaton once asked Clif- ford’s advice on a pending tax bill. “Do nothing,” replied Clifford after, a few weeks, enclosing a bill for $20,000. When the corporate gen- eral counsel demanded some elabo- ration of Clifford's terse recom- mendation, Clifford. replied, ‘Be- cause | said so.” Attached was an additional bill for $5,000. He served as an unofficial advis- er to a generation of Democratic Clark Clifford dent to contact Jenkins and obtain his resignation from | the White House staff. A trial lawyer i Missouri, Clifford joined Truman's White House staff in 1945 as an assistant naval aide. Later he served as Tru- man’s chief speechwriter and a key advisor on politics and foreign af- fairs. When he left the White House in 1950, Clifford and two other men formed a law firm. His exploits on behalf of corpo- rate clients are well known in Washington. One of his first coups, on behalf of Phillips Petroleum, was persuading the Federal Power Commission it had the authority to raise atural-gas prices even leaders, including John Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Stuart Syming- ton and Edmund Muskie. If was Clifford who, on Kenne- dy’s behalf, persuaded columnist Drew Pearson to retract a 1957 story claiming that Theodore Sor- ensen actually wrote Kennedy's book “Profiles in Courage.” Clifford turned down a chance to join the Kennedy Administration, but accepted a variety of sensitive assignments from JFK, At the end of the Johnson ad- ministration, Clifford became De- fense Secretary during the height of the Vietnam war. Like a trial lawyer with a hope- less case, Clifford studied the evi- dence and soon began advising Johnson that he had no choice but to settle with the North Vietnam- ese. As it turned out, Johnson fol- lowed Clifford's advice, but late considered Clifford a turncoat be- cause word of his dissatisfaction with Johnson policy became com- mon knowlege, Miami News - September 15, 1977 \f"

        "ocr_text": "No Favors For Stokes, Says Lance By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Bert Lance testi- fied Friday he did no favors for the prosecutor who dropped charges against him, but acknowledged that he forwarded a request to Jimmy Cart- er’s lawyer, Charles Kirbo, for the prosecutor to keep his job. As the first sitting cabinet member in 54 years to defend himself before a Senate committee on possible crimi- nal violations, the budget director was dramatically defended in the morning by Sen. Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo., who called Lance a victim of McCarthy- like “guilt by accumulation.” In the afternoon, Lance's lawyer, Clark Clifford, temporarily blocked questions from Sen. Charles Percy, R- Til, based on a week-old Justice De- partment investigation into possible tax and campaign violations through Lance flights in a National Bank of Georgia plane. Clifford won the right to inspect the departmental submission to the com- mittee before any questions are asked —explaining that he had a duty to protect Lance's “constitutional rights.” Clifford will tell the commit- tee prior to today’s meeting if he will allow his client to testify on use of the plane. For five hours, Lance never raised his voice as he alternately fielded softball questions from Democrats and Republican attempts to devastate him. After dominating the opening day of testimony Thursday, Lance at times was backed into uncomfortable corners on such matters as double collateral, bank overdrafts, and use of a bank-owned airplane. Meantime, in a mid-day meeting with editors, including Jack Spalding of the Atlanta Journal, President Carter reaffirmed that he was keeping an open mind on Lance's future in the administration. Carter will hold a Associated Press Photo TO TESTIFY AGAIN SATURDAY Bert Lance press conference next week to discuss Lance’s appearances before the com- mittee, “He's answered the charges and I Fore hy hag enh aped his itnatian” wa ths wed 18 Mite. The Focksut also said that there has been no proof presented that the budget chief did anything that was illegal. Presidential spokesman Jody Pow- ell also released figures which showed a dramatic turnaround in favor of Lance at the White House switchboard since his televised testimony on Capi- tol Hill. On Friday, Powell said, the calls were running 84 percent in Lance's favor whereas as the week began only about 30 percent of the callers sup. ported Lance. See LANCE, Page 5-A The hearings continue Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to at least 5 p.m., committee chairman, Abraham Ribicoff, D-Conn., said. Lance will be testifying: committee staff members will testify Monday, Ribicoff said, As the second day of his testimony wore on, Lance’s opponents on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chipped away at his prepared defense, winning concessions from Lance that: The National Bank of Georgia and the Calhoun First National Bank, both of which he headed, suffered combined losses of $193,000 as a result of loans he personally approved to Billy Lee Campbell before his arrest and conviction as an embezzler. ® Despite his earlier testimony that he had never been cited for bank law violations on his personal overdrafts at the Calhoun bank, Lance actually was cited for violating a civil law against loans to bank insiders in a 1971 bank exam- iner’s report. © Although insisting he fully informed the committee last January about his financial problems, he did not recall mentioning the alleged misuse of bank airplanes in the Carter campaign, which recently became the subject of a Justice Department inquiry. Prior to 1974, interest was charged on overdrafts in some accounts at the Calhoun bank, but not on any of the ac- counts maintained by Lance, his wife, or other relatives who owned the controlling shares in the bank. Brought back repeatedly to the subject of overdrafts, Lance drew a laugh at one point when he observed, “As you know, the federal government has a few overdraft policies.” But he also said he “took to heart” the doubts expressed by Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., about his use of overdrafts while a bank officer. ; He indicated he would not overdraw his accounts in the future and acknowleged that it “certainly would have been better” if the overdrafts never occurred, Asked about his contacts with law enforcement author- ities prior to the Carter inauguration, Lance disputed an affi- davit released this week from a bank examiner suggesting that Lance had told the Atlanta regional banking superintend- ent in May 1976 that he expected a high post in the Carter administration. Timeadad bile: ice: 0) VS caper ih otea that last December his lawyer, Sidney 0. Smith Jr., tele- phoned John Stokes, then U.S. attorney in Atlanta, to check the status of a long-pending criminal investigation into over- drafts by Lance's 1974 gubernatorial campaign committee. Stokes, now in private practice, closed the case a few days later, saying subsequently it was weak, Presenting a new element in the chronology, Lance testi- fied that later in the presidential transition period, he received a letter from Stokes or one of his friends. “There was some reference made as to his being retained,” Lance told Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo. Later, when Sen, Sam Nunn, D-Ga., sought to clear up a potentially embarrassing point, Lance explained that he re- ceived a letter suggesting Stokes’ retention as U.S. Attorney and “I sent it on to Mr. Kirbo.” The incident was not pursued. Instead, Sen. Charles M. Mathias, R-Md., pressed Lance on why the FBI was not able to begin its pre-confirmation background check on him for nearly a month after he was formally named as Carter's budget director last Dec. 2. “T'm told that the necessary consent papers were laid be- fore you on several occasions—the transition people say so— and it was not until the 27th of December that you signed them,” said Mathias, Lance, momentarily ruffled, replied, “Nobody ever told me there was any difficulty at all in getting any sort of paper signed by me,” He assured Mathias he had “nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to hide” from the FBI. Behind the scenes, junior committee Democrats have rebelled against Ribicoff for having permitted Perey—a Republican with presidential ambitions—to send an allegedly partisan team of investigators to Atlanta last month in search of information on Lance’s background, The three investigators who went were John Childers and Jonathan Cottin, both appointed by Percy, and Claudia Ingraham, a Ribicoff appointee who was on the staff of Republican Lowell Weicker, R-Conn,, until last January. At the White House, a ranking presidential assistant re- ported that the Senate has apparently “polarized” itself on the Lance case, along no discernable partisan lines, with powerful feelings on both sides, In fact, among Senate Democratic staff aides there were some predictions that Eagleton might seek to strip Ribicoff of his chairmanship of the committee if the hearings dragged on next week. It was Eagleton, dropped from the 1972 Democractic ticket after news leaks on his treatment for mental depres- sion, who leaped hardest to Lance's defense against Percy and other committee critics, Ridiculing the previous day's apology by Percy for caus- ing Lance a weekend of anguish, Eagleton said, “We are playing with a man’s character—more is at stake than a lit- tle momentary anguish over the weekend. Harkening back to the 1950s as a time of “guilt by as- sociation” practices by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R- Wis,, Eagleton said Lance was a victim of “guilt by accumu: lation,” in which each day Percy and others heaped ‘a little more mud” on Lance's reputation, When his turn came, Percy said he had made “two mis- takes * ¢ss0'> 2277et.” One, for whi he qublioly an il \\gized L Lauce cdilier, Wa suggrotialy uit vidges wifecwe may have backdated checks for tax purposes. His second mistake, Percy said after the hearings, was his Labor Day press conference on the White House lawn in which he discussed the charges reportedly made by convicted embezzler Billy Lee Campbell to three Senate probers, The last sitting cabinet-level official who faced congres- sional investigation involving possible criminal misconduct was Navy Secretary Edwin Denby, according to the Library of Congress, Denby testified on Oct. 24, 1923, before the Senate Com- mittee on Public Lands on charges growing out of the Teapot Dome scandal, involving naval oil reserves, The Senate com- mittee later asked President Calvin Coolidge to dismiss him. Coolidge refused but Denby resigned. Atlanta Constitution - September 17, 1977 \f"

Reporter Saw Similar Tubes Journal-Constitution. By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau ©1978 Cox Newspapers WASHINGTON — As an impostor, 1 talked my way past the security guards at*two highly secret Air Force nuclear weapons depots last month and was given a tour of the weak links in their defenses against a attacks, T passed within a stone throw of six metal tubes that appeared to be hydrogen bombs. I could not tell if they were live bombs or dummy training devices, which contain merely the elec- tronic ingredients of bombs, Without doing anything illegal, I also pur- chased a set of government blueprints showing the exact layout of the weapons compounds and the nearby alert areas where bomb-laden B-52s of the Strategic Air Command are ready to take off in case of nuclear war, One blueprint disclosed a method of knock- ing out the alarm circuits, Another diagram showed two unguarded gates through the inner- most security fence. 'e Carrying a Brooks Brothers topcoat and a yellow plastic hardhat, I appeared at the first base last month and claimed to be a potential bidder on a construction contract. No one questioned me or asked for any credentials except for my District of Columbia driver’s license. No one searched me or de- manded to inspect my bulky briefcase. As far as the guards knew, I could have been carrying hand grenades, Looking equally amateurish, I entered another SAC base a few weeks later and joined a tour of its weapons compound which had been organized for prospective contractors, This time, guards required two IDs — a JOSEPH ALBRIGHT ‘ credit card and my driver's license. They also manifested a considerable interest in my middle initial. They even went so far as to search all briefcases, However, no one asked whether I really was a contractor. The first SAC hase is less than 10 miles from a medium-sized American city, in a region that has been beset by terrorist dynamitings. The second SAC base is about 20 miles from a Major state university. The exercise was part of a two-month inves- tigation into one of the ghastly, yet unavoidable, questions of the nuclear age: Are Americans safe from their own nuclear weapons? Without succumbing to hand-wringing or hysteria, it is fair to conclude that there are some inexcusable chinks in the doors to the U.S. atomic arsenal. Turn to Page 16A, Column 1 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 8, 1978 \fNuclear Security: Just How Secure? Continwed from Page 1A Informed in advance about this story, Pentagon nuclear weapons chief Donald R. Cotter ordered an immediate investigation into, Defense Department construction procedures involving weapons sites. As part of the inquiry, Cotter phoned Air Force Gen. Richgrd Ellis, SAC commander in Omaha, to find the exact circumstances of my un- wanthd visits. “You did find a considerable chink in the security system,” acknowledged Cotter, who tis Defense Secretary Harold Brown's assistant for atomic energy “This was too , . . simple,” said Cotter. “This story should be a plus for our securit; efforts.” In recent years, Cotter expla construction jobs at weapons sites have been to contractors without security clearances in an effort to avoid concentrat- ing too much business among a small “club” of high-priced builders. My nuclear excursion was only one piece in a disturbing pattern. Other evi- dence, found in government documents and in interviews with Pentagon and Depart- ment of Energy weapons experts, includes: * The CIA, Defense Department and key members of Congress are clearly con- cerned about the possibility of terrorist groups seizing weapans of mass destruction for high-stakes political extortion. “It seems prudent to assume that sooner or later some group is bound to take the plunge,” an un- classified CIA study declared in 1976. * Although no one has ever stolen a nu- clear weapon, there have been troubling incidents that have received little or no pub- licity. Thus in 1974, guards at a Nike-Her- cules anti-aircraft battery near Baltimore were unable to capture an intruder whom saw pear the corner of a warhead reportedly stole some mustard gas from a munitions depot in France. In 1976, an uni- dentified Army unit found what the Defense Nuclear Agency calls “indications of possi- ble attempts to reconnoiter or photograph a storage site.” Last year, according to the Defense Nuclear , an Army unit “re- ported that two individuals attempted pene- tration of the outer boundaries of a security area.” * Despite these warnings, the Defense is relying on relatively unso- ted devices to keep intruders out. * Officially, the Defense Department tries to keep secret the location of nuclear storage sites by refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons. However, in congressional testimony, the Air Force a list of 16 of its bases where it The CIA, in its 1976 study “Interna- and Transnational Terrorism,” said it be “a few years yet” before any ter- group would be able to manufacture steal a nuclear weapon.

By referring to published jonal testimony, anyone could readily that this was a nuclear weapons storage site. The Army of Engineers, which placed the contract notice, incladed an invit- ing sentence: “Plans and specifications pope perdorbibearae 14 Nov 77 at a cost of Oferet und No one questioned me or asked for any credentials ex- ept for my District of Columbia driver's license.

Inside was a large book of 53 blue- prints showing how Uhe weapons storage area is now protected and how it would be after pl security renovations, Also en- closed were about 300 pages of technical specifications for the contract, including in- structions on how workmen can get creden- tials to enter the base. Amid the dense language of the speci- fications one passage stood out: “Bidders are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves as to all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of the contract... .” It took me three phone calls to reach a Mrs. Hilda Ferry, a kindly secretary who works in the base construction office. Could she, I wondered, arrange for me to tour the site next Tuesday? She asked for my Social Security number and told me to eal! back in 24 hours so she could check i: with her boss, Capt. William Branford. The following day, I tclephoned Mrs. Ferry once again. No problem, she said. Be here at 1:30 p.m. and ask for a Mr. Wilmer. I know nothing at all about soil com- paction, mitering of joints, electromagnet capability or anything else about the con- struction industry.

As it turned out, I spent two hours reading an encyclopedia of construc- tion terms and got no f f than the “B’'s, Steve Wilmer, a civilian construction employee at the base since 1966, was mostly interested in talking about the weather. At one point he sald something about electrical generators | did not understand. I said I was deaf in one ear. He nodded. He suggested that I could leave my yel- low hardhat in my car. Under the specifications for the con- tract, the of Engineers had the right to ask for a list of my other construction contracts before showing me the site. Nor was I asked to prove that I was a require licensed, it turns out that the federal gov- ernment does not. Even so, I thought the game was up when Wilmer led me into a windowless room inside the SAC security detachment cort us was out fo lunch, So Lt. Andrew Ford, the chief Air Force security man on duty, offered to drive us around the post in his pickup truck, First stop was the bomber alert apron, a fenced-in airplane parking lot where I he had any curiosity about me, he satisfied it by examining my D.C. driver's license. Inside the alert apron, I asked Wilmer why the Corps of Engineers had decided to bulldoze one area near the fence. “We have to get rid of those hiding places,” said Wilmer, pointing to several erosion-caused ditches, “We wanted to do a little more work over there, but it was cut out.” I asked why. “Money.” said Wilmer. ee are es mile down an iso- 0 a weapons - a fenced ere about the size six football fi Inside the fence were about half a dozen earth-covered mounds, known in the Air Force as igloos, which serve as ware- houses for city-buster bombs. At Ford's suggestion, we began by aa driving around the outside of the ence. “You know how long it would take to get over that?” Ford asked, nodding at the chain link fence topped with barbed wire. I said I didn't have any idea. “Three seconds,” Ford said, “If you know what you are doing — three seconds.” Just then, I noticed a small tractor hauling an trailer inside the weapons compound about 150 feet away. On the trailer were four torpedo-shaped cylinders, each painted silver, with metallic fins on their tails, The tractor driver was slowly maneuvering the cylinders into what looked like a cinderblock garage. At that moment, I was holding my briefcase, which no one had bothered to examine. Ford, who had a pistol on his hip, had both hands on the wheel, Based on unclassified Atomic Energy hy packing the equivalent of at least one mil- ion tons of TNT. Four such bombs are the typical payload of a B-52 bomber when on nuclear alert. “Seen enough?” asked Ford. One more thing, I said: How about let- ting me inside the security guardhouse in the weapons compound? He looked sideways at me but a , after once again asking for my Social Security number. I stayed inside the guardhouse pound. Then, on my way out, | asked whether “my” work crews would have to worry about guard dogs. No, replied Wilmer. He to tell me the hours when the dogs are kept in their cages. Could it have been a one-time fluke that no one saw through this pose? To find out, I mailed $6 to another re- gional office of the of Engineers and asked for plans and specifications for a similar construction job at yet another SAC base. ‘Back came an equally revealing set of blueprints, along with an invitation to bid- ders to join a tour of the site. For me, the highlight of touring inside canoes. Instead, it held two tapered cylin- ders that looked considerably like the offi- cia] photographs of B-43 hydrogen bombs. My bost. an Air Force sergeant, was also good enough to tell me the route and approximate daily schedule for the vehicles that carry mucear weapons back and forth between the storage site and the B-52's. Upon learning of my tour, Gen. Ellis of SAC informed the Pentagon that at the sec- end base I had seen dummy training bombs. Could I have seized a nuclear weapon? Not at the second SAC base, where the guards were careful to search all briefcases. And even at the first base. where the se- curity verged om lackadaisical, the odds would have been against me Escaping with a hydrogen bomb is not a simple matter since the MK-28 model weighs one ton. But, there was a chance I might have succeeded. Given a few suicidal confeder- ates, a CB radio and a fast getaway helicop- ter, there is no telling bow far I might have gone.

Rep.

Rep. Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich.) whose subcommittee has authorized $300 million for security improvements at nuclear weapons storage depots over the last three years, asked the Pentagon for a complete report on how the reporter was allowed to visit the two bases last month by posing as a contractor, “If the facts are as 1 read them in the sto- ry, then there has been a dereliction of duty and this deserves an appropriate response by the military,”” Neda! said. Particularly unsettling, Nedzi said, was that the reporter was allowed on the one of two SAC bases without any inspection of his briefcase. ‘This is a problem that should be corrected tonight, without the expenditure of & nickel,” he said ‘All it takes is stricter command control.\" Nedzi said he was also troubled that a re: porter was able to buy government blueprints Securit y— From Page | “We know that Mr. Albright was under security guard at all times he was in or near sensitive resource areas and at no time did he consti- tute a threat to such resources...

Originally, the Air Force said its records indicated that the report- er had only seen dummy training bombs. But yesterday an Air Force spokesman telephoned the reporter to retract that portion of the state- ment. ‘‘We are not as positive about that as we thought we were,” the spokesman said. ‘‘We are not cer- tain that you did not sge an actual weapon.” The Air Force said it and the Army Corps of Engineers ‘‘will inve- Stigate .. . to see what, if any, cor- rective action is appropriate.\"’ During his tour of one SAC weapons site, the reporter was escorted by an Air Force lieutenant armed with a pistol, and an un- armed civilian from the base con- struction office. As the story noted, the lieutenant could not devote his full attention to security duties since he was doubling as driver of the pickup truck that caried the reporter around the site.

But Cox Newspaper reporter Joseph Al- bright managed to talk himself past securi- ty guards at two Air Force nuclear weapons bases with no more disguise than his over- coat and a hardhat. For identification, Al- bright produced on demand his driver’s li- cense. He got, in his guise as a potential defense contractor (which was never questioned), practically a guided tour of the weak spots in base security. “I passed within a stone’s throw of six metal tubes that appeared to be hydrogen bombs,”’ Albright wrote in a series of sto- ries on his two-month probe into security at the 636 ‘‘nuclear-capable’’ U.S. military units around the world. The Air Force said the Strategic Air Com- mand is unsure if Albright saw dummy or real hydrogen bombs during his visits. Albright says the Defense Department is relying on relatively unsophisticated de- vices to keep intruders out. Highly technical (and undoubtedly expen- sive) security devices may be necessary to provide air-tight protection of nuclear de- vices from theft or inspection.

        "ocr_text": "Lax Guarding of N-Weapons This is the second in a three-part series om weak links in the U.S. defense against terrorist attacks and accidents at nuclear weapons stor- age sites. fost By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureaw 1978 Cox Newspapers WASHINGTON — Marine Pvt. Timothy Scudder, 17, could be considered an atomic-age hero. He is the only American serviceman - known to have lost his life while guarding a nu- clear weapons compound against the prospect of terrorist attack. The Marine Corps band is not about to schedule any full-dress parades for him, how- ever. Very few Pentagon officials have been told how he died. Those who know would be happy to forget the whole thing. Yet the story of his death is worth telling, for it exposes a grisly problem that has at- tracted only sporadic attention at high levels in ‘Washington: How can the 20,000 U.S. nuclear ‘weapons be kept ready for use in wartime with- out inviting a terrorist incident or freak accident in time of peace? 5 * It is a question that continues to worry the United States intelligence community. CIA ana- lyst David Milbank warned in a 1976 unclassi- fied agency study that “it seems prudent to assume” that sooner or later a terrorist group will attempt to steal a nuclear weapon for its value in a political extortion scheme. And in a report called “Facing Tomorrow’s ‘Terrorist Incident Today,” one of the govern- ment’s chief experts on terrorist behavior, Rob- ert H. Kupperman of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, warned four months ago: “Although few terrorist groups have yet focused systematic attacks on non-human targets, this may become a more attractive alternative as we become inured to assassinations, bombings and _ hostage-taking. Ain Invitation to Terrorists “Incidents such as the attacks on mass-tran- sit ticket machines in West Germany, power fa- cilities in California, broadcasting studios in Spain and Argentina and nuclear power plants in France, Spain and Argentina may foreshadow more extensive nationally disruptive acts... . “It is no secret that many governments — and some subnational groups — are anxious to get their hands on a nuclear weapon.” By an unofficial estimate, it will cost more than $350 million this year just to guard the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. At each weapons site, the two-man weapons patrols are backed up by a Response Force of at least 15 heavily armed troops that supposedly can meet any emergency in less than five minutes, and by an Augmenta- tion Force of several hundred men that can reach the scene in less than an hour. The weapons themselves are generally stored in steel-doored igloos, protected by anti- intruder alarms and security locks that cannot be opened by one person. Turn to Page 14A, Column 1 Continued from Page 1A The Pentagon is proud of its safety record over the last 33 years of protecting its worldwide inventory of mnu- clear bombs, artillery shells, mines and rocket warheads. So far, no atomic weapons have ever been stolen or acci- dently detonated. Defense sources said the scariest incident in recent years occurred one night last March at a nuclear weapons storage site in southern Vir- ginia known as the Advanced Undersea Weapons Compound. When the episode was over, Marine Pvt. Scudder —’a high school dropout from Hamil- ton, Ohio — lay dead of bullet wounds. His partner on the two-man guard team, Pfc. Milton Scott, 20, insisted that Scudder had been cut down by sniper fire from outside the compound. What was first reported as a terrorist attack later turned out to be a different sort of incident. Even now many of the facts are disputed, but it is clear that Scudder had been shot six times at point-blank range. After that was estab- lished, his partner Scott changed his story and said he had never actually seen any sniper fire. In fact, said Scott, he was asleep on watch when Scudder was shot. Navy authorities soon con- clud¢d that Scudder must have. been killed by Scott. But the embarrassing part was to shot with his own rifle. Scot was charged with the murder and last summer he was con, victed of unpremeditat murder by a military court martial on the basis of cir- cumstantial evidence. He wa sentenced to 30 years at har labor. . At Scott’s trial, the fact that Scott and Scudder were on duty guarding nuclear weapons was not divulged by any witness. But the nature of their duties has been subse- quently confirmed by a key Pentagon source. Considered in this light, some of the other evidence in the court-martial is not particularly comforting. According to Scott’s state- ments to Navy investigators, it was common practice for one of the two guards on duty to sleep while his partner covered for him. Another young Marine, who had not been on duty that night, testi- fied, that he, too, knew of times when guards at the compound went to sleep on watch. The prosecution did not seriously dispute this. The backup force, asleep in the guard barracks less than a mile away from the maga- zines, never heard the shoot- ing. Thus once Scudder died, Scott was alone near _ the weapons magazines. And just outside the rear fence of the compound, not far from the shooting scene, was a little- traveled road leading out of the al base. _The incident in southern Virgi was perhaps unique in that a nuclear weapons guard“was killed. But there have”. nm other events and observations involving nuclear weapons which seem equall unsettling. ©® In 1971, two Mexican border-jumpers made their way through at least three se- curity fences and found them- selves inside the Monzan Mountain base, a secret depot in New Mexico that serves as a central stockpile for Air Force nuclear weapons. Seek- ing jobs, the two aliens mis- took this atomic Fort Knox for a cattle ranch and simply went through the _ fence. Forty-five minutes later, they were finally spotted by an Air Force security patrol and evicted. e In 1967, according to Sen- ate Foreign Relations Com- mittee testimony, Greek mili- tary troops surrounded several American nuclear bases near Athens during an attempt by dissident Greek colonels to overthrow’ the American-supported Greek government. The aim, it was thought at the time, was to prevent U.S. forces from nels succeeding in taking power without any direct con- frontation with American weapons custodians. @ In 1972, an investigator from the U.S. Joint Atomic Energy Committee toured half a dozen American nu- clear weapons sites in Eu- rope. At one post in Germany, the investigator found nuclear weapons stored in the base- ment of a barracks. When he arrived, the basement door was open and unguarded. At another European site, nu- clear weapons were found stored at a depot outside the gates of an airbase, so that they had to be transported to planes over a strip of public road. e In 1974, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., spoke to American commanders and enlisted men in Europe assigned to nuclear units. “I was frankly appalled by our lack of security,” Nunn recalled recently. “There were all sorts of problems over there — narcotics, inade- quate lighting, guards forced to work tours that were too long.” e In 1975, House Appropri- ations Committee investiga- tors toured 38 tactical nuclear weapons depots in Europe and wrote a top-secret report enumerating dozens of weak- interfering with the coup. As it turned he eek 0 nesses in their security ar- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 15, 1978 \frangements. The report, which led to a series of classi- fied hearings, is said to have persuaded several members of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee that that there was some danger of an “in- - Side job,” in which a weapons guard would be induced to cooperate in a scheme to “embezzle” a nuclear weapon, * Between 1973 and 1977, U.S. authorities reportedly have had to deal with about 72 threats from cranks claim- ing to have manufactured or stolen nuclear weapons, So far, all these threats have been hoaxes, There is no single solution for the government's dooms- day storage problem. The military needs some more money for electronic sensors, hardened guard posts, and other anti-terrorist devices, But equipment isn’t every- thing. As Pfe. Scott's defense lawyer, James Brydges, put it: “Tt becomes a question of who is going to watch the guy on watch.” That is a dilemma which the military services try to answer by means of a rigor- and — psychological screening known in the Penta- gon as the “human reliability program.” The theory behind the program is to make sure no unstable servicemen are ever assigned to duties involv- ing access to nuclear weap- ons, However, in practice, the arithmetic of the U.S. atomic arsenal makes complete human reliability an almost impossible goal. With abcut 20,000 warheads spread out among about 636 “nuclear- capable” units around the world, errors in personnel as- signments are all but unavoid- able. About 20,000 servicemen are assigned to guard nuclear weapons under the “human reliability program,” a Penta- gon spokesman said, The Navy, in response to a Cox Newspapers query, dis- Closed that in 1976 it had to drop 48 Navy or Marine guards from nuclear security duty for “negligence or delin- quency in performance of duty.” The Air Force, with consid- erably more nuclear weapons to protect, was obliged to drop 326 weapons guards in 1976 for “negligence or delin- quency” on duty or during training, an Air Force spokes man said. The Army said it disquali fied 12 nuclear weapons guards in 1976 for “negligence or delinquency” on duty. A spokesman insisted that none of these instances involved carelessness with a weapon, but was unable to say exactly what the 12 guards had done. Incredibly, there is no offi- cial in the Pentagon who knows the details of these re- ported instances of negligence or delinquency. Cases were dealt with by base command- ers without being reported in detail to the Pentagon, offi- cials said. “Negligence and delinquency” is usually a very - minor infraction in a program with very high standards, the officials contended. Guards are only one factor in the situation. Pentagon fig- ures released by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., show that in 1976, 115,767 military people were assigned to duties in- volving some access to nu- clear weapons. Besides guards, they included weapons maintenance technicians, loading crews, bomb couriers, command and control officers and emergency disposal teams and flight crews. Despite strict entrance re- quirements for the “human reliability program,” military ‘commanders in 1976 found reason to wash out 4,965 of these nuclear specialists and guards from jobs involving access to weapons. The rea- sons ranged from drug and alcohol abuse (usually off- duty) to mental stress to negligence or conviction of criminal offenses. Some commanders are evi- dently more successful than others in weeding misfits out of nuclear weapons crews. In the last four years, inspection teams from the Defense Nu- clear Agency have given “unsatisfactory” ratings to 79 out of the 520 “nuclear-capa- ble” units that have been sub- jected to formal inspections. A breakdown of the reasons for “unsatisfactory” ratings showed that 45 units were flunked for “security,” nine for “safety” and another 29 for deficiencies in the human reliability program. Sometimes one unit was deficient in several catego- ries. Other reasons for nuclear demerits included improper techniques in handling, storing and transporting weapons. All this is not too surpris- ing, for the task of caring for America’s weapons of mass destruction is left to men and women with human frailties, many of them very young. And, as Nunn has remarked, “Guarding a nuclear weapon is the most boring job in the world.” After the death of 17-year- old Timothy Scudder, a re- porter asked a Marine com- mander involved in the inci- dent whether Scudder had been given too heavy a re- sponsibility for his age. “He joined up to be a Marine,” answered the com- mander, who declined to be identified. “He’s just as much a man at 17 as someone who is 19 or 20 or older. “We've got people 17 years old walking sentry duty all over the world.” CONTINUED NEXT SUN- DAY.

They ats rived in a brown envelope marked “Important — this is an addendum to an invitation for bids previously furs nished your office,” My 10-year-old daughter, accustomed to the arrival of thick packages from the military, asked matter of factly: “More blueprints, daddy?” Inside was a sheaf of Army Corps of Engineers dia» grams for the first Air Force SAC weapons site I visits ed last December — the one where I saw four metal tubes that turned out to be hydrogen bombs, At first, the blueprints looked just like the first 3 plans | had bought from the Corps of Engineers last fall, as part of a Cox Newspapers investigation of secu rity flaws at nuclear weapons sites, I had obtained the initial set by spotting a contract notice in a Commerce Department magazine and mailing a $5.30 personal check to a regional office of the Corps of Engineers.

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journai-Constitution Washington Bureau ©1978 Cox Newspapers : WASHINGTON — Largely to save money, the Pentagon plans to retain into the mid-1980s at least 10,000 nuclear weapons which Jack modern safety devices to pre- vent them from being blown up by terror- ists or destroyed by accident. Some of these obsolete warheads are Army “mini-nukes” that will fit in a back- pack. Others are multi-megaton Air Force hydrogen bombs that can create city-wreck- ing fireballs 15 miles wide. Deployed around theworld to deter a Continued from Page 1A learned last week the Carter administration has denied an Air Force request for funds to in making the new bomb. The Carter ro reflecting the decision will be released Monday. ~ The lack of sophisticated safety devices on older American nuclear weapons is a documented fact. Alfred Starbird, then chief of the U.S. weapons program, told a House Appropriations subcommittee in 1976 that the newest Air Force nuclear bombs “are all much safer and more secure than the weapons we have in the stockpile at the present time.” Starbird’s little-noticed testimony shows he was emphatic about the benefits of a new electronic safety catches, known as the Category D Permissive Action Link. The job of this so-called PAL device, which costs about $20,000, is to insure that the bomb cannot be detonated without using the proper six-digit code. Starbird also praised a new triggering system, which he said is less prone to acci- dent since it uses an “insensitive” high explosive instead of TNT used to set off the older warheads. “These are of the nature of the features that will tremendously increase the safety against an accident (deleted) either just the high explosive and scatter the plutonium or nuclear fire the weapons,” said Starbird, ac- cording to the censored transcript. Asked to explain this passage, a spokes- man for the U.S. weapons building program, now part of the Department of Energy, said Starbird was alerting the subcommittee about two hazards inherent in some older warheads: ®A so-called “plutoniurn-scattering accident” set off by bomber crash, a light- ning strike or some other external blow to the weapon. This can occur when something accidentally explodes the TNT trigger of a nuclear weapon, discharging plutonium particles into the atmosphere but without causing a nuclear blast. Communist attack, these warheads are stored in military weapons compounds such as the two Strategic Air Command weapons sites that were penetrated last month by this reporter posing as a fencing contractor. Pentagon authorities now concede that four metal cylinders that were a highlight of this incognito visit to SAC were indeed hydrogen bombs. Judging from government photographs, they were 1950s-model H-bombs, which are not equipped with recent electronic safety me y rans unauthorized explosions. $ early-model weapon paren was a Mark-28 hydrogen bomb. 7 r As the Defense Department points out, = . we nS ites ie Machronic con- 0! le; eney is insi tiehmbdbydatke ® Terrorist seizure of a nuclear weap- ons site followed by an attempt to detonate, or “nuclear fire the weapons,” in Starbird’s words, Despite Starbird’s seemingly compel- ling case for weapons safety improvements, the Pentagon is not initiating a crash pro- gram to purchase the new models and retire the old ones. In faet, a two-month Cox Newspapers investigation has uncovered a pattern of only halting progress toward nuclear weap- ons security, coupled with instances of delay, neglect and overconfidence. Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard N. Cody, deputy director of the Defense Nuclear Ag- ency, acknowledged in an interview that safety features could be phased in some- what more rapidly if money was made available, “Naturally, everything in the national security budget has to compete for funds, whether it is a new warhead or a battalion in Europe,” Cody said. Of course, there are several layers of weapons safeguards already, many of them classified. There has not been an accident involv- ing a nuclear weapon since 1968, when a B- 52 carrying four H-bombs crashed on a frozen bay in Greenland, Weapons, Fist Gatch Fire In that incident, the weapons and jet fuel caught fire in the crash, scattering plu- tonium on the icecap, The fire was hot enough to burn through eight feet of ice, and some bomb components were lost in 800 feet of water. But these older H-bombs are not under presidential control when they are on the ground outside the bombers, Pentagon offi- cials concede. Unhappily, a Mark-28 could be opened and reworked by a competent electrician so that it would detonate when dropped from a civilian plane or left in a warehouse. The explosion could be as much as 50 times as powerful as the A-blast at Hiroshima. ; Eventually these older SAC bombs are due to be replaced by a new, safer model. But the changeover has been several times postponed. A weapons factory in Amarillo, Texas, was supposed to be assembling a replace- ment bomb late this year. But it was 4Jurn to Page 13A, Column 1 As a result of the Greenland crash, and an earlier B-52 wreck near Palomares, Spain, the Defense Department in 1968 eliminated the practice of keeping some B- 52s with nuclear weapons on around-the- clock airborne alert. Today, the bombers are kept on alert on SAC base runways. The prospect of an air crash involving nuclear weapons has not been completely eliminated, however. For example, a De- fense Department order has authorized heli- copters and “tactical aircraft” to airlift nu- Clear weapons on “logistic flights.” The unclassified Pentagon order, dated Dee, 20, 1972, contains a laconic warning to pilots: “Nuclear weapons and major as- semblies shall be jettisoned from transporting aircraft only in accordance with the provisions of the USAF Special Weapons Overflight Guide.” Air Force officials said the overflight guide, a top-secret publication, contains maps showing unpopulated areas around the world where nuclear weapons could be tossed overboard if necessary, The military shopping list for new nu- clear weapons is a secret document issued annually and known in atomic circles as the “New Dog.” The aim of the Nuclear Weap- ons t Guidance, as it is offi- cially known, is to put all requests for new warheads in priority order. “In the past, the ‘New Dog’ has been relatively fiscally unconstrained,” said Cody. “It is more constrained now.” What that means is that requests for safety improvements on existing weapons sometimes have to be delayed so that the government weapons factories can concen- trate on higher-priority weapons. Thove now about to enter full produc- tion include warheads for the cruise missile, the Trident submaring;launched missile, the artillery shell and — most controversial — the Army’s neutron warhead. Shopping for New Bombs As part of its shopping list, the Air Force wants to replace its old Mark-28 H- bombs, which have been in storage for as long as 19 years. It also wants to supplant a 1961-model bomb, the B-43, which also lacks safety devices. But the Air Force is not in much of a hurry. So far, it has ordered the new and safer B-61-4 warheads favored by Starbird to re- place only those Mark-28 and B-43 bombs now located at the 1,000 or so U.S. and NATO fighter-bombers bases in Europe. In fact, weapons designers already have conducted underground tests on a new, safer replacement bomb known as the B-77 FUFO bomb. For peacetime, its safety features in- clude the new insensitive high explosive trigger and a Category D permissive action link. Its wartime advantages include a delayed fusing system allowing it to be dropped from a low-flying bomber without killing the crew. Although the Air Force wants the B-77 bomb, it is not a high-priority item. Under current Air Force plans old model H-bombs in SAC weapons depots will be replaced by B-77s over seven years or longer. 6,780 Nuclear Weapons SAC has at least 6,780 strategic nuclear weapons at its 19 bomber bases in the United States. This does not include a large supply of “re-strike” weapons, supposedly for use by bombers not shot down on their first mission. Not all of these weapons are bombs. Some are nuclear-tipped shortrange attack missiles, which hang under the wings or in the bomb bays of B-52s and are fired before i aches the target. Atlanta Constitution - January 22, 1978 \fica Haske Many N-Weapons Lack KMAodern Safety Devices In spite of its safety features, the SRAM-B project was canceled in the Penta: gon after Carter killed the Bl bomber. SRAM-B could have been purchased instead for the older B-52s, but it wasn't. The delays in phasing out Air Force weapons are matched by the slow-motion pace of the government's actions to replace several thousand 25-year-old Army nuclear warheads assigned to NATO artillery units in Europe, These warheads, sometimes called “mini-nukes,’ were produced during the Kisenhower administration, when it was NATO doctrine that any war against the Warsaw Pact would be a nuclear one, This assumption has long since changed, how: ever, and NATO conventional forces have heen much strengthened, In the meantime, as a recent Congres- sional Budget Office study put it, “the fre- quency of incidents: of international terror- ism in the early 1970s prompted a realization that highly determined, well- organized, trained and equipped groups of terrorists might succeed in an attempt to penetrate special ammunition storage Sites and gain control of a nuclear weapon.” This prospect prompted NATO to ine crease security forces at the approximately 100 atomic weapons stockpiles in Western Europe, But so far, at least, plans to make the weapons themselves terrorist-proof are at an early stage, r The More Tempting Targets Among the more tempting targets for a group such as the now defunct Baader-Mein- hof gang is the U.S, Army's 155-millimeter howitzer shell, ; It can be carried by one man. It will destroy almost everything in a radius of a quarter-mile, And best of all, from a terror- ist's standpoint, it is not equipped with a built-in PAL device to prevent unauthorized use, Although its shipping case has a tough combination lock referred to as a PAL de- vice, Pentagon experts fear it could be jimmied open. Even so, the government's leading bomb experts acknowlege that the job of re- placing old warheads which lack modern safety equipment could be speeded up. But it would cost money: Perhaps as much as $5 billion in spending over the next few years that could otherwise be postponed until the late 1980s, Is it worth it? That is a question which until now, Congress and the Carter adminis. tration have left to the military weapons bu- reaucracy, Yet, in light of demonstrated weak. nesses in security arrangements at nuclear Weapons sites, it is a question that needs to be answered soon, A-Bomb Works Are No Mystery JournalsConstitution Washingion Bureau WASHINGTON — There is no mystery about how a nuclear weapon works, The key is obtaining a chunk of plu- tonium or uranium, whose atoms have a unique tendency to split, giving off energy. One type of atomic bomb consists of a baseball-size piece of plutonium in the cen- ter of a large sphere of TNT, The bomb is triggered by setting off the outer surface of the TNT at approximately 100 points simul- taneously, thus producing an inward detona- tion wave that compresses the plutonium “a hep creates a “critical mass” that will '§ ina chain reaction, Hicials admit ilitary base ecurity lapses WASHINGTON (AP) — Military officials said yes- erday a reporter who entered nuclear compounds demonstrated serious security lapses, but insisted the eporter could not have sabotaged the hydrogen bombs he saw. : ‘Cox Newspapers reporter Joseph Albright told a Ouse subcommittee how he got near six hydrogen bombs by showing his own identification cards and laiming he was a defense contractor.

A source with knowledge of the incident said the bomber was on alert, holding Short Range At- tack Missiles with nuclear warheads, one of which also was tampered with in the incident, but not damaged. The source said it “looked like somebody beat on it with a hammer.”’ SAC headquarters in Qmaha, Neb., confirmed an incident had occurred at Robins AFB, about 15 miles south of Macon at Warner Robins, Ga., but would not confirm that a nuclear missile was in- volved. A spokesman said Air Force policy prohib- its either confirming or denying the location of nu- clear weapons. However, a high Air Force source at the Pentagon who knew of the vandalism did not dispute the version related to The Journai-Constitu- plane, there is little likelihood that it could be deto- mated by the kind of external damage reportedly done to it on the grounded plane, defense experts have said. . In any event, the incident raises further ques- tions about military security at SAC bases, as high- lighted in a series of articles published by Cox Newspapers last month. The base commander said, however, that the vandalism does not appear so far to be the result of any “outside threat.” - According to the official SAC version of the incident,- provided by Lt. Col. Larry Brown in a telephone interview from Omaha, the vandalism was discovered Friday morning by a crew from the 19th Bombardment Wing at Robins. “The damage was confined to some crew professional equipment being broken into; several flight publications were scattered in the cockpit, and minor damage was done to the aircraft’s elec- trical and hydraulic systems,” Brown said. tion on Saturday.

(Col. Leslie Candee, the Robins base commander, said safety procedures were tightened further immediately after the vandalism was discovered shortly after 8 a.m. Friday. . He said that is normal after any “perceived threat” to a military installation, but Candee would not confirm or deny that nuclear weapons are stored at his base. Although the investigation continued Saturday, Candee said there were “no indications of an outside threat” when asked if outsiders may have been involved, He said the incident was analogous to “kids’ pranks. . .

        "ocr_text": "Deadly nerve gas How safe are U.S. stockpiles from terrorists, accidents? First of a series By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service SALT LAKE CITY — From an overlook on a public road near here, a visitor — or a terrorist scout — can gaze across two miles of sagebrush and see 160-gallon spray tanks of nerve gas lined up behind the fence ofa desolate Army depot. Bizarre as it may seem, the Army’s public rela- tions staff allows cameramen to Dhhieeapi this open-air nerve gas stockpile at the same time that : a anes ia fecante eazien committee is about weakne : Ses against terrorists, me pon ian Given the continuing vulnerability of the 15-acre field of nerve gas cannisters, it would not be re- sponsible to publish its exact location in the Utah desert. But it is hardly a secret. Tn December, NBC’s Today Show identified the - base by name and showed a film of its mile-long rows of chemical containers stretching toward the horizon. There is an office building here where anyone can see an unclassified Army map that pinpoints the nerve gas storage yard with 100-foot accuracy, Terrorism is not the only risk. A light plane could cause a devastating accident here because, despite repeated Army requests, the Federal Aviation Administration refuses to ban planes from flying over the depot, as well as over a simi- lar open storage site in Maryland. And only last month, Utah Gov. Scott Matheson expressed fear the nerve gas depot might be on the edge of an earthquake fault zone. By Army calculations, one 105-millimeter nerve gas shell — the size of a wine bottle — could under “worst-case’’ atmospheric conditions cause fairly widespread death as far as 4,300 feet downwind. If a 160-gallon nerve gas container spilled its con- tents on the desert, it could kill people 22 miles away depending on weather conditions, In many ways, the job of providing 24-hour secu- rity for chemical weapons compounds is just as vi- tal — and just as boring — as the task of guarding nuclear weapons’ sites. The difference is that the locations of Army chemical depots in nine states are public knowledge. Also, the physical security arrangements are not as sophisticated. For the last three years, the Army has been working on plans to eliminate the hazards of stor- ing nerve gas in open-air stockpiles or in thin- walled sheds. A $55-million construction program to install stouter fences and provide safe earth- covered bunkers, called “igloos,” is under way at seven of the nine domestic Army chemical-stor- age sites. ; But a Cox Newspapers investigation has uncov- ered a variety of bureaucratic impediments, man- power shortages and misunderstandings that are combining to delay dealing with these acknowl- edged security flaws. Although the Army issued a tougher security regulation covering chemical de- See GAS, Alb cles GAS pots two years ago, it will be 1980 before alt of its provisions are met. HAUNTED BY VISIONS of World War I gas at- tacks, the Army has been storing approximately 20,600 tons of nerve gas in munitions and bulk con- taimers since the 1950s as an \"‘insurance policy” against a chemical barrage by the Russian Army in Europe. Since the time of President Franklin Roesevelt’s successful policy of building a gas ar- senal, which avoided chemical warfare in World War II, all succeeding presidents have approved of the Army’s chemical stockpiles. UNDER A 1969 TREATY, the United States and the Soviet Union destroyed their even more lethal germ and biological toxin weapons. Since then, American and Russian negotiators have been meeting annually in Geneva, Switzerland, trying to agree on a similar treaty to destroy all chemi- cal weapons. While both sides say they agree in principle, the talks have been snagged on the issue of on-site inspections In mid-1975, as a result of increasing terrorism around the world, the Army decided it could not afford to wait for a deal in Geneva. OVER THE NEXT six months, the U.S. Army Physical Security Review Board compiled an inch-thick classified study of security defects at a Utah base near here and eight smaller chemical storage bases in other states, The pe ou was approved by the Army chief of staff in January 1976, but because of delays in the government budget cycle, the findings were not reported to the key congressional committees un- tilearly 1977. From Al AT ONE HEARING last year, Rep. John P Murtha, D-Pa., amember of the House Appropria- tions Committee, was aghast to learn that at some bases chemical munitions are being stored behind ordinary five-foot barbed-wire fences. Nerve gas was discovered by German scientists in the mid-1930s. It is an organic chemical that kills people within minutes of exposure by attack- ing a human enzyme that permits one nerve to transmit signals to another. One variety of nerve gas, GB, is packed in liquid form but evaporates like water when released. The other variety, VX, is a molasseslike liquid that can contaminate an area for about a month, causing deaths by pene- trating clething. GB and VX are odorless. ONE GOOD WHIFF of nerve gas causes a runny nosé¢, tightness in the chest, dimmed vision, diffi- cult breathing, drooling, sweating, nausea, vomit ing, cramps, twitching, jerking, staggering, a headache, confusion, drowsiness, convulsions, and shortly death. To determine how careful the Army is with its nerve gas stockpile, this reporter arranged to visit three seldom-seen chemical depots in Alabama, Colorado and here in Utah ONE FINDING at every stop was that security is better than a year ago. Guard forces have been increased by 50 percent. Heavy concrete blocks are being installed in front of the chemical storage bunkers. In most places, chemical storage build- ings can no longer be opened by a single key, Even so, the present state of security at two of the three bases — those in Utah and Colorado — did not inspire confidence Warning sign at Army nerve gas depot in Utah ¢ Under a federal health-related law, the Ar- my distributes unclassified maps of its chemical storage sites, which seem to make them visible from the air or, in some cases, from the highway. Commanders of the three Army depots said they aren't comfortable about disseminating this kind of information, but insist the Army had no choice under the law. But in Washington, federal officials responsible for this health program say the Ar- my’s disclosure is unnecessary. The Pentagon could have kept the maps secret merely by asking to have them declared classified, it was explained. « At an Army depot near Denver, 900:“‘We- teye’’ nerve gas bombs are stored in corrugated metal sheds whose roofs can be seen from the win- dow of an airliner landing at Denver's Stapleton Airport. Next to the storage site is a tower contain- ing 80 sensors that is supposed to help the guards keep intruders from penetrating the much-publi- cized ‘‘Weteye”’ site. Unfortunately, the sensor tower is useless because the Army has not ob- tained some necessary spare parts. OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE for security are not eager to call attention to the presence of nerve gas depots. At the same time, the Army sees a bureau- cratic need to build popular support for new chem- jleal programs such as the “‘binary.”’ Se chemical bases are opened to the press and secrecy restrictions are removed from virtually all aspects of nerve gas storage operations. bi» one —_ ask: when it = the public con a of nerve gas depots, c haves right not to know?

        "ocr_text": "re merwve gas shells really missing? Second of two parts By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service WASHINGTON — A series of sus- Picious incidents at Army nerve gas depots two missing’ nerve gas weapons, an alleged criminal cover- up and an Army captain’s offer to sell a ton of nerve gas to FBI under- cover agents — have lied to a high- level Army decision to spend up to $38 million to count the entire U.S. chemical warfare inventory. “\"‘We are 99.9 percent sure no nerve gas has been stolen,’”’ one Army offi- cer told Cox Newspapers. “‘But it sure makes us look bad.’*’ The little-known discovery two years ago that a 105-millimeter nerve gas shell is gone without ex- lanation from an Army depot in tah is believed to have triggered the Army’s decision to ask Congress to fund the unprecedented item-by- item survey. ONE DAY IN October 1976, work- ers restacking chemical munitions at the Utah site found that three met- al straps on one box had been bro- ken. One of the 24 shells inside the box had been removed, and no re- cords could be found to indicate why. As of last week, the Army still had no idea where it is. The absent round contains about one meest of nerve gas. Such a shell coul cause fairly widespread deaths from nerve poisoning as far as 4,300 feet downwind. The shell, produced in 1957, was stored in Utah in a comcrete block warehouse with a thin corrugated metal door. The building is inside a security fence. *“The rigid security system ... makes it highly unlikely that anything but an inventory re- cord error can explain the ere. ancy,.”” an Army spokesman said last week. LAST SUMMER, officials at the depot near Salt lake City made an- other startling discovery in another warehouse a few hundred yards away. Fearing an upcoming inspection, an unnamed depot employee broke down and confessed to his supervi- sor that in 1976 he and several other workers had painted 24 empty shells to look like nerve gas shells. They then sneaked the 24 dummy shells into a nerve gas warehouse to cover up what they thought was a 24-round inventory shortage. Arm officials confirmed last week that as a result of the incident the FBI has been called in to investi- gate a possible ‘‘fraud against the government.”\" HOWEVER, A preliminary Army inquiry indicates that the ‘‘missing’” 24 rounds were never produced and that the problem was a bookkeeping discrepancy. An even more troubling incident, which has not been fully investigat- ed, was the arrest last summer of then-Army Capt. Gregory Alberico, who at the time was administrative officer of a nerve gas depot near Denver. Alberico was charged with selling Army plastic explosives to FBI undercover men. FBI videotapes run at his trial in federal court in December showed him selling 375 pounds of C-4 high-in- tensity ee explosives to an FBI agent. e was convicted of selling the explosives and sentenced to 20 eae: He is out on bail, pending ap- peal. DURING A RAMBLING negotia- tion, Alberico twice offered to sell the fake ‘‘fences’’ a one-ton contain- er of nerve gas, according to the vi- deotapes. Alberico bragged that he had access to a master Key that opened virtually every lock on the heavily guarded arsenal. After Alberico’s arrest, Army offi- cials pointed out that no one-ton con- tainers of nerve gas are stored at the arsenal. The oniy nerve gas on the remises was in 9300 ‘‘Weteye’”’ ombs that are tocked in metal sheds inside a high-security zone of the base. And none was missing, offi- cials insisted. But Army documents show that mine months before Alberico’s offer to sell nerve gas, arsenal employees discovered an a arent shortage of one 1,000-pound -34 nerve gas clus- ter bomb. After a three-week Army imquiry, the loss was written off as an unexplained inventory error. THE ARMY TEAM which investi- gated that discrepancy was appoint- ed by Alberico. The Army investigators, all from Rocky Mountain Arsenal, reported that three separate inventory teams counted the arsenal’s supply of M-34 cluster bombs in 1973 because the weapon had been declared obsolete and was due to be destroyed in the arsenal’s ‘‘demilitarization”’ plant. The three teams agreed that the arsenal had 21,115 0f the bombs. However, three years later, work- ers finished demilitarizing the bombs and found, to their surprise, that only 21,114 bombs had been de- stroyed. The Army investigators sought but could not find an extra bomb. They also examined files to see if one bomb might have been shipped elsewhere. But they could find no ev- idence of that.

        "ocr_text": "SAC Nuclear Security Hiked Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Air Force said yes- terday it has adopted new security procedures to keep imposters from entering nuclear weapons storage sites as a result of a Cox Newspapers series last month which highlighted the risk of terrorist attacks. Air Force spokesman Col. Robert Hermann said also that ‘‘where feasible,’ the construction of anti-terrorist barriers at nuclear weapons sites is being accelerated because of disclosures in the articles. These changes resulted from a five-week in- vestigation by the Strategic Air Command (SAC) into why Cox Newspapers reporter Joseph Albright was able to talk his way past the guards of two SAC hydrogen bomb storage sites in December by posing as a fencing con- tractor. Hermann said an Air Force investigation into those incidents has led to the following actions: @ Bidding procedures have been revised to make sure that only bona fide contractors and suppliers can obtain blueprints of nuclear weapons storage sites. The new procedures are aimed at keeping phony contractors — like Al- bright — from buying these blueprints by mail- ing a nominal sum to the Army Corps of En- gineers. e@ Potential bidders on nuclear weapons storage sites are being more thoroughly screened, and the size of each ee of prospec- tive contractors touring a site is now limited to six persons or less. @ Within the limits of the existing defense budget, the Air Force has ordered a speed-up in the design and siting of pending improvements in security systems at nuclear weapons storage depots, e@ The Air Force will ask congressional per- mission to ‘‘re-program’’ funds to support the installation of sophisticated electronic sensors at certain SAC nuclear weapons sites. @ Guards at nuclear weapons depots are be- ing equipped with metal detectors to assist in searching contractors and other visitors. The Air Force refused to release its 145- page investigative report on Albright’s unautho- rized visits. The report, compiled by Brig. Gen. Patrick Halloran, SAC inspector general, is clas- sified ‘‘confidential,’’ Hermann said. According to Hermann, the investigation concluded that Albright’s covert visits had not actually compromised any ‘classified defense information’’ or posed any risk to nuclear weapons, “Mr. Albright was properly escorted and un- der surveillance of armed security personnel at all times when he was in or near sensitive re- source areas,’’ Hermann said. Turn to SAC, Aé SAC From Page | Nevertheless, two officials at one SAC base were formally admonished for ailowing Albright to tour a nucle- ar weapons site without showing any credentials as a contractor and with- out having his briefcase searched, it was disclosed.

Cox Jr., Chairman 1957-1974 ° Tom Wood President Jack Tarver Publisher Hal Gulliver Editor Edward Sears Managing Editor PAGE 4-A, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1978 Tighter Security Reporter Joseph Albright of this news- paper’s Washington bureau produced a startling series of investigative articles re- cently that indicated our security of nu- clear weapons is inadequate, at best. Albright, posing as a contractor inter- ested in bidding on construction, talked his way past guards at two Air Force hydro- gen bomb facilities last December. Later he wrote how he obtained easy entry to the sites and gave some other discomfort- ing insights into lax security around nu- clear weapons’ facilities. Now comes the Air Force announcing new and tougher security regulations for nuclear storage sites. Most of the new regulations are classified, as they should be. But among those made public are specific instructions aimed at keeping out imposters and getting positive identifica- tion from persons who claim to have a le- gitimate need to enter to Air Force areas where nuclear bombs may be kept. It is high time the Air Force and other agencies concerned with handling nuclear devices sit up and take notice of the need for super security of those potentially awful machines. In this age of terrorism in which any number of bands of international gang- sters would like nothing better than to seize a nuclear weapon, matters involving guarding such weapons and staving off terrorism can not be overemphaszied. Luckily, the last known imposter to ‘infiltrate a storage area for nuclear weap- ons was a newspaper reporter named AlI- bright whose principal mission was to write an account of his exploits. We may not be so fortunate with the next success- ful imposter. He may have quite a differ- ent mission. It is good to know that the Air Force took action in the wake of Albright’s reve- lations.

        "ocr_text": "Colonel’s Daughter Accused Mother Denies Charge Girl Vandalized B-52 By Frederick Allen and Joseph Albright Journai-Constitution Staff Writers The 20-year-old enlisted woman charged with vandalizing a B-52 bomber at Robins Air Force Base is the daugh- ter of the bomb squadron’s operations officer. According to her mother, she is innocent of the charges. Airman 1st Class Catherine A. Cain, 20, of the 19th Organizational Mainte- nance Squadron, was charged under military law Friday with “willful dam- age” to government property and with charges related to alleged drug use. The Strategic Air Command B-52, reportedly combat-ready and armed with nuclear weapons, was discovered damaged on Feb. 2. The charges included an allegation that Airman Cain broke and removed “four seals to the manual special weap- ons terminal handle” on the plane. “Spe- cial weapon” is military jargon for a nu- clear bomb or missile. The Air Force would not provide a description of the equipment involved. A SAC spokesman, Lt. Col. Larry Brown, said: “Exact details on the manual spe- cial weapon terminal handles and their role in the weapon-release system are classified.” Officials said the Air Force was still investigating whether Airman Cain might have been seeking access to a nuclear weapon. However, an Air Force source said there was ‘no evidence of any damage “to a nuclear weapon due to vandalism.” Lt. Col. James E. Cain, director of operations for SAC’s 28th bomb squad- ron at Robins, confirmed that Miss Cain is his daughter but refused to discuss the matter. “I just can’t talk about it at this time,” he said. “I just can’t do it.” However, the young woman’s mother said her daughter had nothing to do with the vandalism. ‘“‘The, whole thing’s absolutely ridiculous,” said Mrs. Cain. Mrs. Cain said she was not at liberty to discuss details but added: “I’m not going to watch my daughter be hung for something she didn’t do. There’s no way they can put this on her.” See ROBINS, Page 4-A —Robins Continued from Page 1-A She said her daughter, who has been in the Air Force about a year, has had no emotional problems. “They've had no problems with her,” Mrs. Cain said. “She’s been perfectly happy here.” She said she would issue a full statement “in a couple of days” if the charges are not cleared up. Miss Cain, who lives with her par- ents, could not be reached for comment. Mrs. Cain said her daughter had been told by Air Force officials not to discuss the matter. However, she quoted her daughter as saying, “I didn’t do any- thing. There’s no problem.” When the B-52 was discovered van- dalized earlier this month, knowledge- able sources said it was on alert and was armed with short-range attack mis- siles with nuclear warheads. It was reported that one of the warheads ap- peared to have been damaged. An Air Force source said Friday that it has since been concluded that the damage came from rough handling dur- ing loading, and predated the vandalism incident. Miss Cain, an assistant crew chief, is undergoing an “Article 32” investiga- tion, which is similar to a grand jury investigation, a SAC spokesman said from headquarters in Omaha, Neb. He said the investigation under Article 32 of the Uniform Code of the Uniform Code of Military Justice will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to refer the case for trial by court-martial or a lesser action. Airman Cain has been relieved of her normal duties, the spokesman said, but was reassigned to administrative duties and has not been confined. He said she is one of 115,000 mili- tary personnel with access to nuclear weapons under a “Human Reliability Program” which involves a formal screening process.

        "ocr_text": "entagon Wi Use Depletec Uranium or Making Armor-Piercing Bullets BY JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has found a use for one of its mildly radioactive nuclear waste products: It is about to make more than 1,000,000 armor-piercing bullets out of de- pleted uranium. Known as “kinetic energy penetrators,” the new uranium bullets will be designed to burn holes through a foot of steel armor or knock enemy missiles out of the sky. Depleted uranium is a weak source of radioactivity, but that is not why it is being used in bullets. Its chief advantage, according to Pentagon weapons designers, is that it is ex- tremely heavy and cheap. Officials acknowlege they could have substituted a non- radioactive heavy metal such as tungsten. But as Navy spo- kesperson Sue Fili explained, “Depleted uranium is preferred because it is available in excess and is therefore inexpen- sive.” Tungsten has to be imported. A soldier inside an Army tank armed with uranium bul- lets will be exposed to as much as two-tenths of a millirem of. gamma radiation every hour, according to Darwin Taras, an Army expert on depleted uranium wea 5 A Food and Drug Administration redeatine authority said that at this millirem dosage, tank crews will receive the ont nart of one well-administered chest X-ray every 20 to ours. This dosage is permissible but not desirable under cur- rent radiological health standards for civilians, according to a half-dozen radiation experts outside the Pentagon. The depleted uranium bullets will go into production at a time when congressional committees have shown increasing concern about possible long-range cancer and birth-defect risks from low-level radiation. One of the Army tank bullets will be about the size of an extra-large cigar and weigh up. to eight pounds. When it slams into its target, the uranium catches fire and sears through steel like a white-hot magnesium flare. “This is one advantage of using uranium over tungsten — it gets so hot that it causes any diesel fuel vapors in an enemy tank to explode,” said Taras. In addition to the Army tank shells, the Navy is in the final stages of developing a radar-guided gattling gun known as the Phalanx system that will spew out bullets fashioned from spent uranium at incoming missiles. ‘ Each of the Navy’s bullets will be about the size of a 20- gauge shotgun shell and will contain three ounces of uranium. Officials said the Army will begin producing 730,000 of the uranium tank bullets next January, as the c ation of a $7 million research and development project. The Navy said it plans to procure at least 250,000 of the bullets starting this year so it can begin installing Phalanx gattling guns on all its carriers, cruisers and destroyers. Depleted uranium is that portion of the metal left behind after the more valuable U-235 isotope has been extracted to make nuclear fuel rods or atomic weapons. Depleted uranium, which is the slightly heavier and more common uranium isotope known as U-238, cannot sustain a nuclear chain reaction. Since the atomic program began during World War II, the government has accumulated about 200,000 tons of de- pleted uranium at its huge gaseous diffusion plants in Ports- mouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Paducah, Ky. It is stored in barrels in the form of a metalic salt. At a House hearing last month, Dr. Karl Z. Morgan of Georgia Tech estimated that one extra case of cancer will result whenever a population of 10,000 people is exposed to an average of 1,000 millirems of radioactivity. To absorb that much radioactivity from depleted uranium bullets, Army tank crews would theoretically have to remain inside their tanks for about 5,000 hours, experts estimated. Army tanks carry live ammunition inside the crew com- nt when deployed in West Germany, but in this coun- , tank ammunition is stored in depots. Officials in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said the depleted uranium bullets would not be radioactive enough to be considered a “radiological weapon.

Some parcel post schedules have already been slowed, “WE ARE SPENDING too much money trying to meet impossible service standards that nobody really wants or needs,” William F, Bolger, the new postmas- ter general, said in an interview with Cox News: papers. Bolger said his deputies are now analyzing first class mail service patterns between 77 major cities to identify low volume routes where two-day delivery standards are not being consistently met. In cases caused by air transportation bottlenecks or other schedule difficulties, these “unrealistic” two-day mail routes will be converted into “reliable” three-day delivery zones, Bolger said. James Jeilison, the assistant postmaster general in charge of mail processing, estimated that about | per cent of the 56 billion letters handled annually by the Postal Service will be slowed by the new schedule. ON A NATIONWIDE basis, said Jellison, mai! service should improve. “Where standards are adjusted, actual delivery time will in most cases not change,” he said. “In cases where we go from two-day to three-day, we also ex- pect that this will free up time and manpower and enable us to improve our performance on local over- night and remaining second day mail.” For example, a letter from Miami to Dayton is now scheduled to be delivered two days after it is mailed. Because of airline schedules, mail between these points often arrives too late to be sorted without delaying other mail. Therefore, said Jellison, Miami to Dayton is one candidate for conversion to a three-day schedule. : Bolger, the first career postal employe to become Postmaster General since 1947, said no changes will be made without his personal approval. He said the new schedule will go into effect in about three months. “I THINK PEOPLE are looking for consistency in their mail service, not necessarily speed,\" said Bolger. “There is no sense in kidding ourselves and the public about standards we cannot reliably make.” Bolger said many of these “unrealistic.” two day service commitments were adopted by the Postal Service in 1975, as part of its justification for eliminat- ing air mail service. “What we are trying to do now is correct the error of our ways,” said Bolger, who was head of the New York regional office of the Postal Service when alr mail was dropped. In a related move, the Postal Service has already put into effect a new parce! post schedule that slows deliveries of packages between some cities, The new schedule, which was instituted two months ago with no announce ment, means that a package mailed from Dayton to New York City is due to arrive in five days rather than four. However, pack- ages from Dayton to other cities move on the same schedule, BOLGER, APPOINTED by the Postal Service board of governors after serving two years as deputy postmaster general, becomes the nation’s chief mail man at a difficult time.

By contrast, all 256 properly sealed envelopes ar- rived within a week, whether zip-coded or not, * Letters sent to business addresses often take longer than residential mail — that is, unless the sender includes the firm’s complete address, including postal box number, on the outside of the envelope, In some instances, delays In business mail are caused by inefficient handling by the businesses rather than any Postal Service ineptitude. On balance, the Cox mail survey sug gests that mall travels faster than many skeptics belleve — but not as swiftly as postal publicists contend, The Postal Service says it provides overnight delivery for 95 per cent of all local mail, For most metropolitan areas, local mail means letters that travel up to 150 miles, In the Cox mail test, 10 of 12 properly sealed and zip-coded letters actually ar- rived in one day when mailed to local How the mail test was done by newspapers Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau To test the performance of the Postal Service Cox Newspapers em- ployes in eight cities mailed a total of 336 letters on various Monday morn- ings over the last two months, Each participant in the mail experl- ment mailed four batches of letters, each consisting of one letter to each of the other participants plus one to him or herself. The first batch contained properly zip coded letters mailed to home ad- dresses. The second batch was identical except that zip codes were omitted. The third group of letters carried special delivery stamps. The fourth set bore first class postage and zip codes, but were addressed to the street addresses of downtown businesses, the newspapers partici- pating In the test, After the test began, it turned out that 80 of the envelopes were not sealed before they were mailed. In these instances, the results were disregarded, and new letters were mailed. The participants in the Cox mail survey were; Allanta Journal, John York; Austin American Statesman, Jeff Bruce and Carole Orsak; Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau, Helen McMaster and Barbara Waide- lich; Dayton Daily News, Mrs, Rita Stanton; Mesa Tribune, Mrs. John Emig and Mrs. Bob Shirley; Miami News, Ms, Jacque Parsons; Palm Beach Post, Jeff Kahn; Waco Tribune Herald, Clarence Welkel. home addresses, Two others took two days. BOTH LETTERS HELD over an extra day were discovered to have been post- marked one day late, in an apparent breach of Postal Service regulations, These instances of delayed postmarks occurred in Mesa, Ariz., and Waco, Tex, Outside the overnight delivery zone, currrent Postal Service standards call for delivery within two days up to about 600 miles, and no more than three-day delivery elsewhere in the na- tion. Last year, 91 per cent of all letters were delivered within these two-day and three-day standards, according to Postal Service statistics, The Cox mail test found that 47 out of 42 zip-coded letters (or 88 per cent) ar rived at homes in other cities within the two-day and three-day Postal Service norms, Mail deliveries to downtown business addresses in the same cities were more erratic — probably because the test let- ters were sent to street addresses of the businesses and not to designated post office box numbers, IN THE OVERNIGHT delivery zone, seven out of 12 business letters arrived In one day, Within the two-day and three-day zones, 25 out of 52 letters ar- rived on schedule, The worst performance of all in- volved a batch of eight letters mailed to various business addresses on a Monday morning from a mailbox in downtown Miami, Six of the eight letters arrived at least a day behind Postal Service standards, It took two days for one letter to travel to the Miami Post Office, back to the Miami News, through the newspaper's mail room, and onto the desk of the recipient, . A letter to a business address in Palm Beach, about 60 miles away, also took two days, It took four days for one of these letters to arrive in Atlanta, SIMILARLY POOR results occurred with eight business letters mailed in Palm Beach on the same Monday, A let- ter sent to a Palm Beach address arrived overnight, as scheduled, But five of the seven letters addressed to other cities arrived at least a day behind schedule, wrong, directing the letter erroneously to Columbia, S.C. Six days after it was mailed, the letter finally arrived at the correct destination. The speediest of the elght post offices in the survey was In Austin. Others which provided relatively quick service were the Dayton and Atlanta post of- ~ fices, Those where mail was not so 5 F HAVING cancelled and the letter evidently was t seeing the Waco letter without a zip code, the clerk should have punched a button to route it to a special bin for manual sorting. Instead, the clerk who processes letters at a steady rate of one a second guessed at the’ Waco zip code, But the clerk guessed swift included Miami, West Palm Beach, Waco, Mesa and Washington, THE COX SURVEY was too small a sample to provide a scientifically rell- able reading on the 90 billion pieces of mail which pass thrugh the Postal Serv- ice each year. However, the sample was probably large enough to cause some valid second thoughts on the value of special deliv- ery stamps, Which are supposed to pro- vide priority service to customers who are willing to pay the extra $1.25, For letters bound for Miami or Atlanta, special delivery turned out to be a big time saver.

        "ocr_text": "U.S. contractor sold public perilous radioactive scrap JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Washington Bureau LYNCHBURG, Va. — A contractor who makes nuclear fuel rods for the Navy accidently sold to a junk dealer two tons of scrap steel that contained dangerous residues of bomb-grade ura- nium. The residues were the most highly ra- dioactive ever accidentally released under the 35-year-old government atomic program, a Department of Ener- gy spokesman said. Cox Newspapers has determined that hunks of uranium-tainted scrap were given to plant employes, who took them home and cut up pieces with welding torches in backyard do-it-yourself pro- jects. When an inspector from the Atlanta office of the Nuclear Regulatory Com- mission discovered the contamination four months later, radioactive metal was found in a house, a garage, a gaso- line station and a logging truck. Highly enriched uranium can be han- dled with gloves without harm. But if a particle is inhaled or ingested, it can cause bone, kidney or lung cancer. Five pieces of steel retrieved in the urgent, unpublicized uranium hunt turned out to be highly radioactive, Douglas Collins, the regulatory commis- sion inspector, said in an interview. He ordered the cleanup last September after learning the plant's radiation me- ters for measuring surface contamina- tion had been ‘‘inoperative.” Decontamination teams recovered one gram of bomb-grade uranium, about the weight of three aspirins, Collins es- timated. He said there was no evidence more uranium-bearing scrap was missing. To make sure, workmen removed 50 tons of metal and dirt from the junkyard and partially dismantled the house of a plant employe. In all, 25 pieces were found to be at least mildly contaminated. A Department of Energy radiation ex- pert estimated one gram of highly en- riched uranium, if ingested, is 2,000 times the annual permissible radioactive body burden for an individual. Im the several ‘‘hottest’’ spots on the recovered scrap, Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors measured 200,000 atomic disintegrations per min- ute on a 100-square centimeter area. That is 40 times the surface contamina- tion allowed outside a nuclear plant. A spokesman for the regulatory com- mission and officials of Babcock & Wil- cox Inc., which operates the plant under contracts from Adm. Hyman Rickover’s Division of Naval Reactors, said there Was no sign anyone was injured by harmful radiation in the incident. A Cox Newspapers reporter took a Geiger counter to the junkyard last week and found radiation measured three times the natural background level at the spot where the uranium- contaminated scrap had been removed. Even so, the radiation now at the site, 0.3 milliroentgens per hour, is not enough to be considered harmful. “‘Whatever we had, it’s all gone now,”’ said Larry Moore, manager of the Metco Metals Inc. junkyard. He let a re- porter and photographer wander among acres of twisted metal accummulated from nearby industrial plants. However, his superior, Dave Smith, evicted the visitors, threatening to call police. Smith had a roll of film confis- cated. “Anything that could hurt our business, I am not going to allow,” he said. Documents at regulatory commission headquarters in Washington say it is re- motely possible some contaminated scrap might have been sold to unknown customers between last May, when it Was purchased from Babcock & Wilcox, and September, when the decontamina- tion teams arrived. According to the documents, junk- ard employes told investigators that Cox News Service Reporter Joseph Albright checks radiation level in Lynchburg, Va., junkyard and finds it’s triple normal during that time the “hot” scrap re- mained in one pile, awaiting shipment to a recycling plant. But a commission inspection report added: ‘‘During these interviews, it was revealed that although there had been no sales of large quantities of (Babcock & Wilcox) scrap, there existed a remote possibility that some of the stainless steel scrap could have been sold to indi- viduals.”* Rickover and 350 subordinates in the Division of Naval Reactors, a unit in the newly formed Department of Energy, declined repeated requests for an inter- view. Dr. John Ewing, the Babcock & Wil- cox official in charge of the Lynchburg plant, said Rickover's aides had been “exceedingly displeased’’ that contami- mated scrap was allowed out of the Plant. While the exact nature of the work at the 525-acre plant is classified, it is known to make fuel rods for Navy nu- clear carriers, cruisers and submarines from highly enriched uranium produced by other government facilities. Babcock & Wilcox is licensed to keep up to 55,000 pounds of highly enriched urani- um at the Lynchburg plant — theoreti- cally enough to make more than 2,000 atomic bombs. As pieced together from interviews and documents on file at the regulatory commission, here is how thee incident occurred: About six years ago, Babcock & Wil- cox tore down a small uranium scrap recovery building. The steel beams and other metal components were stored in a nearby fenced area because some piec- es were too “‘hot”’ to be released to the public or used elsewhere. The radioac- tivity was largely in tiny flecks of en- riched uranium that had been stuck to the steel by several layers of paint. g plant managers decided to get rid of the steel because it was an eyesore. ‘“‘We are very proud of the ap- pearance of our plant, and anything that is not orderly, we want out,” Ewing said. Because of what a regulatory com- mission inspection report describes as “ambiguous” instructions, a factory ra- diation technician let the scrap be re- leased without it being thoroughly checked for radioactivity. The plant's portable radiation counters that would have caught the contamination were broken at the time. Under a company policy, at least eight employes were allowed to take home pieces that had been cleared for release. One employe put four contaminated steel I beams into the structure of his new house. Another used three I beams to support a gasoline station canopy. A third used several pieces of angle iron to strengthen the frame of his logging truck. Three factory employes told investi- gators they used welding torches on the contaminated metal, which could have spread particles into the air. Shortly after the welding, two of the three workers took medical tests aimed at detecting uranium as part of the plant’s routine health program. The tests showed “no significant amount of uranium,” regulatory commission docu- ments showed. The third worker who used a cutting torch on contaminated metal was not tested until September, when the nature of the released metal was discovered. Tests found no uranium in his body then, but it was not known whether any had passed through his body earlier. After the plant employes had chosen b & 3,750 pounds to Metco Metals, Spore eight miles away. Metco regularl Miami Pa about 50,000 pounds of scrap a year from the nuclear fuel factory. This was the first time scrap from a ‘“‘hot” area of the plant was sold, Ewing said. When Collins discovered the problem, plant employes rushed to the junkyard and brought back the original pile of scrap, along with about eight tons of other scrap metal stored nearby. A few days later, Collins visited the Metco yard and found two more pieces that contained uranium. One was a stainless steel pipe with particles of ura- nium dust inside. Collins ordered anath- er, more drastic decontamination in which 42 more tons of material was re- moved. “We forced them into taking more ef- forts than they thought necessary,” Col- lins said. When the pile of contaminated steel was returned, it weighed 3,700 pounds, 50 pounds less than had been measured on the scrapyard's scales four months earlier. But Ewing insisted the 50-pound discrepancy was the result of **measure- ment uncertainties,’’ not missing scrap. In the scramble to decontaminate the sites where the radioactive scrap had been, plant teams let workers keep [ beams that had been used to support a gas station canopy and a garage floor, but only after the radioactive paint had been stripped away and the bare metal was found to be free of radiation. The logging truck, which had not been licensed for highway use, was towed to the plant and all radiation was removed. The regulatory commission cited Bab- cock & Wilcox for an infraction of its nuclear license but did not fine or penal- ize the firm. Company officials said the radiation technician who released the contaminated junk has been reprimand- Sr VTS \f"

        "ocr_text": "Nuclear plant seeped uranium into fishing streams JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service ERWIN, Tenn. — A Navy nuclear fuel factory last year gradually poured 250 pounds of enriched uranium into local fishing streams and scattered a light dusting of radioactive fallout on a nearby housing develap- ment. Water in a spring flowing from the factory grounds contained 700 times the natural background radiation in the area, A Cox’ Newspapers reporter scooped up a sample and sent it to the Nuclear Regulatory Commis- sion for testing at a government radiation lab in Idaho. A sample of muck from the bottom of the Noli- chucky River downstream from the plant contained — traces of radium, an intensively radioactive decay prod- uct of uranium. The radium could have resulted from the plant or from natural deposits of uranium or both. Last year, a Tennessee state fish hatchery, unaware of radioactive discharges, stocked 2 million baby wal- leyes n the Nolichucky several hundred yards down. stream: from the plant’s effluent discharge point. Local fisherinen also catch catfish, bass and a few trout near the plant. NRC officials in Washington confirmed the urani- um discharges. But they maintained the Erwin plant is not a health hazard because the uranium, which es- capes through the plant's filtration system, is “very ex- tensively diluted.” . Radium has been known to be a cancer-causing agent since the mid-1930s, when European doctors dis- covered a pattern of bone cancers among radium watch dial painters. One property of radium is that it tends to “go up the food chain” and accumulate in freshwater fish, government scientists say. Most of it concentrates in the fish bones, they said. NRC officials acknowledged that the NRC’s recent environmental assessment of the Erwin plant did not mention radium or include any tests on the radiation levels in local fish. They also acknowledged that Erwin’s ground water, only three feet below the bottom of the plant’s uranium settling ponds, never has been tested to see whether it contained radioactive contamination. Erwin residents get their drinking water from Cox News Service \" JOSEPH ALBRIGHT White-coated worker walks around Nuclear Fuel Services plant at Erwin, Tenn. mountain springs upstream from the plant. But Jones- boro, eight miles south, gets its drinking water from the Nolichucky, In theory, the 250 pounds of uranium washed down the Nolichucky last year was sufficiently enriched to make two crude atomic explosives, according to a doc- ument in the NRC public document room in Washing- ton. The factory here plays a critical role in processing highly enriched uranium for fuel for Adm. Hyman Rickover’s Division of Naval Reactors. It is owned and operated by Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Getty Oil Co. Rickover declined to be interviewed about the Erwin operation. Responding to a written question on the uranium effluents, a Rickover spokesman said: “Safe levels for discharge of nuclear materials to the environment are established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and are not the responsibility of Adm. Rickover.” Although no local annoucement has been made, documents on file with the NRC establish that th plant has been discharging about 50,000 gallons o waste water a day that contains a few parts per million of enriched uranium. Disclosure of these discharges, which have con- tinued for two decades with the permission of the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor agency, the NRC, comes at a time of a widespread scientific controversy about whether low levels of radiation can cause cancer. Perhaps by chance, the rate of reported cancer deaths in Unicoi County, which includes Erwin, is about twice as high as it was shortly before the open- ing of the nuclear fuel processing plant here in 1957. The figures for Unicoi were assembled by Cox Newspapers with the help of a government cancer ex- pert after B.E. Wilson Jr., manager of a local fish hatchery, said in an offhand remark: “My wife and I have been wondering about the number of cancer deaths in the area. It has jumped more than we have ever known before.” Miami News - April 29, 1978 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Carter orders big buildup in nuclear arms By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — President Carter has approved military re- quests for a speedup in the produc- tion of nuclear warheads while pressing for a strategic arms limita- tion agreement with the Soviet Union. A recently declassified House hearing disclosed that the Depart- ment of Energy is seeking funds to expand a nuclear warhead factory in Amarilo, Tex., so it can produce “many new weapons designs, run- ning concurrently with relatively high numbers of units” over the next five years. TO GENERATE enough plutonium and tritium for the new warheads, the government will have to run its three production reactors at Savan- nah River, S.C., near Augusta, at full capacity starting Oct. 1. This year, one of the Savannah River reactors is idle and the other two are operating at partial capacity. Government witnesses said these increases in the annual $1.5-billion Department of Energy weapons budget were necessary because of decisions by Mr. Carter last Decem- ber in the annual secret Presidential Weapons Stockpile Paper. In a subsequent interview, a high- level Carter official said the in- creased rate of warhead production largely reflects an earlier decision during the Nixon administration to deploy multiple independently tar- geted warheads on intercontinental missiles. Another factor was Mr. A < SUMMARY — At President Cart- er's order, the Department of Energy is seeking to expand produc- tion of materials needed to produce nuclear weapons. ; The increased production reflects an earlier decision during the Nixon administration to deploy multiple independently targeted warheads on intercontinental missiles, It also re- flects Mr. Carter's decision to de- ploy the cruise missile. Neither kind of weapon is covered by the SALT agreement, There still has been no decision to go ahead with production of the neutron bomb. Carter's decision last summer to de- ploy the drone-like cruise missile. The official said the higher num- bers of U.S. warheads would be per- missible under the strategic arms limitation treaty that is now in the final stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union. The reason, he ex- _ plained, is that the treaty only puts a ceiling on each side’s inventories of bombers and missiles but does’ not restrict the numbers of war- heads each launcher can carry. ~ MR. CARTER APPROVED six new warheads for production in the coming fiscal year. The new models are: ® Mark 12-A, a multiple warhead with increased explosive yield for Minuteman missiles now poised in silos in the western United States, See CARTER, Page 5, Carter orders more Continued from Page 1. * An eight-inch atomic artillery projectile, a tacti- cal weapon designed to replace older atomic shells de- ployed in western Europe. * A 155-millimeter atomic shell, which replaces a smaller Army nuclear shell that is reportedly consid- ered unreliable because of a suspected tendency to- ward “nuclear fizzles.\"’ * Nuclear tips for several thousand cruise missiles designed to ride in the bellies of B-52 bombers or wide-bodied transport jets in the 1980s. © W-81 “standard” warhead, an anti-aircraft mis- sile designed to protect Navy ships from high-altitude fighters. * A modified B-43 nuclear bomb for the Air Force, which would include certain safety features such as nuclear we apons an insensitive high-explosive trigger that was not in- cluded in earlier models. SO FAR, THE loudest congressional objection to Mr. Carter's weapons budget is that it did not give the green light to production of the neutron warhead, which had been proposed by the Pentagon as a tank- killing weapon for use in the event of a war in central Europe. A second weapons dispute has now broken out over his proposal to modify some of the 20-year-old B- 43 Air Force bombs in storage depots. The Air Force had sought a more advanced bomb design, known as the B-77, but Mr. Carter deferred its production last December and substituted the idea of modifying the B- 43 for budget reasons, Dayton Daily News - May 10, 1978 \f"

Both sought to shun publicity even though the bride’s uncle, President Jimmy Carter, flew in from Wash- ington qunday morning for the occasion. +1 See CARTER, Page 11-A —#Carter Continued From Page 1-A Immediately after the. ceremony in the backyard of Billy’s new house outside of Plains, a light thundershower dampened the guests, sending pastel-clad women scurrying to the shelter of the front porch. mr . About 20 carloads of guests, including two young women in the bridal party wearing green and yellow dresses, left the party during the rain. But it stopped after 15 minutes, and a rainbow a _ over Billy’s newly remodelled brown-and- white rambler. President Carter, his wife Rosalynn and their daughter Amy were evidently sheltered during the shower. Speaking briefly with reporters later, Mrs. Carter—without a hair out ~ place—said, “It was nice, I enjoyed it. I saw a lot of old Among the missing was state Sen. Hugh Carter, D- Plains, author of the recent book “Cousin Beedie and Cousin Hot,” which contains a potpourri of revelations about past tensions within the Carter clan. Billy Carter was quoted after ae of the book as calling his cousin Hugh “a self-made Hugh Carter was invited to the wedding, but a business associate at Carter’s Plains antique store said the senator was on a book-promotion trip in San Francisco. The president and his family left in the early evening, but most of Billy and Sibil Carter’s guests stayed on, taking in the country music by Tom T. Hall and his band. At one point, Sibil joined Hall in singing, “It May Be Peanuts To You, But It’s Love To Us.” Tables were piled high with shrimp, fried oysters, salmon mousse and other delicacies. Bottles of champagne rested on ice inside a large dinghy in Billy Carter’s backyard. Besides champagne, the chief libation was “Billy” beer. President Carter, his wife, and daughter Amy flew from Washington to Robins Air Force Base Sunday morning aboard Air Force One. State Sen. Ed Barker, D-Warner Robins, who greeted him at the ramp, said later that President Carter had de- scribed as “quite serious” the incident Saturday in which Amy was pushed by a Secret Service agent out of the path of a runaway elephant at a charity pet show in Washington. “The elephant almost got to her,” Carter said, according to Barker. The Carters flew from the air force base to Plains aboard a Marine helicopter. They skipped church, thus finess- ing the perennial question of which hometown Baptist church Carter prefers. In the afternoon, the president, his wife and his mother, Lillian, went fishing at the pond on Carter property which he made famous during the 1976 campaign by wading into and draining. bh: ‘ —— \f"

        "ocr_text": "Draft board just one ‘dinosaur’ in U.S. collection of agencies waiting in ‘deep standby posture’ By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT WASHINGTON — “We are,” Brodsky, am administrator of the Selective Service System, ‘‘in a deep standby posture.”” Like his 97 fellow workers, Brodsky comes to the office each day and works on how to run a draft system in World War III. That’s all the agency has left now that Pres- ident Ford cancelled the requirements for 18-year-olds to register. A visit to the agency’s modern offices overlooking the Capitol is a bit like listening toa 78 rpm record on slow speed. There is a large mail room but no mail. There is a workshop for making audio-visual aids, but no workers. There are perhaps a dozen $5,000 electronic memory typewriters with nothing to type. THE SELECTIVE SERVICE System is a member of a species which seems to thrive in Washington’s dank corridors: The dino- saur which refuses to die. The granddaddy of all the airborne dino- saurs was the nuclear-powered airplane, which was a congressional! favorite in the 1940s and early 1950s. It was given up as hopeless about 1960, partially because no one could figure out what would happen if a plane carrying a nuclear reactor happened to fallon a city. Like Lazarus, the nuclear-powered air- plane rose again in 1976 at Wright-Patter- son Air Force Base Near Dayton, Ohio. The Air Force awarded two research contracts totaling $150,000 to Lockheed and Westing- house to take another look at the feasibility of a nuclear plane. The contracts were successful but the plane wasn’t, said Dr. Larry W. Nogglie, an official at Wright-Patterson who supervised the contracts. Said Noggle: “Because of the energy crisis, we decided to take another look to see if the concept was now attractive, but it still looks pretty much out of reach. It is still too heavy, and the costs are horren- dous. It would cost us about $5.5 billion to develop the prototypes. The social and po- litical costs are terrific too.”’ The contracts ran out early this year and now the muclear plane is “pretty much dead,” said Noggle. Of course “pretty much dead” is still a curable illmess, and the nu-. clear plane may very well get another chance in the 1980s. ‘We look at this peri- odically, Noggle said.” “HARDLY ANYTHING is ever perma- nently shut off around here,’ laments Rep. Joseph Addabbo, D-N.Y., a long-time mem- ber of the House Appropriations Committee. “It may turm into a small stream or even a trickle, but it is always hoping to turn into a big river.”* Addabbo recalls with some pride that back in 1966, the committee succeeded in killing one commission left over from the THE DAW PON DAILY Civil War. This year, Addabbo asked some pointed questions about a survivor from a later era that many thought had been slain by Congress in 1975. Why, Addabbo wanted to know, was the Defense Department planning to spend $227 million next year for research on an anti- ballistics missle system? “The principal purposes of the program,” replied Dr. William Perry of the Defense Department, “are to maintain our techno- logical lead in ballistics missile defense and prevent technological surprise, to reduce de- ployment lead time - . . and to maintain theonly free-world center of excellence in ballistic missile defense technology.” Although the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in 1972 to abstain from de- ploying full ABM systems, the Joint Chiefs of Staff feel a necessity to keep ABM radar research alive at the massive concrete a complex on Kwajalein Atoll in the ic. The ABM is not the only technological _ marvel that was given up for dead too soon. THOSE WHO MOURNED the demise of the U.S. supersonic transport plane at the hands of a billion-dollar-pinching Congress in 1971 should take heart. Today the SST lives on in a wind tunnel at Langley Air Force Base, Va. This year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will award $15.1 mil- lion in research contracts to develop studies and wind tunnel models of an advanced ver- sion of the SST. The contractors include Boeing, Lockheed, and General Electric. “Significant progress has been made,”’ said a public relations man for NASA, which took the project over from the De- partment of Transportation several years ago. One purpose of the research, he said, is to achieve better “wing-body blending.” One way to do that is to design delta-shaped SSTs powered by engines which can change from “turbo-fan\" to “turbo-jet’” with the flick of a switch. While nobody is cranking up to build a real airplane, the ‘“‘concept’’ is “‘promising,’’ the NASA spokesman said. Next year, the oe budget is scheduled to rise to $15.9 on. For that matter, remember the B-1 bomber which President Carter got Con- gress to kill last summer? Dayton Daily News Production has been cancelled, but work on the four pretotypes will cost $297 mil lion over the next three years. The Senate Armed Services Committee, which wou like to see a new penetrating manned bomber despite Carter’s decision, recentl offered the Pentagon a shrewd suggestion i its report on the defense money bill. The idea: Change the name of the B-1 but keep the program going. THE HISTORY OF the neutron warhead is enough to give hope to any fallen technolog- ical marvel. The idea of a nuclear weapon that would kill by means of an intense burst of radia- tion flourished in government weapons labs in the 1950s. Originally conceived as a bomb, the neutron weapon was on the verge of being produced in the early 1960s until President Kennedy cancelled it when it be- came an impediment to the atmospheric nu- clear test ban. : It came back to life in the late 1960s as the warhead for a new 8-inch Army artillery shell, but it died again in 1973 when the Army found “technical problems.\"”’ Mean- while, the neutron explosive came to technological maturity as the tip on the Sprint anti-ballistics missile — only to die again when the whole ABM system was downgraded in 1972. It was last year that the neutron warhead found its current mate: The Lance artillery missile that is intended to destroy Soviet tanks in Europe. Until President Carter de- cides whether to deploy the Lance, the neu- tron warhead will be, like the Selective Service System, in ‘‘deep standby posture.”’ IN WASHINGTON, TECHNOLOGY is by over town. The difference seems to be that the civilian species are smaller and better camouflaged and thus harder to kill. One possible specimen was spotted re- cently, moving files from the State Depart- ment to the Department of Labor. Known in the president's budget as the ‘“‘National Commission on the Observance of International Women’s Year, 1975,’’ the commission still has two employees (down ‘from 38 last year) as well as an office and a telephone number. Its original function was to prepare for the internatio women’s convention in Mexico City in 1975, which it did. The next year, it got extra funds from Congress for a follow-up conference in Houston, which took place last October. An official answering the women’s year commission telephone this week said the re- maining two-member staff was a “‘transi- ‘tion group” awaiting an announcement by Carter of a 40-member committee to imple- ment the actions taken in Houston last October. - Carter was expected to name the new committee en soon,”’ said the commis- - June 14, 1978 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Safer H-bomb recommended for Senate OK By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bur WASHINGTON — The Senate Armed Services Committee reported Saturday that certain older-model hydrogen bombs now deployed at Strategic Air Command airbases ‘““do not meet today’s standards of safety, security and operational flexibility.” To solve the problem, the commit- ‘tee asked the Senate to add $32.5 million to next year’s nuclear weap- ons budget to begin production of a new H-bomb that is designed to be immune to nuclear accidents. It was apparently the first report by a congressional committee ac- knowledging the need for better safety features in some U.S. nuclear weapons. In essence, the report con- firmed one of the key findings of a Cox Newspapers series published last January: That many U.S. nu- clear weapons lack sophisticated safety devices to guarantee that they cannot be blown up by terror- ists or destroyed by accident. ONE WHITE HOUSE source said the Office of Management and Budget has now withdrawn an earlier objection to the so-called ““modern strategic gravity bomb’’ because its designers have figured out how to cut about $500 million from its long-range cost estimate. With that obstacle removed, it ap- peared likely that the weapon will be funded by Congress and go into production this fall to become a part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent forces in the 1980s. The new H-bomb would include a tamper-proof safety catch to keep it from detonating without presiden- tial command, even when it is out- side its bomber. This device, known as an electronic Permissive Action Link, requires a crew member to in- sert a secret six-number code into the bomb before it can be armed. If the proper code is not inserted in the first few tries, the arming mech- anism wouid lock and the weapon would have to be sent back to the factory. The new bomb would also contain SUMMARY — Acknowledging the need for better nuclear safety features, the Senate Armed Services Committee Saturday urged the Sen- ate to appropriate $32.5 to begin production of a new hydrogen bomb immune to accidents. The new bomb would include a tamper-proof safety catch to keep it from detonating without presidential command. A committee report said some oider-model H-bombs now deployed at Strategic Air Command airbases “do not meet today’s standards of safety, security and operational flex- ibility .”” an ‘“‘insensitive high explosive”’ trig- gzer to eliminate the possibility of plutonium-scattering accidents like the 1966 crash of a B-52 bomber in Palomares, Spain. *“THE COMMITTEE strongly recommends that insensitive high explosives be applied to all future nuclear weapons, be they for strate- gic or theater forces,’’ said the com- mittee report. The extra cost is justified, the committee continued, “by removing the potential of a nonnuclear deto- nation, with resultant scattering of plutonium and uranium.’’ The panel called on the Departments of Energy and Defense to report by next spring on whether the entire U.S. weapons stockpile should be **retrofitted’’ to incorporate insensi- tive high explosives. The committee said a new H-bomb “is required’’ to replace the current Mark-28 bomb, a one-megaton weapon that has been a mainstay of the SAC strategic bomber force for the last 19 years. Aside from its safety and security features, the new bomb has been sought by the Air Force because it would explode more reliably on low-level, high-speed bombing runs. In addition, a dial on the bomb would allow crew members to ad- just the explosive ‘‘yield’’ to match their target, with settings varying up to about one megaton. Dayton Daily News - July 2, 1978 \f"

In a recent issue of “Military Re- view,” published by the Army War Col- lege, Capt. John Rybicki of the Army’s ADM training school suggested that known enemy invasion routes could be “seeded” with ADMs that could -be ex- ploded later by remote commiand. A single 2-kiloton ADM detonated in the midst of a hypothetical enemy formation would kill about 40 percent of the invaders immediately, Rybicki wrote. He estimated that another 30 per- cent of the enemy along a 3-kilometer on would become “delayed casual- es.”” “These casualties would result from a massive dose of initial nuclear radiation, would become incapacitated within hours and eventually would die,’’ Rybicki wrote. “Chaos and confusion would be added as bonus effects for the defenders and would present likely good targets to modern anti-tank systems.” The 2-kiloton weapon Rybicki de- scribed evidently was the heavier jeep- borne model known as the Medium It can be deduced from unclassified government documents that the yield of the smaller Special ADM is only about a tenth of a kiloton.

Ar- thur Radford put it, that “atomic weap- ons have Sietieally achieved conventional status wi our armed forces.” Unwill to match the size of the : armies, the NATO allies adopted a “trip- ” strategy. The assumption reportedly weigh about 100 pounds, of which about two-thirds is the was that any Russian attack in Europe would be met by a massive American nuclear strike. Old-timers in the Pentagon recall a fervent competition among various mili- tary branches to acquire some form of nuclear hardware, since future wars were expected to be nuclear. At one point, even the Army infantry had a nu- clear weapon — a bazooka known as the Davy Crockett. In that climate, officials said it was logical for the Army Engineers to obtain an atomic blasting device to carry out its traditional demolition duties. The first ADM was a jerry-rigged 500- pound nuclear warhead whose fusing de- vice consisted, literally, of a series of kitchen timers and batteries. Then, to eliminate what some experts thought was a safety hazard, a new model was designed that became today’s jeep-borne Medium ADM. The one-person ADM came later, as an offshoot of the miniature Davy Crock- ett warhead. As it happened, this sthall warhead — known as the W-54 — emerged from the government’s weapons labs just as the Kennedy administration was building up the Army Special Forces and Navy “Seal” teams to fight “unconventional” wars. It appears from Pentagon documents a that the final decision to produce a small IM based on the W-54 warhead was ar by then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara on Oct. 30, 1962 — a few weeks after the Cuban missile crisis. An Army training manual confirms that gor wartime mission of the Special ‘Forces is infiltrating behind enemy lines to “perform certain priority direct ac- tion missions” such as the emplacement of ADMs and chemical weapons. Among the possible targets, according to the un- classified manual, are air defense instal- lations, propaganda outlets, and radio- jamming stations. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 16, 1978 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bourne Quits After Cocaine 2S Sniffin By Joseph Albright and Timothy Adams Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Dr. Peter Bourne, on leave as President Carter's drug adviser, abruptly cut his remaining ties to thie White House Thursday in the wake of a columnist’s televised e that he had sniffed cocaine at a Washington party last December. About 3 p.m., Bourne submitted an an- guished resignation letter saying he had acted in ‘‘good faith” in prescribing Quaalude sleeping pills for his White House assistant, Ellen Metsky. But then he added: “There is really no way for me to combat the charges publicly made against me and the rumors which run rampantly throughout this community.” At his news conference later, a down- cast Carter praised Bourne as a “close friend” and able public servant, adding he had accepted the resignation “with re- gret.” Carter then sought to cut off questions on what he called “this unfortunate inci- dent” by saying that he did not want his comments to influence any investiga- tions. One reporter persisted, asking whether Carter or any members of his family had ever received drugs pre- scribed by Bourne. Carter answered that Bourne had never given him “any treat- ment of any kind,” including prescription drugs. The president did not say, how- ever, whether any member of Carter’s family ever received medical assistance from Bourne. Informed sources said one factor in Bourne's final resignation was an allega- tion broadcast by columnist Jack Ander- son on ABC’s “Good Morning America” Thursday that three witnesses saw Bourne use both marijuana and cocaine last Dec.10. The witnesses, who were not named, were quoted as saying that Bourne used these drugs at a party in Northwest Washington that was spon- sored by a pro-marijuana lobbying group. See BOURNE, Page 12-A Associated Press Photo SNIFFED COCAINE AT PARTY?

Cohn also said two other witnesses pro- vided oral accounts of the same incident. A NORML official later ex- pressed pleasure at Bourne's resignation, saying, “We are disappointed in his perform- ance, and outraged at his sup- port of the program for spraying paraquat on Mexi- can marijuana. But it is too bad that they are dumping him, not because of his caer but because of private mat- ters and his life style.” Bourne evidently decided to quit as Thursday progressed. In an early morn- ing interview with the Wash- ington Star, Bourne said he had no intention of resigning and-that the president had not asked him to do so. Bourne told the Star that the initial idea for a leave of absence was his. “I asked him (Carter) to let me know if it “The message came back that it was okay with him.” Casting new light on his decision to prescribe Quaa- lude, a powerful tranquilizer, instead of milder barbiturates for his White House aide, Bourne told the Star: “I have been on a soapbox for the last year against barbiturates. I have been trying to get the FDA to force them off the market—they cause 2,000 deaths a . It could have been sudeeiteiaiey if -.my Name were on such a pre- scription.” Nevertheless, Bourne con- ceded it was “poor judgment in retrospect” for him to have written a prescription for a staff member. White House Press Secre- tary Jody Powell has said that Bourne has written 10 reports Thursday that suburban, police had been instructed to scour pharmacy Beyond report, Bourne’s initial re- quest for a leave of absence provoked what. were seen in the White House as generally Row arial news accounts on late-evening news shows Wednesday and in Thursday mornin q sociation officials as saying it was unprofessional for a doc- tor. to use a false name on a Prescription for a controlled drug like Quaalude. Almost lost in the swirl of Thursday's developments was the case of the allegedly ille- gal Quaalude prescription which Bourne said he wrote for Metsky after she had complained of unspecified emotional problems. Police in Prince William County—a recently suburban- ized area about 40 minutes south of Washington—ar- rested Metsky’s former room- | mate, Toby Mary Long, and charged her with a fraudulent attempt to get a controlled drug. What-caused her arrest on July ll was that Bourne had written the prescription for “Sarah Brown” — a name he later as a pseudonym for Mets! Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert, a two- term Democrat seeking re- election, has not changed his statement that he will decide in about a week whether to file charges against Bourne or Metsky for their role in at- tempting to obtain the 15 Quaalude pills. The use of a name other than the real name of the pa- tient for whom the prescrip- tion is intended is a felony violation under District of Columbia, Virginia and federal statute. In Washington, an official of the Drug Enforcement Administration, which admin- isters the Federal Controlled Substances . Act, said the agency usually doesn’t press for prosecution of isolated in- stances where doctors put false names on prescriptions. However, the official said Bourne's acknowledged use of a “pseudonym” on a prescrip- tion for a controlled drug was a clear violation of law. Atlanta Constitution - July 21, 1978 \f"

The story be- hind the picture is likely to be detailed when the committee opens four days of hearings on the King assassination in mid-August. One of the Dekalb County men, Leon Powell, is known to have told the com- mittee in closed session Feb. 6 that in the fall of 1967 he and his brother, Claude, met a well-dressed man named “Ralph” at Pete’s Place, a bar in East Atlanta. Leon Powell said “Ralph” showed them $25,000 in a briefcase and offered them $50,000 more to kill King. He said he and his brother declined the offer and never saw “Ralph”’ again. CLAUDE POWELL JR., who is Leon’s brother, has so far refused to testify be- fore the assassinations panel, saying he is afraid of being murdered. On Thurs- day, it was learned, a federal grand jury was to consider contempt of congress charges against him on grounds that he has defied a su i At Claude Powell's house in Dekalb County, his wife, who declined to give her name, scoffed at the reported plot, saying her husband “used to drink a lot” and Leon Powell did likewise. A committee document, submitted as part of the contempt proceedings against Claude Powell, gave this ac- count: t Two years ago, Leon Powell went to the FBI in Atlanta and told how he and Claude were approached by “‘a mutual friend”’ in an Atlanta bar some months before King was shot in Memphis in April, 1968. The friend inquired whether they might be interested in making a “large sum of money” for killing King. THE FBI, SEEKING confirmation, tracked down Claude Powell in Texas | and found that he told essentially the same story. } “The Powells expressed an interest in the contract, and the friend indicated that he would put them in touch with an individual who could financially back such a contract,’’ according to the committee document. . Several days later, the document con- tinued, the Powell brothers said they “The Powells hesitated, at which time Ralph closed his briefcase and left.” The committee document said the FBI “*‘was umable to discredit the story” after spending “‘a considerable amount of investigative time” checking it out. ACCORDING TO THE committee, Claude Powell was given one lie-detec- tor test by the FBI and showed indica- tions of “truth telling” when answering questions about being offered money to kill King. Leon Powell was given four lie-detector tests, but they were incon- clusive, the committee reported. The committee document said the “friend” who allegedly introduced the Powells to “Ralph” denied any involve- ment during a closed-session appearance before the panel on Feb. 6. In an interview Wednesday, Atlanta country music singer Arnold Ray God- frey confirmed reports that he had been questioned by the committee that day on whether he had introduced the Pow- ells to anyone named “Ralph.”’ Godfrey told a reporter he often saw the Powells in Pete’s Place, which is now out of business. But he said he knew nothing of “Ralph” nor of any plan to murder King.

According to the committee docu- ment, Powell later “informed the inves-, that the alternative of going to jail was preferable to that of being killed.” Pow- ell then said that if he was forced appear, “he would lie.”’ Leon Powell initially tried to avoid, testifying, citing fears for his safety. However, he appeared after missing one Leon Powell is the second witness, who surfaced in recent weeks with alle- gations that he turned down a lucrative. contract for King’s murder before it occurred. In St. Louis, Russell G. Byers, a for- mer auto parts dealer, acknowledged that two men from Imperial, Mo., had offered him money on behalf of a group of businessmen to kill King. The inci-. dent sparked intense interest because Byers’s brother-in-law, John Spica, was then serving a murder term in the Mis- souri State Penitentiary, where James Earl Ray, later convicted of King’s mur- der, was also a prisoner. \f"

        "ocr_text": "N-Cruiser ‘USS Rickover’ To Join Fleet Saturday By Joseph Albright JournalConstilution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON = Adm, Hyman Rick over, the 78-year-old crusader who still rules the nuclear Navy, will go to Norfolk, Va., Saturday to watch the commissioning of one of his last atomic-powered surface ships, His one-time aide, President Carter, will be among the speakers at the Norfolk Naval Station as the $262 million cruiser prepares to join the fleet, Continued from Page 1-A Rickover has been described as a per- son who believes that the shortest dis- tancé between two points is a straight line, even it if bisects six superiors. He proved it the next time he testified be- fore his old friends on the House Armed Services Committee. “On a cost effectiveness basis, the colonists should not have revolted a King George III,” said the admi- tal. * Virtually defying McNamara to disci- pline him, Rickover said of the Johnson administration's dealings with Congress; “A situation has arisen analogous to the Senate of the late Roman empire — a Senate whose function is simply to ratify the decisions of the emperor.” Then came his punch-line: “You must take.the initiative if you want to have’ nuclear escorts. If Congress abdicates its position of leadership, we will not have then,” Congress responded by passing a spe- cial clause that required McNamara to go ahead with contracts for the new nu- clear ships unless the president certified that they Were “not inthe national inter- est.” ’ For good measure, Rickover suggested to the committee that it should free up some funds for nuclear warships by can- celling some of the diesel-fired ships which McNamara sought. The committee again complied. She is called the USS Mississippi, but the ship has Rickover’s name written all over her, Starting 12 years ago, he wangled the funds to build her against the will of two defense secre- taries and a president, Since then, he has done everything to make her his ideal of a warship except tighten the bolts, Although he has’ 32 submarines coming along, Rickover’s only two nuclear surface ‘Ships still under construction won't be ready unl 140 and 182, Hig proposed §23 blo Although preoccupied with Vietnam, McNamara still found time to get John- son's signature on a declaration that all the nuclear escort ships authorized by Congress were against the national inter- est. ‘ But then McNamara resigned, and his successor, Clark Clifford, struck a com- promise with Rep, Mendel Rivers, D- S.C., and other Rickover allies. The Navy would get the last few of Rickover’s older class of nuclear frigates. But there . would be no construction money for the . newer frigates that Rickover already was designing. The new class, which was to include . the Mississippi, slid through Congress in 1969 — not because Defense Secretary Melvin Laird wanted ii, but because he didn’t know how to stop it. Rickover has had the uncanny power to outlast his superiors partly because he is one of the few people in the govern- ment who is “double-hatted.” Since 1948, he has worked for the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Department of Energy) as head of its division of naval reactors. At the same time, he has been deputy commander of the Pentagon's Naval Sea Systems Command. As one former high Navy official ex- plained, “When Rick pulled an end run around the secretary of defense, he would usually do it by writing on his AEC letterhead.” Wearing his Navy hat, Rickover.virtu- nuclear supercarrier, now being debated in Congress, would not be finished before 1986. Rickover's latest two-year extension of duty expires next summer, In a sense, the Mississippi is the embodi- ment of a debate which has enveloped Defense Secretary Harold Brown and everyone else who has tried to run the Pentagon. In simplest terms, the issue is; should the Navy order the very best Rickoverstype ships even if that rdering ally dictated the terms of the 197] con- tract for the construction of the Missis- sippi and two other ships by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. Wearing his AEC mantle, he personally approved the blueprints for the nuclear reactor shielding and sent his inspectors into the yard at midnight. In his industrial relations, Rickover was as mellow as a blowtorch. Although the Mississippi caused fewer disputes than some ships, the builders still filed a yet-to-be resolved $47.5 mil- lion claim on top of the contract price. They contend that Rickover and his as- sistants kept changing the blueprints as they went along, but wouldn’t pay for the extra work. In his book, “On Watch,” retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt quoted N. W. Freeman, chairman of the shipyard’s parent company, as saying in 1973 that he had ordered management officials to “throw Admiral Rickover’s ass out of the plant” if he showed up. Freeman complained not only about Rickover’s onerous inspections but also that the admiral used his influence to cancel the shipyard’s priority for a ship- ment of steel that it needed to complete a commercial ship contract. Rickover’s reply was that the shipyard had expanded too fast to cash in on the commercial ship market and the Navy's centrate on smaller, oilfired ships, and buy more of them? Robert McNamara thought he had settled that question in the mid-1960s when as defense secretary he cancelled Rickover's plans for nu: clear surface ships, saying they were not “cost effective,” The one use for nuclear power, as McNamara saw it, was in submarines, See RICKOVER, Pare 4-A work was suffering. He did not deny that he withheld the steel. Despite Rickover’s hounding, the Mis- sissippi was delivered to the Navy 22 months behind schedule. Having built her, Rickover personally approved her commander, Capt, Peter M. Hekman, as well as about a dozen other officers with nuclear-related jobs aboard the ship. It is all part of the Rickover system. Hekman had his first interview with the admiral in 1963, when the young Annap- Olis graduate was allowed to enter the select Navy nuclear propulsion program. Rickover has kept his eye on Hekman’s performance ever since, until he finally decided he was ready to command the Mississippi. Six weeks ago, Rickover was aboard the ship when Hekman took her out into the Atlantic for her sea trials. After pushing her to top speed and fully testing the reactor, the admiral pronounced himself satisfied, When Congress first authorized the Mississippi, she was a frigate — mean- ing to most sailors a ship of less than 7,000 tons. But the ship Carter is com- missioning displaces 11,000 tons and is two-thirds as long as a World War II bat- tleship. About two years ago, the Navy solved this small embarrassment by renaming her a cruiser. Atlanta Constitution - August 5, 1978 \f"

In a week of masterful hearings, the House Select Com- mittee on Assassinations set forth overwhelming evidence that Ray was in some way responsible for the 30.06-caliber bullet that smashed into Martin Luther King’s right cheek a decade ago, The committee turns next month to the Kennedy assassi- nation. Then, after the November election, it will reassemble for 15 more days of King hearings centering on troublesome questions left unaddressed this week: ® Can any of the 23 conspiracy theories in the King assas- convictions which have led to executions. Not only did Ray purchase the apparent murder weapon but his fingerprints were found on it near the scene of the crime, along with a news- paper reporting King’s move- ments in Memphis. Shortly after the murder, Ray fled Memphis and drove all night, not stopping until he reached the bus station in Atlanta the following morning on his es- cape to Canada. Then came what amounted to Ray’s written confession. It was a stipulation which he .initialled electric chair. sination be substantiated? How did Ray finance his dancing les- sons, his nose operation, his airline tickets? Did anyone help him concoct his false names in Canada? © What role, if any, was played by Jerry Ray, his brother, in any of the events surrounding the King assassination? Could Jerry have, been the mysterious character named “Raoul” whom the convicted assassin said he met in Birmingham before the murder? © How far did the FBI go in trying to “neutralize” King because of his growing political influence? Did the FBI and the Memphis police give King full protection, or were his guards deliberately withdrawn on the fatal evening? During the week, James Earl Ray sat beneath television lights and heard himself referred to as the committee's “star” In that document, Ray said without equivocation that at 6:01 p.m. of April 4, 1968, he that fatally wounded King. The only line Ray inked out of the stipulation was a men- tion of his visit to a George Wallace for quarters. “I didn’t think it was in my ae interest,” explained y Friday — an apparent to his previously of a pardon ce was in the The only. piece missing from the committee’s case was a motive, and it tried hard — perhaps too hard, as it turned out — to provide that, too. professed to recall with great clarity Ray’s saying in 1968 that he hoped to make $500,- 000 for murdering King. witness, He got a chance to boast of his criminal cunning and to quip that it was difficult “for me to be a Perry Mason type” while in a jail cell, In the interests of security, Ray even got to ride in a bulletproof limousine like the president's, Yet the outcome was just the opposite of what Ray had . hoped. Far from emerging as. some persecuted political prisoner, Ray'finished three days before the committee with his defense in ruins. Whatever slight chance he had for winning a new ‘court trial was effectively eliminated by the week's testi- mony. Under cross-examination by Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, the committee chairman, Ray had to acknowledge that he had lied half a dozen times to various lawyers and interviewers, He had to admit that no.one, with the possible exception of a nameless “Hie just hated black peo me said the statement by re partment task force which year. In report, one prisoner knew Ray in the sso prison said Ray hated blacks and bragged d oe had ever seen him with his supposed confederate, iW ou Ky ‘ | The committee took apart Ray's new alibi with a ven- geance. In his 10,000-word opening statement, he had insisted he was fixing a spare tire at a service station in Memphis when King was shot eight blocks away, That seemed plausible until Ray admitted that he told his first lawyer, Arthur Hanes Sr,, a different story that made no mention of a gas station, ” A rebuttal witness, Coy Dean Cowden, was later brought forth by the committee to testify that he helped concoct the gas station alibi. He said he did it to help a private investigator peddle a movie script on Ray. See RAY, Page 25-A money D contacting a businessmen’s association’ that supposedly had a bounty on King’s head. While Ray was in the Mis- souri prison in 1966, three blacks were killed in a jail riot. At the time, no one blamed Ray for their deaths. But after King’s murder, several former inrnates claimed that Ray might have been =o ible because of his ha of blacks. One question which seemed to catch Ray unprepared was an invitation to expound on his racial feelings. Pausing to reflect, Ray finally said, “I assume every- one is looking out for himself most of the time, whether he is black or white.” Three days earlier, sitting im the same witness chair, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy had been asked why he thought anyone wbduld have shot King. “I believe he was assassi- mated in an attempt to kill the dream — the American drea mm,” said Abernathy. So the testimony added up to this: The man who had a dream was slaughtered by the ‘fan who had none. Atlanta Constitution - August 20, 1978 \f"

        "ocr_text": "I Assassin, Examiners Tell Panel Experts Say Connally, JFK Shot By Same Man By Joseph Albright And Nancy Lewis Constitution Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Right. medical examiners Thursday supported the War- ren Commission’s theory that President John Kennedy was shot by a single assassin who also wounded Texas Gov. John Connally. A ninth doctor, long-time Warren Commission critic Dr. Cyril Wecht, maintained it was impossible. In the second days of public hearings, the House Assassinations Committee sought to trace the exact ( copper-jacketed rifle bullets fired 15 years ago by displaying long-sealed medical photos as well as the blood- stained clothing Kennedy and Connally wore on their limousine ride in Dallas. All nine pathologists agreed that the two bullets struck Kennedy from the rear — thus rejecting the long-nurtured notion that at least one of the fatal shots was fired from a “grassy knoll” in front of the motorcade. Dr. Michael Baden, speaking for the eight-member majority of the medical panel, went on to back the Warren Com- mission’s conclusion that a single bullet probably wounded both men. That shot came a few seconds before the bullet that struck Kennedy in the back of the head and shattered his skull. A third bul- let missed. “It is our opinion that one bullet and bo one bullet went through the back neck of President Kennedy,” Baden testified. “It is also our opinion that it is the same bullet that went through the resident and the governor because there no evidence for another bullet (strik- either man).” 8 reminded of Connally’s initial insistence that he and Kennedy were hit different bullets, Baden said some shooting victims show a delayed reaction Gin Leng “It is very much i ) a stove — some people - react immediately and others don’t real- ize for a second that they have been in- See HEARING, Page 18-A paths of two - = Se KM ORD: asa Dr. Michael Baden Uses Enlarged Photograph To Trace Entry Of Bullet Into President Kennedy’s Skull Continued from Page 1-A | jured,” he said, - The “single bullet” theory is a central issue in dozens of critiques of the Warren Com- mission, Tests of Lee : Oswald's rifle have long since established that there wasn't enough time for anyone to shoot Kennedy twice and Con- nally once with separate shots. Wecht, the coroner of Al- legheny County, Pa,, told re- porters, “Once you eliminate the single bullet theory, you're in the area of two per- sons involved. You are in the area of conspiracy. You are in the area of coup d'etat. And the government cannot allow that conclusion,” As the lone dissenter on the committee's medical panel, Wecht later testified that the bullet found on Connally’s ‘stretcher was in almost “pris- tine” condition. Any bullet that passed through both vic- tims would have been com- pay flattened, Wecht testi- ied.

        "ocr_text": " ICC rules provoke debate i in trucking By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau : BREEZEWOOD, Pa. — Don’t come to the Gate- way truck stop and tell Richard Stevens about the government's all-out fight against high prices. It’s the day after President Carter’s anti-inflation speech, and Stevens is hauling 20 tons of steel I-beams from a mill in Maryland to an electric plant in Michi- gan. : As the owner and operator of a 290-horse diesel- guzzler, Stevens wishes he were free to pick up a load of freight in Michigan for the return trip. But, under # Interstate Commerce Commission rules, that could cost him a $500-a day fine. So he will drive home with —” his flatbed empty. EVEN WITH A ONE-WAY load, Stevens would be willing to chop $20 a ton from the standard rates for hauling steel to Michigan. But if he made that kind of a deal with the steel shipper, the ICC could send him to prison for granting an illegal rebate. For long-haul truckers, Breezewood is the Broad-— way and 42nd Street of the East Coast. It’s where northbound I-70 dead-ends a few hundred yards short of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. For one reason or another, Breezewood draws 10- wheelers by the dozen. So what better place to inquire into the question — which is now on the minds of Mr. Carter and his chief inflation fighter, Alfred Kahn — of whether federal government regulations are need- lessly adding to inflation? ICC trucking regulations amount to a nationwide network of freight franchises. To get a franchise, an applicant must persuade the ICC that its services on a particular route are convenient and necessary to the public. That’s not easy, because existing truck compa- nies are quick to file opposing motions. A COMPANY CANNOT, under current ICC rules, offer to reduce rates as an argument for obtaining a route. Virtually all trucking rates are set by the ICC on the basis of petitions from ‘‘rate bureaus,” industry-wide committees which are granted im- munity from anti-trust prosecution by the 1935 Motor Carrier Act. One of the few exceptions is farm goods, which can be hauled by unregulated shippers for whatever the traffic will bear. About five years ago Thomas Gale Moore, a Stan- ford University professor, caused a storm in the indus- try by estimating that ICC trucking regulations add between $6.5 billion and $15.2 billion annually to con- sumer costs. He based this finding on a 1958 Agriculture Department study of how poultry and frozen vegetable prices dropped after transportation rates were deregulated by a court order. IN 1976, THE ICC’s Bureau of Economics counter- attacked. In a lengthy report, ICC economists said trucking ere — far from burdening the Trucker Richard Steven thinks some ICC rules need to be changed economy — actually result in ‘net societal benefits” of $4.4 billion a year. Next, President Ford’s Council on Wage and Price Stability commissioned a study in hopes of resolving whether ICC regulations really were a hidden burden on the economy. The study found statistical flaws in both the Moore and ICC arguments, but in the end it seemed to side with the professor. Mr. Carter moved to the forefront on the issue in his anti-inflation speech. He noted that airline ticket prices had fallen recently because some federal regu- lations were lifted. Next year, he said he would work with Congress to “bring more competition” to the rail and trucking industries. Here in the parking lot behind the Gateway truck stop, nothing would please owner-operator Stevens more. But other truckers aren’t so sure it’s a good idea. STEVENS, WHO IS ONLY 23, bought his big rig second-hand last year for cam 000. It now has 450,000 Dayton Daily News - Like most of the 100,000 owner-operators on the highways, Stevens has no ICC certificate of his own. Instead, he leases his truck on a monthly basis to a Maryland company, United Rigging and Hauling, which has ICC permission to haul specified freight to specified destinations. For this 20-ton load of I-beams, United Rigging will get $1,600 — the ICC-approved price. For his truck and his services, Stevens gets paid 65 percent of the tariff. (The costs of fuel, tolls, insurance and other incidentals are apportioned in a complex and negotia- ble fashion between Stevens and the company.) “I'd move this myself for $1,100 or $1,200 if I could,” says Stevens. Why, then, hasn’t he applied for ICC permission to get his own freight-hauling certificate? “First of all, I don’t have $60,000 or $70,000 to put out for lawyers,” he says. “Also, it’s made practically impossible to get a shipper to back you to get ICC rights. The other truck companies can make it very difficult for them to get trucks when they need them.” October 29, 1978 \f"

Seven days a week, 24 hours a day, presses in the Treas- ry Department’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing shoot out ausede of fresh greenbacks. The output has been running $2 bil- lion a month, which means $46,000 e minute. But it has not been enough. “For the last year, the bureau has not been able to deliver all the currency we have ordered,” says James Stull, manager of the cash section of the Federal Reserve Board. To make do, the Fed has had to cut the requests for fresh currency from the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. As a re- sult, in the Atlanta, Richmond and New York districts some limp, soiled money is being recirculated instead of burned. “There have been times when Atlanta just had less new currency than there was a demand for,’ explains Robert Kai- man, a Fed technician. “So they had to lower their (currency) fitness | standards a bit to compensate for their need for cur- “tract by $10.\" The Fed says the slight aging of the currency should not be noticeable — except pneee to a vending machine. “The cause was mainly a personnel crunch,” says Seymour Berry, who heads the Treasury's ‘s ss bureau. Because old- timers have been retiring f. than expected, Berry is short Se piake actunten 60 sua: thn annua aaaeein: Since last summer the remaining 111 plate printers have been working six and seven-day weeks, earning $21 an hour when on overtime. While the bureau has been short-handed, the public has been drawing an ee volume of cash from the bank- ing system. a year ago the supply of per money in cir- culation has inerousad iy 10.5 ee ae to $972 billion. That means for every American there are 33 $3 bills in circu- lation, with a combined face value of $442. That average is up from $405 a year ago and $240 in 1970. Originally, the Fed put in a print order of 3.6 billion new notes for fiscal year 1978. When that year ended last Sept. 30, the money-printing bureau had fallen short of its quota by 400 million bills. Berry blames part of the shortfall on a labor dispute, which until recently prevented him from hiring new plate printers who had not been apprentices. Then, too, the Postal te Commission dumped an extra load on the plate printers last spring when it approved the 15- The Fed has just come through with its new it order: 4 billion new notes, with a face value of $32.2 in fiscal year 1979. “This year, we decided that if we’ve got to to make an a a side,” says Stull. FAfter all, it doesn't spoil. Next year, Stull adds, the Fed will order even more cur- rency. For one thing, public demand for cash is subject to wide seasonal swings. This year, banks’ requests for cash for the annual Christmas peak have been running way ahead of last year. When the Fed controls ‘ supply,” it does so by various credit-regulating sieiains to fine tune the total ee ee enieey men But no attempt is made to put a lid on circulatin; rency, which makes up less than one-third of oe supply. a “It’s what the people want to hold,” said a Fed “The public’s increased use of bills is due to wort factors, inflation for one.

But about 5S years ago, Department concluded that most of the Fed’s vaults were too “soft” to survive a nuclear war. So to cut costs, the Fed gradually put most of its stock- piled money into circulation. What rermains in the vaults is a one-year supply of some larger denominations, along with a one-month supply of smaller bills. Last year, the Fed decided to expand its print order but found the existing presses could print only a mere $24.2 billion. “The bureau E at its limit as far as capacity goes,” says Stull. “The only they could do is run seven days a week skip routine maintenance.

The policeman tackled him 20 feet from Kennedy, In his pocket was a loaded pistol. Four days later, Kennedy was elected president, Jaime Cruz Alejandro and Israel Dabney were booked for carrying concealed weapons, WAS IT A CONSPIRACY? At the time, both men said they carried guns as protection against muggers, It was a tough district so thelr storles seemed plausible, But now, nearly 20 years later, it would be impossi- ble to find out with 100 percent certainty, why they came armed to a political rally. Skeptics would surely point out that Dabney was a former Baptist minister, Did he harbor hatred toward Catholics? What did Ale- jandro really think about Kennedy's Cuban policy? @ 6 6 It is 15 years, less a few days, since Kennedy was shot in the head as he rode in another open car toward the Dallas Trade Mart, A great deal is known about what happened on Nov, 22, 1963, But it {s becoming clearer and clearer that the crime which still pains America to the core will never be absolutely resolved, “I am afraid there are some things we will never know,” sald Rep, Richardson Preyer, D-N.C,, one of the leaders of the House Assassinations Committee, “M JUST SORRY IT'S an untidy world,” sald Richard Helms, the former director of the CIA On the day after Kennedy's funeral, then FBI Direc: tor J. Edgar Hoover received 4 status report on the cap- ture of Lee Harvey Oswald and his death in the Dallas police station at the hands Jack Ruby, ‘It seems to me we have the basic facts now,” Hoover wrote back to his subordinates, See JFK, Page 5A, JEK death questions still linger Continued from Page 1-A. That was a staggering mistake. It was com- pounded when the Warren Commission was set up, not as an investigative body, but as a sort of appeals court to resolve questions thrust upward by other government agencies, The House committee is now near the end of a two-year task of unearthing Kennedy evidence once again, It will announce its major findings next month and issue a book-length report, replete with appen- dices, in the spring. Despite an impressive job of inves- tigating, the result will frustrate those seeking final truth. THE THRUST OF THE conclusion is likely to be (1) that Oswald pulled the trigger, and (2) it is too late for anyone to know precisely why. With hindsight and advanced scientific techniques, the committee has been able to brush away most of the prevailing conspiracy theories. The members are ready to clear the CIA, the FBI, the Cuban government and the Cuban exile community of any iinks to the assassination. This is not to say that Oswald necessarily acted alone. The committee has found, for example, that not long before the assassination Oswald had ‘‘disturbing associations” which may or may not have been con- spiratorial. The Warren Commission ruled out the possibility of conspiracies largely through the testimony of Marina Oswald, who described her husband as a strange recluse who saw almost nobody in the weeks before the killing. No associations, no conspiracy — that was the logic. THAT REASONING HAS FRAYED over the years as indications surfaced that Oswald was more active than his wife let on. One fact which greatly intrigues the assassination committee is that in August or Sep- tember, 1963, Oswald was seen in Clinton and Jack- son, La., in the company of David W, Ferrie. Ferrie was an investigator for New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello, who had once threatened to have Kennedy murdered. Ferrie is now dead. After reviewing reams of old FBI bugging and wiretap transcripts, the committee is ready to assert that there was no high-level Mafia decision to rub out the president of the United States. But it won't deny the possibility that some underworld dissident may have inspired Oswald. To Preyer, who chairs the Kennedy subcommittee of the House panel, “the most disturbing’ new ele- ment in the case is the opinion of an accoustical expert that there may well have been four shots that day in Dealey Plaza instead of three. A RECORD OF THE SOUNDS of the assassination was made when a motorcycle policeman left his microphone in the “on” position. The tape was re- trieved by the committee and sent to the same Cam- bridge, Mass., accoustical firm which studied Presi- dent Nixon's 18-minute Watergate tape gap. At first, Dr. James E. Barger, the firm’s chief scientist, told the committee staff that by filtering out the motorcycle noise he was able to detect four bullet sounds — three from the Texas School book Deposi- tory and one from the infamous “grassy knoll.” In his public testimony, Barger sounded less definite about the fourth shot. At one point he said the chances were about 50-50 that a fourth shot was fired. As an extra complication, Bob R. Hunt, the committee’s photo enhancement expert, pointed out what appeared to be a human figure in one picture of the grassy knoll taken during the motorcade. PROTRUDING FROM THIS unidentified figure was a dark line. Hunt said it could have been a rifle — and it could have been an optical illusion. “It is equally likely that it is a blurred feature or a rifle,” he testi- fied. The committee was no less perplexed by the case of Yuri Nosenko, the Soviet KGB officer who defected to the United States in 1964 and proceeded to tell the CIA that the Russian government had scarcely any interest in Oswald during his stay in Moscow and Minsk. Was Nosenko a double agent sent to spread ‘‘disin- formation” about Oswald's background in Russia? The CIA could never figure that out, testified Richard Helms — even though the agency exposed him to psychological torture for three years in an effort to make him crack. “If he was not bona fide,” said Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, “he might have been a KGB plant sent here to deceive the United States. Wouldn’t that leave you with the conclusion that Oswald was a KGB agent?” “By implication,” replied Helms. TO CLEAR THIS UP the committee tried to get the Soviet government to release additional files it may have on Oswald. But the Russians could not be budged. Nor was the committee successful in discrediting the letter Oswald allegedly wrote to the late Texas oil man H. L. Hunt a few weeks before the assassination. The handwritten letter, which an assassination critic claims to have received anonymously, says: “I am sug- gesting that we discuss the matter fully before any steps are taken by me or anyone else.” A panel of handwriting experts was unable to determine whether or not it was a forgery, according to Joseph McNally, a former New York police hand- writing expert retained by the committee. He said the handwriting corresponded in many ways to Oswald’s writing, even though the signature was misspelled. While opening some new uncertainties, the com- mittee shut the door on many others. IT PROVED TO ALMOST everyone's satisfaction that the first shot from the Texas School Book Deposi- tory missed. The second penetrated Kennedy's back, emerged from his windpipe, and went on to inflict all of Tex. Gov. John Connally’s wounds. The third shat- tered Kennedy’s skull, killing him instantly. If a fourth bullet was fired from the knoll in front of the motorcade, it missed and was never found. The committee has also disposed of the controver- sial photograph that supposedly showed Oswald on the ground floor of the book depository about the time the shots were being fired five floors above. An anatomy expert established that the figure on the ground floor was one of Oswald’s co-workers. And at last the seemingly bottomless supply of CIA and FBI files has been thoroughly examined, without turning up any evidence of official complicity in the assassination. The committee is prepared to re- state with considerable confidence that Oswald was never a U.S. government agent. e e s The worst part is that it almost didn't happen. IF THE MARKET HALL in Dallas had been avail- able for the president’s luncheon instead of the Trade Mart, the motorcade would not have passed the book depository. If the rain hadn’t stopped just as Kennedy landed in Dallas, Secret Service agents wouldn’t have removed the limousine’s bubble-top. If Oswald’s co-worker, Bonnie Ray Williams, had taken 10 minutes longer to eat lunch on the sixth floor, Oswald wouldn't have been left alone. If work- ers hadn’t been painting the floor, no one would have piled up the boxes next to the window, affording Os- wald a hiding place. Next May, Kennedy would have been 62 years old.

He told the FBI he hadn’t seen his brother since 1951. Asked about his dealings with Stoner, Jerry Ray said, “I just run errands — pick up mail at the post office — things of that nature.” He in- sisted that he had never heard of Stoner until 1969, when Stoner offered to serve free as his brother's attorney.

Joseph Albright, Cox Newspapers, on the security of national security With a Brooks Brothers topcoat In hand, Joseph Albright showed up at an Air Force nuclear weapons depot in December 1977. He announced he was a potential bidder on a construc- tion contract. He wasn’t searched; his briefcase wasn't inspected. The only identifica- tion he was asked to produce was his District of Columbia driver's license. He gained admittance. The ‘contractor’ was actually a Washington reporter for Cox News- papers. He had learned that many nuclear weapons did not have safety devices to prevent their detonation or destruction. He had also learned that in some places where they were being stored, security was not tight. So he set out to investigate whether Americans are safe from their coun- try's nuclear weapons. Albright found that Defense De- partment and CIA officials and mem- bers of Congress worried about ter- rorist groups’ obtaining nuclear weapons. A more likely possibility, the CIA noted in a 1976 report, would be for terrorists to barricade them- selves inside a nuclear power plant or storage site. “If my experience means any- thing,” Albright wrote, ‘the average commercial airport in America is in some ways better prepared against terrorists today than some of the Strategic Air Command's bomb stor- age sites.” Albright noted that the government is not using the most sophisticated detectors available to keep outsiders out of nuclear sites. He also reported that while the Defense Department was making attempts to keep secret the location of nuclear storage sites, the Air Force published a list of 16 of its bases that needed funds for im- proving the security of nuclear stor- age. Albright received the award for Washington correspondence. Judges commended his series for being “singularly responsible for reducing the danger of a nuclear or chemical catastrophe.” The Pentagon was given an ad- vance copy of Albright’s article; the Pentagon responded immediately, ordering an investigation of the De- fense Department's construction pro- cedures. A month later, the Air Force announced increased security proce- dures at its nuclear storage sites. The House Appropriations Committee or- dered Defense Secretary Harold Brown to stiffen security measures. Last December, the Strategic Air Command announced it had taken 65 steps to assure nuclear security. A SAC commander called Albright’s series the ‘catalyst’ for the changes.
