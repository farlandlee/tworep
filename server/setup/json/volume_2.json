The porch roof, constituting the fifth\r\nlevel, will be used as a sun roof that will\r\noverlook the woods and offer a panoramic view\r\nof the surrounding countryside.\r\n\r\nThe basement level will be used for storage\r\nand utility purposes. The second floor will hold\r\na studio, bath and bedrooms for the Brown’s\r\nthree children, Kel Lee, 11, Wade, 9, and\r\nSydnee, 7.\r\n\r\nIrregular erevices on the second floor will he\r\nutilized for storage space and as storm and\r\nfallout shelters, All major plumbing also will be\r\ncontained in a natural fissure in the rock.\r\n\r\nGlass-Domed Pool\r\n\r\nOn the third and main level the craggy\r\nsurfaces of stone will be submerged in a 160-\r\nsquare Foot swimming pool and serve as focal\r\n\r\nint in a sunken living room, where cushions\r\nwill replace traditional furniture, scattered for\r\nseating around the rock.\r\n\r\nOver the open pool will be a raised glass\r\ndome to permit natural lighting and to add ex-\r\ntra room for diving.\r\n\r\nBrown, a tanned and bearded architect for\r\n\r\nWilliam J. McHugh and Assbciates of West .\r\n\r\nHartford, emphasized throughout an interview\r\n{hat masonry work held the key to his unusual\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMasons Joseph N.

That's why we're using so\r\n\r\nmuch exposed concrete.”\r\n\r\nHe said that the major cost is in the form-\r\ning. But, the wood for forming also is used for\r\nframing, in a horizontal rather than the usual\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nLow Price Tag\r\n\r\nIn addition to reusable forms, other\r\neconomies include not using roofing material on\r\nthe concrete roof, using the natural rock\r\nwherever possible, and letting the concrete cast\r\nlentils serve as steps.\r\n\r\nBrown’s economies will pay off in the end,\r\nfor he expects the total cost for his home to re-\r\n\r\nmain under $30,000.\r\nMuch of the reason for such a low price tag\r\nis due to the time and work Brown himself has\r\n\r\ncontributed to the project. )\r\nAfler surveying the land he began to think\r\n\r\nabout a preliminary design.\r\n\r\nFinding he would need something more ac-\r\ncurate than the usual surveyor's methods,\r\nBrown set up an eight-foot square plane table\r\nover the rock to physically record each bump\r\nand depression. From this he was able to lay\r\nout the precise plans that his masons lauded.\r\n\r\n‘Brown and his wife, Donna, and three\r\nchildren came here 542 years ago Tom 1\r\nDakota, They began looking for thy “right” lot\r\nto build on about three years ago.!  &\r\n\r\nHe said they did not know exactjy vi\r\nwanted in the way of property, hut jwere look\r\nfor something “challenging.” Ce\r\n\r\nAfter a three-year search they gjnally placed\r\nan ad in a local paper for a moddrately PUC*\r\nunique piece of land.\r\n\r\nThe lot at the end of Tyaié'\r\nresulted. )\r\n\r\nfrom North .\r\n\r\nWenver\r\n_-rTimes Photo bY Barry\r\n2 itect\r\n\r\nil 30,000\r\n\r\nveor) while its <r\r\nON ANy AROUND GRANITE sabres cst to be less th\r\n\r\nHOUSIE\r\nRobert K.

That\r\nordinance was passed on July\r\n22 in expectation of the zoning\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nAlthough it calls'for regula-\r\ntions which, according to con-\r\nsultant Mrs. Diana Donald,\r\n“are among the strictest in\r\nthe state,” the ordinance also\r\nhas a section permitting the\r\ncommission to modify the\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n-. Most of those present in-\r\n\r\ndicated they felt the clause\r\nnullified the regulations: and\r\nexpressed a desite for a\r\nguarantee that the regulations\r\nwould be strictly adhered to.\r\n\r\nPeter Basco of Unionville,\r\n\r\n- Avenue noted that “We. have\r\n\r\ntalked tonight strictly. , about\r\nresidential. versus industrial\r\nzoning.” He suggested the.\r\nland could be used for parkj;.\r\npreserves and reserves.\r\n\r\nBasco then asked “What\r\nWill we do 20 years from now\r\nWhen we're completely boxed\r\nin by industry? Where will we\r\nfind trees and streams?”\r\n\r\n. His comment was greeted\r\nwith hearty applause by the\r\naudience,\r\n\r\nAnother statement was\r\nmade by Mrs. Frederick\r\nTyler who owns a large seg-\r\nment of land in the area.\r\nMrs. Tyler said that she had\r\nsold land to the town against\r\nher wishes on which to build\r\nthe Toffolon School with the\r\nunderstanding that open\r\nspace would be left for play\r\narea.\r\n\r\nShe added that this open —\r\n\r\nspace would be violated by\r\nthe zone change, and would\r\nbecome a dangerous place for\r\n\r\n“children,\r\n\r\nAlthough commission\r\nmembers and town officials\r\nattempted to answer ques-\r\ntions and explain the efficacy\r\nof such a change, they were\r\noften interrupted and ridicyj-\r\ned by irate townsmen.\r\n\r\n*\\ Commission member\r\nRudolph Mazzalupo said in\r\n\r\nresponse, “We on the com-\r\nmission respect everyone's\r\nopinion here and expect the\r\nsame. in: return.

Located in the heart of town, across from Simsbury Bank and Trust Co., the shop culminates months of previously fruitless searching “from one end of Simsbury to the other,” according to Coc- chi. “We had a lot of promises for a place,” Cocchi said, “but no one came througti.” The thought of two high school kids opening an outlet for original art work just didn’t appeal to the business sense of too many adults, One location was assured Jast August, but Cocchi was disabled in an accident ‘‘and we had to start all over again,” he said. Then realtor George Matt — a Spelman family friend—went into action and helped secure the spot behind Colli-Wagner Realty Company which he manages. ; A former physical educa- tion teacher, Matt “likes to keep in touch with youth. Too many times they ‘try to do something and no one will help,” Matt explained. He, too, struggled with an art gallery once and knows the problems his young friends will encounter. Shop owner Mrs. Bertha Hoffert also has proved to be a friend to youth. She is not even charging. rent until the boys “get established.” Why such generosity? It’s a matter of faith in Cocchi and Spelman, generated by some friendly persuasion from Matt. , “IT usually wouldn’t want young people in there,” Mrs, Hoffert said, “but they're going to make a success because they're going to work at it. “Tt’s most unusual to find young men doing something like this,” she added. What they are doing is spending every spare moment — squeezed in between school and their part-time jobs—readying the shop for customers, The location las an artsy- craftsy atmosphere perfect for a gallery. To reach the basement hideaway, one walks through a short alley, under and around a hanging fire escape, and there jg the door in a niche between’ two building corners, ‘ _ On sale will be pieces rang- ing from wood floor sculptures to metal design wall plaques. Cocchi and Spelman also will do work to order when requested, . Both have “learned through experiment” as well as in art and industrial courses at school. Major guidance and encouragement has come from. art teacher Anthony Gardocki and other school ad- ministrators, But the young, unknown artist seldom can find a market for kis work, regardless of how much en- couragement is voiced by friends. So the solution is to open ° your own shop and get things rolling. The pair hopes “The Hidden Gallery” will be an outlet not only for their own creations, but for the work of other local young people as vel. j They want to prove something, and they're well on their way.

An inquiry of the home was prompted when The Times learned a petition had been filed asking the State Depart- ment of Welfare to in- vestigate “known, long-stan- ding violations of professional standards” at Rose Hill, formerly known as the Polish Orphanage.

Also reported in the letter, written by Miss Carol Ford, psychological examiner at Rose Hill from September of 1969 to last January, were cases of children whose emo- tional and social malad- justments were heightened during confinement: at the home. A psychologicat study of one boy, inmated at the home for four years, described an over-all decline in functioning due to environmental deprivation. It was recom- mended he be placed in a foster home. Another ‘boy, residing at Rose Hill until last February, was tested and found to have emotional difficulties and suicidal tendencies ex- acerbated by placement at the home. Miss Ford, currently a psychological examiner at Central Connecticut State College, was a main organizer of the petitioners. She said she also informed Archbishop John F. Whealon and other Catholic ad- ministrators of conditions at Rose Hill ~ with no response. The archbishop was not available for comment. Edward J. Power, Catholic Family Services executive director who has received copies of Miss Ford’s cor- . respondence, said his person- nel “have offered consultative services to the sisters for years.” - Miss Marjetta Scully, social worker at Rose Hill from March 16 until her resignation last Friday, reinforced the reports of harsh conditions. Miss Scully said she had seen one lay housemother, who supervises boys aged 10 to 14, kick the boys in the groin with her knee afd pull their hair so severely that fingernail marks are left on their scalp. ' According to Miss Scully, the housemother formerly was an inmate of a mental institution. Miss Scully also deplored the food served at Rose Hill. “The food donated is day-old bread and rolls and pies, and the children get no fresh fruit. They even served macaroni and potatoes at one meal,” she said. In an earlier letter to the Welfare Department from Miss Ford and two other signers of the petition, It was noted that a Child Welfare League study of the home last summer estimated a daily fond expenditure of 69 cents for each child. Administrators of another aréa child care institution said they spend $2.50 to $3 a day per child for food. The amount currently spent on food is not known, since the home administrator refus- ed to comment. But Francis Murphy, Welfare Department institutional consultant. said a num who is a trained dieti- cian now serves both Rose Hill and the nearby Catholic girls academy. Murphy added that “there could be more intensive in- -volvement” on the part of the dietician. _ Miss Ford also relaled in- cidents of homosexual assaults in the older boys’ dormitory that she said oc- curred in the absence of a child care worker. She added thal despite her pleas, the ad- ministrator moved a_ nine- year-old boy to the dormitory to free his bed for a new ad- mission. No steps were taken to pre- vent further such incidents and, Miss Scully said, the in- stitution still has no program of sex education, even for the teen-age girls. Nor is there a structured program of recreation at Rose Hill. Miss Scully noted that during last week's spring vacation from school (the children attend public schools) no activities or trips were planned to keep the children occupied. Frank Cimino. part-time social worker at the home from 1966 to last spring, described the children’s ac- tivities: “They would sit and sit and sit, and play records, and sometimes get in fights. They need a full-time person in charge of child care services,” Cimino and other peti- tioners who ‘have not served the home on a full time basis | reported seeing no cases of physical abuse and are nat aware of dietary deficiencies, ‘They cited instead defi- ciencies in personnel qualified to handle children from pro- blem homes, deficiencies in programming, and defi- ciences in understanding, Every petitioner - in- lerviewed termed the in- stitution as a Welfare Depart- ment “dumping ground” for children whom other homes will not accept. Institutional Murphy currently is  jn- vestigating conditions reported by petitioners over the last few months to the Welfare Department, Merphy said that he is compiling a report for the welfare commissioner that also will be sent to the home administrator.

Some former staff members have charged the child care institution with allowing physical abuse and serving inadequate meals, but they and others who signed a peti- tion asking for a State Welfare Department in- vestigation into Rose Hill find problems penetrating deeper than poor custodial care. Welfare officials agree, yet have been unable or unwilling to alter the traditional man- ner in which the order of Catholic nuns runs the home. Nor has the state brought in the profess ionalization necessary to help the young: outcasts of troubled families. Staffers of New Britain's Child Guidance Clinic, a private, non-profit agency aban- that offers child consultative services, said they abandoned doned Rose Hill after spending two frustrating years atfenipt ing to update admission policies and to establish programs to ease emotional a nd Te aicloniell problems of the children. Dr. David Hill, a_ clinic psychologist, set up an in- service training program for the sisters and other staff members at Rose Hill. Hill said that during this time he developed a concern about the staff members coming in contact with the children there. “Some of them are very damaged people,’ he main- tained. “Some responded very well to my suggestions and recommendations; but when they tried to ‘carry these out, they were blocked by higher- | ups in the administration. “They almost had to sneak the love in,”’ ‘Hill said. Dr. Henry Altenberg, psychiatrist and medical director at the Child Guidance Clinic, also found a basic lack of understanding on the part of home ad- ministrators. “Kids in child care homes today have greater needs than they did 40 or 50 years ago,” Altenberg said. “Then the children often were just orphans, who lost their parents through. disease or accident. “Many of these kids today come to an institution with deep psychological or emo- (Continued on Page 7A) Pye ME CYA) \fFormer Would (Continued from Page 1A) tional mroblems. Their life ex- perience often has been much more damaged through social upheaval and lack of family structure. “Today having the kids not starve and pray every day isn’t enough,’ Altenberg said. Alténberg charges that the Welfare , Department also is responsible , for conditions at Rese Hill. The department’s policy of upgrading the home from ihe bottom ‘up—throush added child care and Social workers—is ineffective, Alten- berg said.- “You can’t do this when there i a general lack of sensitivity at the top,’? he said. = Fran¢is ~Murphy, Welfare Department institutional con- sultant; said, ‘‘The sisters’ motivation’ is going in the right direction now.”> Hé cited as evidenee a four-week in- tensive course in child care at St. Louis University Missouri that several have attended.

They also suggested the state fears that pro- fessionalization would mean closing the doors of Rose Hill to extreme problem cases, compounding the department’s already difficult task of placing 10,000 Connecticut children in institutions. Murphy countered that he has heard the term ‘‘dumping Zround’? used by every in- stitution in the state, mainly because the department has so many difficult children to Place. , “We get them all,” Murphy Said, “and we have to put therm sSomewhere.”” A former Rose Hill staff Member who xsishes- to re-- gain #nenymeous, told of en- in Rose Hill Specialists Shut Down the Home DR. DAVID S. HILL - - . €riticizes home counters with Murphy in a letter to Welfare Com- missioner John Harder. “*In attempting to establish myself. asS_a_caseworker at Our Lady of Rose Hill Home, I met with Mr. Murphy. Mr. Murphy defensively berated trained social workers. *“The reasons at first were not clear, but I soon realized that the home was used as a ‘dumping ground’ for bits of humanity that did not fit into other private and state agen- cies. “The home, without any set programs,. would absorb children with assorted pro- blems, and at possibly the lowest existing day rate. It was my feeling that Mr. Murphy did not want te see this changed,’’ the caseworker said. Since the time this worker. Was at the home, the state’s rate per child has increased considerably. The former monthly rate of $165 per child has been raised to $367. Murphy said most of the ad- ditional money has gone toward increases in staff at the home. Even with additional money for personnél only oné pro- fessional social worker was employed there as late as last Friday. On that day, social worker Miss Marietta Scully left Rose Hill after serving there since March 16.

Instead, Miss Scully said, her main duties consisted of meting out punishment to the ehildren and ironing out school difficulties. “The nuns have no idea about child welfare  prin- ciples, concepts or ideas, and I do not think they care to learn. I feel sorry for the children who are inmated at Rose Hill, but one person is powerless .to help them,”” Miss Scully said. : Frank Cimino, who left the home last spring after three years as a part-time social worker, said the fact that the home has to accept emergen- Cy cases at any time is a ma- jor policy problem. Cimino, now. a social worker in the East Hartford school system, told how children often would be ac- cepted in the middle of the night, disrupting sleep of others at the home. These emergency cases often older children who were runaways—would remain a few days, then be shipped out to another institution or foster family. “But they were at the home long enough to tell stories of police chases or lurid family affairs, ‘‘upsetting the childrén tremendously,’? he said. Cimino did not blame the sisters—who were ‘‘trying to do the right thing’’—but faults the state for not sending such emergency cases to private homes or institutions especially equipped to handle short-term cases. : A former part-time caseworker, wha wishes to remain anonymous, claimed his attempts to update pro- grams and record systems were almost totally thwarted in the 10 months he worked at Rose Hill.

        "ocr_text": "Can State Push Rose Hi By MARCIA KUNSTEL Times Staff Writer Experts on child care in- stitutions say only the state Welfare Department can forces changes at Our Lady of Rose Hill Home — the in- stitution currentlyy under at- tack for child neglect — but they agree the department may not have the resources to do so. The specialist on children’s services, gathered in Hartford this week for the regional conference of the Child Welfare League of. America, registered little surprise at the charges of neglect leveled against the Roman Catholic home in New Britain. Samuel P. Berman, the league’s assistant executive director, said he has seen homes with conditions much \\ worse than those alleged at Rose Hill. Charges fanging from physical abuse to lack of pro- per care for _ emotionally damaged children have been made by a group of area child care specialists who petitioned the Welfare Department to investigate the home. Berman initially was in- volved in a league survey of Rose Hill last summer that resulled in an extensive report on conditions and recommended changes. “Some agencies ask for our help,’ Berman said, ‘‘but they don’t want Lo implement our suggeStions.”’ He noted that the league, which conducts studies of child care institutions throughout the nation, has no power to enforce its recom- mendations. “The assumption is that no one will spend money for a study like this and then not implement it. We'd like to come in and give further help here, but we have to be in- vited,’’ Berman said. Berman also _ questioned whether the order of Catholic nuns that runs Rose Hill can effect change on its own. He said that only the Welfare Department, which licenses the state’s 14 child- care institutions, has the muscle to force an upgrading of the facility. Welfare Commissioner John. Harder has adopted a ‘wait and see”’ attitttde and refuses to say what steps the depart- ment might take until a cur- rent study of the home has been completed. But exactly how much the department can do is ques- tionable. Francis Sampson, director of social service for the May 1, 1970 Needham, Children’s Center in Hamden, said “‘the state’s problem is tremendous, resulting»in hav- ing to use facilities outside of Connecticut.” The department must place all children who have been taken from their homes by state. Sampson said that some in- stitutions offer only custodial care, while others provide special treatment services for disturbed children. — ‘* Inappropriate referrals are unavoidable,’ he said, “based on the fact that there simply are not enough in- stitutions in the state.” A major concern of peti- fioners -is that children at Rose Hill — some known schizophrenics — receive lit- fle or no psychological and emotional help, and at fimeés not even adequate custedial - care. r Albert FE. Trieschman, ex- ecutive director of Walker Home for Children in Mass.. traces causes for inadequate  in- stitutional care throughemany levels. Trieschman, who has won acclaim as senior editor of the recently. published book “The Other 23 Hours,’’ faults the institution itself for view- ing innovative staff members as a threat to traditionally oriented administrators. He also blames com- munities for pushing children out of their homes and into State hands, because they don’t have resources to han- dle the children. These resources might in- clude programs in the school Systems as well as readily available medical and mental health facilities. At the top level of con- tributors to child neglect, Trieschman finds the state legislatures, which do not ap- propriate sufficient funds for Welfare de to upgrade nd adequate woos. - \f"

He was “in disguise.” Sockless, battered ‘loafers, Joe-college T-shirt and blue zip jacket. “You heard me right,” he said. “Take off the bras, You’re going under cover (no pun intended, we were sure) and hippies don’t wear ’em.” A few minutes later, three slightly embarrassed but sober young women in sloppy clothes left the Park Plaza Hotel accompanied by three similarly dressed men for a meandering night long walk through the campuses at Yale. In appearance and man- nerisms, we girls were students. In fact, we were the “cover” for special police in- vestigators assigned to sniff out those who would destroy New Haven with bombs. Last Friday night’s sporadic guerrilla-like attacks by student militants had, police thought, foreshadowed worse Strikes for Saturday night. Hoping to head-off bombings, the New Haven police were using “in- formers,” several of whom had been suspected by the demonstrators and Were no longer effective. Only six men were still operating without suspicion. The three of us had gone down to New: Haven Saturday night to view the situation first-hand.

The report was commis- — sioned by the Board of Trus- tees for Regional Community Colleges which administers the eight existing two-year schools established over the ~ last five years. The firm noted in its report that some areas of the state which should be served by community colleges are not, and that further development is needed at all the existing facilities. *. A major deficiency in the present program, according to _ the report, is that only one of the existing schools is located in a permanent facility. _ It was noted i tity, separate ‘institution. - a e u “Although temporary facilities have advantages, the report said, they tend to project a stigma of being “‘se. cond best,” especially when a college is housed within q high school still in use.

Based on original plans set up in 1965 the state would establish 12 two-year colleges, none of which would be coordinated with technical schools. The areas proposed for six future colleges include Dan- bury, New Britain-Bristol, Mohegan (Southeastern), North Central, Brook Park (Meriden - Wallingford - North Haven) and Northeastern- Windham. .

Graig heads the ma ssive feeding operations for crew of 3,000” nard—With By MARCIA KUNSTEL Times Staff Writer ON BOARD THE U.S.S. IN- TREPID — I stood there on the dock — dwarfed by the massive frame of a ship — and my stomach suddenly, dropped to knee level. That in itself might not have been so bad, except that my knees were quivering, too. The cause for this sudden malaise? I was about to board my first Naval aircraft carrier — a lone female. among some 800 sailors. It had seemed like a dream situation for a 22-year-old, eligible woman. But I hadn’t realized the ship would be so big, the men would be so many, and a female would be such a novelty. ‘ But I was on assignment, and with true journalistic fortitude I set aside any fleeting doubts and mounted the maze of planks and steps that led to -the deck “of the Intrepid. Leading up to that. Tong climb over the side of the ship had been several weeks of anticipatory preparation. It started the day the city editor brought me a news release about the annual Ney Memorial Award for the best mess hall operation in the Navy. First I was to find out if any of the six finalists’ was anchored nearby. Even that had its moments of excitement — calling the Pentagon, then waiting to hear if the Navy would okay our boarding the Intrepid, anchored in Boston harbor. Interspersed throughout was the feedback from fellow staffers. Female expressions of envy alternated with male warnings that I tried not to take sériously. The warnings flashed 800 Sailors 1 hereré) noe way for a woman to remain in conspicuous at the Bosto Naval Shipyard. But it was time to get oF with the reporting job af hand. That was to ljearn what it takes to feed ‘up to 3,00 men on board a ship and tq make a first-hand taste tes to see. why the Intrepid wa singled -otit as an awar the chow in the Navy is a feat of massive proportions. And though it may not live up to what mother used to make, it more than equals the fare I ‘had been subjected to in col- lege days. ~The man burdened with ex- plaining operations to a reporter totally ignorant of Navy ways was Lt. ig. Robert M. Craig, food service officer ° for the Intrepid. After the minor hassles of getting abroad—someone had forgotten to tell the shipyard people we were coming — followed by a precarious des- cent into the dark bowels of the ship amid stares of wondering sailors, Lt. Craig’s office was indeed a haven. Li. Craig, ahandsome young officer so tall he couldn’t stand to his full height in the low-ceilinged office, assured me I had indeed come on the right day. When on the bat- tlefront, the Intrepid cooks never kno when the men will drop in to eat. Food must be ready at an hour. June 11, 1970 \fWoman Goes Aboard-With 800 Sailors And he nonchalantly rattled » off statistics that awed me as much a8 had the physical proportions of the ship, “A group of 45 cooks are the crux of the food opera: tion,” he said. “They order, get it aboard and cook — everything all the way down the line.” Helping to feed the hungry sailors are a crew of 80 to 100 “mess cooks,” who serve in that capacity only tem: - povatily, Theyre clerical work. T later saw the bakers splashing a new coat of white paint on the bakery walls, “We must maintain a three to four months’ supply of food on board af all times,” Lt. Craig continued. This means carefully checking provisions On hand with. a supply list thal salt. ote fie wae It also means good menu { ihe ial planning so the men don’t eat hamburg for three weeks straight. Sometimes cooking itself is a 24hour task. “We must serve four meals a day minimum,” Lt. Craig said, “and the maximum is having food prepared for serving on a 24-hour basis.” ‘Such marathon cooking is needed only when the Intrepid is undergoing flight prepara- tions or is on the battlefront, as it was during three deployments to Vietnam. In that hectic situation there might be planes landing and taking off as often as one every minute. “We never know when the maintenance crews, pilots and communications man will get a break to eat, so we have to be prepared at all time,’’ he said. In such feverish times one ean’t exactly expect gourmet delights to tiekle a sailor’s palate. But the Navy = _at least on the Intrepid — tries to keep its men a aa .

The lieutenant was quick to ex- plain. “The thing is, no matter what kind of roast we serve — even roast port or veal — they think it’s roast beef,’’ he said. i When the Intrepid is at sea, the lieutenant said, ‘Food is one of the chief morale fac+ tors. That’s when all they * have to do is eat, sleep and work.” \" han Lt. enlisted men’s general mess, It was still no homey dining room, but and his predecessors had Per hea minor miracles in 4 Rane ping that has extended ov the past year, The bright yellows in drapes fighting equipment anges ane g that hid fir wer replacing the melancholy green that still covers other walls and’ decks.

Not exactly what I'd ex- pected to find on one of the Navy’s most famous aircraft carriers. f The soda bar, which offers quick pick-me-ups to alleviate rumbling stomachs, was somewhat akin to a Parisian street scene. Tiffany shades hung from the ceiling, and cafe chairs and tables with checkered cloths were scat- tered around a mock wishing well entwined with plastic flowers. A perfect setting for international dinners held to break up the monotony of seafaring the occasional routine. Now I understood what Lt Craig meant when he said he as finds his job more “creative” than some other shipboard duties.

They also use the city service. “Tf the independent com- pany can handle it, we'll have to increase the frequency of collections,” said a manage- ment aide. “Otherwise we'll stack it up on the street.” A spokesman _ predicted “curb to curb trashcans throughout the city, as well as an increase in vermin.” She said Executive House owners probably will have to hire extra mainteaance personnel to pick up the garbage in the present in- cinerator rooms on 2ach floor and take it down to street level. \\ Such service probably won't be offered at lower cost apartments, and most owners admitted their'tenants wil! be expected at least to carry the rubbish down to a basement collection room, if not to cart it all the way outside to a dumpster, And those outdoor dumpsters could create another problem, Y Most city apartment buildings are back-to-back Structures, with only a2 minimal amount of space, all of it required by law for parking, _...Those.big-metal containers’ ‘suddenly deposited in a park- ing space or wedged in between buildings could pose difficulties for pick up, and more important, for easy ac- cess in case of an emergency such as a fire. Fire Marshall Ralph Marone said the department “naturally will be concerned about excess amounts of com- bustible material sitting around outside and about ac- cess to buildings,” Other public servants wor- tying about the coming trash explosion include those in the health and public works departments. Holbrook Bourne, director of environmental health for the Hartford Health Depari- ment, will be charged with enforcing the state regula- tions, Beginning Oct. 12, Bourne said his staff of “four and a half” sanitarians will take on the added duties of checking out the incinerator situation at more than 300 addresses in the city where the old-style incinerators are known to be in use. Bourne said his four regular sanitarians, men specially trained for such ins spections, and one inspestor, a position demanding several years less experience, will carry the brunt of the load. He may also get some assistance from the housing code enforcement inspectors, , Bourne explained that his department is supposed to have six sanitarians just to carry out regular duties, which include investigating all complaints such as air pollution or nuisances, and in- specting all businesses deal- ing in food. Anticipating the need for more men this fall, Bourne put in a budget request to cover salaries for three nore Sanitariens. The city ad- ministration refused him the money. Bourne's staff not only must look-in on incinerators, . but also will inspect the - method of storing refuse. Bourne said a man can make seven or eight in- spections a day — if he has no other duties. _ Bernard Batycki, the man in charge of the city’s Public Works Depertment, said he has no plans to step up refuse REDPRPPPPrIre red ... confident the city's incinerator can handle the ex- tra waste ; iti i te) Temoval.

        "ocr_text": "City Park Becomes Jail For a Little Old Lady By MARCIA KUNSTEL Times Staff Writer - If was a sunny afternoon and she was just minding her own business, but yesterday a little old lady ended up be- hind bars in Hartford. It wasn’t behind the bars of a jail, but she was just as securely locked in as if she’d been assigned to sit in a maximum security prison. The wrinkled, white-haired little woman, who looked like a good grandmother to some- body, was incarcerated acci- dentally in Porter Memorial Park, a park “For Women and Small Children Only’? at Gro- ton and Wyllys Streets. She helplessly explained to consoling onlookers that the whole thing was a big mistake. Somehow, the groundskeeper came by two hours earlier than he should have, securely chain-locked the gates and turned the park into a prison, The woman, who refused to give her name, placidly trod from one gate to another, showing passers-by that she was, indeed, interned—for the first time in her obviously long life. She gazed up at the pointed iron fence-posts that surround the small park and said with- out a whole lot of conviction that she’d ‘‘climb the fence if I have to.” Thanks to the aid of Hart- ford’s police and fire depart- ments, she didn’t have to. Fireman William Johnson and Policeman Alfred Hague, who were at the scene to douse a minor fire down the street at SS. Cyril and Meth- odius School, proved to be her knights in shining armor, As Hague said a few com- forting words, Johnson Speed- ily retrieved some huge lock- cutters from the firetruck gear and freed the woman. By 2:45 p.m. she was re- turned to the outside world, after just 15 minutes of cell life.

In its own front-page obituary edged in black, the evening paper described it- self as “a newspaper strangled by litiga- tion” and declared that the lawsuits in which it had been embroiled fo- the last - | year had “gravely injured” its advertising land readership and “steadily ezoded” its position. The Htigation stems from the sale of \"The Times in 1973 for $8 million by the Gannett Company to the Register Publish- ing Company, publishers of The New Haven Register and The New Haven Jour- nal-Courier, Last year, Lionel S. Jackson, president of the Register Publishing Com- pany, brought suit against Gannett, charging that the sale had been based on fraudulent profit-and-loss figures and inflated circulation records. Other Htigation involved members of Mr. Jackson's family, who hac tried to prevent his purchase of The Times. Later they brought suit to rescind Mr. Jackson’s acquisition of the newspaper. There have been no rulings in any of these court actions; which have been prominently cevered in Connecticut newspapers. Pattern of Circulation At the end of World War H, The Hart- ford Times had a circulation of 85,000. Its rival, The Hartford Courant, a morn- ing - newspaper, had a circulation of 46,000. The readership of both papers grew dramatically for the next 20 years. In 1965, The Courant, with a circulation of 136.000, finally surpassed The Times, which then had a circulation of '34,000. Since then The Courant circulation has eontinued to rise, while The Times leveled off until 1972 and then began to plum- met. That year it had a a circulation of 132,060, according to Audit Bureau of Circulation figures. BY, the foHowing year it was down to 123, and now it is at 69,000. The Courant has a circulation of 183,000, according to A.B.C. figures. Courant to Increase Press Run No one at The Times or the Register Publishing Company was available for comment yesterday. But in many ways it is evident that the demise of The Times is similar to that of evening papers around the country, which have found themselves going out of business as living habits and reading habits have changed and the evening news on television fas replaced the evening paper. Hartford now joins 14 other United States cities that have lost at least one newspaper since the end of 1971. This leaves 41 cities with two or more sepa- rately owned and published daily news- papers, according to figures from the oe Hartford Times staff members appea American Newspaper Publishers Associa- tion. The Hartford Courant announced that it had no plans to buy The Times or to put out an evening newspaper. Accord- ing to Richard E. Mooney, executive edi- tor and vice president, The Courant will increase its press run by 6,200 copies. Last year The Times asked the anti- trust division of the United States De- partment of Justice for an opinion on its proposal to sell its nontangible assets to The Hartford Courant. At that time, six smaller Connecticut newspapers “voiced their opposition to such a proposal and in Fi the Justice Department in- formed The Times that it would look negatively on the proposed transaction.

The Times cited as one of the reasons for closing the “harassments from other Connecticut publishers which resulted in an adverse Justice Department decision.” Rumors have been flying for months |\" that The Times would shut down im- mediately, Last week, 50 empicyees were laid off.

You want to put top government officials on the hot seat for failing to protect the public interest or maybe it’s a sear- ing expose of a million-dollar corporation that's on your mind.

They are William Ferretti, who heads the Connecticut project, Charles Dattola, whose domain for the sum- a RELATED STORY, PAGE 16B mer is the Consumer Pro- tection Department, and William Johnson, who is haunting the halls of the In- surance Department. They don’t come across as the high pressure type of angry young men usually associated with Nader’s notorious team of in- vestigators — not until they want something from you. Just for example, they refused to grant an interview without a reporter’s promise to include a pitch for the volunteer help they so vitally need. (Volunteers contact Ferretti, 407 Canner St., New Haven.) 4 _They disavow any attempts. to label their project an «* investigation,’’ preferring instead the milder term “study,” and generally paint a low key picture of the work they're doing in Hartford. Ferretti explained that the bulk of their time is con- -sumed_ with. interviewing persons inside and outside the departments they are ‘‘stu- dying,’®” and with examinin files of historical and lega documents, legislative hear- ings and newspaper records. All three say the two state commissioners, Francis Gersz in consumer protection and William Cotter in insurance, ‘have been cooperative all the way down the line. The commissioners have opened their doors and their files and cleared the way for interviews between their staff members and the Nader team. “It’s been kind of disap- pointing in-a way,’’ Ferretti said, ““we were all ready for opposition.*’ The Raiders usually are close-mouthed about their work until they one day drop a bombshell. That day will come sometime in the late summer or early fall. < The Man himself may release findings from _ the study — Ferretti said Nader is expected in Hartford later this summer. But complete details of what's going on in Connecticut’s constmer and insurance affairs eventually will be published by Nader’s Center for the Study of Responsive Law. By that time Ferretti, Dat- tola and Johnson will be back to graduate school. Dattela will head for Boston University’s law school! while the others will be found ji Yale's halls of ivy, Johnson studying law and Ferretti public health. They will depend on loans, fellowships and paid research work to get through the year, since a Raider’s paycheck was described as ‘‘starvation wages.’ (‘‘At best you could say it’s a very modest sum” — Ferretti.) The men obviously haven't joined the consumer advocate business for the money, The reasons they give for putting in a summer of hard work _ generally boil down to idealis- mand commitment. “Tt’s mainly an interest in consumer problems,” Ferretti said. ‘‘This is an opportunity to get action.’’ , He noted that individuals often call with specific pro- ‘blems they’d like the Nader men to tackle. ““We just can’t entertain those _ problems when we're dealing with broader, public problems.’’ Dattoela and Johnson agreed their interest in law led them to the consumer scene. “My approach is that it’s lawyers and the legal system that have allowed the situa-| tion where the consumer is at with panies and. government,’’ Johnson said. “T want to use the tools tha put consumers in that position to take them out of it.”” July 26, 1970 \f"
