        "ocr_text": "Soviets urge ‘radical’ cuts in nuclear arms By Joseph Albright Cox News Service GENEVA, Switzerland — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko called on the United States Sunday to negotiate agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space and at the same time move toward “radical reductions in nuclear arms.” The 75-year-old Gromyko delivered one of his most conciliatory-sounding statements in years as he arrived from Moscow for two days of path- making nuclear arms talks with Secretary of State George Shultz. There was no public reaction from Shultz, who flew into Geneva earlier Sunday and said little upon his arrival other than that President Reagan had sent him on “a mission for peace.” In his brief remarks at the wind-whipped, snow-bound Geneva airport, where the tempera- “ ture hovered below 5 degrees, Shultz did say: “I look forward to discussing the important arms contro] issues with Mr. Gromyko, and I hope our meetings will set our countries on a path toward new negotiations and equitable and verifiable agreements.” As the curtain on the long-awaited U.S.-Sovi- et “Thrilla in Geneva” prepared to open Monday, the makeup of the American delegation seemed to suggest that the Reagan administration, while talking tough in public, may now be ready to strike a deal to cap the twin superpower arse- nals of nuclear destruction. The Associated Press George Shultz and Andrei Gromyko in Geneva Sunday month interruption. It was the first Shultz and Gromyko*plan to meet for seven and a half hours over the next two days — in a se- ries of three 24-hour sessions Mon- day morning, Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning. If necessary, their talks will extend to a fourth session Tuesday afternoon, Ameri- can aides said. The clearest sign of Washing- ton’s heightened interest in serious bargaining was the surprise decision by Reagan to send his national se- curity adviser, Robert McFarlane, to Geneva to participate in the talks along with Shultz. Unlike some of Reagan’s more hawkish officials in the Pentagon and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, McFarlane developed dur- ing Reagan's first term something of a reputation for favoring “half a loaf” compromises designed to keep arms negotiations moving. Shultz, in a press conference aboard his Air Force jetliner en route from Washington, disclosed that only he, McFarlane and three other Americans will do the actual talking with the Soviets. Others on this “first team” of negotiators are Paul Nitze, Shultz’s senior arms control adviser, Arthur Hartman, a He saree diplomat serving as .S. ambassador to Moscow; and Wa tLO< ne Wh an-speakin Jack Matlock, the Russian-speaking Soviet expert on the National Secu- rity Council staff, who has served as deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Another 22 U.S. arms control advisers also flew here to take part in strategy sessions between the Shultz-Gromyko meetings. Among the 22 who will not get a chance to see the Soviets across the table are Gen. Edward Rowny, a hard-liner who headed the U.S. delegation to the suspended START talks, and Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle, who has op- posed the State Department for its alleged i to give away too much in the 1981-83 U.S.-Soviet arms talks. When this reporter spotted Perle in a hotel corridor Sunday and asked him for an interview, the De- fense Department official said he could say nothing unless he is autho- rized to talk by Shultz’s press spokesman. In his arrival remarks, Shultz made no mention of the administra- tion’s $26 billion, five-year Star Wars military space research pro- gram — an initiative that evidently sparked the Soviets to return to nu- clear arms negotiations after a 13- comparable break in superpower distinctly optimistic flavor nuclear talks in three decades. But his arrival statement had a especial- Gromyko, quite possibly aiming ly in contrast to his statement last his remarks at Western audiences. read his formal statement in En- te something he rarely does. romyko once served as the Soviet ambassador in Washington and speaks English well. He refrained from directly criti- cizing the Reagan administration for its Star Wars research. And he did not repeat the passionate Soviet objections to the stationing of ap- proximately 100 American Pershing 2 and cruise missiles since Decem- ber 1983 in West Germany, Italy and Britain. “The Soviet Union is in favor of working out basic guidelines to ori- ent the negotiations toward reaching mutually acceptable accords which would prevent an arms race in out- er space and at the same time en- sure advancement along the path of radical reductions of nuclear arths and in the long run the complete elimination of nuclear weapons,” Gromyko said. The Gromyko statement con- tained no indication of changes in the bedrock Soviet positions in past nuclear negotiations. All the same, the —— tone that has charac- terized Gromyko’s public remarks in recent months was absent.

        "ocr_text": "U.S., Soviets agree to 3 sets of talks One round to focus on curbing space arms race By Joseph Albright Cox News Service GENEVA, Switzerland — The United States and the Soviet Union agreed Wednesday night to enter into an ambi- tious long-term negotiation aimed at nothing less than “preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth.” Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko issued a joint statement announcing that the two nations undertook to form three new interconnected sets of arms talks. One set of talks — virtually demand- ed by Gromyko as a price for any further arms negotiations — will focus on “pre- venting an arms race in space.” __ Talks in the space forum will cover President Reagan’s much-ballyhooed Star Wars anti-ballistic missile project as well as Soviet anti-missile defenses, Shultz told a late-night press conference. The second set of new talks will cov- er intermediate-range missiles and bomb- ers — Western weapons based in Europe able to hit the Soviet Union as well as Soviet SS-20 missiles and bombers able to strike deep into Western Europe. The third arms forum will encompass strategic nuclear arms such as the huge Soviet SS-18 intercontinental missiles and the soon-to-be-deployed American MX missiles. The two latter negotiations will amount to a resumption of strategic and intermediate-range talks that were bro- ken off by the Soviet Union in December 1983 to protest the U.S. deployment of cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in Europe. “We cannot be sure where these nego- tiations will lead, and clearly we have a long road ahead of us,” Shultz told re- — at the conclusion of his 14% Disarmament Agency, told reporters later that it was only within the last hour of bargaining Tuesday after- noon that “it became apparent” to the American side that Gromyko would make a deal. Although Gromyko agreed to re- sume negotiations on nuclear weap- ons after a-13-month hiatus, the So- viet side was not claiming the statement as any milestone on the road to an. overall improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations. ’ Soviet Foreign Ministry spokes- man Vladimir Lomeiko, asked at a press conference whether he saw a resumption of detente in the offing, replied, “I wouldn’t jump to conclu- sions on this subject.” The key paragraphs of the state- ment read: “The sides agree that the sub- ject of the negotiations will be a complex of questions ccncerning Space and nuclear arms — both strategic and intermediate-range — with all these questions considered and resolved in their interrelationship. “The objective of the negotia- tions will be to work out effective agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth, at limiting and reducing nuclear arms, and at strengthening strategic stability. The negotiations will be conducted by a delegation from each side divided into three groups. “The sides believe that ultimate- ly the furthcoming negotiations, just as efforts in general to limit and re- duce arms, should lead to the com- plete elimination of nuclear arms everywhere.” _ Shultz said the two nations would decide within the next month when and where the three-pronged negotiations would open. He de- clined to say who might head the U.S. delegation or any of its three separate squads of negotiators. Edward Rowny, who headed the U.S. delegation to the suspended strategic arms talks, said he antici- pated the site would be Geneva and that he would remain in charge of the strategic talks. The forthcoming talks loom as more complex than Ford and Carter administration arms talks with the Russians. The reason-is that pro- gress on one front — say cruise missiles — will be linked by the terms of the new agenda to prog- ress on all other arms issues, in- cluding the future of space weapons. What essentially happened is that Gromyko agreed to take Rea- gan up on his vaguely worded pro- posal last September for “umbrella” talks involving the entire spectrum of arms issues. Shultz made it clear that he and Gromyko left the two-day talks with sharply differing views on the desir- ability of both sides’ shifting to an emphasis on anti-missile defenses, as Reagan has championed ie his Star Wars research plan. The announcement and late- night press conferences left @ host of unanswered questions, including these: @ Will the U.S. Air Force pro- ceed with its propesss test this spring of a fighter-carried rocket that is designed to shoot down ene- my satellites? Shultz said the two sides agreed on no ‘“preconditions’’ concerning the scheduled anti-satellite test. But other U.S. delegation members said that during the talks with Gromyko, Shultz reiterated U.S. willingness to accept “restraints” on the anti-satel- lite tests once the pegotiations get under way. @ Can the Reagan administra- tion reach an internal consensus on details of the negotiating positions it will put forth in the talks, especially on the unexplored and controversial subject of space weapon limits? @ Will the United States contin- ue to deploy Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe? So far, approxi- mately 100 of the planned 572 inter- mediate-range missiles have been installed — substantially fewer than the Soviet SS-20, SS-4 and SS-5 in- termediate-range missiles they were designed to offset. @ Will the onset of arms negoti- ations be regarded in Moscow and Washington as sufficiently encourag- ing to justify a summit conference between Reagan and Soviet Presi- dent Konstantin Chernenko? As of Tuesday night, sources on both sides were maintaining that the subject of a summit conference never came up in the Shultz-Gromyko talks. Atlanta Constitution - January 9, 1985 \f"

A Bulgarian statement this week flatly rejected the main elements of this story, saying reports of forcible name changes are “sheer fabrica- tion.” Any roadblocks that might be seen in the region are ‘‘normal”’ consequences of winter weather, the rcent of the population of 9 mil- ion, but statistics indicate their birth rate is double that of Bulgari- ans, who make up 85 to 90 percent of the population. The crux of the Bulgarian posi- tion is this: “Bulgarian legislation is broadly democratic and places all citizens in a status of complete equality. Among the rights it guarantees is the right of every Bulgarian citizen to choose for himself a name, and to change it if he so wishes. No Bul- garian citizen is deprived of this right.” But an ethnic Turk told Western statement said. However, interviews with unoffi- cial sources in several parts of Bul- garia yielded a different picture: a normally passive Turkish minority stirred with dismay and occasional fury. Notwithstanding the vehemence of official denials, credible unoffi- cial sources say at least a dozen name-change resisters have been killed by Bulgarian militiamen in the last two months. Most of the reported violence occurred last month in a heavily Turkish border town called Momcil- grad, which apparently remains sur- journalists that a Bulgarian militia- man entered his home in Kardzali province a few weeks ago and de- manded his old identity card, which bore his Turkish name. By his account, the militiaman then filled out a mimeographed change-of-name petition on his be- half. The document was a request to Kardzali local authorities to give him a new Bulgarian name and a new identity card. The Turk said he tried to avoid signing the petition but agreed after the militiaman grabbed him by the back of the neck. “There is no more Turkish — it rounded by Bulgarian tanks and mi- litia geipforcements sent in from as far a 600 miles away. Despite episodes of resistance, thoseyinterviewed agreed that Bul!- gariag ‘authorities have achieved a massschangeover of names in only threeymonths, convincing the major- ity of the 300,000 Turks in southern Bulgaria to sign petitions asking to be assigned Slavic names. The alleged campaign culmi- wnates a sporadically enforced but longstanding effort to assimilate the ‘country’s 700,000-member Turkish minority into the population. Ethnic Turks make up only 8 is finished,” he said. He showed reporters his new temporary identity card, which conr sisted of a piece of paper with hig new name in ballpoint pen and a round official stamp in the lower left corner. The date on the papef corresponded to when the man sai militiamen came to his house. ' Journalists were not allowed t@ enter Momcilgrad, the reported cent ter of Turkish resistance.

The move is aimed at discredit- the Bulgarians, in October in Rome for allegedl driving Agca to St. Peter’s Squar and telling him the best firing an gles for assassinating the pope. Bulgarian Interior Ministry offi cial Iordan Ormankov, been investigating possible Bulgari. an complicity in the papal shooting for two years, told an internationa Press conference that Agca is _ the only one who will face trial in Sofiz as a result of the just-completec Bulgarian inquiry.

Italy, where Agca is now serv- ing a life sentence for shooting the pope, has shown no inclination to turn Agca over to Bulgaria or any- one else. And Bulgaria has shown no readiness to surrender for trial the two former officials of the Bulgari- an Embassy in Rome, Todor Aiva- zov and Zheylo Vassilev, who re- turned to Sofia before the first Italian arrest warrants were lodged against them in 1982. Nor, it was confirmed Wednes- day, is Bulgaria ready to let Italian authorities try Bekir Celenk, a re- oe Turkish heroin smuggler liv- ng in Bulgaria who was charged in the Italian indictment as being the facilitator who passed a $1.25 mil- lion assassination contract from the Bulgarian secret service to Agca. Ormankov said of Celenk: ‘‘He is no longer regarded as a suspect. We consider him as a witness. ... The only limitation is that he is not free to leave Bulgaria.”’ Quizzed repeatedly by Italian journalists, Ormankov maintained that the Bulgarian ‘‘competent au- thorities’” have not received a for- mal extradition request for Celenk, whom Agca has described as a big- league Turkish mafia smuggler who introduced him to a Bulgarian se- cret service agent in Sofia during July 1980. Half a dozen Italian journalists insisted, some heatedly, that the Italian Foreign Ministry sent a note to Bulgaria in November 1983 seek- ing Celenk’s extradition on drug and weapons smuggling charges as well as complicity in the papal shooting. Ormankov replied that Italy has not provided “‘concrete evidence” or a documented request through offi- cial channels. Celenk is thought to be living in a Sofia apartment under surveillance of Bulgarian au ties. The only Bulgarian whom the Italians have to put in the dock is Sergei Antonov, a former Bulgarian airline manager now under house arrest in Rome.

        "ocr_text": " Gromyko seeks Italian support Soviet might meet pope as he enlists space weapons foes By Joseph Albright Cox News Service ROME — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko was due to arrive here Monday hop- ing to enlist Italian officials and maybe even Pope John Paul II in his campaign against American antimissile weapons in space. Gromyko has planned a 3%- day visit to Rome, followed by a trip to Madrid for several days of meetings with Spanish leaders. Official news outlets in Mos- cow have attached considerable importance to the meetings with Italian officials. Commentaries by the Novosti news agency have stressed ‘‘positive” aspects of So- viet-Italian relations, without mentioning that Italy is one of three NATO countries that ac- cepted new American nuclear missiles in December 1983. The main suspense in Rome has been over whether Gromyko will meet the Polish-born pope. An Italian newspaper, Cor- riere della Sera, reported on Sun- day that Gromyko will definitely meet the pope This was in line with hints ON 3%-DAY VISIT TO ROME Foreign Minister Gromyko dropped last week by Italian and Soviet diplomats. However, the Vatican, which seldom discloses papal audiences in advance, has not announced a meeting. “God knows what will hap- pen,” said one Vatican official Friday. “We'll just have to stay tuned in.” Gromyko’s visit to Rome fol- lows three years of wary tension between the Vatican and the Kremlin. Since late 1982, John Paul has been blamed by Soviet news- papers for instigating ‘subversive activities” in Poland. Last Au- gust, the Soviet government de- nied the pope permission to visit the heavily Catholic Soviet repub- lic of Lithuania to help celebrate the 500th anniversary of the death of St. Casimir, Lithuania’s patron saint. After the attempted assassi- nation of John Paul in May of 1981, the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, has been linked publicly to the shooting. Turkish terrorist Mehmet Ali Agca, who fired the shots, claims the KGB and Bulgarian agents gave him assistance. Although there are no diplo- matic ties between Moscow and the Vatican, the redoubtable Gro- myko may well have more expe- rience in conferring with popes than any other foreign minister in the world. Gromyko began his series of papal encounters in 1965 — eight years after he became foreign minister — when he met the late Pope Paul VI at the United Na- tions. In the next decade, Gromy- ko met Paul four more times at the Vatican. Gromyko had a Vatican meeting with the current pope, John Paul, on Jan. 24, 1979, a few months after he left his con- gregation in Poland to become pontiff. They reportedly talked for two hours in Russian without interpreters. Atlanta Constitution - February 25, 1985 \f"

It was an ted round for Andrei Gromyko, the 75-year-old So- viet foreign minister, in the continu- ing U.S.-Soviet competition for world opinion in advance of the Ge- neva arms and space talks that are due to begin in 12 days. Gromyko, in Rome for his first trip to a European NATO country since the arrival of U.S. cruise and Pershing missiles, also conferred for Pope Paul I. Along with discussions about cariy tre hours Wednesday with. peace, the pope reportedly gave Gromyko an earful about the rights of Catholics in the Soviet Union. In a joint communique issued by the Italian government following Gromyko’s talks with Italian offi- cials, the two sides declared: “The parties repeat that their ultimate objective is general and complete disarmament under effec- tive international control. This will require the setting aside of outer space for exclusively peaceful uses, as well as complete and general elimination of nuclear and every type of armaments.” There was nothing in the joint statement that criticized military space research while “ultimate ob- jectives” are being sought through negotiations. This ambiguity will no doubt allow Italian officials to say they support the U.S. “Star Wars” project during its research phase. At talks between Gromyko and Secretary of State George Shultz in Geneva last month, the United States: and. the Soviet. Union agreed that the objective of th arms talks would be effective agreements ‘‘aimed at preventing Atlanta Constitution - February 28, 1985 future . an arms race in space and termi- nating it on earth. ...” However, the American side carefully refrained from accepting the Soviet formula- tion that space must be “demilitarized.” Of the pope's first meeting with a Soviet leader since the martial law crackdown in his native Poland in 1981, a Vatican spokesman. would only say that the two men discussed “peace in the world and the situa- tion of Catholics in the Soviet Union.” There was no discussion of the pope’s deeply-cherished desire to visit Catholics inside the Soviet. Union, Gromko told a reporter dur- ing a photo-taking session. Last Au- gust, the pope disclosed that Soviet authorities had denied his request to visit Soviet Lithuania. While the pope’s words to Gro- myko remained secret, journalists covering the Vatican have gotten authoritative leaks in the last 48 hours on what the Catholic hierar- chy was preparing to ask Grotnyko on behalf of the estimated 12 to 13 million Catholics in the U.S.S.R. \f"

The draft treaty, whici attract- ed relatively little notice at the time, would require all nations ‘“‘not to utilize space objects in orbit on celestial bodies or stationed in outer space in any oth- er manner as means to destroy any targets on Earth, in the atmosphere, or in outer space.” Sources in the U.S. dclegation said Sunday that the Reagan admin- istration is not prepared to give the Soviets any draft treaty on space weaponry. “In space, we are starting with a clean piece of paper to a certain extent,” said U.S. delegation spokes- man Joseph Lehman.

It was Kvitsinsky who met se- cretly with U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze to reach the off-the-record “walk-in-the-woods\"” deal in mid- 1982 that was subsequently dis- avowed by both sides. Karpov, the overall Soviet dele- gation chairman, has a second hat as chairman of the Soviet negotiat- ing group on “strategic” arms such as the MX and Soviet SS-18. His American counterpart will be for- mer Sen. John Tower (R-Texas). Karpov, 56, has been bargaining about long-range missiles since 1969, as a member of the Soviet SALT I team and chief of the SALT Il and START delegations. The third and least-known of the main Soviet bargainers is Aleksei Obukov, 46, who will face veteran American negotiator Marvin Glit- man on intermediate-range weapons in Europe.

        "ocr_text": "The Aesccisted Press Chief Soviet delegate Viktor Karpov (from left) meets U.S. team: members Maynard Glitman, Joseph Lehman, John Tower and Max Kampelman ¥ Soviets: Space wea By Joseph Albright Cox News-Service GENEVA — Soviet negotiator Viktor Karpov opened a new round of U.S.-Soviet arms talks on Tuesday by emphasizing that there can be no deals on anything else until the United States comes to terms on preventing a race in space weaponry. Karpov told reporters before the ses- sion that Mikhail Gorbachev, the new So- viet leader, presided last Thursday over the Soviet Politburo meeting at which his negotiating instructions were approved. That was three days before Konstantin Chernenko died. This highly unusual bit of candor about Kremlin decision-making appeared to signal Moscow’s desire to associate the new Soviet leader immediately with the Soviet objectives of using the talks to shoot down the American Star Wars re- search project. Before the meeting began, Karpov warmly greeted the U.S. delegation lead- er, Max M. *Kampelman, saying he hoped Tuesday’s session would be: ‘one. of the first in a series. that. we..will. negotiate, . and reach an agreement.” The ghext ses- sion will be held Thursday. After the two hour and forty-five min- ute meeting, Kampelman read a brief statement to a jammed news conference, saying the two sides ‘had a serious and businesslike discussion of the issues.” Cit- - ing an agreement with Ka v on “confi- dentiality”’ of the negotiations, Kampel- man declined to answer questions from the lectern. The so-called Negotiations on Nuclear and Space Arms began 474 days after So- viet bargainers walked out of the last Ge- neva nuclear talks when U.S. cruise and Pershing missiles arrived in Europe. In the interval, the two sides have placed more than 150 new intermediate- range nuclear missiles on their firing lines — about one every 3.2 days. Be- tween them, the newly installed missiles carry roughly 250 new warheads, each three to ten times as powerful as the Hi- roshima bomb. After the meeting Tuesday, U.S. dele- gates relayed their impressions to a panel of about 20 congressional ‘‘observers” at a classified “debriefing.” “This was just the preliminary skir- mish and a very short one at that,” said mnry tops list U.S. House Minority Leader Robert Mi- chel (R-Ill.). in summarizing what he learned of the U.S.-Soviet encounter. American strategy at the talks is to move gradually toward detaching the more cut-and-dried questions on long- range and intermediate-range missile from the new, bitterly contentious issue of how to prevent an arms race in space. Karpov has thrown the Americans a tactical knuckle ball by resisting at least initially the U.S. desire to split the negoti- ations into three relatively independent sets of negotiating tables. The first indication of differences came at a preliminary agenda-setting meeting Monday between executive secre- taries of the two delegations. The Soviets sent only one official, while the United States had one official dealing with each of the three negotiating issues. The pattern repeated itself at the for- mal opening of talks on Tuesday. Kampel- man arrived with the two other principal American negotiators, former Sen. John “Tower (R-Texas) and foreign service offi- cer Maynard Glitman, but Karpov \\ was the only Soviet negotiator present. ., Atlanta Constitution - March 13, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bergen-Belsen: ‘Everywhere are memories’ By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BELSEN, West German — “Some- where here lies Anne Frank,” said Presi- dent Reagan, a catch in his throat. “Everywhere here are memories — pulling us, touching us, making us under- stand that they can never be erased.” When the president reached out above the mass graves Sunday for a phrase that would be memorable, he quoted the 15- year-old Dutch girl whose diary survived the war even though she died here at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He quoted this passage from “The Dia- ry of Anne Frank”: “I can feel the suffering of millions, and yet, if I looked up into the heavens I think that it will all come right, that this cruelty too will end and that peace and tranquility will return again.” The enormity of the slaughter before the British liberated this camp April 15, 1945, was such that no one has ever seen fit to erect an individual marker for Anne Frank. Instead, there are markers on mass graves that read: “Here Lie 2,500, Dead” ... “Here Lie 1,000 Dead” ... “Here Lie 5,000 Dead.” And 150 yards to the left of where Reagan spoke, there is a sign with an even ghastlier import. It is the sign on top of the razed ruins of the camp's crematorium: “Here lie an unknown number of dead.” Reagan, who added this stop to defuse domestic criticism of his decision to visit the Bitburg cemetery, climaxed his speech here with the ringing phrase ‘never again.” In attempting to personalize his feel- ings, Reagan chose to talk about two teen- agers who died in 1945. When he spoke at the Bitburg Air Base, he talked of Hans Vinson, a German sol- dier whose grave is among the 2,000 in the nearby Bitburg cemetery. Like Anne Frank, Vinson died just a month before his 16th birthday. “Perhaps if that 15-year-old soldier had lived,” Reagan said, “he would have joined his fellow countrymen in building this new Democratic Federal Republic of Germany, devoted to human dignity and the defense of freedom, that we celebrate today.” Atlanta Constitution - May 6, 1985 \f"

His historic symbol was a wreath of white lilies, blue irises and red gerbera. It bore a printed inscription: “The President of the United States.” @ President Reagan recovers from blunder of Bitburg, says Associate Editor Bill Shipp. Page 8-A @ The memory of Holocaust victim Anne Frank comes alive at Bergen-Belsen ceremony. Page 8-A. His theme, enunciated half an hour lat- er in front of West German and American troops massed ‘on the runway of Bitburg Air Base, was “reconciliation” — a noun he hammered out five times in a speech televised live in America and Germany. “We who were enemies are now friends,” Reagan said. “In the place of fear we have sown trust, and out of the ruins of war has blossomed an enduring peace.” To World War II veterans, Reagan said: “Our gesture of reconciliation with the German people today in no way mini- mizes our love and honor for those who fought and died for our country.” Acknowledging the furor over the Bit- burg cemetery visit, Reagan said, “Some old wounds have been reopened, and this I regret \"very much, because this should be a time of healing.” To Holocaust survivors, he added: “Your terrible suffering has made you ever vigilant against evil. Many of you are wor- ried that reconciliation means forgetting. I promise you, we will never forget.” See BITBURG, Page 8-A MONDAY, MAY 6, 1985 SPORTS FINAL The Associated Pres: President and Mrs. Reagan share quiet moment with Chancellor Helmut Kohl at Bergen-Belsen death camy \fContinued From Page 1-A In reference to President John F. Ken- nedy’s declaration at the Berlin Wall 22 years ago, Reagan said: “Today, freedom-loving people around the world must say, ‘I am a Berliner. I am a Jew in a world still threatened by anti- Semitism. I am an Afghan, and I am a prisoner of the gulag. I am a refugee in a crowded boat foundering off the coast of Vietnam. I am a Laotian, a Cambodian, a Cuban and a Miskito Indian in Nicaragua. “I, too, am a potential victim of to- talitarianism,’” the president said. Afterward, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said, “I thank you, Mr. Presi- dent, for the whole German people, and I thank you personally as a friend, for taking a walk with me. You are welcome as friend, ally and guarantor of our security.” After nearly a month of boiling world- wide controversy, the visit to Bitburg’s Kolmeshohe war cemetery was suddenly over. When Reagan finished addressing the troops at the air base, he broke into a smile of relief and kissed his wife, Nancy, on the forehead. When a reporter asked him for his as- sessment of the day, after a state dinner in Bonn, Reagan paused for an instance, then replied, “It’s been a wonderful day.” Sunday night, in a toast heralded by trumpets, Reagan told the final state din- ner of his trip to Germany: “I hope the Federal Republic (of Germany) will join us in this effort. “The United States is moving forward with a research program that could offer a technological path into the sunshine, a way to diminish the threat of nuclear annihila- tion,” Reagan said, continuing a drive for Star Wars support made at a seven-nation economic summit last week. Willy Brandt, a former socialist chan- cellor who has been critical of U.S. defense policies, skipped the dinner, reportedly be- cause Reagan declined an invitation for a private meeting. It was one of the most dramatic days of Reagan's presidency, ranking with the day President John F. Kennedy addressed angry, disappointed Cuban exiles in Mi- ami’s Orange Bowl after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. Reagan's appointment at the Bitburg cemetery was clocked by reporters as last- ing eight minutes — two minutes shorter than scheduled. After his long black bulletproof limou- sine climbed a hill, he strode onto the flower-bedecked knoll beside Kohl. Awaiting them was a corridor of mili- tary honor guards — on their right, 10 blue-suited U.S. Air Force enlisted people, seven men and three women, and on their left, 10 red-bereted, khaki-clad West Ger- man paratroopers. After a two-minute walk, the two lead- W.A. BRIDGES/Statt Limousine carrying Reagan and Kohl approaches Kolmeshohe Cemetery ers found themselves on a walkway in front of the cemetery, where they faced Reagan's wreath and another sent by Kohl. As West German army bandsmen tapped a soft drum roll, Reagan stiffly stepped forward and placed his right hand on the wreath. To his left, a pace away, stood retired U.S. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, still spry at 90, the American paratrooper hero who fought the Germans from the Normandy battlefield clear across Germany. To his right stood Kohl, and then re- tired German Gen. Johannes Steinhoff. 71, a World War II Luftwaffe ace who is cred- ited by some sources with having shot down several hundred Allied planes, many from his Messerschmidt 262. After touching the respective wreaths for a few seconds, the four men stepped backward. A German army bugler played “Ich Hatt’ Einen Kameraden” (I had a comrade), the haunting dirge that German soldiers have played since World War I to commemorate fallen friends. Reagan left it to Ridgway and Stein- hoff, the two war heroes in their business suits, to clasp hands in a symbolic hand- shake. The president and Kohl stood aside a little awkwardly, as if they momentarily? had forgotten their script. W.A. BRIDGES/Statt Bitburg resident Therisia Klammt points to wreath plac ed at cemetery by Reagan to honor Germany’s war dead About three feet behind Reagan's heels was the grave of Alfred Muller, a 22-year- old Nazi Waffen SS trooper who is buried in the front row of the 2,000-grave Kolme- shohe Cemetery. Another 47 or 48 Waffen SS graves are dotted throughout the cemetery, but the markers were obscured by hundreds oj bunches of daffodils, tulips and geraniums It was the graves of the infamous Waffen SS, Hitler's elite shock troops, that became the focus of opposition by Holocaust vic- tims and some veterans groups to Reagan's visit. Reagan and Kohl had just flown 220 miles from an emotion-laden appearance at the former Bergen-Belsen Nazi concen- tration camp, As Reagan was entering Bergen-Bel- sen’s bleak, heather-covered fields, a kno of Jewish protesters from New York shout- ed at him from 40 yards away. “Come back, please, Mr. President. We don’t want you to go in there,” yelled one man from behind a German police line. It was the ugliest scene the presiden' — who wore a bulletproof trenchcoat — would confront all day inside his cocoon of Secret Service and German police security. A more painful rebuff awaited him in front of the grim gray granite wall that was to be the backdrop for the first of Reagan’s two speeches of the day. Twenty-nine Jews, most of them con- centration camp survivors, had received official German government invitations to sit in the audience, according to German protocol aides. And a rabbi had been invit- ed to deliver an invocation. Yet on the misty, leaden mor ning when the president of the United States came to mourn, only two Jews were seated in the audience.

        "ocr_text": "Reagan to urge new hot line President will seek direct link for U.S., Soviet commanders By Joseph Albright Cox News Service MADRID — President Reagan, return- ing to the United States via Spain follow- ing the economic summit in West Germa- ny, will propose that Soviet and U.S. military commanders have their own hot line to speed communications in an emer- gency, aides said Monday. White House spokesman Larry Speakes sajd the proposal would be made in a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday. _ Arriving in Madrid, Reagan and his en- tourage were greeted by an unwelcome but not unexpected warning from Spanish offi- cials that they want the United States to withdraw some of the 12,500 American troops from Spain. Spanish Foreign Minister Fernando Moran delivered the message to Secretary of State George Shultz during a two-hour meeting a few hours after the presidential party flew in from West Germany. A senior American briefer told report- ers that Moran informed Shultz that “the Spanish at some stage may want to begin a process of negotiations with the goal of a possible reduction in the U.S. presence.” Reagan officials, announcing more up- beat news, said the president plans to pro- pose a “major” step to prevent incidents such as the shooting of U.S. Army Maj. Ar- thur Nicholson or the attack on Korean Air Lines Flight 007. The aides said Reagan will suggest that Moscow and Washington agree to install a direct teletype between American military commanders and their Soviet military counterparts, A similar hot line already exists for crisis communications at the highest levels, but U.S. officials said it would be useful if opposing military commanders could com- municate directly on small, fast-breaking incidents. Speakes said the idea arose from sug- gestions by Sens. Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) and John Warner (R-Va.) and the late Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.). Reagan put forward a virtually identi- cal proposal in a Dublin speech last June, but Moscow has shown no signs of interest. -Speakes speculated that because of the accession of new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviets may now prove to be more receptive to the Dublin proposal. On Tuesday, Reagan is due to meet here for about three hours with the Spanish head of government, the 43-year-old Social. | ist premier Felipe Gonzalez. On the eve of Reagan’s arrival from West Germany, protesters marched in half a dozen Spanish cities shouting, “Reagan go home” and “Reagan — outlaw, fascist and gunslinger.” The largest protest came in Barcelona, where 225,000 demonstrators marched and some broke the glass door of the building housing the American Consul- ate, spraying paint on the exterior walls. However, Reagan's arrival was not greeted with renewed protests, A poll published Sunday in the . ed newspaper El Pais showed that only 16 percent of Spaniards believed the United States and its president are “loyal and sin- cere friends of Spain.” Another 64 percent said the United States was not their friend, Nonetheless, aides said Reagan is plan- ning to use his 41-hour stay in Madrid to underline the importance of NATO and to convey a public message that ‘freedom works.” When Reagan and Gonzalez confer, the Spanish leader is expected to criticize Rea- gan's May 1 declaration of a total trade cutoff against Nicaragua. Spain joined NATO in 1982 under a center-right government. But six months later the Socialists, led by Gonzalez, swept to power. Atlanta Constitution - May 7, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Reagan will deplore Soviet mobile missile By Joseph Albright Cox News Service MADRID — President Reagan has decided to ac- cuse the Soviet Union on Wednesday of deliberately building powerful, elusive nuclear missiles designed to “strike first” and thus disarm the United States. It is one of the harshest indictments involving weapons of nuclear annihilation from the leader of ei- ther superpower since the two nations first began arms control talks 18 years ago. The new missile, which U.S. intelligence predicts: will be deployed in 1987 or 1988, is expected to have. the range to fling up to 10 warheads at widely scat tered U.S. targets. In previous public statements, the Pentagon i called it the SS-X-24 and said it has already been flight: tested at the Soviet rocket range at Plesetsk, Siberia. The missile, about the size of the American MX, is. designed to be shuttled around the Soviet Union on rail cars to avoid detection, according to the Pentagon. = The White House said the president will make the accusation in a full-dress speech in Strasbourg, France, to a session of the European Parliament called to com-, memorate the 40th anniversary of V-E Da Skeptical critics of Reagan arms policies Tuesday: sought to dismiss the speech as an attempt by the. White House to take attention away from the Bithurg controversy and the president's cool reception in Spain. ' White House national security adviser Robert McFarlane took the unusual step Tuesday of reading portions of the prepared text in an on-the-record brief: ing during Reagan's state visit to Spain. McFarlane said he wanted to draw “particular” at- tention to Reagan’s reference to mobile multiwarhead missiles because “‘in the president's view” they present a “new dimension of the strategic equation.” McFarlane said that if the Soviets actually deploy such traveling land-based missiles, “one can imagine the time in which the president could be faced during a: crisis with not knowing how many or the location of So-. viet strategic nuclear power.” : “This is an intolerable condition, a condition which presents the Soviet Union with an apparent first-strike capability,” added McFarlane. He said the SS-X:24 presents a more “destabilizing” threat than the now-abandoned MX “race-track” scheme because the Soviet missiles “can roam the en- tire geography of the Soviet Union.” His use of the word “intolerable” was eye-catching because it is seldom used in the cut and thrust of nucle: ar negotiations, In diplomatic parlance, the word is often taken as, an ultimatum. McFarlane not only said it but also is- sued a transcript of his remarks. The Soviets are also likely to take offense because under the SALT II arms treaty signed by the Carter ad- ministration, each side was entitled to build one addi- tional type of mobile land-based missile. Both the U.S. and Soviet negotiators in 1980 under: stood that the United States would press ahead with the MX and the Soviets would build what turned out to be the S$-X-24.

        "ocr_text": "U.S., Soviets spar in V-E speeches By Joseph Albright Cox News Service STRASBOURG, France — From oppo- site ends of the European continent, Presi- dent Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev celebrated V-E Day on Wednesday with sledgehammer speeches aimed at each other’s national systems. Relations have chilled so markedly over the past month that prospects for an early Reagan-Gorbachev summit meeting now seem cloudy and the future of the Geneva arms talks looks gloomier. In Moscow, Gorbachev said in a tele- @ Queen Elizabeth II recalls sneaking out and mingling with the masses on V-E Day. Page 25-A. vised Victory Day ceremony that “fore- most among the military threats to man- kind is American militarism.” The new 54-year-old Politburo chief acknowledged that American troops made some contribution to the Soviet victory over the Nazis, along with the British, French and partisan forces. But Gorbachev went on to complain that American capitalists ‘“‘made a for- tune” out of the war and the United States has subsequently sought “historic revenge” from the Soviet Union. Reagan, in his own V-E Day anniver- sary speech to the 434-member European Parliament in Strasbourg, contrasted the successes of a democratic free-market America with the economic performance of ‘our adversaries.” “Our adversaries,” Reagan said, “can offer their people only economic stagna- tion and the corrupt hand of a state and party bureaucracy which ultimately Satisfy neither material nor spiritu- al needs.” Calling communism a “bankrupt ideology,” he pledged that the Unit- ed States “is committed to an end to the artificial division of Europe.” As expected, the president charged the Soviet Union with build- ing nuclear forces “clearly designed to strike first.’ National security adviser Robert McFarlane had tele- graphed this most powerful punch of the speech in a press briefing 24 hours earlier. Reagan — as he had done in two speeches on Sunday in West Germany — conspicuously refrained in Strasbourg from mentioning Sovi- et sacrifices or Soviet military con- tributiéns to the defeat of Nazi Ger- many. The president chose not to dis- cuss any nation’s role in winning the war, in keeping with the theme of reconciliation among current U.S. allies that has dominated his nearly completed European trip. Instead, he saluted ‘“‘America and Western Europe” for rebuilding from rubble after the war and cre- ating the NATO military alliance. Mikhail Lysenko, the spokesman of the Soviet Embassy in Washing- ton, said Wednesday that “we were disappainted at the embassy” that Reagan did not see fit to mention “the fact that the Soviet Union and America were allies in World War SILENT ON WWII SOVIET TIES President Reagan II and also the decisive role of the Soviet Union in the victory over Hitlerite fascism.” Lysenko, reached by trans-At- lantic telephone, said he cannot speak for the Soviet leadership in Moscow, ‘but I think they feel the same.” . Stubbornly held views on two is- sues peripheral to the arms race have pushed Moscow and Washing- ton further apart than they have stood since June 1984, when the two Sides began exchanging feelers about renewing the nuclear talks that finally resumed in Geneva in March. One issue is the killing of U.S. Army Maj. Arthur Nicholson by a Soviet soldier in East Germany on March 24. The other is what Moscow re- gards as a premeditated slight by Reagan of the Soviet sacrifice in winning World War II at the cost of 20 million Soviet war dead. The next arena for talking about these and other issues is a meeting scheduled next Tuesday in Vienna between Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. Another White House official, who declined to be quoted by name, told reporters Wednesday that Mos- cow’s response to the Nicholson kill- ing has been “inadequate” since there has been no Soviet apology or offer to pay compensation to Nich- olson’s family. An official traveling with Rea- gan disclosed some details of recent US.-Soviet daily dealings, details of the sort that are seldom divulged. Among the clues that suggest the in- creasing distance between Washing- ton and Moscow: @ The No. 2 official in the Sovi- et Embassy in Washington, Oleg M. Sokolov, called on the State Depart- ment “within the last few days” to say that Moscow no longer consid- ers it appropriate for the United States and the Soviet Union to ex- change messages marking the V-E Day anniversary. @ Despite this private message, Reagan decided sometime on Tues- day to dispatch a short V-E Day an- niversary message to Gorbachev. @ The U.S. ambassador in Mos- cow, Arthur Hartman, was instruct- ed late Tuesday to deliver the Rea- gan letter on Wednesday morning. Within about an hour after Hartman was supposed to deliver it, the trav- eling White House mimeographed the letter and passed it out to re- porters before the Strasbourg speech. @ Reagan has instructed Hart- man to stay away from Thursday’s huge Red Square anniversary pa- rade marking the end of the war. Hartman also passed up an invita- tion to attend Gorbachev’s speech Wednesday, which was attended by French and British ambassadors. @ The United States has also turned aside a Soviet invitation to send a “high-level” delegation to Moscow to join in the anniversary celebrations. In fact, there is not even a low-level delegation to the Soviet ceremonies. Atlanta Constitution - May 9, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Shultz, Gromyko talk, but summit unsettled By Joseph Albright Cox News Service VIENNA, Austria — Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko spoke for six hours Tuesday and then left the world hanging on whether there would be a summit conference between President Rea- gan and new Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev. “You saw ironpants Shultz and ironpants Gromyko,” reported one American at the table, adding that this was the longest meeting the two men have ever held. According to one well-informed source, Shultz restated Reagan’s de- sire to see Gorbachev in Washington next September, but Gromyko passed up the chance to give a clear response. An American briefing officer said the U.S. offer of a September summit remains on the table. The officer refused to comment when asked whether the Soviets had responded to Reagan’s summit invi- tation, which was sent to Gorbachev the day he took over as Soviet lead- er in March. Shultz and Gromyko have anoth- er opportunity to discuss a summit informally Wednesday. They are scheduled to see each other at an Austrian state ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of a treaty be- tween the wartime allies that re- sulted in the withdrawal of Soviet and Western troops from Austria. Soviet spokesmen Vladimir Lo- meiko, at a diplomatic news confer- ence, said opaquely that the two sides stressed their intentions to “strengthen the structure of their mutual relations and to fill them with concrete substance.” Lomeiko said both countries had made clear “not today, but earlier” that they have “a certain interest” in arranging a Gorbachev-Reagan summit meeting. However, the Soviet spokesman ignored a question on whether a- summit had been discussed, as did Shultz when he spoke to reporters a few minutes earlier. Shultz said he and Gromyko spent “a heavy proportion” of their six hours in a chandeliered confer- ence room at the Soviet Embassy in Vienna, talking about nuclear arms control, especially the talks sched- uled to reopen May 30 in Geneva, Switzerland. Other topics that Shultz raised, according to a later American back- ground briefing, included: @ The March 24 shooting of Ma@ Arthur Nicholson, an American Army reconnaissance officer, by a Soviet sentry in East Germany. @ The status of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, who is in internal exile in the Soviet Union. Lomeiko said Gromyko replied that this was not a proper subject for discussion because it was “an internal mat- ter.” @ Developments in the Middle East, South Africa and Central America. Gromyko replied that American policy in Central America was a major “source of tension,\" Lomeiko said. On nuclear arms, American sources said the two officials ‘‘ex- haustively discussed” the linkage in the Geneva talks between the three parallel negotiations on space arms, long-range strategic arms and Euro- missiles. One subject that did not come up was the recent flap over whether the United States will choose to vio- late the missile ceilings of the un- ratified Salt II treaty later this year when the next Poseidon nuclear sub- Marine is launched.

        "ocr_text": "Reagan-Gorbachev talks still up in air By Joseph Albright Cox News Service - VIENNA, Austria — Secretary of State George Shultz wrapped up talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and returned to Washington from Vienna on Wednes- day, having faiied in the one mis- sion that seemed dimly possible upon his arrival two days earlier: Shultz got nowhere in aronere a summit meeting between ident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The presence of national securi- ty adviser Robert McFarlane at Shultz’s side was a powerful signal of Reagan's eagerness to work out the details here. But the Soviet side was not to be rushed. The outlook now is for an excru- ciatingly protracted series of follow- up talks focusing more and more on the main issue — nuclear and space weapons. The next likely date for a Shultz-Gromyko meeting is early August, when Western and Eastern mations are due to convene in Fin- land to mark the 10th anniversary of the Helsinki human rights decla- rations. British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe — who has spoken separately to both Shultz and Gro- myko following their six-hour meet- ing Tuesday — made a point of cautioning journalists Wednesday Atlanta Constitution May 16, 1985 night to “be ready for a long haul.” No significant nuclear arms treaty has ever taken less than three years to achieve, Howe said, and the most recent — the unrati- fied 1979 SALT II pact — took six years to write. The British foreign secretary saw Gromyko for 90 minutes Wednesday evening at the Soviet Embassy after Shultz had departed for Washington. Earlier in the day, Shultz briefed Howe and French . Foreign Minister Roland Dumas over breakfast about what he and ) Gromyko had discussed. Western sources said Shultz told the British and French foreign min- isters that Gromyko had put for- ward no new ideas to simplify the Geneva arms talks, the second round of which is due to begin in two weeks. The sources said Gromyko spent a long time reminding Shultz of the familiar Soviet position that an agreement to ban Star Wars weap onry must accompany any deal on reducing the ceilings of nuclear mis- siles, bombers and submarines. Shultz said Wednesday morning that there had been no announce- ments on a possible summit because “as yet we have not been able to settle on when or where that meet- ing might take place.” Later in the morning, Shultz saw Gromyko privately for about 10 minutes at a ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the treaty that got Soviet and Western troops out of Austria. Howe, in his press conference, hinted that what is holding up a summit announcement is more than just picking a meeting hall. The two sides, he said, are discussing how to make such a session ‘useful’ — an indication that tough bargaining may lie ahead before Moscow and Washington will go through with a summit. The treaty Shultz, Gromyko, Howe, Dumas and other European foreign ministers came to commem- orate stands in retrospect as one of the most durable achievements of postwar detente. Austrian Chancellor Fred Sinowatz likes to tell visitors that if the Austrian treaty negotiations had not succeeded 30 years ago, there now would likely have been two Austrian chancellors of a divided nation, just as there are an East Germany and West Germany. \f"

Italian prosecutor Antonio Mari- ni said Agca’s claim to be Jesus would have “no effect’’ on the case because “it was only a show for the journalists.” Trial judge Severino Santiapichi called Agca to the witness chair an hour after the second “I am Jesus Christ’” announcement, asking him to explain where he got the Brown- ing automatic pistol he had used to shoot Pope John Paul II in St. Pe- ter’s Square on May 13, 1981. Instead, Agca launched into a confused statement, in which he de- seribed his attempt to murder the pope as “Undoubtedly one of the gravest crimes but also the greatest one in human history ‘The truth of this story no one knows, or more precisely, the one who knows but is afraid to disclose what it knows is the Vatican,” Agca said. “There are concrete proofs.” There Santiapichi cut Agca off. . “It is the story of this pistol which you should bs ik to me about,” the judge said. ““I do not wish to know other things.” “OK,” replied Agca in Italian. “But I want to make it known = I am completely sane - to be more precise, “many define me as not believable tor crazy.” Agca, who is due to ia % turn to the witness chair Tuesday, is v.the only witness Italian prosecutors * have dredged up who has ever al- * leged that the three Bulgarian de- “ fendants — Antonov and two Bul- ‘~t garian diplomats who are being ‘ ¢ried in absentia — had anything to | do with plotting the papal assassina-| | tion.

No one yet knew that the White House was about to announce that President Reagan was con- sidering the “option” of forcing the airport's clo- sure to put essen on the TWA hijackers. But one Lebanese air control supervisor had a prescient hunch. “1 am afraid for this airport,” he said in his office near the tower. “If they destroy the runway, we will have no more airport. The airport is like my home. ... I am too old to do anything else.” About 9 a.m. Tuesday — more than seven hours before the White House announcement — a voice from the TWA cockpit made the controllers in the tower jump up and grab a microphone. ‘A bag of ice cubes, and newspapers’ ~~ “Good morning,” the voice began in English. Then it immediately switched to a fast, gutteral Arabic. “We are all fine, we are only hungry,” said the hijacker’s voice. “We want ashqawan (a kind of cheese). And a bag of ice cubes.

That is where we — two American journalists and a Lebanese journalist — strolled. It was just ms, butter, Nescafe, Pepsi-Cola, tea and bottled water. “They told me, ‘We'll ask the hostages what they want to eat for lunch and we'll be back to you. We'll send for you if we need anything.’” We asked the catering manager what the hi- ckers on the plane — commonly thought to num- about a dozen — could do with 115 pieces of toast. Were there more hostages aboard than just the three crew members? “They put it on the plane,” sald the catering manager. “They distribute it. I don’t know where it goes.” Another catering employee produced a typical MEA economy-class lunch like that which has been served to the hostages. “ The metal-boxed meal consisted of a baked chicken leg in yellow gravy and white rice cooked Lebanese-style, with almonds, pine nuts and nut- meg.

The exchanges began when Ira- nian House Speaker Hashemi Raf- _ Sanjani appeared on short notice in - Damascus on Sunday, apparently af: ter a sudden summons from Syria’s President Hafez Assad. The visit came shortly after a request to Syria by President Rea- gan to help in resolving the hostage crisis, A Syrian source told a French news agency Sunday that Syria was doing its best to bring about a “pos- itive solution” to the TWA hijack crisis after Assad — just back from a trip to Moscow — had received “several letters” from Reagan. Rafsanjani — one of the most prominent disciples of Iranian Shiite leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini — met Assad twice, on Sunday and Monday. More significantly, Rafsanjani also met privately in Damascus with a Shiite scholar from Beirut who is thought to have spiritual in- fluence, if not direct authority, over the TWA hijackers. The scholar, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, is the reputed - spiritual leader of the small, violent pro-lranian Shiite faction in Leba- non that is believed to have pulled off the hijacking of TWA Flight 847. The faction is called Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Fadlallah ~ pethaps for his own safety — denies all connections with the group. What Rafsanjani told Fadlallah can only be surmised, Fadlallah's secretary told a caller in Beirut on Wednesday that the sheik would re- turn in a few days from Damascus. For public consumption, Rafsan- jani said at a press conference Mon- day, “If Iran had known in advance about this kind of abtion’ the hijack- ing), it would have acted:to prevent it.” Assad seems to have brought in Rafsanjani to counsel Fadlallah since he had himself been frustrated in trying to win the release of 10 Americans and other Westerners kidnapped in Lebanon by Hezbollah and closely allied terrorist factions. Assad, in a speech June 13, one day before the TWA hijacking, said kidnapping should not be used as a tactic because “there is a code of honor between the combatants.” But he acknowledged that the kidnap: pers had turned down his good of: fices, adding, “It is difficult to deal with these groups in Lebanon.” From what can be gleaned from the day's developments, it appears the hijackers softened their line not, because of anything Berri, Leba- non’s mainstream Shiite leader, said. It seems, rather, that Berri, who played an aa role in keeping the hostages alive in the first vola- tile days of the drisis, was a virtual bystander in the‘ weekend's machi- nations involving! Reagan, the Syrian president, the Iranian House leader and the reputed spiritual counselor of the hijackers. _ Amal and Hezbollah, whose bit- ter rivalries have led to seizures of each other's militiamen, are loosely cooperating with each other toward the end of using the hostages to win the release of the Lebanese Shiites and others held in Israel. : Formulating a deal that would satisfy both Amal and Hezbollah has been, up to now, one of the toughest obstacles for any Syrian or other in- termedia ry. If Reagan chooses to accept Berri’s offer to send the 39 Ameri- cans to Damascus, he will have cut a least part of the diplomatic knot by leaving only the and presumably their spiritual ally, Fad- lallah, to satisfy. It will be a grim, typically Leb- anese irony if Fadlallah finally gets them freed. For it was he, accord- oh to pre hiy who gave tua nce to a Shiite truck bomber on the eve of his suicidal drive into the U.S. Marine barracks that killed 242 U.S. servicemen in October 1983.

        "ocr_text": "Amal treats 32 hostages to lavish poolside dinner By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BEIRUT, Lebanon — There was no official confirmation by Amal spokesmen that TWA Flight 847 hostages would be moved Saturday to Damascus, but the report gained credence when 32 of the 39 hostages were treated Friday night in Beirut to a lavish dinner beside a large Olympic-size swimming pool at a beachfront hotel. The hostages were described by journalists who saw them as some- what shocked to find themselves in such surroundings. One hostage asked a woman photographer if he . could touch her just to prove that -what he was seeing was real. The hostages said they had no idea where they were going next, - but many sounded excited when in- formed by ABC News staffers of a report that the hostages may be moved Saturday to Damascus. The hotel they visited, the Summerland, is a heavily guarded beachfront ho- tel that ABC News has adopted as its Beirut headquarters, In Damascus, the Associated Press reported, government infor- mation office officials told reporters that the TWA hostages would arrive in Syria sometime Saturday after- noon. The officials demanded ano- nymity. Syria is six hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time. The Americans would be held _ until the remaining 735 prisoners — ‘mostly Shiite Moslems — held by ‘the Israelis in a prison near Haifa ‘were released, according to reports. The 32 hostages were served shish kebab, chicken and a large cake decorated with the words “Missing You Back Home.” After the dinner, which lasted about, three hours, the hostages were hustled by =tifle-toting Amal militiamen into a “van and several cars and driven off «sto their secret hideouts. «.- » Betsy Aaron, an ABC correspon- *Hent who was at the Summer! when the hostages drove up, said several of the captives she talked to did not know whet to think of going to Syria. “Nobody ‘had any sense of what Syria was,” Ms. Aaron said. She said that ABC had no idea the hostages were coming to their hotel and that hotel employees ap- parently didn’t either. One ABC staffer said, “Someone looked out the window and said, ‘Jesus Christ, it’s the hostages.’ ” The remaining seven hostages — three members of the TWA crev and four others reportedly guarde: by a radical faction — did not ap pear for reasons that were not ex plained. ; Earlier Friday, the leader of th American hostages, Texan Ally: Conwell, told a Cox Newspapers re porter in a low voice at the conclu sion of an exclusive interview, “Ge Texas stirred up. We need their hel to get out of here.” Conwell had expressed bewilder ment that France had shown reluc tance to offer its Beirut embassy a a temporary refuge for the captives and that the reported decision to move the hostages to the Syrian capital had not been made. — “I can tell you I would be dis- tressed to hear that there isn’t a country willing to stand up and as- sist in this period of crisis,’ Conwell told Cox Newspapers. - “T would not only be disappoint- ed,” he said, “but I'd be shocked.” Conwell, an oil field equipment executive who had been an assi; ment in Oman, was made available for a brief chat inside Amal leader Nabih Berri’s west Beirut apart- ment building as part of an interna- tional image-building campaign by the Shiite n Amal movement, which now holds most of the hos- tages. Bate opts ths «athe . Conwell said he learmed Friday morning, apparently oie a “briefing” he and two other hos- tages received from Berri, that the French -had declined to accept the hostages in their west Beirut em- bassy under Berri’s terms. France had said it was willing to accept the hostages but declined to guarantee they would remain in . Lebanon until Israel releases its 735 - Lebanese prisoners, as Berri de- manded. no? Conwell, who has apparently been chosen by the group as its spokesman with Amal’s assent, had the healthy look of a well-laundered, clean-shaven TV anchorman. He wore a gray polo shirt and slacks. He made clear that what he really wants is to go home. At the same time, he restated his sympa- thy, as expressed in earlier inter- views while in captivity, for Amal’s objectives of winning the release of 735 Lebanese prisoners in Israel. - Conwell said he met with Berri to express “concern” about the pos- sibly fragile health of one hostage, Simon Grossmayer, 57, of Algon- quin, Ill., who has had one lung re- moved. A third hostage, the Rey. James McLoughlin, 45, of Geneva, Il, also participated. There were indications from ranking Amal officials that Berri would release Grossmayer on health grounds Saturday. It was not clear what effect the possible move to Syria would have on Grossmayer’s release. 7 After being driven to the apart- ment from their secret hideouts un- der an escort of Amal militiamen, the three captives spoke with Berri Atlanta Constitution June 29, 1985 and received his “briefing” on the apparently Stalled hostage negotia- ons.

        "ocr_text": " Navy frogman: ‘A real slap in the face’ | By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BEIRUT, Lebanon — Jeff Ingalls, a tall, red-bearded member of a U.S. Navy diving team, had been moved from the dismal prison office where the radical Hezbollah faction kept him. He was about to be hauled out of Lebanon. H e leader Allyn Conwell had al- ready called the roll in the south Beirut — schoolyard where Amal security men as- sembled the half-dozen groups of hos- tages. A Red Cross caravan was lined up to drive through the pink and white ole- anders of Tahweita Street toward Damas- cus. ‘ Half:an hour before the caravan ‘rolled, Ingalls, 24, saw an armed Amal militiaman wearing a U.S. Navy diver’s insignia like his. . “Look what that guy has on,” he ex- claimed to fellow Navy diver Stuart Dahl, 31. : “Don’t worry, don’t worry about: it, buddy. Don’t worry about it,” said Dahl, explaining some of the Navy divers had given Amal guards their diver’s pins. “Smile and be nice to ’em,” said Dahl. “That’s all we can do.” - Ingalls still didn’t like it. “It’s a real slap in the face,” he told a reporter. In the early days of the hostage drama, he said, some of his captors riffled his lug- gage and took all of his military pins and patches. Ingalls had it worse than most of the 39 Americans in the schoolyard. He said he was never threatened, beaten or deprived of food and water. But there were no steak dinners at beach- front hotels, no direct lines to network anchormen — no assurance he was ever going home. . Ingalls and Robert Brown, 42, of Stow, Mass. were culled into the same group of four passengers on the second day of the hijacking by Hezbollah, the Shiite faction to which the original hi- jackers belong. Ingalls and Brown remembered dif- ferent low points from several of the hideouts in which they stayed. “As near as I can figure out, it was a prison with drunks and thieves,” said In- galls, referring to one of the hideouts. He said the four Americans stayed in the prison office, not a cell. Brown recalled living the first week in “an underground bunker.” Then, on June 25, he found him- self in the middle of a high-speed chase after Amal leader Nabih Ber- ri assembled all the hostages for in- terviews by the Red Cross. “That night they drove us very fast,” said Brown. “We were being followed. I think it was by Amal.” Their most wrenching hours came Saturday when they heard the erroneous report on the radio that the hostages had already departed for Damascus. At that point, the four were still in the hands of a Hezbollah group and had not been handed to Amal, the predominant Lebanese Shiite faction. “We were a little upset,” said Ingalls. \"'t was a downer. It was a drag.” His ca,tors were confused, too. After a while, they told him the radio was wrong, his fellows were still in Beirut. * Ingalls was the only military man in his foursome. Another heavi- ly guarded group Included about five other Navy men on the TWA plane. Clinton Suggs, 29, of Norfolk, Va., said his guards kept the US. Navy men separated “because they thought we were Marines.” Stuart Dahl, said they all thought they were going to be shot when they were led off the plane on June 15, the day the hijackers killed their companion, Navy Petty Offi- cer Robert Dean Stethem, 24, of Waldorf, Md. “But they loaded us onto a truck and hauled us away,” said Dahl. And his captors turned out to be “very nice.” hd One day Amal’s impromptu hos- tage catering service broke down and no one brought any food. “The | guys dug into their own pockets and |’ fed us,” said Dahl.

A “shoot-up” is a volley from an AK-47 assault rifle over the heads of a cluster of approaching journal- ists. There were at least five shoot- upa on the streets outsfde the schoolhouse in the space of two hours, sometimes within only three feet of the ears of the journalists.

The safest place, it turned out, was leaning against a gray Peugeot station wag- on belonging to one of the two Syri- ap intelligence officers who were waiting to join the escort to Damas- cus. About 5 p.m. (10 a.m. EDT) hos- tage leader Conwell stood up in the schoolyard — an enclosure perhaps twice the size of a basketball court — and began calling the roll. The first time through the list nine names were missing. But it was only a few minutes before an- other delegation of hostages was led in by their Amal guards. When the group walked in, the rest of the hos- tages cheered. Conwell read the list again. One name was missing. After another few minutes, he too appeared. The hostages gave another burst of - plause, for now there seemed to nothing holding them back. Amal official Ali Husseini then made one of the stranger speeches from a jailer to his prisoners: “We are very sorry that you suffered. ... We want to thank you and say we are sorry and especially sorry for the friend we have lost (Stethem) before Amal entered.” And then it was on to Damascus in a caravan. It was at 5:41 p.m. when the Red Cross official in the first hos- tage car out of the schooll.ouse end- ed the crisis with one sentence: “All 39 hostages are frpe as of this mo ment.” ‘ } - July 1, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "‘Phone all set ‘in motion deal to regain men By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BEIRUT, Lebanon — On Saturday, when 39 American hostages teetered on the edge of free- dom, Nabih Berri telephoned a gray-bearded Is- lamic scholar respected by the hijackers of TWA . Flight 847. On the other end of the phone line was Berri’s Shiite rival, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah — the man on whose doorstep a ClA-trained anti- terrorist squad detonated a car bomb in March. The call was a revealing episode in the secret dealings that brought freedom to the Americans on Sunday and that promise to bring the early re- lease of 735 Lebanese Moslems from an Israeli ail. ; The deal involved the original terrorists, Shiite political bosses, presidents, sheiks and dozens ‘of intermediaries. On Saturday, Fadlallah was in his combined -office-apartment in the southern suburb of Bir Abed. Not far away, 35 of the hostages were mill- ing around a schoolhouse waiting to be released. “He (Berri) talked about a hitch,” Fadlallah © recalled. ‘Apparently, they want more guaran- tees.” Who is “they”? Fadlallah was asked. “Berri and all the others for whom he speaks,” said Fadlallah, presumably peluering to the hijack- ers. Fadlallah is no mere Islamic fundamentalist scholar. He is, in the judgment of Western and Amal sources, a spiritual beacon who guides the radicals from the Hezbollah party who were: be- lieved to be behind the TWA hijacking.

Sometimes at social gatherings, we talked about politics.” According to the hijackers’ explanation, once i their “comrades” reached Damascus, “our Syrian brothers informed us of the commitments they have received for the release of our imprisoned brothers in (Israel at) Atlit (prison).” The hijackers said they “reciprocated” by indi- cating their willingness to end the hijack crisis with the freeing of both the American hostages and the Atlit prisoners — not all at once but “in batches.” A Hezbollah faction behind the hijackers had its hands on one “batch” of four hostages. © They were, as one hostage put it, Hezbollah’s “ace The original hijackers said th isis .be gan to move toward a settlement. “after. |. direct contact the Syrian brothers made with:us:\"*. « They didn’t say when or: where they’ received their “Syrian brothers.” But afterward,. they said; “We assigned comrades to goto: D Toa to It is known that Fadlallah spent afew iow dayd is Damascus on June 22-23.

The other four were still in a Hezbollah hideout — somewhere in west Beirut, ..» the former hostages believe. On Saturday night — as the deal was on the point of collapsing — a delegation from Hezbollah rushed to Damascus to work out the snags. The hi- jackers demanded a promise from the Reagan ad- 4 ministration that it would not “retaliate.” Assad puts heat on U.S., Hezbollah. Their concern is understandable, for they are all marked men. Qn June 14, authorities in Athens, Greece, had learned the identities of the hijackers from one of theft comrades. The hijackers asserted Sunday that Reagan’s hard-line remarks: in Chicago caused them to delay releasing the hostages until they got a U.S. com- mitment. “We decided, to delay the release operation un- til the United States backs out from its rashness and takes up a reconciliatory tone,” a hijacker said. “This has happened. Bowing to our demand that was communicated to the Syrian brothers, the U.S. State Department has issued a statement that was published through the international media. Therefore, we release the hostages upon the com- pletion of this news conference.” As the release agreement seemed to be unrav- eling, Syria’s president, Assad, and his first vice president, Abdul Halim Khaddam, put the heat on both Washington and Hezbollah. Assad passed a. secret message to Hezbollah leaders that if they did not turn over the four Americans within 12 hours, Syria, would break all links with Hezbollah. The final assurance from Syria on the impend- ing freedom for the Atlit ers came in a call between Berri and Damascus just after midnight Sanday, according to Amal security chief Abu Ra- jieh Atlanta Constitution - July 2, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Tutu urges blacks to end killing Vows to leave South Africa if revenge attacks continue By Joseph Albright Cox News Service KWATHEMA TOWNSHIP, South Africa — Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu warned a large crowd of black mourners Tuesday. that he and his family would leave South Africa if there were more vengeance killings by blacks of suspected police informers. * “We have a cause that is going to pre- vail,” said Tutu, last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner. “For goodness’ sake, let us not spoil it by the kind of methods that we use. If we do this again, I must tell you that I am going to find it difficult to be able to speak up for our liberation.” Tutu said that if such violent incidents recur in the anti-apartheid struggle, he re- luctantly would gather up his family and leave South Africa, “a country that I love very deeply, a country I love passionately.” His oration over the caskets of 15 blacks killed during police incidents succeeded in ‘calming the first mass gathering by blacks ‘since South Africa imposed a state of emer- gency ‘Sunday. Meanwhile, police said that they had ar- rested 441 people during the state of emer- gency. Many detainees are members of black township councils, the grass-roots leadership in the fight against white-minor- ity rule. In Port Elizabeth, police arrested Molly Blackburn, the leading white anti-apartheid activist in troubled eastern Cape province. A prominent member of the political opposi- tion, she was arrested on charges of attend- ing .an illegal meeting. The action came an hour before she was to meet former U‘S. Cabinet members Cyrus Vance, Robert -Mc- Namara and Donald McHenry. Police reported more riots in townships Monday night and Tuesday. At least eight blacks have been killed in clashes with po lice since the emergency took effect in 36 black cities and townships. Sixty people have been arrested on criminal charges after street battles with riot patrols in townships cov- ered by the decree and elsewhere. During Tuesday’s outdoor funer- al, attended by an estimated 15,000 blacks, there was no repetition of last Saturday’s incident, when black mourners stoned, beat and set afire a woman suspected of being a po- lice informer in the nearby black township of Duduza. _ Nor did South African security men move to call off or disrupt the funeral, which was arranged before the emergency proclamation went into effect at midnight Saturday. As mourners walked back to their homes, they found two ar- mored trucks filled with white South African soldiers in riot gear parked along their route. Similar encounters during the last year have resulted in rock throwing by blacks and the use of tear gas and guns by authorities. On Tuesday, there was no flare-up. Tutu’s appeal came two hours earlier as mourners gathered in a The Associated Press At funeral services in Transvaal province Tuesday, South African Bishop Desmond Tutu greets the relatives of 15 blacks killed during police incidents. dusty soccer stadium. He began by calling apartheid an “evil’’ system and predicting that white-minority rule was bound to end. He told the crowd again and again that ‘‘victory is already ours.” With. equal passion, he then con- demned “all forms of violence,” in- cluding vengeance killings of police informers. “The world is filled with people who support us, people who want us to be free,” said Tutu. But when they see black retribu- tion portrayed on worldwide televi- sion, ‘““many of them say ... if these people can still do things like this, maybe they are not yet ready for freedom.”’ . He closed by urging whites to concede a share of power peaceful- ly, in their own interest. “You will never be free until we are free, because freedom is indivis- ible,” Tutu said. ‘“‘We don’t want you to be running around here with guns.

Page 21-A. In a separate incident, the national police headquarters said a soldier fired one rifle round and killed a 16-year-old youth after blacks stoned an army vehi- cle in eastern Cape province. As has often happened in recent months, the clash that resulted in four deaths began after a funeral in a black _ Slum when a crowd of departing mourn- ers passed a seemingly isolated security patrol near a cemetery. “A mob of 4,000 is rather frightening, especially when it is at a fever pitch,” said South African police spokésman Lt. Tom Jefferson. : Later in the day, authoritiés for the first time announced that an 9» funeral of black victims of recent distur- bances had been “provisionally banned” under the state of emefgency that was declared six days ago. A magistrate in the resort town of ‘Parys, 50 miles south of Johannesburg, ordered that a funeral for three. scheduled for this weekend could only take place during the week. The full text of the “provisional banning” of the funer- al order was not immediately available. The latest shooting episode occurred Wednesday afternoon in a black township called Daveyton, 28 miles east of Johan- nesburg. One local black official said by telephone that the town’s population is about 100,000, not counting some 75,000 other people who live in shacks and tem- porary shelters. No. eyewitness accounts had been pub- lished Thursday.

One soldier in the Buffalo was sent to a hospital with unspeci-, fied injuries, police spokesman Jef-. ferson said. . “A police patrol arrived and dis- persed the mob using shotguns and: rifles,” said Jefferson. He said he did not know whether police first: tried rubber bullets or tear gas, as has been a pattern in other crowd control episodes. A Daveyton undertaker said the dead included two teenage girls, a teenage boy and an adult man. All had bullet wounds, he said. Mrs. Sarah Ndebele, the grand- mother of one dead 17-year-old girl, was reported to have said her granddaughter was forced by the mourners to accompany them to the cemetery. But the South African newspa- per the Star, which considers itself more progressive than the govern- ment on race issues, provided only one direct quote from the grand- mother in its front-page account. It quoted the grandmother as telling a Star reporter: “This was the first time for my granddaughter to attend such a fu- neral, and, unfortunately, she did not come back.” Since the wave of violent unrest began last August, nearly 500 blacks — an average of about 1.5 a day — have died in various kinds of clash- es around South Africa, including confrontations with police, assaults on black local officials and house burnings. The frequency of fatal incidents has quickened over the past three months and has not yet slackened, police figures indicate. In the five days since the emer- gency went into effect, police have announced the deaths of 15 blacks, including the four from Daveyton. Officially reported detentions in the first five days of this white- ruled nation’s state of emergency rose to 795. But university professor David Webster, a member of the Detainees’ Parents Support Commit- tee, said he believed nearly 1,000 people have been seized. Webster said the committee’s in- formation from around the country indicated police lists of detentions were late and incomplete. Funerals of blacks killed in po- litical violence have developed into the one tolerated form of anti-gov- ernment protests. As a rule, authorities have kept their distance during the five hours or so of the funeral service, walk to the cemetery and burial. But police have patrolled actively before and after the funerals. Bishop Desmond Tutu, Anglican bishop of Johannesburg, has called on police to stay away from black townships during funerals to avert incidents, but authorities have cold- shouldered his suggestion. The government strategy ap- pears to reflect a fear by the white- dominated government that black revolutionaries are trying to use vi- olence to establish de facto “liberat- ed zones”. in some urban ghettos. “They want to establish revolu- tionary committees in liberated ar- eas and they want to have people's courts,” said Len Dekker, a r official in the Department of Consti- tutional Development and Planning, the Cabinet agency that oversees black township administration. Speaking before the latest shoot- had become publicized, Dekker told a Cox Newspapers reporter, “There is a very marked similarity between what is happening here and. what happened in the Russian Revo- lution. This (liberated zones) is a very Marxist concept.” \f"

        "ocr_text": "Black police are pariahs in South Africa By Joseph Albright Cox News Service DUNNOTTAR, South Africa — In the center of this whites-only suburb, 19 black police offi- cers and their families live in tents in a police compound because their black neighbors have torched their homes. Underpaid and unloved, the black police of South Africa have emerged as the prime targets of young black rebels looking for a weak link in the eee power structure. ; Black police officers like Constable Steven Mona, 28, say they are hurt and bewildered.’ “They are fighting against me and not the government,” said Mona, whose house was fire- bombed June 17. “I am not the government. I am just an employee.” Police headquarters in Pretoria says that throughout the country, 294 black police officers have had their houses burned down since last. summer. Police statistics also show that eight black police officers have been killed and anoth- ér 113 “assaulted.” Ironically, white police officers, who earn more than their black counterparts, have been virtually immune from violence during the racial strife. White police live in white-only communi- ties the black protesters have not targeted. So far, a few white police officers and sol- diers have been injured by flying rocks in black townships. But no white security men are known to have been killed or burned out of their homes. Apartheid protesters feel betrayed The young apartheid protesters believe that their comrades are being locked into detention cells through the efforts of black police. And sometimes with good reason. One piece of proof came to light Tuesday when police headquarters in Pretoria announced that six peo- ple had been arrested for the internationally televised arson-murder of a woman suspected of being a police informer in the township of Du- duza, four miles from here. In an interview before the announcement, a white police commander disclosed that his black investigators played an important part in the case against the six. The commander said the black investigating officers who worked on the case used to live in Duduza before their houses were burned down this spring. A police spokesman has disclosed that all 34 black police officers who lived in Duduza early this year have had their houses torched by arson- ists. Duduza, one of the bitterest of the combat zones between young, unarmed protesters and the government, is a suburb of 34,000 people tucked away behind a garbage dump south of this middle-class white suburb. Since Duduza is only four miles away, police superiors decided to establish a temporary camp’ here for the burned-out black officers. Black Constable Michael Modise, 27, says he and his wife can no longer talk to their friends in Duduza for fear of what angry protesters will do. ‘We don’t have friends anymore’ “If they see one of my friends talk to me, as soon as possible they are going to burn him,” he said. “That is why we don’t have any friends anymore.” Modise said his house in Duduza has been firebombed three times. He said the first two at- tacks resulted in minor damage. The third try destroyed all he owned. Modise, who has finished three years of high school, says he joined the police force three years ago because “I just want to maintain law and order among black people.” He says his basic salary is about $170 a month. A police spokesman, Col. Jaap Venter, later acknowledged that this is lower than what a white police constable with identical experi- ence and education would earn. Venter said salaries of higher-ranking offi- cers are now comparable for whites and blacks but that there remains a black-white “gap” for constables and other lower ranks. He declined to provide an exact comparison, adding, “Govern- ment policy is to phase out the gap in salaries as money becomes available.” Nonetheless, Modise says he is pleased with the pay, adding, “It is a good job.” Like the other Duduza police, he has had to pull his 12-year-old daughter out of school in Du- duza for her safety. “They (apartheid protesters) want to kidnap all the policemen’s families,” Modise explained. He said the police department is trying to help the black officers find new homes some- where outside Duduza, so far without success. His wife, Emma, said she won't go back to live in Duduza in any case. She said that the sec- ond time the house was firebombed, she, their daughter and Modise’s mother narrowly escaped being burned to death. Because this is South Africa, the black offi- cers face visible reminders of their unequal sta- tus in the tent camp. One such indication was the white police su- perior who stood by listening as the black offi- cers were being interviewed. Interviews with white officers were not monitored.

Africa dailed for 23 years, black attorney is key political force By Joseph Albright Cox News Service JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Nelson Mandela lives in Pollsmoor Pris- on in Cape Town with almost no outside contacts and little to do except tend the tomatoes and cucumbers he has been al- lowed to plant in drums on the prison roof. Yet after 23 years in jail, this intel- --lectual-turned-saboteur has grown into a hurricane force in South African poli- ties, At 67, Mandela looms as the un- nown factor in determining whether “there is any hope for a negotiated peace ‘this decade between whites and blacks. _ . While cooped up in prison, Mandela commands such admiration among a wide spectrum of blacks that no other credible leader would dare bargain with the government about how blacks could share power with whites, Recently, congressional leaders in the United States strengthened Mande- vision in an anti-apartheid sanctions bill that said the release of Mandela within a year would permit South Africa to avoid heavy economic penalties next year. To many white South Africans, Man- dela has become an albatross. President Pieter Botha offered him freedom in February on condition that he promise not to try to overthrow the government by violence. Mandela refused, saying, “Only free men can negotiate.” Louis Ooosthuysen, an editor on the Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport, says, “I think it would be wise of the government just to release him. It would cause quite a disruption within the ANC (the banned African National Congress, of which Mandela was a lead- er). At the moment he is a martyr, a symbol of suffering and that kind of thing.” Although a good many whites agree, interviews with a dozen young black ac- tivists in violence-rocked Soweto, Kwa- Thema and Tumahole townships suggest the white view is wishful thinking. “Our undeniable leader is Mandela,” said Ace Magashule, a 25-year-old lead- er in Tumahole who has gone under- ground to avoid a police search. “I think Bishop Tutu is on the same track with us, but he is not our leader.” A senior black protest figure, Curtis Nkondo, 57, who faces a treason trial Monday because of his own anti-apart- NELSON MANDELA: To many whites, he has become an albatross. heid activities, said: “Mandela is one of the greatest men ever. If they released him, they (authorities) would not be able to contain the excitement that would grip the nation. Not one of to- day's younger leaders would say he doesn’t want Mandela’s leadership, not one.” There has been no scientific polling on Mandela's support nationwide. The occasional surveys in local black news- papers have said Mandela is backed by a heavy majority of those interviewed in urban townships around the white cit- ies. He is thought to have less support among blacks living in the rural “home- lands,” where tribal leaders remain strong. Because Mandela's writings have been banned for more than two decades, most blacks and whites only have a sketchy notion of his background and what he stands for. ‘Violence was inevitable’ Mandela got his start in South Afri- can politics by helping to organize the ANC’s youth league in 1944. The ANC then was a peaceful, legal organization that limited itself to pass- ing anti-apartheid resolutions, During the 1950s, the ANC began the Defiance Campaign, which aimed to pressure the government through strikes and passive resistance. Chief Albert Luthuli, then the ANC leader, put Mandela — a young, articu- late lawyer ~ in charge of recruiting volunteers, Mandela and 155 other lead- ers were tried for treason and attempt ing to set up a communist state. But a judge acquitted them. In 1960, the government banned the ANC as an unlawful organization after police opened fire and killed 69 blacks at Sharpville during a demonstration. Atlanta Constitution - August 4, 1985 \f— Mandela “The ANC refused to dissolve, but instead went underground,” Mandela said in a court statement in 1964. By his account, the ANC banning or- der made him decide in June 1961 to go beyond the ANC’s traditional advocacy of non-violence. “I and some colleagues came to the conclusion,” he said, “that as violence in this country was inevitable, it would be unrealistic and wrong for African lead- ers to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the govern- ment met our peaceful demands with force.” Mandela said he and a few others formed in November 1961 a small sabo- tage unit loosely affiliated with ANC that they called Umkonto We Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, The government has called it the military wing of the ANC, but Mandela toid the court that Umkonto was not under ANC discipline. He said they began planning attacks on power plants, rail and telephone lines, and other targets that could be hit without causing any deaths or injuries. The aim was to damage the economy enough to influence white voters. “We did not want to be committed to civil war, but we wanted to be ready if it became inevitable,” he told the court. “Four forms of violence are possi- ble. There is sabotage, there is guerrilla warfare, there is terrorism, and there is open revolution. We chose to adopt the first method and to exhaust it before taking any other decision.” As the sabotage planning was under way, Mandela slipped out of South Afri- ca in early 1962 on a mission for the ANC to seek moral support, money and guns. While abroad, he was highly visible, He conferred with British Labor Party leader Hugh Gaitskell in London and with half a dozen African leaders, in- Cluding Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selas- sie at an African summit in Addis Aba- ba He also traveled to Algeria to take part in “a course in military training,” he said. He slipped back into South Africa in June or July 1962. In August 1962, he was arrested by police who found him disguised in a chauffeur's uniform and driving with a white associate. He was sentenced to five years in prison for having left the country without a pass- port Sabotage plans uncovered It was in 1963, while he was in pris- on, that police raided the house of a white ANC activist in the Johannesburg suburbs. Mandela had used the house as. a hideout, and police scooped up a trove of documents in his handwriting. They included plans for sabotage. ne fail 1@0 {0 a fle and seven others on charges of sabotage and belonging to a communist organiza- tion. Confronted by Witness X and Wit: ness Z, two former ANC colleagues who turned state's evidence, Mandela readily admitted that he planned sabotage, even though most of the 199 sabotage acts charged by prosecutors occurred after he was in prison. A major controversy at the trial centered on whether Mandela ever be- lieved in communism, something the government sought to prove to discredit the ANC. One of the more damning docu: ments from the raided house was a manuscript in Mandela’s handwriting saying, “Under communist rule South Africa will be a land of milk and hon- ey.” Of the “milk and honey” document, Mandela said it was his handwriting but someone else's ideas, He explained that P he had agreed to redraft a lecture that had been written by a communist friend. His intention, he said, was to show the friend that the language could be simplified by omitting “the usual communist cliches and jargon.” - Mandela vehemently insisted that he was an African nationalist and had nev- er been a communist, even though some other ANC members were communists. have been influenced by Marxist thought,” he said, “But this is also true of many of the leaders of the new inde- pendent states. Such widely different persons as Gandhi, Nehru, Nkrumah and Nasser all acknowledge this fact. We all accept the need for some form of so- cialism to enable people to catch up with the advanced countries of this world and to overcome their legacy of extreme poverty. But that doesn't mean we are Marxists,” He said that if the Communist Party could help rid South Africa of race dis- crimination, “I welcome its assistance.” But he said he differed from commu: nists in that he admired the British par- liamentary system and the American Congress, Mandela said that blacks were fight- ing, above all, for “equal political rights.” This summer an American lawyer, former Watergate counsel Sam Dash, was permitted to interview Mandela in rison. His goals now, he told Dash, were black representation in Parliament, in- troduction of “one-man, one-vote” elec: tions, and an end to the white-imposed system of tribal “homelands.” Dash quoted Mandela as saying: “Unlike white people anywhere else in Africa, whites in South Africa belong here — this is their home. We want them to live here with us and to share power with us,” Atlanta Constitution - August 4, 1985 (Continued) \f"

Meanwhile, the death toll in ri- ots mear Durban rose to 65 as two more blacks were burned to death in separate incidents. Police said an unidentified man was set on fire in near Pretoria, by a mob Mamelodi, of blacks who also torched a hostel - for migrant workers and a black- owned business. Another man was found burned to death in Cradock. The South African Press Associ- ation said an Indian school was burned in Chatsworth, near early Sunday.

Mrs. Mxenge, shot and killed Aug. 1, was a defense lawyer in the treason trial of 16 members of the United Democratic Front in Durban. The front is South Africa’s major anti-apartheid organization.

Tshwete had spent 15 ears at the government’s Robben island political prison. “We are committed to seeing that South Africa comes down to its knees,”’ he said in a call for in- creased violence. “We are going to use practically everything we can lay our hands on, even if it is gunpowder,” Tshwete said. “If we have to shoot to get our liberation, we are going to shoot. No apologies.” - The mourners, waving the flag of the banned African National Con- and carrying banners reading “The People Shall Govern,’ were leaving the cemetery when two black officers in a police truck tried to make their way through the crowd. The crowd threw dozens of heavy rocks at the truck. One of the policeman, obviously terrified, bolt- ed across a field trying to escape. A group of about 250 blacks who had gathered for the burial rushed after him. They caught him after some 200 yards and _ knocked him to the ground. People in the mob hurled rocks on his head and body until he stopped moving. Then they gathered loose twigs around his body, doused it with gasoline, and burned it about 150 yards from Mrs. Mxenge’s grave. Tshwete told reporters after- ward: “It is not a question of black killing black — it is blacks against the system, and the system is both black and white.” A message read at the funeral from jailed black leader Nelson Mandela said, ‘‘It is an atrocity which we will never forget and nev- er forgive.” \f"

Jones, who sits. on the federal appeals bench in Cincinnati, was re- leased Saturday after being held four hours at the police station in nearby Fort Beaufort, close to the southern tip of the African conti- nent. Although he showed his U.S. passport and identified himself as a federal judge, he was not allowed to telephone the American Embassy in Johannesburg until after he was charged. Atlanta Constitution - August 12, 1985 (Sidebar) Jones said, however, that a sen- ior South African prosecutor tele- phoned him at his hotel Sunday morning to tell him that the charges were being dropped and to express his regrets.

Over the weekend, he drove here from Durban to attend the fu- neral of Victoria Mxenge, one of the defense lawyers in the case, who was murdered by unknown gunmen four days before the trial was due to open.

This renewed rand rush came just one day before President Pieter Botha was due to make a speech before members of his ruling Na- tional Party outlining his program of race “reforms.” Meanwhile, government radio and TV announced seven more deaths of blacks in scattered inci- dents of racial unrest, raising the total killed during the state of emergency to 114 and the total killed in the last 18 months to 629. In one incident, black students mobbed a teacher they accused of being a police informer, threatening to set him afire. He escaped, and riot police rolled into the Soweto schoolyard in 15 armored vehicles. “We want to burn him alive,” one student said. He claimed the teacher had reported class boycotts to police. ‘ The Barclays a termed “certainly .. a commentator on the state-con- . trolled TV network. The commenta- tor said the fall of the rand resulted from “a growing perception that South. Africa’s foreign loan situation was becoming more difficult.” The Barclays statement in Lon- don said the company was reducing from 50.4 percent to 40.4 percent its holdings of stock in Barclays Na- tional Bank, its South African sub- - sidiary. The subsidiary is the largest commercial bank in South Africa. In the deal, the South African Barclays raised about $111 million worth of fresh capital from South African companies, thus diluting the British parent company’s ownership by 10 percent. The stock issue allowed the British bank to reduce its liability to depositors in the South African subisidiary without having to put in fresh capital. In the process, the British bank’s percent of ownership in the subsidiary was reduced to re- flect the infusion of outside capital.

African seeks Botha’s ouster Party says president is too soft on blacks By Joseph Albright Cox News Service PRETORIA, South Africa — The leading right-wing opposition leader called Monday night for the replacement of President Pieter Botha as essential “for an unfet- tered white future.” “Our bullet is the ballot,” said Andries Treurnicht, addressing a cheering crowd of 1,000 white South Africans of the Conservative Party who believe that Botha is too soft on blacks. “For whites to maintain them- selves, it is a prerequisite that we have our own ‘vaderland’ (father- land), where we can govern our- selves without co-governing and power-sharing with colored, Asians and blacks.” The Conservative Party, a voice of those Afrikaners who oppose even the smallest reforms in the apartheid structure, is hoping to damage Botha politically in off- year elections Oct.’ 30 for five va- cant seats in the white House of Assembly. Botha’s failure last ‘week to an- nounce racial reforms is thought to have resulted in part from fears among senior National Party offi- cials that the Conservative Party is gaining among lower-middle-class whites hurt by a lingering reces- sion. = Treurnicht, a former chairman of the secret society Afrikaner Broederbond, charged that whites are being overtaxed and forced to compete for jobs with blacks. “How much is the government prepared to spend on white employ- ees and their families who have no work or income and who are starv- Atlanta Constitution - August 20, 1985 ing?” he asked. He criticized hints in Botha’s speech that the government may some day modify ‘influx control” laws that aim to restrict movement of blacks from the countryside into black townships near white cities. “We have the right to restrict the flow of blacks to our towns and cities,” he said. “We have the right to redirect them to the (home- lands).” Treurnicht told reporters that a strong Conservative showing in the October elections could force Botha to call a national parliamentary election next year, three years be- fore the Parliament’s term .xpires. The Conservatives, who now have 10 percent of the seats in the white house of parliament, broke away from the long-ruling National Party in 1982 when Botha moved to create a third chamber for colored and Indian minorities. Treurnicht, opening a three-day party congress in the country’s most strongly conservative region, had to contend with a right-wing splinter faction that advocates an even more extreme position: creat- ing a white “homeland” in the cen- ter of the country, where other ‘races would not even be allowed to enter as laborers. ; ‘The idea of creating an island of white racial purity surrounded by black, Indian and colored home- lands has been put forward by Hen- drik Vervoerd Jr., a Conservative Party figure whose late father was a major architect of apartheid as a National Party prime minister from 1958 to 1965. Treurnicht dismissed the “white homeland” strategy as impractical on grounds that much of the coun- try’s mineral and industrial wealth lies in the Pretoria-Johannesburg industrial belt, where blacks and whites live in close proximity. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Arming blacks is goal of South Africa rebels By Joseph Albright Cox News Service » LUSAKA, Zambia — Two lead- ers of the strongest South African black underground organization have predicted that their covert units soon will succeed in supplying guns to significant numbers of South African blacks. A major purpose, they agreed in separate interviews, will be to spread the anti-apartheid struggle into white neighborhoods in order to force the white government into ne- dtiating an end to white rule, “T don’t think that when the crunch comes very many whites will be prepared to die,” said Chris Hani, 43, a military organizer in the headquarters of the African sa tional Congress, _ “We shall see when they actual- ly face armed confrontation over a long period of time, when it is going to be risky to continue with normal farming, when a situation will arise when they won't even trust the maid in the kitchen.” _ Another ANC official, informa- tion director Thabo Mbeki, 42, said, “You will get an increasing inci- dence of actions by the armed masses shooting at this army of oc- cupation.” Their remarks — which came just before a planned march in Cape Town, South Africa, to the prison where ANC leader Nelson Mandela is confined ~ suggested that a new and bloodier phase of the South African conflict may be in the offing. ANC President Oliver Tambo, a 68-year-old relative moderate in the organization, told a press confer- ence 10 days ago that the ANC won't indiscriminantly attack white civilians. But ANC officials are now say- ing that Tambo's assurance doesn’t apply to such targets as. the homes of white police officers, army re- servists, civil defense workers, or farmers who are part of a paramili- tary reserve. “Naturally, as the war expands there is no way of avoiding a higher incidence of civilian casualties, black and white,” Mbeki said. Hani and Mbeki are members of the ANC’s eight-member political- military committee, the senior body that directs the activities of the ANC’s 5,000-member guerrilla army, known as Umkhonto We Sizwe (Spear of the Nation). Umkhonto guerrillas have con- ducted a low-level sabotage cam- paign inside South Africa for more than two decades. Yet, except for a few scattered clashes with police, they have not made their presence felt in South Africa during the cur- rent 39-day state of emergency. Hani, the chief “political com- missar” of ANC’s guerrilla army, said groups of a few armed las are trying to enter South Africa “almost every day.” Intense police and army surveillance makes it im- possible to send in as many as 20 guerrillas at a time, “We are ... working for a situa- tion (in which) our people, every- one, would have an AK,” said Hani. “If our people had AKs, the. situa- tion would be radically changed in a few months. If all those people go- ing out challenging the Caspirs (South African armored cars) had some rocket launchers and AKs, then those soldiers and police would not be patrolling those streets.” AK is the worldwide guerrilla slang term for the rapid-firing Ka- lashnikov AK-47 assault rifle manu- factured in the Soviet Union. Hani said the Soviet Union has been supplying ANC exile forces with military aid, including AK-47s, land mines, explosives and uni- forms. Although the ANC includes vari- ous brands of ideology, its leaders acknowledge working closely with the banned South African Commu- nist Party. ANC sources confirmed that Joe Slovo and Moses Mabhida, two of guerril- the eight members of the ANC’s key political-military committee, are senior South African Communist Party officials. Mbeki and Hani said the ANC could not afford to shun communist military aid, especially since it gets none from the West. “The United States of America, a country which is not communist, had no problems with fighting with the Soviet Union against Hitler,” Hani said, lowing the 1976 Soweto riots — are receiving training that includes the use of small arms and artillery in i Fret Taian, Rak Coy 008 Although Hani did not mention this, intelligence sources believe most of the ANC’s roughly 5,000 fighters are deployed in austere camps in Angola.

        "ocr_text": "Sudan trial puts focus on Coke, boycott deal By Joseph Albright Cox News Service KHARTOUM, Sudan — A charge that a Sudanese government minister improperly allowed Coca-Cola Co. to evade an Arab business boycott is playing a promi- nent role in a trial five months after the downfall of President Gaafar Nimeiri. The defendant, Baha Eddin Mohamed Idris, sat at a wooden table Sunday as the 30th prosecution witness testified about a string of alleged government favors, ‘including a 1980 letter telling Coca-Cola it would be free to do business in Sudan. At the time, Coca-Cola was on a blacklist aimed at companies that ‘do business in Israel. Baha was the second most powerful man in Sudan before the April 6 coup, which prevented Nimeiri from returning from a trip to Washington. The Coca-Cola allegations are among charges that Baha endangered Sudan’s independence while sabotag- ing the econemy. — The official Sudanese news agency has reported that Baha faces penalties that include life imprisonment, ‘death or “cross-limb amputation.” Such amputation is a ‘centuries-old Islamic penalty for theft, and Nimeiri made it a prominent feature of Sudan’s criminal code. Prosecutors have introduced a 1980 letter from Ba- ha’s files in which he informed a Coca-Cola official, Sam Ayoub, that Sudan would lift its bottling boycott. Under terms of a 1958 law, only the president was empowered to lift a boycott. Documents show that Ni- meiri did not sign such an order until 1983. Sunday's witness, former Finance Minister Ibrahim Mouneim Mansour, testified that he awarded a Coca- Cola bottling concession in 1982 to a local company whose representatives reportedly had been in contact with Baha. Mansour said he acted on the basis of Ba- ha’s 1980 letter. Defense lawyer Abdulaziz Shiddo maintained Baha did nothing illegal. He said Baha merely was reporting on a preliminary decision by Nimeiri for which the pa- per work apparently had been mislaid. _. Testimony showed that Coca-Cola granted a fran- chise to another company in 1983, about the time Ni- imeiri ordered the boycott lifted. - Despite the trial, Coca-Cola still is being sold and bottled in Sudan.

        "ocr_text": "Middleman could link Bulgaria with papal plot By Joseph Albright Cox News Service ROME — Lawyers for accused Bulgarian plotter Sergei Ivanov An- tonov have been stunned to learn that a Turkish alleged middleman in the papal shooting case has been spared from prosecution — a clue suggesting Italian investigators may have cultivated an important mys- tery witness to shore up their hy- oe of a “Bulgarian Connec- on.’”” When a reporter broke the news Friday to Antonov defense lawyer Giuseppe Consolo that the Turkish middleman was not indicted with seven other alleged suspects, Consolo interrupted the interview. “That is impossible! No, that is im ible!’’ exclaimed Consolo, shaking his head. Picking up a phone, he summoned Antonov co-counsel Adoifo Larussa from an adjacent office. For several minutes they pored over the report- er’s photocopy of the official sum- mary of charges, looking in vain for the name of a man who is uniquely “Sree in the scheme, Bekir Ce- enk. In the indictment released Friday, Celenk was charged with offering a bounty of $1.2 million to Agca and two other Turks for the pope’s mur- der, with the money to come from “unknown donors.” ; Celenk, in a December 1982 press conference in Sofia, denied ever meeting Agca. But, according to the Italian prosecutor’s secret report, as a result of Mersan’s statements, “it cannot be denied ... that it is Celenk who has lied and not Agca.”’ The prosecutor’s report said Acga got help from Mersan in Bulgaria in July 1980 upon arriving on a false passport as a fugitive from a Turk-— ish murder sentence. Mersan not only gave Agca money and found him a room at Sofia’s plushest hotel, according to the prmcction report. The report said e also “put him in touch with Bekir Celenk, a potent Turkish mafia boss.” It was Celenk, according to the prosecutor’s report, who arranged a meeting at Sofia’s Vitoosha Hotel in positioned to harm the Bulgarian’s defense if he decides to talk when the case comes to court next year. He is Omer Mersan, 34, a Turkish businessman based in West Germany who has also from time to time operated in Bulgaria. As of last spring, he reportedly worked for the vocaar Export Import Co. of Mu- nich. Mersan is the only figure in the case known to have admitted to Ital- ian investigators that he had deal- ings inside Bulgaria with Mehmet Ali Agca, who was imprisoned for life for shooting the pope on May 13, 1981, in St. Peter’s Square. Mersan’s whereabouts now are undisclosed. Consolo said Mersan “disap ” this spring following six days of questioning by the chief examining magistrate in the case, Ilario Martella. Consolo said he has heard only rumors of Mersan’s whereabouts since then. A secret prosecution report, leaked to the press this summer, recommended to Martella that Mer- san be indicted with the same cast ACCUSED: Sergei Ivanov Antonov late July 1980 between Agca and an agent of the Bulgarian secret serv- ice, identified as Todor Aivazov. The prosecutor’s report was com- pleted May 8. That was just three weeks after Martella had finished a week of closed-door questioning of Mersan in Rome. of three Bulgarians and four Turks who were actually charged Friday. Martella ignored the recommenda- tion, offering no explanation. If Mersan could be induced to testify, this would provide a much needed boost to the Italian case against the seven defendants. Up to now it has seemingly hung on the word of Agca, a convicted terrorist. who has shown a propensity to lie to please his captors. Italian officials have offered no explanation of why Mersan wasn’t indicted or where he is. The prosecution report contained the little noticed disclosure that Mersan had reluctantly confirmed certain key allegations by Agca about Agca’s contacts inside Bul- garia. The secret report said that after “endless negotiations’’ Mersan con- firmed ‘‘miscellaneous details and conferences” that Agca claims he had in Bulgaria. 7 These involved Agca’s otherwise unsubstantiated story about his meetings in Sofia in July 1980 with the alleged Turkish paymaster and Atlanta Constitution - October 28, 1985 \f"

In the last month before the summit in Switzerland, Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Pres- ident Reagan have put forward competing plans to cut back the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two superpowers by a breathtaking 50 percent. However, the two days of final preliminary talks, including a rough four-hour session in the Kremlin be- tween Shultz and Gorbachev, failed to find even the outlines of a solu- tion for their remaining differences on space wea , cruise missiles and a half dozen other military hardware questions. Nor were there any hints of oth- er. forthcoming agreements on the Middle East, Afghanistan or the re- lease of Soviet dissidents. Shultz said that as the talks were about to end, he and Soviet Foreign Minister Edward Shevard- nadze agreed to tell the public that while there had been some: “posi- tive’ developments, the two sides also see that “there are many seri- ous differences beween us, which I suppose suggests the need for a {summit} meeting.” a nuclear arms agreement - Geneva summit meeting in ° -- The Associated Press Secretary of State George Shultz (right) chats with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev before their four-hour parley Tuesday. “I don’t want to overdo the nar- rowing of the issues,” Shultz told Western journalists. Shultz replied somberly when asked to evaluate the likelihood that Reagan and Gorbachev would suc- ceed in achieving an agreement: in principle on mutual nuclear cuts during their Nov. 19-20 meeting. Shultz said arms talks are still under way between U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva, but “there ‘was nothing from our discussions to- day from which to draw that con- clusion.” _. ‘The secretary of state was the first senior U.S. official to confer with Gorbachev since Vice Presi- dent George Bush’s brief protocol visit in March at the Kremlin funer- al of Kostantin Chernenko, Gorba- chev’s predecessor. ~ From Shultz’s account, it was Clear that Gorbachev did little to turn on the charm, as he had done in previous meetings with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi. “He’s accustomed to inter- rupting, expressing a view,” said Shultz, adding that he had done like- wise on the principle that “when in Moscow, do as those in Moscow do.” After conferring for nearly four hours with Gorbachev, Shultz and Shevardnadze held a final two-hour session, adding to the eight hours of talks between the two foreign min- isters on Monday. Shultz said the 14 hours of conversations proceeded item by item through a list of sub- jects Reagan and Gorbachev want to discuss in Geneva. Shultz said in answer to a ques- tion that the Soviets gave him no hint that they might be preparing to free the exiled Soviet physicist An- drei Sakharov, whose wife, Yelena Bonner, has been granted permis- sion to go to the West for an ey operation. ‘ Shults said he was struck by how differently the two sides view each other. What he described as the “frank arguments” between him and the Kremlin leaders had served about summit after Kremlin talks ‘to underline, he said, the fact that “the view here of the United States is very different than we think ‘the reality is.” . His assessment was distinctly more downbeat than after his last summit preparatory meeting with Shevardnadze in New York last month. Shultz all but acknowledged that he is returning to Washington with no agreement on the shape of a communique for the two leaders’ approval at Geneva. Atlanta Constitution - November 6, 1985 \f"

Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev listened impassively on the balcony while his wife, Raisa, sat in the audience.

A few. slogans,: such as “Peoples of the: werld, fight Atlanta Constitution - November 8, against plans to militarize space,” criticized American policy but did not identify the United States by name. The traditional Red Square parade following Soko- lov's speech was shorter than usual and displayed none of the strategic and intermediate-range nuclear rockets at issue in the summit meeting that opens in 11 days. The weapons display was preceded by a snappy mil- itary parade of some 4,000 troops from officers’ col- leges, the paratroopers, the naval marines, the KGB border guards and the infantry. When the last rocket had passed, civilians in mass formations continued the parade, carrying thousands of red banners, balloons and:-paper flowers. There were floats and other types of banners.

But USS, officials, speaking on condition that they not be identified, said the two leaders would announce at the joint ceremony that Gorbachev would visit the United States next year and that Reagan would go to the Soviet Union in 1987, +e boy Specific locations and plans for the back-to-back follow-up summit conferences are still to be worked out, the sources said. The quick succession of three superpower summit meetings, after a lapse of more than six years, re- called the pace of summit diploma- cy in the 1970s. .. There were U.S.-Soviet summit meetings in 1972 and 1973, and two ‘in 1974. President Ford and Soviet . ‘leader Leonid Brezhnev met in Hel- | sinki, Finland, in 1975 while attend- -ing a 35-nation conference on East- . West tensions. _ The Associated Press reported ‘that Secretary of State George ‘Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister ‘Edward Shevardnadze would partic- ipate in a document-signing ceremo- ‘ my during the leaders’ joint appear- “ance. A U.S. source indicated that ‘there would be a joint statement to rovide impetus on arms control t that the leaders would issue no ‘specific guidelines to help negotia- tors break the current impasse. A follow-up summit would pro- vide both sides a chance to build on the two leaders’ apparent personal rapport — clearly the most unex- pected. aspect of the summit. .. Speakes said that Reagan and Gorbachev shook hands before a roaring fireplace at the Americans’ lakeside villa to seal what he de- scribed as their “agreement.” _ The leaders’ wives and a hand- ful of their senior foreign policy aides witnessed the handshake in a drawing room after the Reagans hosted a dinner of lobster souffle, chicken ine, cheese mousse and lemon souffle. Speakes said that the joint news blackout that has been in force dur- ing the summit would not be lifted until “the two leaders speak.” A few hours earlier, a press . Statement released with the approv- al of Reagan and Gorbachev con- tained this key sentence: “There are broad areas of agreement and other areas on which further discussions must take place.’”’ Both sides de- clined to elaborate. Reagan is scheduled to address Congress 17 hours after his joint ap- rance with Gorbachev, making ursday one of the longest days of his presidency. Reagan’s speech: is set to begin 45 minutes after Air Force One lands at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland, after a seven- hour flight across the Atlantic. Rea- gan will return to the White House via Brussels, Belgium, where he plans to brief America’s NATO on the two-day summit. After holding a press conference in Geneva, Gorbachev planned to fly- to Prague, Czechoslovakia, for a parallel meeting with his allies in the Warsaw Pact. The two leaders “are likely to say something” about a possible fol- low-up summit or summits just be- fore they leave Geneva, chief Soviet spokesman Leonid Zamyatin told a packed briefing Wednesday morn- ing. It was the first solid indication ota agreement might be in the Reagan romptly told sveceears that “of courae’’ Mie. would e to see Gorbachev in the United States. ‘There is much that divides us,” Reagan added, “but I believe the world breathes easier because we are here talking together.” Later, however, the Soviet dele- gation threw the Americans a curve by announcing unexpectedly that Gorbachev would hold a solo.press conference Thursday morning. The Gorbachev conference was rescheduled for later Thursday only after Reagan and Gorbachev settled on their joint appearance. Atlanta Constitution - November 21, 1985 \f"

Gorbachev to go for a walk. The two leaders left a larger meeting of their subordinates and . Strolled down a path to a pool house beside Lake Geneva. The pool house was on the grounds of Villa Fleur D’Eau, the millionaire’s villa lent to ‘the Americans as a meeting site by the Swiss government. The “walk at the edge of the woods,” as White House spokesman _ Larry Speakes called it, clearly wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment inspi- ‘ ration on Reagan’s part.

The experts’ meeting lasted well past midnight, broke up, and then reconvened Wednesday. The news blackout held tight: 3,000 reporters in Geneva didn’t re- alize an experts’ meeting was going on, even though this was exactly the procedure that led: to summit agree- ments during President Richard Nixon’s three summit meetings with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Among Reagan’s deputies in the “experts” meetings were American arms control adviser Paul Nitze, Pentagon arms expert Richard Perle and Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway, who heads the State Department bureau with responsibility for the Soviet Union. The summit talks continued on ex- Viet- three parallel tracks Wednesday morning: @ Reagan and Gorbachev talked privately with only their interpret- ers present. @ Half a dozen “principal” dele- gates from both sides traded views on regional conflicts at a formal “plenary” session. @ And USS. and Soviet lower-lev- el experts met to draft language for a final agreement.

It was crunch time. The experts from the two sides, having worked much of the night, were finally close to agreeing on language. Now the principals needed time to go over what the experts had re- solved and what they hadn't. Shultz, McFarlane and the other U.S. prin- cipals drove from the Soviet mis- sion to caucus with Nitze and the other American experts. . Reagan and Gorbachev stayed behind, continuing their tete-a-tete. They stood for a while in a large hall and then sat down in a smaller room to drink coffee. Forty-five minutes later, at 4:15 p.m. (10:15 p.m. EST), the Soviet and American principals, along with the experts, returned to the Soviet mission. The Soviet and American princi- pals went back into plenary session, apparently without rechecking for further instructions from Reagan and Gorbachev. At 5 p.m. (11 a.m. EST), Shultz, Shevardnadze and the other princi- pals decided they had gone as far as they could go. Experts and princi- pals ‘from the American and Soviet delegations, 30 people in all, were ushered into a room with Reagan and Gorbachev. Shultz summarized where things stood, with Shevardnadze comment- ing from time to time. Atlanta Constitution - November 21, 1985 (Sidebar) \f"

Gorbachev said that during the summit he and Reagan “uncovered that we do seem to share a certain initial premise as concerns improv- ing our relations. That is the under- Standing that a nuclear war cannot occur, that there can be no winners in a nuclear war.” He said the two leaders agreed “not to give out any more stupid re- marks” about each other's countries or to blame each other for every in- ternational change. As an example, he said it would be “irresponsible” for Westerners to view the hand of Moscow in any fu- ture convulsions in Brazil, Mexico or other debt-ridden nations if they are unable to pay interest on their huge debts. “You can imagine what effect ‘that’s having on their societies,” Gorbachev said. “And this situation is going to get worse. There is going Strategic Defense Initiative, com- monly called “Star Wars.” “We cannot understand his atti- tudes,’”’ Gorbachev said. “The Amer- icans did not like our logic ex- pressed at the meetings, but we did not even see the logic of their argu- ments.” Suggesting that the summit con- versations sometimes got rough, Gorbachev said they were ‘‘very frank talks, sometimes ... very lively, and at one point they became very, very lively.’’. Gorbachev spoke for an hour and then answered about a dozen questions from an invitation-only audience of 250 international jour- nalists in a conference room at the Soviet mission. His questioners, to be an explosion, so again, are people going to say, ‘That's the hand of Moscow’?” He said he and Reagan “touched” on the topics of Central America, the Middle East and Afri- ca, with emphasis on the “principles behind these various regional is- sues.” Regarding economic issues, he said he told the president that in- creased trade between the two countries would contribute to a “healthier atmosphere of trust.” “If we trade together, then we depend on each other more,” he ex- plained. “And if we depend on each other more, that can’t help but af- fect the political side of things.” But the theme that recurred throughout the press conference was his frustration at being unable to communicate on the same wave- length as Reagan on the issue of space weaponry.

The United States is strong in computer sciences, radio communi- cations and some other kinds of technology, he said, leading some Americans to seek superiority over the Soviet Union. “One could even quote President [Lyndon] Johnson way back, who said that whoever manages to gain power in space will rule the Earth,” he said. 1985 \f"

He said the authorities in the control tower reminded the hijack- ers of the Achille Lauro ship affair in October, which ended when Navy F-14 fighter jets intercepted an Egyptian plane carrying the hijack- ers to safety. ; In a bit of irony, the captain disclosed that the Boeing 737 hi- jacked to Malta was the same plane the Americans had forced to land at Sigonella, Sicily, with the four Pal- estinians who hijacked the Achille Lauro aboard. The captain said he told the hi- jackers that he wouldn’t risk taking off in the event the Americans might intercept the plane. “TI told them that if you want to kill me, kill me now.” Atlanta Constitution - November 25, 1985 (Sidebar) \f"

Yet here in western Sudan, trail of responsibility stands out lik footprints in a dry creekbed. |] leads back to a forgotten Sudanes water p roject that began 20 year ago with aid from the Swedish go ernment and, briefly, from the U.!

Deserts spread in rings aroun each well. As time passed and peo- ple and cattle moved in from miles around, the arid rings grew wider and wider. People who had been no- mads cleared trees to grow crops on soil that soon was exhausted. (In Washington, international ‘aid officials nodded knowingly when in- formed of the Sudanese desert rings. They told of similar phenomena in other countries south of the Sahara (“La cercle de la mort,” said World Bank forestry expert Jean Gorse, referring to observations in what was once French West Africa. “The circle of death.”’) The wells and the circles of death they led to did not cause the African drought, or even the famine associated with it.

Kelly, whose research on the So- viet plan was supported by grants from the U.S. Naval Research Lab- oratory. has said that shrinking the Arctic ice pack conceivably could raise temperatures throughout the Northern Hemisphere by several de- grees and cause changes in rainfall, threatening widespread crop fail- ures in warmer latitudes. The concern is based on the fact that fresh water flowing into the Arctic is lighter than salt water and tends to float on it. Beneath this layer of mostly fresh water is a lay- er of “Atlantic water’? — which has been driven north by Atlantic Ocean currents. - The fresh water serves to insu- late the icecap from the warmer “Atlantic water.’ “There is no doubt that modifi- cation of nature on the scale of the proposed transfers will result in substantial ecological and environ- mental consequences,’’ Kelly said in a paper published last year. “‘Scien- tists both within and outside the -S.S.R. are considering the magni- tude of the irmpacts and the possibl meed to take anticipatory remedial action or. indeed, to exert pressure to alter the transfer plans.” Kelly. a professor at the Univer- sity of East Anglia in Norwich, England, said the first of the Soviet project apparently would di- vert an amount of water that is within the normal variations in riv- er flow.

        "ocr_text": "Clues hint first day’s talks went well Shultz, Gromyko seemed to be in ‘very good mood’ By Joseph Albright Cox News Service GENEVA, Switzerland — One day into the revived U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms talks, the most that can be safely said is that they haven’t failed yet — and they might be on the verge of getting somewhere. After 13 months of long-distance shout- ing, American and Soviet officials held six hours and 50 minutes of face-to-face discus- sions on nuclear arms Monday while snow- flakes swirled in the streets. Another session is set for Tuesday. As with the Reagan news confer- ence, the speed with which the NATO briefing was planned could indicate the -Americans already *know how the two-day Shultz-Gro- myko talks will turn out. @ To Western reporters allowed to observe Shultz and Gromyko dur- ing brief ‘photo opportunities,” the two foreign secretaries were smil- ing, jocular and animated, especial- ly at the start of the afternoon ne- gotiating session and at an early evening cocktail reception at the American mission. ; @ Several Soviet correspondents also sounded distinctly hopeful. One Tass reporter, Alexander Shalnev, told about 50 Western reporters that both Gromyko and Shultz appeared to be “in a very good mood” when he observed them at the evening cocktail reception. One potential area for compro- mise involves a possible ban on fu- ture anti-satellite weapon tests. The Soviets, who already have a crude anti-satellite weapon in their inventory, announced in August 1983 a unilateral moratorium on further anti-satellite testing and have been pressing the United States to do likewise. Reagan, in a speech to the Unit- ed Nations last Sept. 24, declared that if arms talks resumed between the superpowers, ‘‘we would consid- er what measures of restraint both sides might take while negotiations proceed.” While there were no authoritative disclo- sures Monday, a pattern of faint clues emerged hinting that things went well in the first day of preliminary talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and U‘S. Secretary of State George Shultz. ° Interpreting what happened behind the Soviet and American mission walls was like listening for the dog that didn’t bark. The hopeful clues included: @ After the meetings with Gromyko, the U.S. delegation clamped a news blackout on the substance of what happened. In so doing, American officials were reverting to the no- disclosure guidelines that used to prevail in Geneva until U.S.-Soviet arms talks collapsed in December 1983. @ Moscow Radio, Tass and other Soviet A U.S. concession to forgo fu- ture anti-satellite weapons tests, if it materializes, would go a signifi- cant distance toward satisfying So- viet leader Konstantin Chernenko’s calle Saturday for measures to pre- vent an arms race in space. At the same time, an anti-satel- lite testing moratorium would not directly affect Reagan’s much- prized Star Wars space research project, whose objective is to knock down incoming enemy missiles after they are launched. The opening meeting took place at the Soviet permanent mission here, with six Soviets and six Amer- icans arrayed around an oblong wooden table in front of note pads, ballpoint pens and three bottles of mineral water. Joining Shultz on the American side of the table were Robert McFarlane, President Reagan’s na- tional security adviser; Paul Nitze, Shultz’s senior arms control adviser; Arthur Hartman, the U.S. ambassa- dor to Moscow; and Jack Matlock, a Russian-speaking National Security Council staffer; and Dmitri Arens- burger, a State Department translator. On the Soviet side were Gromy- ko; his first deputy, Georgi Kor- nienko;,; arms control specialist Vik- tor Karpov; ambassador to Washington Anatoly Dobrynin; the deputy head of the American desk, Aleksandr Obukov; and interpreter Viktor Sukhodrev. news organs appeared to mute @reir criticism Monday of the gan administration’s arms policies. As late as Sunday, the Soviet press was still roundly denouncing the dangers of President Reagan’s Star Wars plan. However, no major blasts at Reagan were reported af- ter the talks got under way. @ Reagan announced earlier he would hold a full-scale news conference Wednesday night — something Reagan typically has not done when there was bad news in the offing. His last prime-time news conference was July 24, 1984. @ About the same time, NATO ambassa- dors in Belgium let it be known that they had been invited to a briefing Wednesday by a high-level member of the Shultz delegation.

        "ocr_text": "Soviets mapping arms control strategy By Joseph Albright Cox News Service GENEVA, Switzerland — Soviet leader Kon- stantin Chernenko and heads of the six other War- saw Pact nations are due to hold a summit con- ference this week that may launch a fresh peace offensive aimed at stopping installation of U.S. missiles in Europe. Western analysts say ion long-planned com- reading yet on the East Bloc’s public relations strategy for capitalizing on the agreement in Ge- neva to open talks on space weapons and nuclear arms. The chronic poor health of the 72-year-old Chernenko has led to conflicting signals about where the meeting will take place. Bulgaria has announced that it will host this first Warsaw Pact summit in two years. And a Bulgarian diplomat in Rome said on Thursday the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. However, Western analysts said on Friday that backup preparations are apparently under way in Moscow to hold the session there in case Chernenko is not fit to travel. Wherever the meeting is held, it is sure to feature a briefing by Soviet Foreign Minister An- munist summit is likel retary of State George Shultz. The Warsaw Pact session, re- portedly slated to open on Wednes- day, is expected to attract not only the ranking communist party lead- ers but also the foreign and defense ministers of the Soviet Union, Po- land, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bul- garia, Romania and East Germany. The tone of the final Warsaw Pact communique is expected to be less stridently critical of the United States than comparable statements over the last three years. At the same time, in the view of Western specialists who have fol- lowed past Warsaw Pact summits, a central purpose of the meeting will be to rekindle “‘no-more-nukes” pro- tests, especially in Western Europe. At the last Warsaw Pact sum- mit in Prague in January 1983, the late Soviet leader Yuri Andropov pushed through a similar strategy of stirring public protests against U.S.- made Pershing II and cruise mis- siles. The effort failed when West German, British and Italian govern- ments decided to accept the mis- siles beginning 13 months ago. One feature of Warsaw Pact strategy this time around is likely to be an East Bloc call for various forms of freezes and moratoriums as a sign of “seriousness” by the United States in approaching the new talks. During the Geneva talks, Gro- myko declined an American propos- al to set a date and place for the opening of space and nuclear arms negotiations. Nor could the two sides agree on the panos divi- 1 Gromyko sttemfiy. to delay Ane a of full-scale negotiations in provide the clearest States to enter “temporary” deploy- ment freezes as a sign of good faith. The following interchange sever- al days ago between Shultz adviser Paul Nitze and a TV interviewer suggests the Soviets will have little or no trouble conveying to Europe- an audiences the notion that the United States is playing stubborn: Q.: Will there be any interrup- tion in research on strategic defense initiative, or Star Wars, weapons? Nitze: No. Q.: Will there be any moratori- um on anti-satellite weapons? Nitze: No. Priority: pressure on U.S. Q.: Will there be any interrup- tion in the deployment schedule of the new NATO missiles? Nitze: No. U.S. National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, asked by Cox News Service about a possible can- cellation of this spring’s U.S. anti- satellite weapon test, disclosed that U.S. negotiators in Geneva hinted strongly to Gromyko that President Reagan might consider putting off the test once the talks get started. Gromyko did not respond to the American hint, McFarlane said. Gromyko’s reasons, in the view of some Western analysts, probably included these: @ He doesn’t worry much about the relatively primitive ‘‘tomato can” anti-satellite projectile that the Pentagon plans to test this spring. @ He wants to keep the world’s focus on space weapons in general, rather than allowing Washington to split off anti-satellite weapons as a separate issue. @ His highest priority, in the short run, is to a oe on re for a halt in deployments of i cruise missiles in me ts ve the War.

The arithmetic of nuclear tar- geting suggests such a deal might appeal not just to a broad spectrum of Europeans but to Soviet military planners as well. Western unofficial estimates suggest that the Soviets have enough intermediate-range missiles and planes at the ready so they could offer a major cutback without diminishing their power to smash NATO’s. military ere, That, at least, is the implication of the most authoritative unclassified study on nuclear targeting in The study, by Massachusetts In- stitute of Technology professor Ste- phen Meyer, calculated that there are only about 280 airfields, mili- tary bases, nuclear storage sites and other “primary targets” in Western eyer estimated that even after allowing for missile inaccuracy, a force of 221 SS-20 Soviet missiles would be sufficient to obliterate all of these “primary” military targets.

        "ocr_text": "Bulgarian name campaign ignited by history By Joseph Albright Cox News Service HASKOVO, Bulgaria — “Comrade chair- man,” the form in Bulgarian reads, “I ask you to change my own personal family name on my identity card. ...” The mimeographed document, slipped to Western journalists by a source critical of the communist regime, looks no more menacing than a postal change-of-address card. Yet in the last three months, according to un- official sources here, the Bulgarian communist regime has used forms like this in a campaign to pressure tens of thousands of Bulgarians. with Turkish ethnic roots into adopting Bulgarian names. “The usual method has been for the militia to surround a village at night,’ said one man sympathetic to ethnic Turks. “They enter people’s houses and ask people to sign the forms for a change of name. If they sign, no problem. If not, they use threats or vio- lence, sometimes severe beatings.” What is behind this bizarre business in the backwaters of Bulgaria? What does Eastern Eu- rope’s most solidly entrenched regime find threatening about a bunch of farmers and arti- sans having names like Mehmet Ali Ecevit? No outsider knows the full rationale, in part because the Bulgarian newspapers have not even acknowledged the existence of a name-change campaign. For foreign consumption, Bulgarian spokes- men say that allegations about forcible name changes are “sheer fabrication.” They insist that all citizens, including those of Turkish origin, can choose any names they wish. Outsiders hunting for explanations believe that a variety of ingredients, some old and some new, have been simmering for a long time to form a distinctively Bulgarian stew. Among the factors: Bitterness lingers over Ottomans @ Bitterness lingers among Bulgarians about brutality suffered by their ancestors during the 482 years Bulgaria was occupied by the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Well beyond the Middle Ages, Turks used to send military expeditions into Bulgaria to cap- ture Christian boys who were forced to convert to Islam. As recently as 1876, Turkish forces massacred 15,000 Bulgarians in Plovdiv, now Bulgaria’s second largest city. (The Turkish over- lords were finally ejected by armies of czarist Russia in 1878, and now only the remnants of the old Turkish peasantry remains.) , @ Beyond historical bitterness, Bulgaria has viewed pro-Western Turkey as a direct military threat at least since 1944, when communists WALTER CUMMING/Staft seized power in Bulgaria. Fearing potential sub- versives, Bulgarian authorities have gradually closed separate Turkish schools, harassed those who speak Turkish in public, and discouraged Is- lamic marriages, funerals and circumcision rites. A matter of national policy @ More than a decade ago, at the 10th Com- munist Party Congress in 1971, Bulgarian leaders declared it a matter of national policy that “citi- zens of our country of different national origins will come ever closer together.” But efforts to “Bulgarize” the Turks through voluntary means have found little success. @A bureaucratic deadline in late 1985 may have pushed Bulgarian officials into trying to ac- celerate the assimilation. Authorities are trying to finish a five-year task of assigning new identi- ty cards to all citizens — but there are indica- tions ethnic Turks may have been passively re- sisting by not turning in their old cards on schedule. @ Authorities are also reportedly planning a national census in 1985 which might reveal em- barrassingly high numbers of Turkish names. Bulgarian communists have sought to promote marriages and discourage birth control, especial- ly among ethnic Bulgarians, because the country is seen as having a labor shortage. Some Bulgari- ans worry that the ethnic Turkish have more ba- bies faster than do the majority of Bulgarians. @ What may have been the last straw came last August when at least two terrorist bombs exploded in cities on the same day Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov was paying visits. Al- though no group claimed responsibility and no- body has been arrested, minority Turks are known to have come under police suspicion. For whatever the reasons, credible non-com- munist sources say a majority of the roughly 300,000 ethnic Turks in southern Bulgaria have been pressured into switching their ancestral names just since November. This month, Bulgari- an authorities have reportedly begun pressing for mass name switches in other ethnic Turkish pockets in northern Bulgaria. As many as 1 million of Bulgaria’s roughly 9 million citizens are said to be Turkish by ances- try. As of 1974 there were also an estimated 50,000 Pomaks — Bulgarian Moslems descended from Bulgarians who were induced to convert from Christianity under the Ottomans. Perhaps the most surprising development is that even in the face of overwhelming Bulgarian police strength, some of the normally compliant ethnic Turks are fighting back. Security cordon imposed last week Last weekend, it was learned that the Bul- garian Interior Ministry has had to impose a 500- square-mile security cordon around one heavily Turkish section about 125 miles southeast of the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. In the center of the security zone, isolated and still reportedly — with Bulgarian tanks, lies a town whose 29,000 inhabitants are almost all ethnic Turks. Last December, according to unofficial - sources, at least two dozen Momcilgrad residents were killed while trying to resist pressure by the militiamen to sign the name-change forms. One ethnic Turk living in a nearby town told this reporter last weekend he thought 160 people died in the Momcilgrad resistance. He said Mom- cilgrad people struggled back, in some cases us- ing guns against the militia. This man, the only Turk in the region who has talked to a Western reporter, said that al- though Momcilgrad is only 15 miles from the Greek frontier, no one has been able to escape because of what he called a “Chinese Wall of sol- diers” along the border. The Sofia Press Agency, the official overseas information organ of the Bulgarian state, chose not to answer a reporter's written question on whether the Momcilgrad resistance had been brought under control. A strong hint that something is still going badly for authorities came last Wednesday when the Bulgarian state tourist agency canceled 1,000 hotel reservations in Bulgaria held by tourists from Turkey. The cancellation message, which complained of “anti-Bulgarian” stories in the Turkish press, will cost Bulgaria significantly, not only in tour- ist revenues but also in its long-term diplomatic relations with neighboring Turkey. In the short term, it will mean authorities will be able to keep the lid for a little longer on what really is going on in Momcilgrad. Without the tourist ban, a forthcoming Turkish school va- cation would have brought hundreds of Turkish tourists to ski areas and towns on the fringe of the security zone around Momcilgrad. - Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 27, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bulgarian speaks for first time on ‘naivete’ of papal plot Accused mastermind denies he had role in assassination try By Joseph Albright Cox News Service SOFIA, Bulgaria — The highest- ranking Bulgarian wanted in Rome for attempting to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981 says the con- spiracy he allegedly masterminded is too amateurish to have happened. “You would have to assume that we can make such mistakes that are absolutely unforgiveable even in detective stories,” said Lt. Col. Zhe- lyo Vassilev, 42, a former assistant military attache at the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome. Vassilev also made it plain that he is worried about leaving Bulgar- ia to participate in the “Bulgarian connection” trial, which is expected to open in a Rome criminal court this spring. “There would be a strong possi- bility of spending the rest of my life in an Italian jail because of the lies of a professional assassin and psy- chologically unstable person,” he said, referring to Mehmet Ali Agca, the convicted papal assailant and INDICTED: Zhelyo Vassilev. Vassilev’s accuser. In one of his first interviews since being indicted in absentia by an Italian court last October, Vassi- lev said he has no plans to attend his trial in Rome unless he receives “certain guarantees that I would not be sent to jail without reason.” He insisted that Italian officials have unfairly “manipulated” Agca to give false testimony against him and fellow Bulgarians. If, somehow, Vassilev is con- vinced to go to Rome, he would make a compelling defense witness. He came across in a 90-minute in- terview as smart, unflappable, worldly and glacier-cool. He also speaks good Italian. But the feature that an Italian court would probably find most persua- sive is his height. He stands only 5 feet 4, and Agca is on record as swearing to Italian investigators back in 1982 that Vassilev was be- tween 5 feet 11 and 6 feet 1. When’ Bulgarian officials pounced on Agca’s mistake, Agca retreated, saying he confused the heights of two Bulgarians due to “mental tiredness.” Vassilev says he has been in the Bulgarian army since he was 19 and has been an officer since he was 24. When he was in his mid-30s, he said, he was assigned to what he called the International Relations Department at military headquar- ters in Sofia. After two years, he was sent in 1979 as secretary to the military attache in Rome, where he served until returning to Sofia in August 1982. Was not in secret service Although many countries use such military attache’s offices as Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 3, 1985 > \fBulgarian speaks covers for intelligence assignments, Vassilev said he never was part of the Bulgarian secret service, whose agents Agca has accused of partici- pating in the papal plot. Vassilev did not give a direct answer when a reporter asked whether he had reported to Bulgari- an military intelligence officials while assigned to Rome. Now serving as a tank unit com- mander, Vassilev readily answered a reporter's request for his critique of the plot as outlined in the Italian indictment. He said he never had studied terrorist techniques, “but I have read a number of detective stories, and from this point of view Agca’s statements don’t stand up at all.” He said that when he first heard news from St. Peter’s Square four years ago, “I was impressed by the fact that this attempt on the pope’s life was rather naive.” “To attempt an assassination of the pope in a crowd of several tens of thousands of people, the greatest part of which are really religious believers, and to think he (the as- sailant) can get away with it, is for me thorough naivete,” he said. He took even stronger issue with the plausibility of the alleged clan- destine meetings between Agca and Bulgarian diplomats in the days im- mediately before the assassination attempt. Bulgarian diplomats in Rome were under tight “intelligence sur- veillance” by Italian secret services at the time of the papal assassina- tion attempt, according to Vassilev. He said that taking “a notorious personality like Agca” on repeated rehearsal tours through the streets of Rome would have been an “un- forgiveable mistake” for anyone as well known as a foreign diplomat. To have done so, he said, would have entailed “the risk of having somebody see us on our first en- counter with Agca and have control exercised over us’ by Italian authorities. Agca’s side of the story The Italian indictment alleges that Vassilev met Agca three times in public places in Rome in the four days leading up to the shooting May 13, 1981. The two other Bulgarian defendants, Sergei Antonov and To- dor Aivazov, are described in the in- dictment as having met Agca seven more times at coffee bars, street corners and outdoor squares during those four days. Vassilev and Agca allegedly held a key planning session May 10, at a restaurant near Rome’s main railroad station, in the company of two other Bulgarians. It was there, Agca has testified, that Vassilev told him the attempt on the pope would have to proceed quickly because the French: Secret Service had gotten wind of a possi- ble attack from a Bulgarian double agent. Vassilev scoffed in the interview at that suggestion, saying -he was surprised to hear that Italian chief investigating magistrate Ilario Mar- tella “ascribes such superhurnan ca- pacities to us to know what the French Secret Services are doing.” The indictment charges that Vassilev gave Agca his final in- structions at a hurried outdoor meeting in St. Peter’s Square about eight hours before the shooting. By Agca’s testimony, it was Vassilev who pointed out the best “firing points,” who promised that another Turk would explode panic bombs to facilitate his escape, and who advised him to shoot during the pope’s second tour among the pilgrims. Vassilev said his promotion from major to lieutenant colonel in September 1983 — 13 months after he completed his term in Rome — is his “best proof” that he had noth- ing to do with the attempt. “I don’t know of any precedent in military history when an officer does not fulfill his assignment -and is still promoted. John Paul Il is still alive. Agca is in prison speak- ing about his Bulgarian accompyces and the officer who instructed hi how to do everything is promoted.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 3, 1985 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bulgarian Turks resisti By Joseph Albright Cox News Service SOFIA, Bulgaria — Bulgarian security troops are enforcing a reign of terror in dozens of towns and villages where the mostly un- armed ethnic Turkish citizens have been trying to resist being assigned new Slavic names, according to eye- witness accounts gathered in Bul- garia and Turkey. A Bulgarian spokesman, Philip Bokov, told a conference on Feb. 7, “The situation in the whole country is quite peaceful and normal.” But a three-week inquiry by a Cox News Service correspondent suggests that things are scarcely “normal” for the roughly 1 million Turks who are the largest minority in this Ohio-sized nation of 9 million people. Nor are things “normal” for rul- ing communist authorities in what has been the most stable of the So- viet satellite states. Here, for the first time since the Hungarian up- Eising in 1956, there are credible re- forts of protesters in an East Euro- pean communist state shooting back at authorities. -- The only weapons available to the Bulgarian Turks are thought to be a few old hunting rifles or shot- Even so, noncommunist diplo- mats believe at least four Bulgarian Security troops have been killed since December — along with be- tween 20 and 200 ethnic Turks. Among the fresh evidence turned up in the Cox inquiry: @A Turkish woman visiting eth- nic Turkish relatives in northeastern Bulgaria told how her cousin was shot, two of her grandsons disap- peared and one nephew committed suicide — all during a 19-day visit last month. @ Another woman who visited ethnic Turkish relatives in southern Bulgaria last fall told of watching a militiaman slug her brother with a nightstick and scare her 101-year- old mother into signing papers ac- cepting a new Bulgarian name. BA Western traveler who speaks Bulgarian told of asking a Bulgarian soldier at a roadblock what he and fellow soldiers were doing in northeastern Bulgaria. ng pressure MESSAGE FROM BULGARIA: In Istanbul, brothers Husnu and Muslem Guler hold a handkerchief with a message from their sister Feride in Bulgaria, notifying them that she now has the Slavic name of Fidanka Martinova. “Killing Turks,” the soldier replied, according to the traveler’s notes. The Interior Ministry is going to considerable lengths to suppress news of Turkish resistance. Measures have included jamming Turkish language broadcasts on the BBC and expelling three Turkish journalists. who entered the country on transit visas. Officials deny casualties On Feb. 10, I was given a 110- mile police escort back to Sofia af- ter being stopped while driving to- ward a Turkish-inhabited province of southern Bulgaria. With me in the rental car were two other journalists who had been given visas to come to Bulgaria for a press conference. One was a Turk- ish-speaking German journalist and the other was American. “On three earlier forays without a Turkish-speaking companion in late January and in early February, my car was turned back at four po- lice roadblocks near Turkish towns. But I was allowed to drive on with- out being followed. Bulgarian officials flatly deny that there have been any casualties. And they insist that no one in Bul- garia has been forced to adopt a new name against his or her will. The most compelling evidence to the contrary came on Thursday from Mrs. Fatima Nine, a diminu- tive 84-year-old grandmother who emigrated to Turkey from Bulgaria seven years ago. In a tearful interview in Istan- bul, she told of an ordeal that began one evening last month while she was back in Bulgaria visiting her grandchildren. The first thing she recalled was the electricity in her grandson's house being cut. Then there was a knock on the door. “Three people came in. They gathered everyone in one room and said they were looking for a doctor at the hospital. They took my grandson, who is a doctor, and put him in a car. “The next day, his wife looked at the hospital, at the jail, at rela- tives houses. She looked everywhere but couldn’t find him, and we still have no news from him.” Another grandson living near Sumen was taken from his home in a police car about midnight the same night, she said. Terrified, she and about four other family members piled into a family car, Mrs. Nine said. They to adopt Slavic names headed north for a small village where one of her cousins was the mayor. “It was empty,” she said. “Ev- eryone was gone.” So the family drove on to anoth- er village an hour away. There, a woman relative told her that her cousin, Mayor Niyazi Sifulaov, had been shot by Bulgarian soldiers af- ter he warned local people to flee into the mountains, One of her grandsons saw the body but she didn’t, Mrs. Nine said. After about two days, she said, the family drove back to Sumen. “The night before we arrived, my husband's brother’s child had committed suicide because he had to change his name,” she said. “He drank poison. I saw him buried. On his grave they had to put his Bul- garian name.” ‘Bloody things’ happening Fantastic as her account sounds, it appears to fit in with uncon- firmed reports foreigners in Sofia were receiving in mid-January about unspecified “bloody things” supposedly happening in and around Sumen. These reports reached Sofia via furtive telephone calls, but the lines went dead before any details could be relayed. Mrs. Nine’s story also appears to fit in with an odd conversation that is known to have taken place at a Bulgarian army roadblock about 60 miles west of Sumen in late January — before she took the train back to Turkey. - A Western traveler, who de- clines to be identified, said in an in- terview that his car was stopped by soldiers as he was trying to drive from Sofia to Sumen. The traveler said he struck up a conversation in Bulgarian with a talkative young Bulgarian soldier manning the roadblock. The traveler said that according to notes he wrote later that day, the soldier told him Turks in the region ahead were “ fighting back”. against government forces. Some of his army friends had been killed, the soldier said. When the Westerner asked what the soldiers were doing in the re- gion, the soldier replied, “Killing Turks,” according to the Western- er’s notes. A Cox Newspapers reporter try- ing to reach Sumen in a Bulgarian rental car about 10 days later was turned back by Bulgarian security troops at a different roadblock about 40 miles west of Sumen. The second woman, Mrs. Ha- mide Uslu, 57, said she traveled from Bebze, Turkey, to a village near Haskovo, Bulgaria, last fall. She planned a month-long visit to her 101-year-old mother, her broth-” er and several other relatives. “On the third day about mid- night, as we were eating, someone came and said the village was going to be invaded,” Mrs. Uslu said. “The younger relatives ran: away behind the house. My mother stayed on the bed and I hid under the bed. Three soldiers came and’ broke down the door with a crowbar ° one of them carried in his hand. “They asked my mother for her passport but she said she was too old to have a passport. Finally my’ mother cried out and the others came back into the house. “T heard my brother say, “We've | paid for this door, why did you. break it down?” One of the soldiers hit him on the shoulder with a night stick and he fell on his face. Every- one started to cry.” Mrs. Uslu said the “soldiers” produced papers and insisted that all the relatives, including her mother, must sign them. She said the “soldiers” left about an hour later, after all six adults in the. house had agreed to change their names. Atlanta Journal-Constitution February 17, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Europe's initial relief over arms talks turns to doubt amid Star Wars issue By Joseph Albright Cox News Service . SS GENEVA, Switzerland — Eu- rope greeted the arms talks that will begin here Tuesday with a great euphoric rush of relief when they were announced Jan. 8 by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. After 13 months of long-distance quarreling, at least ‘Les Deux Grands” would be talking face to face in Geneva. But now that the snow is about gone and the grass is green in Ge- neva, the joy of January seems to be giving way in Europe to tremors of foreboding. True, Reagan’s Star Wars de- fense project will be put before the Soviets on Tuesday with the ostensi- ble backing of all the major NATO allies. But behind a veneer of ap- proval lies a barrier of doubts. From chanceries to coffee bars, many Europeans concede that it was fear of Star Wars that forced the Soviets to choke their pride and resume arms talks without getting Reagan to remove a single cruise or Pershing missile. But now what? That's the ques- tion many Europeans are asking. One of the most frightening . questions Europeans ever. have to face, as Italian author Luigi Barzini has observed, is “whether the Amer- icans will wake up pragmatic. or idealistic tomorrow morning.” And so it is with Star Wars. Will it work? If it does, will the next ad- ministration go ahead with it? If so, will it encourage Americans to slide into a “fortress America” mentality and pull out U.S. troops? And in the other camp: Will the Soviets build their own Star Wars defenses? If so, what is the value to the French and British of their vaunted independent nuclear mini- arsenals? A further question mark was in- terjected three days ago by a high- ranking French general in an anony- mous article in Le Monde. Despite official French policy to the contrary, the general proposed that Europeans must start their own Star Wars crash program to avoid getting left in the lurch by Ameri- can and Soviet researchers. The general, who is rumored to have close ties to President. Fran- cois Mitterrand, argued passionately that Europeans must head off a So- viet-American “condominium” in space weaponry by building anti- missile defenses for “the four or five most important cities in Europe.” Britain, West Germany and Ita- ly have hit on a delicate formula of backing Star Wars for the ‘“re- search” phase. But they are with- holding judgment about supporting either the testing of weapons in space or actual deployment. It would amaze no one if Rea- gan finds European officials gradu- ally diluting their support for Star Wars even further in the next 18 months as the Geneva talks drag on and Reagan's term winds down. In 1981, Reagan collected a much more impressive set of testi- monials for his “zero option” nucle- ar missile proposal, under which the Soviets were to withdraw their mis- siles from Europe in exchange for cancellation of NATO plans to in- stall U.S. missiles in Western Europe.

        "ocr_text": "A behind-the-scenes glimpse at arms talks pomp and circumstance By Joseph Albright Cox News Service GENEVA, Switzerland — Inside the Soviet delegation headquarters at Villa Rosa, some clever Ameri- canologists must be beating their brows. What was this fellow Max Kam- pelman telling us? Are we missing something? - This Kampelman gets up there in front of the cameras Tuesday, right after the opening session. And he reads this formal statement call- ing himself the American negotiator on “nuclear and space arms.” But then — about 15 minutes later — the Tass reporter covering the American press center comes back with a mimeographed copy of Kampelman’s statement. Aha, one word is different. In the written text, Kampelman has dropped the word ‘‘nuclear.”’ In- lagged House delegation arrived and was taken to the President Hotel. Robert Vieux, Geneva’s dapper protocol officer, was scarcely agog at the prospect of greeting the American and Russian plenipoten- tiaries at Satellite 40. “We started out at 7:20 this morning with the secretary general of the United Nations,” he said. “We have got 24 groups we’ve got to meet here today, from the the presi- dent of Tanzania to the president of Niger to the minister of justice of Canada to the minister of this and the minister of that.” The protocol chief's last arrival of the day, he said, would be a Brit- ish minister of state due in at 9 p.m “I might not come out for that one,” Vieux sighed. ‘I only come out for important people.” The last week has been trying. stead, he calls himself the negotia- tor on “defense and space arms.” Hmmm. Ever since January, they have been telling us Kampel- man would only talk about space. Does this mean it has only taken Comrade Victor Karpov, the chief Soviet delegate, one meeting to make the Americans see that every- thing we talk about is linked to ev- erything else? Or is Kampelman pulling a fast one on the other two guys, John Tower and Maynard Glitman, who are supposed to be the nuclear negotiators? The Soviets, with their awe of high-tech gadgetry, would never guess why Kampelman was given the wrong draft to read. It was a problem with a word processor, said an American source: “Just before Kampelman was sup- Not only the space and nuclear talks. But a big Geneva automobile show. And at the same time, a big U.N. conference on famine in Africa. What’s it like covering big-time diplomacy? In these early stages, at least, it’s a little like standing outside a football stadium and trying to de- scribe what’s going on inside. Or trying to write about a closed grand jury meeting. For talks that mean so much to so many, the two sides have chosen _meeting rooms that have all the Old World charm of a conference room in an American airport motel. The American delegation’s meeting room is about the size of a school classroom and is decorated by LeRoy Neiman serigraphs of ten- posed to go on, the Wang ate his statement.” For'a negotiation that is going to concentrate on space weapons, it seemed only fitting that the opening scenes last weekend took place at Satellite 40. Satellite 40 is the VIP. arrival hall of the Geneva international airport. It is where blue-and-silver Air Force Boeings delivered 92 Ameri- can negotiators and where, one day later, a single Soviet Tupelov-154 eroened off Karpov and his team of about 80 Soviets. It is where Vice President George Bush arrived from Africa and where he left for Moscow. It is where 10 senators showed up in an Air Force Boeing, talked into a mi- crophone, and left for the Hilton. It is where a similar-sized, equally jet- nis, football and hockey games. On one wall is a large photograph of a- mountain scene. The only meeting room report- ers have seen at the Soviet mission was an antechamber. On the wall was an abstract painting, much re- moved from traditional socialist re- alism art. Who is meeting whom? That, so far, has been a big question. The networks try to answer it by ‘‘stakeouts.’’ That means they station crews outside the Soviet mission, the American mission and the Botanic Building, where the American arms delegation has its headquarters. When someone comes out, they shoot. But the trouble is that there are several entrances. And nobody in the Western press corps knows more than a handful of the Russians by sight. ; Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 17, 1985 \f"

Tronically, the vaccine was available at a U.N. aid office in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, 250 miles away. But local health authorities, be- wildered by the sudden appearance of 32,000 hungry countrymen on their doorsteps, didn’t ask, Khartoum for extra vaccine. Regional adminis- trators were finding it hard enough to scrounge up grain for bread as well as water and a few blankets. “The vaccine would have cost about $220,” said John Zins, a for- ‘mer Peace Corps volunteer from Cincinnati who runs the one-room UN. Children’s Fund office here. “Tt would have saved at least 200 lives,” The camp, with its inhabitants. living in burlap lean-tos and sharing seven latrines, has become a fester- ing political and medical dilemma. On the one hand, President Gaa- far rey and his regional gover: nors are determined to move dis- placed farmers back to their villages to resume crop raising. On the other hand, there is a risk of broadcasting measles to a much wider population by dispers- ing the camp dwellers, The issue must be settled soon, If the farmers are going to plant this year, they must be home by June, the normal onset of the three- month rainy season, which scarcely materialized last year, To help keep Sudanese peasant farmers from clustering around the cities, the U.S. government — Ni- meiry’s major outside backer — has organized an emergency aid pro- gram costing up to $200 million this year. The United States is already de- livering surplus sorghum ah to refugee camps and to more than 700 remote Sudanese villages, Measles already has taken hun- dreds of lives among Ethiopian ref- ugees in U.N.-organized camps in eastern Sudan, a U.N. official in Khartoum said, Doctors have concluded that the El Obeid measles outbreak originat- ed with some children who were moved into the camp in January af- ter they had lived in similar make- shift camps across the Nile from Khartoum. Those camps, within an hour's walk of Nimeiry’s palace, held about 50,000 Sudanese displaced farmers until military trucks took most of them away to their villages or other camps in January. la Slane 0) peat fee as peasant farmers converged on the regional capital, which has a normal population of 147,000. In December, authorities recognized it as an official camp’ and started a vaccination program. But the vaccine ran out near the end of the month. A correspondent visiting the camp Tuesday found dozens of men, women and children lined up stoi- cally in the 105-degree sun waiting to see one of the three camp doc- tors. Osman Abdu, one of those doc- tors, said the camp medical staff has had to cut back on medications to save a tiny supply of antibiotics for the most critically ill, “We don’t have any vitamins now,” he said, “We are running short of oral antibiotics, We only have enough to treat about 250 peo- ple. We could use it all up in one day.” By Abdu’s estimate, more than half of the 6,000 children in the camp have caught measles since January. ) Since the first measles cases, at least 269 deaths have been regis- tered in camp records, A sampling in February found roughly three: quarters of the deaths traceable to measles and dehydration from diar- rhea, a common measles after-ef- fect, Medicines cannot cure the mea- sles. But doctors use oral antibiotics and vitamins to fight off measles complications that can devastate children already dehydrated or mal- nourished, ) Although authorities now have obtained more measles vaccine, camp doctors believe it is best to let the outbreak run its course in the camp without resuming vaccina- tions. Zins, the local U.N. official, ex- plained that shots could not head off the disease among children already exposed to the germs. Continuing the vaccinations would have meant children getting measles after get- ting shots, And that, said Zins, could have undercut public acceptance of all vaccinations throughout Sudan, When Vice President George Bush toured Sudan three weeks ago, he and his press entourage were told by Sudanese regional officials that the El Obeid camp probably would close in a few weeks so resi- dents could go home, The Bush party spent half an hour at the camp after local work crews devoted a day to bulldozing - from parts of his motorcade route, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 24, 1985 \f"

His herd of 40 longhorns starved to death last year. He is out of fnoney, As of 10 days ago, he had nough kernels of grain to make bread for his family for two days.

Broad expanses of grazing lands ‘would be declared off limits, to sserve as a national strategic pasture weserve. : And instead of dickering with tindividual cattle brokers, herders ‘would sell their steers to a govern- ement marketing agency. $ Government spokesmen say this tis merely a means of assuring herd- ‘ers highéP prices. Skeptics say it is way to colject more taxes. | The policy outlines emerged searly this month at a “national de- ‘bate” on livestock raising at Ta- oua, Niger, a regional capital and vestock market. Although Sallah not heard about it, the meeting as going on about 25 miles north ,his vegetable garden. _ It was an invitation-only meet- 250 government officials, erdérs and international agency ‘observers, with the declared aim of reaching a national consensus on the future of herding. Niger, a country three times the size of California, is already two- thirds desert. Except for a Connecti- cut-sized green belt hugging the southern border, the rest of the country is becoming more and more barren Within 60 years, the population has grown from 1 million to 6 mil- lion. And uncounted billions of tons of topsoil have eroded away after the original tree and grass cover was burned off by farmers, shaved by firewood cutters, gnawed by goats or trampled by cattle. The government says now it is acting for the nomads’ own good — and for the good of the fast-eroding land. As a spokesman from the: re- gional government of Dosso made clear, the government is convinced that the nomadic herders bear heavy responsibility for accelerating soil erosion. ins “The perpetual movements of herders in the search for water and pasture for their animals are a seri- ous handicap for land manage- ment,” the Dosso official said. “The abusive cutting of wood and the overexploitation of pasture are causes leading toward the total destruction of our ecosystem.” A government herding counsel- or, Issa Ben Djima, said a “progres- sive sedentarization” of the nomads is the solution not only to save the pasture lands from becoming de- serts but also to save nomads from the pain of losing their flocks. “For the herder, the animal does not only constitute a sign of richness but also an intimate and faithful companion,” He said. “It is ishing to see a_herds- man completely bereaved by the sudden death of his cow or camel just as if he had lost.a member of his family.” i Bitterly resisting change ‘ THe debate, partly funded by $50,000 grant from thé U.S. Agency for International Development, was closed to foreign journalists, who were only allowed to read selected speeches presenting the government view. But a surprisingly candid ac- count in the government-controlled newspaper “Le Sahel” left no doubt about the bitterness among some Tuareg and other nomadic leaders invited by the government to partic- ipate, One unidentified herder was quoted as blaming government poli- cles for much of their misfortunes, saying, “They wish to kill us.” Of all the Africans, the saber- wielding, camel-riding Tuaregs — now numbering about 600,000 in Ni- ger — have so far resisted outside forces as stubbornly as anyone. Believing in a mixture of Islam _ and magic, Tuareg men — but not women — often wear veils over their lower faces. Sometimes tribes- men are called “the blue men” be- cause blue dye from the veils and clothes of Tuareg nobles transfers to their skin. For most of the last 400 years, they and the rival Fulani tribe of nomads dominated the sedentary farmers in the south. The farming Djerma and Hausa tribes not only make up three-fourths of Niger's population but also dominate the government. Descendants of the North Afri- can Berbers, the Tuaregs have his- torically supported themselves by raiding farming villages, operating long-distance trade by camel cara- vans and collecting protection mon- ey from travellers.

By her count, about 30 children have died of starvation in Bouza since the start of 1985. Others have died of measles and diarrhea. A few months ago, Ms. Daly got a small shipment of 100-calorie pro- tein tablets from the French Red Cross. ‘‘In three weeks, I started seeing a real difference among the kids coming into the center,’ she said. But when the pills ran out, no body sent more. Bouza, a town of about 5,000, is is the equivalent of a county seat. It is surrounded by hardscrabble farm- land that can still- yield a decent crop of millet in a year when the summer rains yield the expected 14 inches of rainfall. Last year, the rains failed and there was almost no crop. Villagers began selling off their few goats and cows to buy grain for bread. When the goats and the grain ran out, they ate their seeds. When the seeds run out, they began eating the chaff they had separated from their grain. Whenever the chaff runs out, they have nothing — except the hope that Niger’s government will reach them with distributions of do- nated American and European grain. This can prove to be a long wait. Niger now is only foreign food do- nations, which have to clear the clogged ports of Nigeria, then travel overland to Niger by truck. Even when the grain arrives and is turned over to Niger army units for local distribution, there are delays. - Western diplomats say the US. foreign aid program has donated $2 million to Niger to pay for gasoline for local distributions. So far, this gasoline money has scarcely been touched, according to the diplomats. In the regional capital of ' Ta- houa, 60 miles north of Bouza, I saw a stack of grain sacks as large as a circus tent waiting for distribu- tion. The ranking regional official in Tahoua, Maj. Tanja Mamadou, told me, ‘“‘We do not have serious hunger here.” To illustrate how well food dis- tributions were working in his re- gion, he arranged for me to drive 25 miles to the town of Illela, where he said army trucks would be giving out food later that day.

But about a dozen are Moslem children who manage to pass across the Green Line, with its gauntlet of op- posing gunmen, each day to learn a trade.

It is about half a mile from the Christian-Moslem Green Line, that divides Beirut into warring sections. Most of her 200 pupils are Christians from east Beirut. But about a dozen are Moslem children who manage to pass across the Green Line, with its gauntlet of op- posing gunmen, each day to learn a trade. Besides teaching permanent waves, hems and typing, Mrs. Ba- chour tries to instill the virtues of showing up for work punctually — even when shells are exploding in the neighborhood. “I tell them we are not living in Switzerland,”’’ she said. ‘“‘We have to get used to the situation and do the best we can.” Beirut schools close for heavy shelling just as American schools close for snow.

        "ocr_text": " Violence drives wedge between South Africa’s two worlds ZIMBABWE J “ MOZAMBIG Sy Joseph Albright Cox News Service : PRETORIA, South Africa — Lu- cas and Nico are among this coun- try’s bright young men who have been driven apart by a year of fes- tering violence. A year ago this country seemed to be moving toward a time when an articulate black like Lucas might have found himself across a local council table from a white govern- ment planner like Nico. That was before the country’s black townships plunged into a tail- spin of arson, police shootings, in- timidation and murder that has cost “nearly 500 black lives — and left much of the outside world up in arms against the white South Afri- can regime. Lucas Matukula (not his real -last mame) is a 27-year-old black factory worker at a white-owned company that makes safety glass. He moonlights as a revolution- ary organizer in his black slum township of Kwathema, 35 miles south of Pretoria. : ‘Violence, to Matukula, appears “as the best way to cause the white ‘government in Pretoria to bend. “\"\" **We are not happy to kill, but it ‘is all we can do,” he told a reporter in Kwathema on Tuesday. Nico DuBois, a 26-year-old white Afrikaner who works in a ministry in Pretoria with a comput- er on his desk, said Thursday that the cycle of violence has left him “sad”’ and “‘frustrated.”’ Reforms that are ‘‘already in the pipeline” could mean a “quan- tum leap for the better for blacks,” he maintained. But even in the best of times, he said, it would take ‘418 months to ‘two years’ before most blacks in the townships really notice new po- litical and economic gains. In recent months, repeated epi- _sodes of violence have only served to stiffen white political resistance to granting blacks any reforms, he maintained. “It’s not a nice thing to have a state of emergency,” he said, refer- ring to the new sweeping police rules ordered on June 20 by Presi- dent P.W. Botha. ‘“‘But for reform it is necessary. You cannot have re- form while the townships are burn- in, ae . = DuBois, who holds a master’s degree in political science from Stellenbosch University — the alma mater of much of the white political elite — views himself as a progres- .Sive by South African standards. ‘ = SE I was an American, I would probably be a liberal Democrat pushing the black cause all the y,”” he said. AFRICA REPUBLIC OF G2 SOUTH AFRICA Uitenhage e Although he makes his living planning black community reforms, he says he has not visited any of the black ghettos called townships, which serve as dormitory suburbs for about 4 million black workers who have state permission to live in urban townships and work in the ur- ban economy. “‘What I know of black people is what I read,’’ DuBois said. To ex- plain why he has had little personal knowledge of black living condi- tions, he said he grew up near Cape Town, where there are many more “‘colored” (mixed-race) townships. “I regard the colored as family,” he said. If the yearlong drumbeat of vio- lent incidents in South African black townships has saddened DuBois, it has hit Matukula closer to home. Three weeks ago, four other young blacks from Kwathema were found dead with their right hands blown off. - Although official confirmation is lacking, township residents say the four were killed while pulling the safety pins from hand grenades sup- plied by a police undercover agent — grenades doctored to explode the instant the safety pin was with- drawn. : Their funeral early this month was followed by a night of clashes in Kwathema between residents and police that left about 15 people, in- cluding one of Matukula’s relatives, dead. By now, Matukula is all for ven- geance killings of police informers — something that has not only up- set South African whites but also shocked the sensibilities of a world- wide TV audience. “There are a lot of informers JIMMY HOLDER/Staft among us,’”’ he said. ‘‘We want to show the outside world that we are determined to get rid of them. We don’t want people to come among us and sell out our leaders. We have to make them (the informers) feel the pain that we are feeling.” - He has also helped to organize Atlanta Journal- Constitution July 28, 1985 \f mass “funeral day’’ observances, which mean that workers stay home in order to put pressure on employ- ers. '“We don’t call them ‘stay-at- homes,’” said Matukula. “We call them funeral days. ‘Stay-at-homes’ are illegal.” Matukula said the current “ene- my Noa. 1” among his acquaintances in Kwathema is one of the town- ship’s black policemen. Matukula said the policeman, _whom he called officer Sam Sithole, “has already killed a bunch of us and has bragged that he wants to kill some more.” / To Matukula’s disappointment, Sithole has been transferred to an- other assignment outside Kwath- ema. Matukula says “everyone” in the township has lost faith in Kwathe- ma’s black mayor and councilmen. “All these people are just looking after their own interests,”’ he said. “They cannot lead people who have rejected them.” When asked whom he did trust, Matukula conspicuously did not mame Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu, who has been appealing to blacks to avoid violence. “Nelson Mandela, he is the one real leader of the people,” said Ma- tukula, referring to the long-impris- oned leader of the underground Af- rican Navocal Congress. Violence drives wedge between South tragedy that reform planners like DuBois had been counting heavily on the same black local officials who have become the enemies of articulate blacks like Matukula. DuBois says that in retrospect, white administrators made a mis- take in. giving the black local councilmen more authority and more financial backing two years ‘Oo. Z ~ Under . a 1982 act of the South African Parliament, the 38 most “advanced” black townships in the country have been allowed to elect their own black councilmen. Anoth- er 119 black communities have black councils appointed by white officials. Because Pretoria did not give the black governments much _ bud- getary assistance, said DuBois, the new black governments had to raise fents and bus fares. Some also claimed what black constituents felt were excessive salaries and perks.

It was not one of the battlefields in the t Zulu war of 1878-79, in which the British army crushed King Cetshwayo, the last indepen- dent Zulu ruler. - During the 1976 riots in Soweto township near Johannesburg, Gasa tried to organize anti-apartheid demonstrations here. Sabelo, who by then was no Atlanta Journal-Constitution August 18, 1985 (Continued) longer close to Gasa, helped police suppress them. He says he is against apartheid, too, but believes “we must solve this problem with the central government ... not with force.”’ Sabelo, a restaurant owner, is the local leader of Inkatha, the 10- up of 90 blocks of land spread over Natal Province. Several residents said in rate interviews that it is impossible to find a job with the sprawling KwaZulu government unless you join Inkatha and wear a Buthelezi lapel button. Sabelo, as an Inkatha founding member, sits in the KwaZulu “par- liament.”” He is also on the Inkatha central committee, but his real -power comes because Zulus in Um- lazi recognize him as the only man who can mobilize the warriors. Gasa, Sabelo veered apart Gasa and Sabelo veered apart after the South African government set up one of its local black com- munity councils here in 1972. Sabelo chose to join the political establishment by running for coun- cilman. Gasa, who by then had moved out of Tintown and me a successful builder, didn’t. When Inkatha started in 1975, Sabelo joined. Gasa — who is a Xhosa, not a Zulu — did not. Gasa says that after one of his attempts to organize an anti-apart- heid protest in 1976, Sabelo came to his house and warned that if he didn’t join Inkatha, there would be “a problem.” That very night, according to Gasa, the police arrested him. He spent the next two years in jail and was then placed oner a banning or- der amounting to house arrest. Gasa was released from banning within the last year. He kept a low file until after Aug. 1, the day lack activist lawyer Victoria Mxenge was found murdered out- side her Umilazi home. ' Gaza and others began organiz- ing a memorial week that included persuading students to stay out of schools. The local high point was to be a memorial service at the cine- rma. The incident that tri the violence in Umlazi was a move by Sabelo’s Zulu warriors, apparently aided by police, to break up the me- morial service. Gasa was inside the theater along with at least 1,000 other ‘ mourners when a police tear -gas canister went off. As choking partic- ipants fled, Sabela’s warriors rushed in to scatter the crowd, cutti ple with spears and knives: did not interfere. Sabelo, interviewed later at the township office, said it was his duty to break up the gathering before people inside could carry out their “plan to burn down everything in Umlazi.” et “Their whole idea was to twist the arm of the president (Pieter Bo tha) to declare a state of emergen- oe ee in Natal Province,’’ Sabelo Earlier, small-scale looting In the two previous days, there had been small-scale looting, and a few houses were firebombed. At the same time, Sabelo said, ‘‘we ob- tained reliable information that they Planned to use the memorial as a pretext to destroy everything.”’ At midday on Aug. 7, Sabelo personally mobilized his Zulu war- rior reserves. He did it by. sending loyal Inkatha men door to door, spreading the customary alert mes- sage that “‘our house is on fire.’ Sabelo says he had deployed five ‘‘regiments,”” numbering 5,000 to 6,000 warriors, with sticks, shields and spears by the time the memorial service started. He said Inkatha sent several “spies”” inside the big brick movie theater to listen to the speeches. One spy. he said, walked out of the cinema and passed on a report that some unidentified speaker — not Gasa — had called on the audi- ence to burn and loot after the. ser- vice. 84 “We could see that they were at war with us,’’ said Sabelo. ‘‘We could not wait.

Every day black leadership passes more and more to the young and desperate. Every other day white leadership backtracks and blusters. All the while and pet- rol bombs chip away the margin for com oe events race ahead unchecked, the Rhodesian civil war will look _like a sideshow. Rhodesia bled on - for eight years at a cost of 30,000 , lives before the blacks finally achieved majority rule in 1980 en tion. ‘ About the only thing most black and white South Africans seem to share these days is cast-iron stub- bornness. : At a funeral in Da town- .

Most of them be- lieve they are to die. Not that they have a th wish. But they are just saying, ‘If that is how we are going to get our freedom, then that is how we are going to get our freedom.’ ” A good many whites, including President Pieter Botha, would like to “modernize” apartheid by elimi- nating its most embarrassingly bla- tant symbols of discrimination. But it is hard to find a single white South African who wants to give blacks the only thing that ap- en could calm the black mul- itudes — a political system in which the majority could rule. For every relatively enlighted white ‘‘modernizer,’’ one meets a hard-line racist like the white taxi driver who said that Botha’s policies are “too soft.”’ secoseg Discs in black-only ps, taxi driver said, is a form of self- for the white community. “If there is a revolu- tion,” he said, “we could kill them all in two hours if we had to be- cause they are still living in these isolated locations.” Coming election is crucial The next six weeks will be criti- cal in whether the wiiite electorate The signs for which whites are waiting are five off-year elections Oct. 30 for seats now held by Botha’s National Party in the white chamber of rene: Right-wing splinter parties are hoping to win at least two of the seats. If they succeed, local com- mentators are sure to trumpet this as a rejection of Botha’s perfor- ae Andries Treurnicht, the Conserv- ative Party leader, was propenly right when he said that if Botha’s py lost badly in the by-elections, would be forced to “reconsid- er” his tentative moves toward black political participation. Even if Botha’s party wins in a landslide, this won’t mean the whites are endorsing any U-turn from apartheid. Yet nothing short of a U-turn will discourage blacks from throwing rocks at po espe- cially now that they know they have captured the world’s attention. On Wednesday, Botha took his boldest “reformist” step so far by announcing that South African citi- zenship would be restored to blacks who were involuntarily assigned cit- izenship in black homelands in the 1970s. If he had done this a year ago, most blacks would have seen it as a dramatic concession. But because Botha delayed and dithered, com- mon citizenship will be too small a bucket to fight the firestorm that has ignited in the meantime. At best from Botha’s viewpoint, common citizenship will lighten the pressure from local white business organizations to do something to stave off economic pressures from abroad. At worst, it will add horsepower to the argument that South Africa can be forced to end apartheid if foreign governments impose more ihe ints forms of economic sanc- ' tions. : Atlanta Journal- Constitution September 15, 1985 > \fBotha and the “moderates” in his Cabinet have now exhausted two of the three relatively painless con- cessions they envisioned a year ago — common citizenship and an end to laws against mixed marriages and interracial sex. ~The third — a loosening of the hated laws ~ is likely to go _ into effect sometime next year, un- less Botha’s party is badly beaten in the coming by-elections. Reform may spur violence Liberalizing the pass laws won't end the violence any more than the first two concessions. After nearly 700 blacks have died and several thousand others have been jailed, the survivors are much too embit- tered to settle for modifications in apartheid. Perversely, loosening the pass laws could even make black town- ships tenser in the short term by aggravating unemployment and housing shortages, The changes will stimulate a new inrush of unem- loyed blacks from rural home: ands. But blacks would still be barred under the Group Areas Act from living in white suburbs and from setting up businesses in all but a few districts in the white cities, Almost anything else Botha “might do unilaterally — better schools and better housing, for ex- ample — would cost the white tax- payers money they have not been nomic , With foreign sanctions and vestment campai willing to spend even in good eco- ~ times, SS rably into South Africa’s rate of a economic growth, the white taxpay- ers will be under more pressure in- stead of less in coming years. Botha will make a highly publi- cized effort to hunt for black lead- ers willing to negotiate about the tougher issues of how blacks and whites can share political power. As Botha undoubtedly knows in advance, his search will fail.

Bo- tha doesn’t want to free Mandela because Mandela can’t be con- trolled.

But age is overtaking the ANC leaders who ran the group as a legal civil rights organization before the government banned it in 1960.

        "ocr_text": "Arms cuts possible at Geneva CANALYSIS “By Joseph Albright Cox News Service - MOSCOW — Despite all the grumping and ‘poor-mouthing in the last week, Mikhail Gorba- chev and Ronald Reagan may be within talking distance of an agreement in principle for deep slashes in nuclear weapons at their summit meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. Ostensibly their negotiators are getting no- where, But a close look at Soviet and American public statements suggests that the two sides have glided closer to each other than they ad- vertise, -' Soviet pronouncements give no hint that Gorbachev is inclined to yield another inch. In keeping with this tough-talking approach, one Soviet foreign ministry official said Wednesday that the Soviets will have no choice but: to build more and more nuclear rockets if President Reagan's Star Wars missile shield, or Strategic Defense Initiative, begins to take shape. _ “We will bake them like pancakes,” the offi- cial said. What makes the prospects for the summit a bit more appetizing is that both sides really do agree that everyone would be safer from a first Strike if their swollen strategic nuclear arsenals could be chopped in half, Beyond a consensus that “deep cuts” are a good idea, the two sides remain divided on what kinds of offen to be counted ally charged differences on anti-ballistic missile defenses, Nothing can be agreed upon unless both \"ys.

Reagan, in his recent interview with four ‘ cu in SDI's future that was so limited that the Soviets Soviet correspondents, offered a description of would love to have the Americans carve it in stone in the final Geneva communique. Reagan said, for instance, that “we are go ° ing to stay within the strict definition” ‘of the ! 1972 ABM treaty, He even referred directly to its Article 5, which bans the future deployment of “space-based” ABM systems, Reagan’ also told the Soviet journalists that future American ABM tests would be conducted under the terms | of the ABM treaty, as the Soviets have been de manding, The Soviets, meanwhile, have been whittling down the kinds of SDI research that they claim the ABM treaty forbids, Defining ‘strategic’ forces | Last month the Soviets insisted that the . United States must refrain from testing ups, test models, assemblies and components of “space-strike” weapons. A few days ago, a new definitive article by Defense Minister Sergei So- kolov omitted “assemblies and components” from the list of objects that couldn’t be tested. Two weeks earlier, Deputy Defense Minister Sergei Akhromeyev made clear that the Soviets weren't trying to ban all research that could lead to space-strike weapons: only visible mani. festations of the research outside of laboratories that could be photographed by space satellites. Last in the rhetorical crossfire about Star Wars is the fact that the Soviet Union is not challenging the U.S. right to develop one ABM complex using the kind of exotic lasers and su- percomputers that SDI envisions, ‘If Reagan and Gorbachev can somehow find suitable language on how to limit future ABM development, the rest of a nuclear deal could well fall into place, . The most important question would be what to include in the category of “strategic” nuclear weapons that should be subjected to “deep Gorbachev, in his October offer to slash strategic nuclear forces by 50 percent, intro. duced a seemingly insuperable obstacle by in- sisting that 1,149 American medium-range mis- siles and forward-based aircraft must be thrown in the “strategic” category, meaning that they would have to figure in the 50 percent cut. American spokesmen insisted this was unfair because Gorbachev omitted 2,000 Soviet medi. um-range missiles and planes from the weapons that would be subject to cutting. The Soviets have subsequently given no signs of budging from what the Americans call a lopsided definition. Even though the time is short for a Soviet counteroffer, it is worth re- calling that Soviet negotiators have receded from exactly the same definition of “strategic” twice before.

        "ocr_text": "Arms talks unaffected by Chernenko’s death By Joseph Albright Cox News Service GENEVA — In rapid-fire burst of decision-making Monday, the Soviet Politburo not only named a new Soviet leader but also decided to plunge immediately into new nu- clear arms talks with the United States. The speed with which it all was announced was an unmistakable clue that the decision had been made well in advance for the tran- sition to Mikhail Gorbachev, 54, as the new Soviet front man, In a symbol of how rapidly events are moving, two lines of American limousines will roll through Geneva’s streets at almost the same time today. The first will carry Vice Presi- dent George Bush to Geneva’s Cointrin Airport, where he is due to take off in Air Force Two to lead the U.S. delegation to Konstantin Chernenko’s funeral, Bush, who was attending a Unit- ed Nations conference on famine, was tapped by President Reagan Monday to attend his third funeral of a top Soviet leader in 28 months. At the precise moment Bush plans to be on the tarmac reading a somber departure statement, an- other American motorcade should be tooling up the Avenue de Paix carrying three U.S. arms negotia- tors toward a rendezvous with So- viet negotiators at the Soviet mission. Given Chernenko’s progressive- ly weakening health, his death sur- prised no one. Indeed, a Bush aide said that the vice president went so far as to make at least one contin- gency plan for Moscow before leaving on his recent trip to Africa. “As he confessed to a couple of African leaders, he had packed his long underwear in anticipation,” the aide said. While Chernenko’s death was expected, there was palpable re- lief — especially among U.S. arms negotiators — that the Moscow transition did not throw off the carefully orchestrated opening of the negotiations on nuclear and space arms, long scheduled to be- gin today. As U.S. delegation spokesman Joseph Lehman put it: “I think the Soviet Union has shown a good de- gree of coherence in their dealings with us in this trying time.” Few Western experts were pre- dicting that Gorbachev's accession would have any direct effect on the arms talks, at least for now. Gorbachev wasted no time in let- ting the world know he is personal- ly committed to the coming arms talks, and especially to the Soviet goal of blocking American star wars anti-missile research. Within a few hours of his desig- nation, Tass, the official Soviet press agency, quoted him as de- claring: “We want an end to the arms race and not the creation of new arms systems, either in space or on Earth.” When Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev died in November 1982, a Soviet arms delegation was in Madrid negotiating on steps to in- crease security in Europe. On that occasion, the talks were suspended for several days so that delegation chairman Leonid TIli- chev could fly to Moscow for the funeral. A Soviet journalist explained Monday that protocol does not re- quire that any of the approxi- mately 80 members of the Soviet arms delegation attend Chernen- ko’s funeral. .. “They are not members of the Central Committee,” the journalist noted. By contrast, Ilichev, who was a deputy foreign minister, was a Central Committee member. Black-draped flags are aligned on the Central Telegraph building Gorky Street in Moscow in memory of Konstantin Chernenko. \f"

The castle owner, Baron Adolf Sigismund von Holzschuher, 51, confirmed Wednesday that he is one of Hitler’s numerous godchildren. Somewhat indignant about being publi- cized, the baron pointed out that the West German government has leased the castle from him since 1973 for use as a guest house. “Hitler was never in Gymnich Castle,” the baron said. ‘I myself was no Nazi. As far as this place is concerned, really, it would not be embarrassing to the President of the United States.” He said his parents named him Adolf in 1934 out of their regard for Hitler, who had come to power one year earlier. A West German foreign ministry spokes- man said other guests before President Rea- gan have included Queen Elizabeth of Britain, the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezh- nev, and King Hussein of Jordan. The White House, striving to minimize bad publicity over Mr. Reagan’s trip to the Bit- burg war cemetery Sunday, quickly sought to distance the President from the baron. “The President is not personally familiar with the owner or the owner’s family con- nections,” said Mark Weinberg, assistant White House press secretary. Mr. Reagan stayed at Gymnich once be- fore, in 1982, during a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Bonn.

At right, President show outside Lisbon, P Reagan and wife, Nancy, are entertained by a horse ‘ortugal, during one of the lighter mo- ments of the President's 10-day European tour. Reagan imprint left | Europe By Joseph Albright Cox News Service TRASBOURG, France — President Reagan was flying around the conti- nent last week like a lightning storm at midnight. He was an illuminating but not very subtle flash. Some Europeans found him mystifying and others inspiring, Some were terrified and others puzzled. About the only reaction Mr. Reagan did not generate last week was boredom. Now that Thunderstorm Ronald has ridden the jetstream back to America, it is time to sort things out from the Euro- pean perspective. What this voyage was really about, from its inception almost a year ago, was the future of West Germany. The last decade has seen a clash of two tendencies in West German politics. One is the postwar anti-Sovietism of the late Konrad Adenauer, and the other is Willy Brandt's quest for an independent, non-confrontational haven based on im- proved relations with Moscow. President Reagan started down the road to Bitburg because he wanted to en- courage the Adenauer strain in German politics over the Brandt strain. So far, at least, the President seems to have found the destination he was seeking. The clearest indicator came four days before Mr. Reagan's arrival, when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl thanked the President for not backing out of the Bitburg visit. Koh! called the move “the noble gesture of a friend.” Chancellor Kohl, who was elected in early 1983 for a five-year term, is an Adenauer for the ’80s in the White House view. Kohl was hurt last June when Mr, Rea- gan — at the insistence of French Presi- dent Francois Mitterrand — took part in a commemoration of the Normandy Beach landings from which the West Germans were excluded. Mr. Reagan has succeeded in making it up to Kohl. In the light of the visit, it became blindingly clear how much Mr. Reagan counts on Kohl in his larger geostrategic games, The real bedrock of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not 16 countries, Except in the unlikely event of a Soviet invasion, the United States has a hard time rounding up more than two full- time allies — Great Britain and West Germany. All the others find reasons to choose a la carte from the menu of NATO alliance policies, The Greeks, the Turks, the Nor- wegians, the Dutch, the Italians — all have reservations that Mr. Reagan finds constraining on nuclear matters, Kohl came through for President Rea- gan at the seven-nation Bonn summit by managing to persuade the others to in- sert a key paragraph in a communique that hailed as “positive” U.S. arms pro- posals at Geneva. Kohl also tried to deliver Mitterrand on a hotly contested issue of setting a date as Mr. Reagan wanted for interna- tlonal tariff-cutting talks, The issue on which the Presi- dent most needs Kohl's support is the star war strategic defense ini- tlative. Kohl is going along with the proposed research for the mo- ment, but he and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher man- aged to pin down Mr, Reagan to a commitment that he would not “go it alone” on deploying the missile defense system. Not since Jimmy Carter tumbled thé neutron bomb question in 1978 have the Europeans been so dis- turbed by a U.S. president's judg. ment on a nuclear issue, Mr, Reagan, during a toast at a state dinner in Bonn, was down- right lyrical about the stategic de- feage initiative. He called It a potential “technological path into thé bunshine, a way to diminish the threat of nuclear annihilation.” The French, on the other hand, see'the plan as a way to diminish France, Mitterrand, in a recent op- ¢ Interview, called the anti- e defense program “halfway What really scares him is that It — and its inevitable Soviet coun: terpart — will work. For if it does prove possible to put up even a moderately effective anti-missile safety net, the French independent nuclear force of more than 250 warheads will be obsolete. France not only opposes the star war plan, but it has come up with a competing space research project, called Eureka, by which it hopes to block other Europeans from suc: cumbing to the lure of American star war subcontracts. Mitterrand’s pique at President Reagan is probably among the rea- sons the French president did not show up in Strasbourg for Mr, Rea- gan’s speech to the European par- liament Wednesday. Mr. Reagan's pique at Francois Mitterrand is probably among the reasons the President never men- tioned Gen, Charles De Gaulle in his Strasbourg speech.

        "ocr_text": ") hostages discourage rescue try By Joseph Albright Cox News Service BEIRUT, Lebanon Five American hostages from hijacked TWA Flight 847 appeared at a cha- otic press conference Thursday and urged President Reagan to avoid “at all costs” any military at- tempt to rescue them. Hostage spokesman Allyn Con- well, 39, of Houston said he had personally seen 36 of his fellow American captives and that they appeared well. But he said the group is feeling the stress from the week-old ordeal. “We're all under a tremendous amount of strain and tension and concern,” he said. Conwell said the hostages he had seen are being held in secret loca- tions in and around Beirut. Three other hostages, the crew of the TWA Boeing 727, are being held in the plane at the airport. The five hostages, appearing be- fore a throng of reporters and pho- tographers in a transit lounge at Beirut Airport, were guarded by Amal Shiite militiamen carrying Russian-made AK-47 assault rifles and handguns. The events Thursday in Beirut came as the United States stepped up behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts to win release of the hostages. | “We are redoubling our diplo- matic efforts there in order to bring pressure to bear on those who might have influence,” White House spokesman Larry Speakes said in Washington.

News agencies reported that there was scuffling between armed militiamen and the press. But later the conference was allowed to re- sume, and Conwell read the names of the 37 passengers in custody. Conwell was joined at the con- ference by four other hostages: Ar- thur Toga, 33, of St. Louis; Vincente Garza, 53, of Laredo; Peter Hill, 57, of Hoffman Estates, l.; and Thom- as Cullins, 42, of Burlington, Vt. “The purpose of our agreeing to talk with you tonight is primarily involved with assuring our families and fellow countrymen and our loved ones and friends that we are all in good health, that we are be- ing cared for,” Conwell said. “We as a group do most impor- tantly beseech President Reagan and our fellow Americans to re- frain from any form of military or violent means as an attempt, no matter how noble or heroic, to se- cure our freedom,” he said. ‘That would only cause, in our estima- tion, additional unneeded and un- warranted deaths among innocent people.” Conwell said the hostages feel as if they are “pawns” in what is “a tense game of nerves.” Some of the hostages were un- According to some administra- shaven and appeared ill at ease. tion officials, the Benge adminis- They avoided sensitive questions tration has told friendly about the hijacking, which took governments that if the 40 Ameri-place last Friday just after Flight can hostages are freed uncondi-847 left Athens, Greece, for Rome. by the hijackers, Israel will follow with the release of the Before the press conference, detainees. 766 a Berri said the hijackers have But the administration has told agreed to a procedure for releas- diplomats that the United States !ng all the American hostages — will maintain its principle of not bargaining, or negotiating, or giv- ing in to terrorist demands.

By referring to “all” the hos- tages, Berri implied that this in- cluded roughly a_ half-dozen hostages who had been separated from the rest when hijackers culled those with Jewish-sounding names from the aircraft Saturday, several days before most of the hostages were taken into Beirut. In what has become his almost daily hijack briefing, Berri said he has received a message from Swiss foreign minister Pierre Aubert of- fering the Geneva airport, or some other Swiss airfield, as a meeting point where the American hos- tages could be swapped for the Shi- ites held in Israeli detention after the recently ended Israeli occupa- tion of southern Lebanon. A Swiss government spokesman in Berne confirmed that Switzer- land had offered its services to re- solve the hijack _ situation, according to the British Broadcast- ing Company. Berri said that the hijackers have agreed to a swap in Switzer- land and that he has relayed that to the Swiss government for relay to Washington. While Berri said the the hijack- ers’ acceptance of the Swiss air- port offer was ‘‘a good and positive step,” it seemed to be aimed most- ly at increasing pressure on the Reagan administration for conces- sions on the Israeli-held Shiite pris- oners through press coverage. In one worrisome note Tuesday, Retired Col. Akef Haidar, another leader of the “moderate” Shiite movement Amal, said explicitly that Amal has no direct control of the rival Shiite faction whose gun- men actually are guarding the hostages.

        "ocr_text": "16 are slain as riots rock South Africa By Joseph Albright Cox News Service JOHANNESBURG — Hospital authorities Thursday reported 16 more people slain overnight near the port city of Durban, raising to 20 the number killed in some of the worst rioting in 11 months of civil unrest, Combat troops were ordered into the black townships north and south of Durban, 400 miles south- east of Johannesburg, after police were unable to restore order. Crowds of blacks looted and burned scores of houses, grocery and liquor stores, schools, and go- vernment buildings in the town- ships outside Durban, One black professional in the township of Umlazi, reached by “telephone, said at dusk: “I can see them down the street breaking into the supermarket and the bottle store now. There are about 300 of them. They are running up and down taking away the beer and the food. There are no police in sight.” About 20 miles to the north, blacks also burned and looted the houses of Indians. Hundreds of In- dian families fled for their lives, and Indian men began arming themselves with guns and clubs to go back and protect their property. The Indian community appears to have become the target for the rioters largely out of the wide: spread unemployment among black youths and the feeling that Indians, many of them shopkeep- ers, are exploiting them. The bloodiest episode in the lat- est spate of rioting occurred late Wednesday in the black township of Umlazi, south of Durban. White Police used tear gas, guns, and spears to break up a memorial ser- vice for a murdered black civil rights lawyer, Virginia Mxenge. The memorial was sponsored by a black activist organization, the United Democratic Front. views, two young blacks who es- caped unharmed said that police used tear gas to clear out the 500 blacks attending an approved me- morial service in Umlazi Cinema, a large movie theater in Umlazi. Both witnesses said police wait- ing in armored cars opened fire and killed an unknown number of blacks as people fled out the exits, A police spokesman in Pretoria said he could not confirm the incident. Two nearby hospitals reported receiving 16 dead bodies, almost all victims of gunshot wounds, By nightfall, the two hospitals in the area reported having treated more than 400 people, nearly half of them for gunshot wounds. The authorities, meanwhile, an- nounced a tightening of a 20-day- old state of emergency. They said police had been empowered to im- pose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. in black townships around Port Elizabeth, In another development, high- ranking U.S. and South African of- ficials met in Vienna, Austria, to exchange views on the mounting unrest, E State Department spokesman Edward Djerejian declined to talk about the specific matters under discussion. However, the CBS Evening News said that the United States had told South Africa that unless further concessions are made to blacks, it will be difficult for the Reagan administration to defend its friendly policy toward the Pre- toria government.

        "ocr_text": " Hints o rerorm meet with denial by South Africa By Joseph Albright Cox News Service DURBAN, South Africa — The government, in a change of signals, moved Monday to deflate world expectations that President Pieter Botha is about to announce impor- tant steps to solve the racial crisis. “This whole fire is brought about by some people who want to create a revolution by raising expecta- tions,” said Jack Viviers, personal secretary to Botha. On Thursday, Botha is scheduled to make his first major speech since declaring a_ state of emergency. He has called a Cabinet meeting Wednesday to discuss contents of the speech. Interviewed by telephone from Pretoria, Viviers said leaks from Washington sources and specula- tive stories in South African news- Papers have combined to create expectations that Botha is unlikely to fulfill. Informed sources have said the speech is expected to deal in gen- eral terms with two of the touchi- est issues in South Africa — influx control and citizenship rights for blacks. 2 Both issues ultimately involve the extent to which the National Party, which has been in power since 1948, is willing to abandon its traditional insistence that blacks can only enjoy political rights in black-only homelands. Botha, in a speech to parliament Jan. 25, said for the first time that the government ‘“‘accepts the per- manence of large numbers of the black populations communities” living outside the homelands. Without filling in details, he said such communities ‘‘must be given political participation and a say at higher levels.” As a consequence, he said, “clar- ity must be reached soon on the question of citizenship.” There has been no report so far from a spe- Austin American-Statesman - August 13, 1985 cial Cabinet committee he appoint- ed to study black citizenship. Of the 25 million blacks, about two thirds are South African citi- zens, even though they have no na- tional voting rights. The remaining third of the blacks lost their citizenship in the 1970s when the government grant- ed independence to four tribal homelands within the border of South Africa. All blacks with roots in the four tribes, no matter where in South Africa they lived, were declared citizens of the landlocked entities of Transkei, Ciskei, Venda, and Bophutuswana. Eventually the government in- tended to confer independence on six other homelands, but tribal leaders have been resisting, in large part because their members prefer to retain South African citizenship. The influx control issue involves whether to relax laws dating back 50 years that restrict blacks from living in white cities unless whites need them as workers. Under current law, a black can- not remain for more than 72 hours near a city, even in a black town- ship, unless: ® He was born in an urban area and has lived there continuously. © He has worked in an urban area for the same employer for 10 years or has lived there legally for 15 years. © He is the spouse or unmar- ried child of a person who already has permission. © He is a contract laborer who is allowed to stay for a one-year pe- riod without a family. Meanwhile Monday, police and other sources reported 11 more black deaths. That brings the unof- ficial toll in a year of riots to 600 dead, and surpasses the violence that began in Soweto in 1976 as South Africa’s bloodiest black up- rising against white rule. \f"

On another floor of the $85 million Las Vegas-style gambling complex, weekend gamblers played slot machines for gold Kruggerands. Other merrymakers watched soft porn films in a nearby theater that runs 17 dif- ferent films a day, including Black Em- manuelle and Aphrodisia’s Diary. Like conservative Saudi princes who fly to London to get their kicks, tens of thou- sands of South African whites flock each weekend to this sex and gambling haven where South African morality laws are not in force. At least three-quarters of the roughly 50,000 Sun City visitors on a recent week- ‘end were white South Africans. The rest “Virginity is very, very important,” she said. “It is too important, because people get married too soon and they don’t know anything about sex or about people. And there is a lot of divorce.” As in Victorian England, the society seems to allow white males a ‘“‘boys will be boys” leeway to have extramarital sex. Massage parlors and escort services op- erate with only occasional police interference. If a man is caught at a brothel, he is sometimes compelled to give secret testi- mony against the prostitute, but his name is not published. Sex between white men and black wom- en is by no means unknown. From the pulpits of the Dutch Reformed Church, fundamentalist Afrikaner preach- ers regularly rail against sexual promiscu- ity, gambling, and pornography. According to police files, two years ago, members of a right-wing Afrikaner para- military group got so outraged about im- morality at Sun City that they made a plan to infect the place with syphilis germs. Playboy and Penthouse magazines are were South African Indians and blacks. All races are free to mingle with whites since the Sun City gambling resort is in the South African black ‘homeland’ of Bo- phuthatswana, a tribal reservation to which the government has granted limited independence. Hardly anyone looks nervous or furtive. The patrons are not a bunch of old men in overcoats. Many playing the slot machines are mid- dle-class couples who brought along their children to play video games in an arcade 50 steps from the soft porn theater. A spokesman for Sun City, Sabine Van Ommen, said the resort does not allow or- ganized prostitution. “What we are trying to market is free- dom,” she said. Race prejudice is not the only psychic puzzle that makes white South Africans difficult for the outside world to comprehend. Nearly as perplexing, and less often scrutinized, is the ambivalence among white South Africans toward sex. ‘ Victorian prudery is still a powerf(‘ in- not sold in “‘white’’ South Africa. And the national censorship board has just banned the importation of two more skin maga- zines, Sex and Fun and Gallery. Although girlie magazines are banned, the respectable daily newspapers here print many more stories having a sex an- gie than do daily newspapers in the United States. Johannesburg’s Sunday Times, one of the most widely read conservative news- papers, is symptomatic. The newspaper is partly a serious, sober newspaper and partly a National Enquirer. No Sunday Times would be complete without the “Girl of the Week,” a busty, bi- kini-clad beauty contestant who is spread in full color across a quarter of a page. A recent girl of the week was on the same page as stories from overseas news services on “‘Raunchy Rod’s boudoir in the sky,” “Teacher jailed for illegal sex,” and “Sexy carry-on no joke for holiday- makers.” Despite an unending flow of tease-ap- peal stories in newspapers, very little of substance is said or published about South African sexual atti : SOUTH AFRICA on os =a a. su pty Staff Map by Mary Coppinger fluence in South Africa. Possibly as a con- sequence, it is not hard to find evidence of sexual fascination. In traditional Afrikaner homes, “‘people just don’t talk about sex,” said a 33-year- old unmarried Afrikaner woman in Pretoria. Austin American-Statesman - August 24, 1985 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Revision within vision Geneva drama unfolds behind blinds By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cox News Service GENEVA — As Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko strode out of the American mission Tues- day night, an American typist inside was hurriedly knocking out a one-page statement that had been re- written yet another time. The paper was titled “Joint Soviet-U.S. State- ment.” It was supposed to be the meat of the Geneva meeting. But as the final afternoon's talks dragged on, the negotiators kept insisting on change after change in the text. A handful of reporters staked out in near-zero tem- peratures in an inner courtyard of the mission were treated to an unauthorized glimpse of this unfolding drama because of a security lapse. Despite the elaborate news blackout imposed on the meeting, U.S. security men made the mistake of ordering the reporters to stand just outside a first- floor office that was being used as Shultz’s typing and photocopying room. THE VENETIAN BLINDS on the inside of the win- dow were almost closed — but not quite. Through cracks, the reporters could see a secretary in a pink sweater typing three drafts of the state: ment within the last 90 minutes of the session. About 20 minutes before Gromyko left, a U.S. official in a vest handed the secretary what appeared to be a total redraft. There were corrections all over the page — most of them made by a red marker pen and some others by a black ballpoint. Even the title of the statement remained in conten- tion, or so it appeared through the blinds. In a draft typed by the secretary an hour earlier, the paper had been headed “Joint Soviet-U.S. Statement.” But now, 20 minutes before Gromyko’s departure, someone had changed it in pen to “Joint U.S.-Soviet Statement,” There were few, if any, changes scrawled on the first paragraph of the text. That was the easy one: It Dayton Daily News - January 9, 1985 simply recited that “as previously agreed,” Shultz and Gromyko met in Geneva on Jan. 7 and 8, THE REMAINING five paragraphs were covered with editing marks, These were the portions of the draft that described the subjects dicussed and what would happen next, Some scattered words in the middle paragraphs were Visible. The sense of that portion seemed to be that the two sides had discussed a wide range of issues, including space weaponry and nuclear arms. One quickly glimpsed phrase seemed to say that the two sides expressed divided opinions, The glimpse was faulty, it turned out, when the docu- ment was released a few hours later. What the phrase actually said was that the talks would be con- ducted by a delegation “divided” into three groups. Even the list of issues was evidently controversial. Red and black editing marks made the text unread- able through the blinds, When these Geneva talks were announced by Mos: cow and Washington last November, U.S. national security adviser Robert McFarlane said their objective was “reaching mutually acceptable agree- ments on the whole range of questions concerning nuclear and outer space arms,” Eventually, the completed statement outlining plans for resumed arms negotiations by the two superpowers was released to a waiting world and several bone-chilled newsmen were allowed to come in from the cold. \f"

Some others in the international community are gloomier. “You have a very high-risk group of a million to a million and a half chil- dren who are already severely under- nourished,” says Samir Basta, who di- rects the U.N. Children’s Fund office. “A child in severe malnutrition in a country like Sudan rarely survives. I am assuming 700,000 to one million sigan are not going to recover and tion like Ethiopia.... U.S. grain alone. He maintains that vitamins, dried skimmed milk and protein-rich beans as well as at least 400 new water wells are also vital. Arthur Holcombe, an American who is the chief United Nations representa- tive in Sudan, says, “This situation has explosive implications for the govern- ment itself. It is hard to imagine how this government could survive a situa- It is a tinderbox.” On Wednesday, a week after he spoke, the sparks apparently struck fire in central Khartoum, where crowds of placard-carrying youths were seen surging through the streets shouting anti-Nimeiry slogans. The demonstration, broken up by police tear gas amid reports that several demonstrators were shot, occurred just as Nimeiry was flying off for a visit to the United States. HOLCOMBE SAYS there already have been unpublicized ‘“demonstra- tions” for more bread in half a dozen cities and towns within the last two months. The government has quelled unrest so far by quickly diverting extra food to those cities, Holcombe says. “But there will come a point when there won't be any more food to di- vert,’ he says. “‘The pressure is building.” Sudan is not accustomed to the de- gree of longterm grinding malnutrition and disease found in Africa’s poorest precincts. The Sudanese per capita income, $380 a year in 1981, was five times that of the median Chadian. Dayton Daily News - LAST YEAR was different. Sudan © was wrung dry by a catastrophic crop failure when rain gauges in the major growing regions recorded their skimpiest rainfall of the 20th century. Drought had already ruined the har- vest two years in a row in western Sudan's semidesert peasant farming belt. Last summer things got more ominous when food crops failed not only in the west again but also in the mechanized farming heartland along the Blue Nile, On Nov. 19, the first ship carrying American emergency sorghum grain docked at Port Sudan on the Red Sea. The sorghum made it to some vil- lages through the sandy, roadless backcountry — but not others. In February, a nutrition survey team from the U.N. Children’s Fund and the British anti-hunger group Oxfam reached El Figira, a village of hungry cattle-herding Kababiesh nomads 250 miles west of Khartoum. TWELVE OF THE 39 children in El Figira had died in the previous nine days, the researchers found. “Others looked as if they would follow shortly,” says a U.N.-Oxfam internal report obtained by the Cox News Service. The United States has already sup- plied or pledged 1.8 billion pounds of food grains to Sudan since Nov. 1, in- cluding some donated and some sold under a longstanding easy-terms sales agreement. Witt's new request would raise the U.S. total this year to 3.2 billion pounds. That awesome quantity is million people with 1,600 calories a day for four and a half months — pro- vided it can move through the port and filter through a transportaton network of railroads and roads that varies from archaic to nonexistent. TO SPEED THE transportation, the U.S: aid mission has in effect bypassed the central government by contracting directly with a trucking company and has taken care to arrange direct deliv- eries to at least 700 villages. The government has no money to buy the necessary gasoline. So the U.S. supplying wheat, sorghum United States is supplying it, using its ‘ample local balances of Sudanese pounds that have been derived from past food sales. Witt says Congress would probably have to vote an extra $140 million to cover his emergency request since all previous appropriations have been tap- ped to fill earlier African emergency food requests. NIMEIRY HAS managed to stay in power for 16 years by keeping his po- litical opponents either off balance, in cushy jobs or in jail. For the last 18 months he has lurched in the direction of turning easy-going Sudan into a fundamental- ist Islamic state. But two weeks ago he pulled another surprise, jailing about 200 Moslem brothers, including some of his close advisors as alleged subversives. Should Nimeiry fall and be replaced by his radical enemies, the United States would lose its most important piece of Middle East turf since the Ma- rines abandoned Beirut Airport — per- haps since the shah was driven from the Peacock Throne in 1979.

Amal leader Nabih Berri freed 48- year-old Jimmy Dell Palmer of Little Rock, Ark., who has a heart condition. Palmer appeared with Berri at a news conference at Berri’s home and then was taken by Amal militiamen to the Beirut airport for a Middle East Airlines flight to Larnaca, Cyprus. Berri said he is also considering whether to free a second ailing hostage, Simon Grossmayer, 57, of Algonquin, Ill. “If he is not in good condition, I will release him today or tomorrow,” Berri said. In what could be a major break in the hostage crisis, Berri proposed that the remaining 39 hostages be transferred to an unspecified Western embassy in Beirut, or possibly Syria, if Amal re- ceives a promise they will not be re- leased until Israel frees its prisoners. Palmer, 48, wearing & red polo shirt, sat next to Berri at a hot, packed press conference in the basement of Berri’s apartment building. Minutes later, Palmer hustled out of the sand-bagged building by Amal gunmen, led through a mob of journalists and driven away in a white Mercedes 200. Dayton, Ohio, Wednesday Evening, June 26, 1985 Palmer, a heavy-set man who ap- peared to weigh about 250 pounds, said his blood pressure rose in the early days of the 13-day hostage crisis. But in the last several days, his blood pressure has dropped after he received medicine from the United States through the in- tervention of the Red Cross. The leader of Lebanon’s 14 million Shiites said all 39 of the hostages are now in West Beirut and were examined | by a Red Cross doctor at a single, undis- closed Beirut location after dark Tues- day night. Palmer confirmed this. k Berri, in a further bid to break the hostage deadlock, said he and the hi- jackers are now willing to transfer the remaining 39 Americans to a Western embassy in West Beirut - provided the embassy’s government would guaran- tee him the hostages would not leave Lebanon before the remaining 735 Leb- anese Shiites and others are freed from an Israeli prison. Berri mentioned the French or Swiss embassies here as possible quarters for the 39 hostages. But he said any West- ern embassy in Moslem West Beirut would be acceptable so long as that government would promise the hos- tages would stay until the Lebanese in Israel are released from Atleet Prison. “This (offer) is an example of good faith,” he said. Berri said that if the United States would prefer it, he and the hijackers are willing instead to transfer the 39 hostages to Syria for the duration of the “I am feeling real good now thatI am crisis going home,” said Palmer. On the political maelstrom in which he found himself in Beirut, Palmer said, “I am a typical American who knows gy about the problems of West Bei- . All I can say, I hope they get ae problems —_— out, be- He said he had not been in touch di- rectly with Syrian officials, but he said he understood that President Reagan and Syrian President Hafez Assad had exchanged several messages in recent days. “If they (the Americans) want to choose Tehran, no problem,” Berri said throwing out a@ suggestion that ete cause shivers in Washington. Tee move odkiy shel anes are ported to have joined efforts to secure | the hostages’ release. Syria is the main 0 ee Sanne Lane. Berri reiterated his warning that a flotilla of U.S. 6th fleet warships led by the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz must “be far away” from the Lebanese coast, and that there be no attacks on Leba- poe Magy | Israel or the United the situation is hostage In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department’s hijack task force declined to comment on Berri’s state- ments. ““We just have no response. We don’t want to characterize it at this point,” he said. Asked whether he has had recent telephone conversations with U.S. Am- bassador Reginald Bartholomew at the U.S. embassy in East Beirut, Berri re- plied, “Today I tried to call him and say that I have Mr. Palmer with me, and he was not in his office.” Berri, as expected, reacted sharply to Tuesday’s White House threat to force the closure of Beirut Airport as a means of putting pressure on the hijackers. Calling this interference with Leba- non’s sovereignty, Berri said he would insist on an American guarantee that there will be ‘no attack, no aggression against Lebanese territory” before the American hostages can be released. The release resulted from a visit by two Red Cross officials, one a doctor, to all 40 hostages, according to a Red Cross statement. The other hostages — “all sent messages home. Some were examined by the Red Cross,” Palmer said. Two Frenchmen kidnapped near the Beirut airport May 22 also will be freed once the hostage crisis is settied, Berri said. He said he had been approached Tuesday night by the kidnappers, who he did not identify. “They will put the two men in a situation exactly like the hostages,” Berri said, : Dayton Daily News 25¢ me amie are Michel Seurat, a scientific researcher for France's Cen- ter for Studies and Research of the Contemporary Middle East, and Jean- Paul Kaufmann, a writer for the Paris- based magazine, L’Evenement D Jeudi. Berri said the kidnappers of the Frenchmen told him they do not hold any of the other 10 Westerners - seven Americans, two Frenchmen and one Briton -who have been kidnapped since March 1984. Earlier today, Israel’s foreign minis- ter was quoted as saying his country would consider taking part in a U.S. blockade of Beirut to put pressure on the Shiites. Two Israeli gunboats were visible through binoculars, cruising op- posite Beirut’s Mediterranean coast at daybreak. Red Cross spokesman Pascal Gon- drand said in Geneva that the two Red Cross representatives had held private talks with all of the hostages. However, in keeping with Red Cross policy, information on the hostages’ conditions would not be made public, he said in Geneva, Switzerland. A re- port of the visit will be provided to U.S, authorities and to the families of the hostages, he said. The Red Cross representatives visit- ed the three crew members of a hi- jacked TWA jetliner on board the air- craft at the Beirut airport, where they are being held, he said. Gondrand said the team saw all the remaining hostages in one place, but refused to comment when asked whether the hostages were then dispersed The Shiite hijackers are demanding that Israel release 735 Lebanese prison- ers, including more than 500 Shiites, who Israel accused of either planning or carrying out attacks on the Israeli’ army in southern Lebanon.

Despite the vast audience Botha yielded nothing to South African editorialists, opposi- tion groups and business leaders who had counseled him to announce dramat- ic reforms Instead, he used his time to question whether that the media in South Africa is in league with revolutionaries, to suggest that Mandela was a commu: nist, and to insist that violence is being encouraged by “hostile pressure and agitation from abroad.” Although Botha repeated his govern- ment's willingness to see some unspeci- fied form of black political “participa- tion,” he insisted that he would not set ‘ atime limit for negotiating reforms, “Tam responsible for South Africa's future,” he said, \"I am not going to fall into that trap.\" | Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond Tutu said that blacks would reject any changes imposed without consultation with black leaders, “We are getting no direction in this country, really,” Tutu said shortly after the speech. “The government has lost direction and all we are asking from him (Botha) is ‘For goodness sake, try to indicate you do have a plan and the plan is dismantling apartheid and you havea timetable,’ ” In a chilling prediction eight hours before Botha’s speech, Mrs. Winnie Mandela, wife of the 67-year-old jailed African National Congress leader who Dayton Daily News August 16, 1985 has been jailed for 21 years, told West- ern journalists in Johannesburg: “He (Botha) must be aware that if he disappoints the black majority, he will simply plunge this country into the worst violence any country has ever seen.” Even as Mrs. Mandela was speaking, the government announced seven more deaths, bringing to 121 the number killed during the 20-day-old state of emergency. The latest victims in a nationwide surge of carnage included four blacks and one mixed-race youth killed by po- lice bullets; one black policeman stoned by a mob, and a “mixed-race” youth killed by a hand grenade tossed in his window. The most perplexing aspect of Botha’s speech is why he passed up his most important opportunity ever to sketch out for a worldwide audience reforms that he has already signaled to the South African parliament. One possibility suggested by a close reading of the speech is that Butha could not achieve a consensus within his Cabinet this week on what to propose. Botha said he wants to deal with ap- peals “from certain international as well as local quarters” that he release Mandela from his life prison sentence as a saboteur, but made clear that he Would not do so until Mandela pledged to foreswear violence as a condition for his release. Botha, in a move that will deepen White opposition to Mandela’s freedom, proceeded to read from a disputed doc- ument from his 1963-64 trial which conveyed the impression that he was a Communist. At his trial, Mandela acknowledged planning sabotage of telephone centers and other economic targets, but denied being a Communist. The Reagan Administration has also urged South Africa to consider freeing Mandela, but Botha said the South Afri- can public would not approve if he re- leased Mandela and later had to rear- rest him. Besides the release of Mandela, one of the most persistent demands of mod- erate black leaders like Bishop Des- mond Tutu has been for a “statement of intent” by Botha about the agenda for future power sharing negotiations. To this demand, Botha replied, “I am am not prepared to make it (a state- ment of intent). Not now and not to- morrow. | say it would be wrong to be prescriptive as to structures within Which participation will have to take place in the future.” One passage of the speech hinted at coming government moves to lessen the barriers against blacks starting businesses in black townships. Botha also said his government would devote $450 million over five years to black housing and would propose changes in the cumbersome pass laws restricting movement of blacks to cities, Sitting in the second row of the audi- ence was the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the American right wing fundamentalist Who just arrived on a visit. “| think he took a very couragious position,” Falwell said. “I think he is doing all he can do.” All National Party delegates inter- viewed approved of the speech. One delegate, stockbroker Richard Castle, said the speech would “remove uncer- tainty created by massive media coverage.” \f"

No need to wake the President. It was just a Soviet-made Antonov transport plane deliver- ing food donated by Libya for other Sudanese villagers. Their peaceable encounter on a private air- strip in Muglad, 500 miles southwest of the capital, was just another round in a global competition to see who can help Sudan the most. The Sudanese are so far coming out the win- ners. Six months after the downfall of Presi- dent Gaafar Nimeiry, Sudan is one of the rare corners of the world where international rival- ries are putting food in peoples’ mouths. Bidders for the friendship of Sudan's inexpe- rienced new leaders are not only Americans and Libyans but also Saudis, Romanians, West Germans, East Germans, Britons and Belgians.

But the ex- perts aren't talking about wide-scale famine. The worst fears have been dissipated by huge food donations and good weather. In the last two months Sudan's desiccated farm belt has been drenched by its first real rainy season in four years. This hasn't averted famine this year. But next year it will if this fall's crops live up to their promise. The main satistier of this year’s hunger has been the U.S. taxpayer.

Along with a food crisis, there was also a fuel crisis six months ago. People in Khartoum had to wait in lines for several days to buy gasoline.

The rain, food and gasoline and the loosen- ing of Nimeiry's brand of Islamic law have all contributed to something of a political honey- moon for the “transitional” military president, Gen. Abdul Rahman Swareddahab, and his cl- vilian cabinet. Gone is the feared State Security Organiza- tion, which functioned as Nimeiry's secret po- lice until it was disbanded after the April 6 coup. More important is the mushrooming of po- litical parties that had been suppressed during the Nimeiry years. Roughly 40 political par- ties, including communists, pro-lraqi Baath- ists, pro-Egyptians and pro-Libyans have popped up to compete in national elections that Swareddahab is promising by the first anni- versary of the coup.

And in a surprise development, the indict- ment also charged that a second gunman, a 25-year-old Turk still at large, fired one of the three shots that struck the pope. The second gunman, identified in the indict- ment as Oral Celik, 25, was a longtime friend of the convicted papal assailant, Mehmet Ali Agca. Celik allegedly fled the scene with Bul- garian help.

ANTONOV, under house arrest in Rome, has contended since his arrest by Italian anti- terrorist police in 1982 that he knows nothing about Agca. Claiming to be a plain airline man, Antonov has offered alibi witnesses, mostly Bulgarians, who have said he was in his office several miles from St. Peters Square at the moment the pope was shot.

        "ocr_text": " Geneva not awec by summit meeting By Joseph Albright Cox News Service GENEVA — Beneath the gold on- ion-shaped domes of the Russian Or- thodox church, a priest chanted a melodic prayer for peace in Russian, just as he does every Sunday. But Mikhailo Ivanovich, 47, one of the 150 prosperously dressed wor- shippers, didn’t think the prayer would make much of a dent on Ron- ald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. ‘Miracles only happen in there,” the Yugoslav told a reporter, nod- ding toward the church as the morn- ing service ended. Thanks in part to subsidies from the Geneva taxpayers, this little jew- el of a church, started for the benefit of vacationing Russian noblemen back in 1868, is going strong. Every week it attracts several hundred elderly Russian emigrees and their children and grandchildren. It also draws a mixture of other Or- thodox Christians from Yugoslavia, Greece and elsewhere. Geneva is many things to many people. Haven of choice for genera- tions of fortunate foreigners is one of them. A century ago, there were enough Russian aristocratic vacationers liv- ing in the old central city that people called it the Russian Quarter. They were affluent enough then to look on Geneva as a pleasant place to shop and hire governesses. Back around the turn of the centu- ry, four out of every ten people in Geneva were born abroad, according to a survey. Foreigners were so thick that na- tive Swiss complained that foreign- ers were not only meddling in poli- tics but also serving as prostitutes and begging on the streets. Failed revolutionaries from Ger- many, France and Italy loved its bars, coffee shops and its open door to political refugees. In 1903-4 and again in 1907-08, the aspiring Bol- Dayton Journal-Herald - November 18, 1985 shevik leader Vladimir Lenin lived in small apartments several miles from the Orthodox church. Since Lenin’s departure in 1908, Geneva has become richer, more staid and less hospitable to unem- ployed revolutionaries. Paradoxical- ly, it also has become more of a glob- al city. Henri Dunant, a Geneva do-good- er, stimulated the international trend back in 1864 when he started the In- ternational Red Cross here. Since it was one of the first inter- national organizations anywhere, the Red Cross set a pattern. After World War I, it seemed only natural for the great powers to situate the new League of Nations on the shores of Lake Geneva. : Today, some 20,000 of Geneva's 360,000 inhabitants are international civil servants — which mean they earn good money and don’t suffer from overwork at such specialized U.N. agencies as the International Labor Organization, the Conference on Trade and Development and the World Intellectual Property Organi- zation, which deals with copyrights. Gee-whiz is not the reaction one finds here about any foreign digni- taries, including Reagan and Gorba- chev. The city has taken in stride the visits of Pope John Paul II, Queen Elizabeth, the 1955 summit confer- ence between President Dwight Eji- senhower and Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev, as well as visits by least 100 presidents. Geneva is worrying a good deal more this time about a possible ter- rorist attack. Authorities said 1,450 Swiss po- licemen and 2,000 Swiss soldiers have been detailed to guard the American and Soviet visitors. At the Geneva airport the Swiss have deployed at least one M-113 Ar- mored Personnel Carrier to make sure no terrorists could burst onto a runway in a suicide truck. \f"

As demonstrators from the fa- natical Shiite faction Hezbollah, or Party of God, marched through the main airport gate, the seized Trans [ World Airlines 727, parked there since Sunday, was quickly moved away from the teeming crowd. The march came just hours after two unidentified warplanes swooped low over the airport, ap- parently on a reconnaissance mis- sion. Later, Israeli military sources in Tel Aviv denied that any Israeli planes had flown over the Leba- nese capital. One march leader, Sheikh Zu- hair Kenj, a Hezbollah backer, said the demonstration was designed to “support the beleaguered hijack- ers” — a rallying cry which nei- ther he nor anyone else explained. Yesterday's march route also passed within 50 yards of the site of the former U.S. Marine bar- racks which was shattered by a suicidal truck bomber 20 months ago. U.S. intelligence sources have said the killing of 240 servicemen was probably the work of young fanatics with close ties to Hezbol- lah. It is widely believed here that the TWA hijacking was also car- ried out by terrorists with ties to Hezbollah. “Long live Khomeini,” the marchers chanted, referring to the Iranian leader, as men beat their Demonstrator carries Ayatollah Khomeini poster chests in a centuries-old Shiite de- votional gesture. “America’s fleets will not frighten us,” they said. Hezbollah is one of three shad- owy Shiite extremist factions which have been contending for support in the Shiite slums of Mos- lem West Beirut against the more numerous militiamen of the main- stream Amal movement, led by Nabih Berri. The others are known as the Mujahidoun and the Jundal- lah. In what has become a daily fac- tional contest to stage the most eye-catching made-for-TV photo opportunities, yesterday's round went to the extremists. The main subject of a meeting with Berri and other Amal leaders, one participant said later, was not the 40 American hostages but rather the unrelated “war of the camps,” in which until last week Shiites battled Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps, between downtown Beirut and the international airport. Although there were no signs that the hijackers were ready to leave the commandeered TWA jet, there was evidence that they are becoming tired of their diet. Three TWA crewmen are believed to be remaining, as hostages, with the plane. Airport sources believe that the hostages are eating economy-class meals from the Middle East Air- lines kitchen at the airport, since meals and mineral water have been seen leaving the airport in a car driven by an Amal militiaman. For the second consecutive day, the hijackers still aboard the jet fired rifle shots above the heads of cameramen seeking to obtain fresh videotapes. A Lebanese journalist in the tower heard the controller radio the hijacker, using his preferred code-name of Abu Feras, to say: “This is the control tower. What were the shootings about?” The voice of Abu Feras replied by radio: “There are photogra- phers everywhere taking pictures of us. We will stop shooting when they stop taking pictures.” Security men at the airport herded journalists inside the termi- nal for several hours. But later they were allowed to return to within camera range. Although the hijackers have demonstrated a nearly insatiable desire for publicity, the one calling himself Abu Feras complained at one point on the radio that journal- ists had abused their precarious access to a crime still in progress. “We stopped shooting and gave them time to take pictures, and thev got ereedy.\" Feras complain.

Berri, interviewed in Arabic by Lebanese journalists. chose to stand up to Washington on an issue on which the Reagan admin- istration could easily afford to make a concession — how far off the Lebanese coast the U.S. Sixth Fleet is cruising. Berri told the Lebanese report- ers: “The advance of the Sixth Fleet toward our shores forces us to add one more condition — this time for the Amal movement — and that is the withdrawal of the Sixth Fleet from our coasts.” A flotilla led by the carrier Nimitz has cruised to within about 25 miles of Beirut Harbor, but as of last reports it had withdrawn to about 60 miles offshore. After a weekend with no direct contacts with the Rea adminis- tration, Berri disc that he had spoken yesterday by telephone with Reginald Bartholomew, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon who works and lives in Christian-con- trolled East Beirut. Berri said the ambassador told him the United States would not ressure Israel to release the tages. There was no way to pin down the extent to which the Amal y mediators are really speak- ng for Shiite gunslingers who seized the plane and now are guarding the hostages. ‘ It was the increasingly regular Amal briefing in one of Berri's several residences in West Beirut that the most tangible indication of what sort of agree- ment might eventually be possibile. fi press conference aimost The Complete weather, 2A A Cox Newspaper — Lebanon's Amal party, said in a briefing that “we” would consider releasing the U.S. hostages in exchange for an iron-clad guarantee that the detainees in Israel will be released on a fixed timetable.

After the burial, Tutu ap-: proached Nel in front of an ar- mored car to say, “Colonel Nel, in carrying out totally unreasonable . rules, you behaved in a wonderful . manner. God Bless You.” Nel, who could ha Tutu on the spot for having men- tioned apartheid in his funeral ora- tion, instead answered, “Pleasure ... Same to You Sir.” Evening TV newscasts did not mention Tutu’s appearance at the funeral in Daveyton, 30 miles east of Johannesburg, in which he openly defied last week’s Law and Order ministry order against min- isters discussing government poli- cies during funerals of unrest vic: ms. Calling apartheid the “one rea: son” the nation has suffered vio: lent incidents, Tutu used the fu: neral forum to appeal to the government to release “our lead: ers in jail and allow those in exile to return here” for negotiations with the government. Although Tutu has been editori- ally reviled in South Africa for re- marks last year pepe “the evil of apartheid” to evils in Hit: ler's Germany, Tutu chose to re- turn to that theme yesterday. “This country is not a commu: nist country,” he said. “It is in “And if we are told in this land what to preach, then who can doubt that when I said apartheid is as evil as communism and Nazism, that I was not speaking the truth?” Tutu was speaking at the funer- al of Elizabeth Khumalo, 16, one of four blacks shot dead in Davey- ton July 24 in a clash between mourners and soldiers. A police spokesman has said the demon- strators threw rocks but parents maintained the troops opened fire without pee after giving a crowd of mourners five seconds to disperse.

Some well-informed Afrikaaner editors say privately that Presi- dent P.W.

Such commentaries are fre- quently are used to forewarn the public of controversial moves the overnment is close to announc- ng. One recent instance was the government's state of emergency proclamation, which was fore- shadowed in a broadcast commen- tary more than 24 hours in ad- vance.

At 47, he is the Communist Par- ty first secretary of the Stavropol district, a territory the size of Indi- ana. Next to him is Stavropol's most important native son, Yuri Andro- pov. At 64, he heads the Soviet KGB security organization. The place is Mineralniye Vodi. It is a picture-book resort in the Cau- casus Mountains. People from all across the country come here to hike, take mud baths and dry out in alcoholism sanitoriums. Before long, a special train stops. Off steps Leonid Brezhnev. The 71-year-old, bushy-browed party boss has dominated Soviet politics for 12 years and he is still going strong. At his side is his longtime aide and traveling com- panion, Konstantin Chernenko, 66. Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko and Gorbachev — four men fated to control the Kremlin in the next seven years — exchange greetings on the platform. Later that night, the four meet in private. The next morning, Brezhnev and Chernenko reboard the train. It pulls out and heads south for Baku on the Caspian sea, 400 miles away... Alexander Rahr, a Gorbachev watcher at the U.S. government: backed Radio Liberty research center in Munich, Germany, makes a case that “the subsequent career of Gorbachev was decided” on the station platform that evening. Andropov was the first Politbu- ro member to spot Gorbachev as a comer. The two apparently met when Gorbachev came to greet Andropov during one of his regu- lar visits to the Mineralniye Vodi spas in the 1970s. Brezhnev must have liked his KGB chief's candidate. Two months later, Gorbachev was transferred to Moscow and made Soviet Central Committee secre- — charge of agriculture. was now one of the roughly 10 secretariat members, with a job nearly equivalent to a senior White House staffer. Back in 1953 when Nikita Khru- shchev took over party leadership, analysts called him an appara- tchik, It meant that he rose to the top solely as a creature of the par- ty apparatus. Gorbachev has followed the same route. He did it by convine- ing @ succession of older men that he had talent. Gorbachev's first patron was an unheralded party operative at a machine tractor station near his village. On this man’s say-so, the local party chose Gorbachev, a 19-year-old assistant combine op- erator from a peasant family, to go to study law at Moscow Universi- ty in 1950. Gorbachev's law studies came second to his extracurricular job as the Komsomol (Communist youth league) agitation and propa- ganda organizer for the law school. He was allowed to become 4 full Communist Party member at the early age of 2]. He met his wife Raisa, now 52 and a teacher of communist philos- ophy at Moscow University, while , were students. They have one child, a daughter Irina in her late 20s, and a grandaughter, Oksana, 5 After graduating in 1955, he re- turned to Stavropol and gave up law. He spent the next 23 years climbing the local party rungs. After 14 years of zigs and zags in the local party hierarchy, he en- joyed a breakout at 39; He was snp to Stavropol regional irst secretary. A distant power struggle gave him his opening. His predecessor had been a Khrushchev man whom the new Brezhnev team in Moscow wanted to ditch. One year later, in 1971, Brezh- nev brought Gorbachev and scores of other fresh faces into the par- ty's 300-member Central Commit: tee in a further purge of Khru- shchev loyalists. Miami News - November 9, 1985 Five of these newcomers would later become members of the party Politburo, which serves as the So- viet Union's ruling inner cabinet. Gorbachev was the youngest of the five. By 1979, Gorbachev was elected as a candidate member of the Po- litburo, He was only 48. A year later he was made a full voting member. Brezhnev's death in 1982 set off three years of infighting, punctu- ated by the deaths of his succes: sors, Andropov and Chernenko. After Andropov's death in Feb- ruary 1984, the inner party coun- cils apparently struck an unprece- dented compromise, for reasons that remain unclear. They gave the party chairman- ship to Chernenko, the candidate of the Brezhnev Old Guard. At the same time, they secretly tapped Gorbachev, who had the backing of the Andropov faction, as the party's second-in-command and crown prince. On his way to the top, Gorbach- ev had learned a thing or two about politics. Since taking over upon Chernen- ko's death last March, he has in- stalled six of his own men in the Politburo. After naming the first four, he proceeded to sack his young Polit- buro rival, Grigory Romanov, who had enjoyed dangerously close ties with the military and Brezhnev- era bureaucrats. Gorbachev even kicked Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko upstairs to the honorific job of Soviet president. Not since Stalin's death in 1953 has a Soviet leader's power base \f"

        "ocr_text": " Water project threatens ice cap JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Con News Service MOSCOW — For Soviet scien- tists, simply damming a river isn’t enough. Instead, they want to turn several completely around. Just this year, the Soviets broke round on what could eventuall ome a $200 billion water pro ect that would reverse some of the flow of major Russian rivers. When completed, it will divert more water than flows over Niag- ara Falls, the geographical equiva- lent of irrigating the wheat fields of the Pacific Northwest from sources near Fairbanks, Alaska. But some Soviet and internation- al scientists are worried because nothing of such scale has been tried anywhere. And British clima- tologist Michael Kelly has warned that the Russians could end up raising the salt concentration of the Arctic Ocean, which in turn could melt some of the polar ice cap and set off a chain reaction of problems in global patterns, in- porn flooding, water pollution and widespread crop failures. The project’s first stage will take about 1.3 cubic miles of fresh water annually from lakes and riv- ers north of Moscow, forcing it southward to meet irrigation de- mands. The amount diverted will increase tenfold over the next 65 years of the project. Kelly, whose research on the So- viet plan was supported by grants from the U.S. Naval Research Lab- oratory, has said that shrinking the Arctic ice pack could raise temperatures throughout the Northern Hemisphere by several degrees and cause changes in rain- fall, threatening crop failures in warmer latitudes. Freshwater flowing into the Arctic is lighter than saltwater and tends to float on it. Beneath this layer of mostly freshwater is a layer of “Atlantic water” — which has been driven north by Atlantic Ocean currents. This freshwater serves to insulate the ice cap from the warmer “Atlantic water.” “There is no doubt that modifi- cation of nature on the scale of the proposed transfers will result in substantial ecological and environ- mental consequences,” Kelly said in a paper published last year. Grigoriy Voropayev, director of the Institute of Water Problems of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, dismisses the possibility of world- wide climate changes. But Voro- ayev says Soviet scientists have anki increasingly sensitive to such risks. Some scientists believe the Sovi- ets have little choice but to contin- ue. The Caspian Sea, a valuable freshwater fishery five times as large as Lake Superior, has fallen 11 feet this year. Miami News - December 12, 1985 \f"

If Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev chooses to meet President Reagan this year, it would mark the first time since the 1917 Russian Revolution that the ranking Soviet chief has agreed so early in his tenure to meet with an American president. Reagan, who unlike every president since Harry Truman has never met a Soviet leader at a summit, has invited Gorbachev to Washington in conjunction with the Soviet leader’s expected visit to the U.N. General Assembly in New York this fall. Shultz and Gromyko have scheduled only one session in Vienna, a meeting at the Soviet Em- bassy this afternoon which is set to last three to V linn Meeting Attracts Top U.S. Officials four hours. Wednesday, the two foreign ministers are set to take part in a ceremony commemorating the 30th anniversary of a treaty that removed Soviet and Western troops from Austria and a Austrian sovereignty following World ar II, Shultz, referring to the 1955 Austrian treaty between the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, said in an airport arrival statement yesterday, “Negotiations can work. It's a very important message for us,” Shultz, addressing reporters in Bonn, West Germany, on May 2, said he planned to discuss “a range of matters” with Gromyko in Vienna. He added that “it’s very likely” that one of the subjects would be a possible Reagan-Gorba- chev summit, As Shultz flew to Vienna from Jordan yester- day, he spoke a shade more cautiously to re- porters aboard his plane, telling them that a possible summit meeting is not “the particular purpose of the meeting” with Gromyko. In an indicator of the importance the Ameri- can side attaches to the Gromyko meeting, U.S, _ sources said 125 rooms have been reserved at the Vienna Hilton for the Shultz entourage of advisers, translators and security men. A list of the Shultz party includes Paul Nitze, the Reagan administration's senior adviser on the arms talks, as well as U.S, Ambassador to Moscow Arthur Hartman and Jack Matlock, the senior National Security Council specialist on the Soviet Union, All three sat alongside Shultz during his last meeting with Gromyko in Geneva on Jan. 7-8, at which the two sides agreed to open nuclear and space arms talks, If a summit meeting is arranged, an an- nouncement might well come simultaneously from Washington and Moscow, in a format that would focus attention immediately on the top leaders instead of their foreign ministers. Certainly there are no signs the State Depart: ment is getting ready in Vienna for a major announcement. Although Shultz has tentatively scheduled a press briefing after his meeting with Gromyko, the State Department has set up only a small press room that has no telephones. Shultz is due to fly back to Washington on Wednesday. Reagan, in an interview published April 2, said Gorbachev had accepted in principle his invitation for a meeting . Since then Reagan has stressed repeatedly and publicly his desire to meet Gorbachev. However, his top aides have tried to dampen expectations by talking of a Reagan-Gorbachev get-aquainted session, rather than a full- fledged “summit” aimed at producing results, Palm Beach Post - May 14, 1985 \f"

Checkbook journalism didn’t exist during the Beirut hostage crisis. If anything, it was $100-bill journalism. How much of this went on during the 17- day hostage crisis is one of those questions that needs more digging. As the great TV media war escalated to- ward the hostage release, ABC News consis- tently scooped the world with exclusive in- terviews with Berri and the hostages. With every scoop came a new round of journalists’ speculation around the Commodore Hotel bar that ABC must be paying off sombebody in Amal. This unsubstantiated talk became most in- tense around 6 a.m. Saturday, a few hours after journalists from other organizations were rousted by their news desks in the United States to discover Amal had delivered 32 of the hostages to ABC’s Beirut headquar- ters, the isolated seafront Summerland Ho- tel, for a going away dinner. Five ABC-TV crews were allowed by Amal to film the hostages for about three hours while ABC’s Betsey Aaron interviewed them only necessary but ethical. There were only about a dozen Americans working as correspondents for U.S. maga- zines and newspapers in Beirut last week, in addition to several dozen or more TV types. A good many Americans carried fat wads of $100 bills as kidnap insurance. The idea was that if any nasty scenes unfolded at the vari- ous militias’ roadblocks, the wad of bills would transform even the most rabid Ameri- can-hating Hezbollah fanatic into a capital- ist. It never came to that. None of the Ameri- can journalists covering the hostage crisis was ever seriously hassled, let alone kid- naped. : Bribery is necessary, and possibly ethical, when it is time to place a telephone call when a switchboard is jammed and the interna- tional lines out of Beirut are finicky.

The other networks were in shock. David Fitzpatrick, Beirut bureau chief for CBS, sought out newspaper reporters in the lobby of the Commodore to say CBS had declined to rebroadcast any of the ABC film from the party. “It’s because we feel it was arranged with the cooperation of gunmen,” he said. After hearing all this, Washington Post reporter Chris Dickey asked Amal chief spokesman Ali Hamdan whether he had any “financial arrangement” with ABC. “There is no money, nothing at all,” re- plied Hamdan. He acknowleged he had given ABC some exclusives in the hostage story, but other networks had some exclusives too. When pressed, he said ABC deserved some advan- tages because it is the only network that has maintained a full Beirut bureau in recent turbulent months. “CNN closed its office when we needed them in South Lebanon,” said Hamdan. “NBC has had no correspondent here.

John Ashworth of Great Britain — have been instructed by members of the Catho- lic hierarchy in Sudan to fly home to visit their families, However, Agreiter expressed doubt that Ma- iehaoes data tt nes bole, eens he ta worked since 1982, Soon after his capture, Cath- olic sources revealed that Major had disregard- ed strong admonitions from a Sudanese Catho- lie bishop to abandon the remote mud-hut settlement in Bentiu, Sudan, where he and Ash- iam baie tomer a acuse, 8 brother Charles, a law- yet, said this account squared with his under- Palm Beach Post - October 25, 1985 standing of the events in Sudan, He added that his brother’s refusal to leave Sudan was due to “a fear that once he gets out of the country he could have a hard time getting back in.” Charles Major said his brother, who had pre- Viously served for 10 years in Borneo, took intensive Arabic language training in Beirut before he went to Sudan two years ago, It was his understanding, Charles Major said, that the demand for ransom did not occur until the kidnapers heard a Radio Libya broadcast that accused Peter Major of being a CIA agent. The two other freed missionaries were identi- fied as the Rev. Zachariah Chatin, a Sudanese- born Catholic, and Pastor John Kong, a Suda- nese-born Presbyterian, All four missionaries had been held since early September at a guerrilla camp about 80 miles from the Bentiu mission where they were seized Agreiter said the captors demanded “not a large amount” of money along with radios and tape recorders, All ransom demands eventually were dropped, and the men were freed without conditions, he’ said, Agreiter identified the captors as members of a small faction within the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army, the black Christian-led rebel group that has been fighting for 15 months to overthrow the predominantly Islamic regime of Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiry. In the end, Agreiter said, the missionaries were freed because of pressure on the captors from a larger faction in the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army. The Liberation Army still holds four other captives — a Briton, a Scotsman and two Frenchmen — who were taken prisoner eight months ago. \f"

It turns out that Ronald Reagan is the world’s most open-handed bene- factor of Bourkina Fasso — the coun- try formerly known as Upper Volta — whose young revolutionary leaders shot their way to power 20 months ago. Last spring President Thomas San- kara, 35, the paratrooper captain who heads the National Revolutionary Council, appealed to the Soviet Em- bassy for food assistance. Moscow responded with an offer of 1.1 million pounds of rice. Sankara an- grily turned it down, saying publicly this was insignificant compared to the country’s needs. This month an American aid team in the capital of Ouagadougou is cranking up to deliver 161 million tons of surplus food — mostly grains and some dried milk and wemeonbic oil — costing U.S. rs $32 million. Two-thirds of this is being distributed by Catholic Relief Services, Baptist missions and the International Red Cross. The rest will be sold or passed out free by the Sankara government. Not only here but almost every- where in Africa, the United States this year is pumping in record quantities of emergency food to make up for last year’s crushing crop failures. Since last September the Reagan government has pledged 5.3 billion pounds of foodstuffs to 18 African countries, according to a mid-Febru- ary tabulation by the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization. By U.N. nutrition standards that would be enough to provide two weeks of minimum 1,600-calorie-a- day bread rations for all 400 million sub-Sahara Africans. The object, how- ever, is to stretch out the emergency food until harvest time in October by directing it to the most stricken re- gions. Countries receiving U.S. farm sur- pluses range from Sudan, Kenya and Niger to Africa’s three remaining bas- tions of Soviet-style socialism — Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola. U.N. statistics show that fully 85% of all the emergency food for Africa this year will arrive in sacks bearing Western insignias. The American share — 47% of the worldwide total — is by far the larg- est. But France. West Germany, the apan million and 400 million pounds apiece. During the drought the Soviet Un- ion has been notably tightfisted with. all forms of aid, especiallly food. The U.N. tabulation shows that So- viet food pledges have amounted to only 12 million — onefive hundredth of the U.S. total. The only other communist contributions have Bourkina meaning public of Upright People” in tribal languages — is a Colorado-sized cake of clay and sand with 7 million inhab- itants and virtually no exploitable re- sources. It needs extra food mainly for its northern villages, which were wiped out by crop failure last fall and now are swollen with nomadic herders. A reporter who drove 400 miles through the flat, dust-brown, sparsely wooded countryside found that in towns of 10,000 or more, markets were well stocked with grain, cab- and onions. Most townspeople looked well fed. But in small villages the sickly look of hunger was inescapable. The most pitiful were among the shy young chil- dren who edged up in the crowds that clustered near the reporter’s car. Idrissa Belen, health officer for a network of villages with 6,000 inhabit- ants 120 miles north of the capital, “Their legs swell up, their abdo- mens swell up, they die in about three days,”” he said. While it seems clear the American food will alleviate some suffering, it is much less certain that U.S. generosity will make any difference on the chess- board of international rivalries. For whatever the reasons, the fact is that Sankara has not led Bourkina Fasso as far into the radical camp as Western analysts feared when he overthrew the previous, pro-Westerm military regime in August 1983. Sankara’s accession sounded alarms in the Washington foreign poli- cy establishment since intelligence re- ports said he obtained weapons through a secret Libyan airlift to a hideout across the border in northern Ghana.. Bourkina Fasso has shown a prickly independence from all its benefactors to the point of irritating all of them at different times. - Washington was upset last summer when the y became one of the few African states to join the Moscow- orchestrated boycott of the Los Ange- les Olympics. There were similar groans iast whom Sankara > great fighter for the work of emanci- Pation.”’ On the other hand Sankara oblique- ly criticized the Soviet Union in a U.N. speech last fall when he spoke out against “foreign military intervention im Afghanistan.” And closer to home, Ser Tr purged six pro-Moscow Com- unist ministers from his Cabinet last eurrines and threw leading Commu- nist union leaders in gees Gradually, Sankara has distanced from Libya. He has not im- ported Libyan, Cuban or other foreign troops. And he has kept his country’s economy linked to the French curren- cy. In recent months Libyan aid has dawindled. Sankara has been accept- ing loans and high-level visitors from Algeria, the enemy of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi. *‘Maybe the Libyans thought they could use us but we are not like that,” said Capt.
