        "ocr_text": "Arabs are ready, but Israelis won’t talk yet By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — A last-minute obsta- cle to Palestinian participation in Mid- dle East peace talks was swept aside Monday, but Israelis said they have no intention of showing up to resume nego- tiations the Bush administration has scheduled for Wednesday. The administration was equally ada- mant about trying to begin the talks as planned. The Israelis say they won't talk until Monday. “We'll be open and ready for busi- ness” on Wednesday, said State Depart: ment spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler, refusing to suggest how or whether the impasse with the Israelis might be resolved in time. Should the Israelis stick to their de- mands for a delay, the key issue will be whether the Arab negotiators will wait for them. There were indications that at least some of the Arab delegations, ex- pected to arrive today, would do so. Israel signals displeasure Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli deputy foreign minister and spokesman for the Israeli delegation to the October open- ing of peace talks in Madrid, is expected to arrive in this country today but is not expected to join the talks. “T presume he will be giving inter- views and explaining our position,” said Ruth Yaron, press attache at the Israeli Embassy. He and Israeli Ambassador Zalman Shoval, another delegate to the Madrid talks, “absolutely won't show up” at the Wednesday resumption of negotiations, she said. The Israelis balked after the Bush administration set a date and place for talks that Israel did not approve. Israeli officials were incensed that the invita- tion to come to Washington was sent the night before Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had a chance to present his case to President Bush for holding the talks in or near the Middle East. The Israelis did not refuse to come altogether but showed that they will not accept dictates from the White House by announcing they will be in Washington to negotiate Dec. 9, next Monday, PLO visas cause delay Ms. Yaron said she does not expect ‘sraeli negotiators to begin arriving un- til late this week. Meanwhile, some of the Arab dele- gations already were en route to Wash- ington. The Jordanian and Palestinian nego- tiators were delayed about eight hours in Amman, Jordan, on Monday, over a dispute with the Americans about grant- ing visas to some Palestinian advisers who are officials of the Palestine Liber- ation Organization. American law prohibits giving visas to officials or representatives of the PLO, except under special waiver from the secretary of state. At the State Department, Ms, Tutwiler indicated the problem was re- solved when the Palestinians agreed not to formally make application for some of the advisers, Mohammed Shtayyeh, administra- tive director for the delegation, said in Washington that the problem was a technical error based on the lack of pho- tographs, He said three of the people who did not apply for visas in the proper manner did not get them. “We are ready to stay in Washington as long as it is necessary for us to stay,” said Mr. Shtayyeh.

Elaine Carey WASHINGTON BUREAU ashington — The Unit- ed States stepped for- ward Monday as mid- wife in the birth of a Ukrainian nation, offering to recognize the republic’s independence from the Soviet Union as soon as Ukrainian leaders satisfy outside worries such as who controls So- viet nuclear missiles on Ukraini- an territory. “We obviously are moving toward full diplomatic recogni- tion,” said White House spokes- man Marlin Fitzwater. About four hours later, Ukraine got another historic push toward independence when Russian republic President Bo- ris N. Yeltsin announced that his huge republic would recognize Ukraine as an independent na- tion. For virtually all of the past 350 years, Russian czars and So- viet commissars have ruled Ukraine from afar. “Boris Yeltsin expressed his conviction of the possibility and the need to quickly establish new interstate, including diplomatic, relations between Russia and Ukraine,” said a report on late- night Russian television § in Moscow. Mr. Yeltsin's response was notably more enthusiastic than that of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who emerged ever more clearly from Sunday’s Ukrainian referendum as a lead- er in title only. A spokesman for Mr. Gorba- chev issued a plaintive statement Monday discouraging “any inter- pretation of a vote for indepen- dence as a vote for a split from the union.”’ Two days earlier, Mr. Gorbachev had pleaded with Ukrainians to stick with the un- ion of republics he heads. Preliminary results showed that 90.85 percent of Ukrainians who voted supported indepen- dence, a wider margin than pro- independence activists had ex- pected. The results suggest that millions of ethnic Russians, Poles, Romanians, Jews and oth- er minorities joined the ethnic Ukrainian majority in opting to break with Moscow. ‘The White House said Presi- dent Bush will send two “special emissaries” within the next month to discuss “complex is- sues” arising from the refer- endum. It said Thomas Niles, the as- sistant secretary of state in charge of European affairs, will depart for the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, next week to confer with newly elected Ukrainian leaders about “our future relationships with Ukraine.” TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1991 Chief among them will be for- mer Ukrainian Communist ideo- logue Leonid Kravchuk, 57, who renounced communism during the August Moscow coup and on Sunday was chosen by Ukrainian voters as president, with a re- ported margin of more than 60 percent. To pin down any commit- ments elicited by Mr. Niles, Sec- retary of State James A. Baker III will visit both Kiev and Mos- cow before the end of December. The United States plans to discuss three “baskets” of issues before agreeing to exchange am- bassadors with Ukraine, accord- ing to White House and State De- partment briefers. The issues: > Ukraine’s willingness to re- spect international treaty obliga- tions of the Soviet Union and its readiness to respect existing in- ternational borders. Steps by Ukraine to ensure “safe, responsible and reliable control of nuclear weapons” on Ukrainian soil, as well as to head off proliferation of ‘dangerous military-related technology.” > Ukraine’s economic poli- cies on trade with other Soviet republics, as well as the Ukraini- an government's willingness to shoulder a share of Soviet inter- national debt. From the world, viewpoint, the most crucial of the issues is how Ukrainian leaders will treat the estimated 4,000 tactical and strategic nuclear weapons that the Soviet armed forces now con- trol on Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian government has said Ukraine ultimately will become a nuclear-free zone. But it has insisted that the existing Soviet weapons remain on Ukrai- nian territory until they can be dismantled. For now, two big Soviet mis- sile bases in Ukraine house 176 Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at North Ameri- can targets, each tipped with six to 10 nuclear warheads. Another question — only partly settled by Mr. Yeltsin’s announced recognition — is whether Ukraine’s indepen- dence will set off 4 trade war with Russia. With its vast expanses of fer- tile black soil, Ukraine has long been the granary that supplies bread for Moscow and Lenin- grad. Its factories also supply one-fifth or more of all Soviet in- dustrial commodities, But it is desperately short of oil, natural gas and timber and has virtually no hard currency. One leading Ukrainian par- liamentarian, Volodymyr Polip- chuk, said in an interview in Kiev recently, “If Russia stops sup- plies of fuel to Ukraine, Ukraine will in turn stop its steel plants, and it will mean the collapse of the Russian economy. Ukraine will also stop shipments of food- stuffs to Russia, and we could also stop the transit of Russian goods through our territory to the ports on the Black Sea.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 3, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Mideast talks resuming today without Israelis By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Arab negoti- ators arrived Tuesday, calling Is- rael’s refusal to join today’s peace talks an effort to under- mine the peace process. “We know that the Israelis for a long time have been trying to procrastinate, have been trying to buy time, have been trying to get the peace process derailed,” said Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi. “We are not going to sit around twiddling our thumbs.” Israel says it will not show up for today’s talks because its ne- gotiators did not have enough time to prepare. The Israelis say they are willing to resume bar- gaining Monday. But the Palestinian-Jordanian delegation said it does not expect to be available for talks Monday. There were indications, however, that some of the Arab delegations would meet their Israeli counter- parts Tuesday. The Bush administration con- tinued its policy Tuesday of not criticizing Israel. Instead, it made a gesture clearly designed to show the Israelis that they still have strong friends in Washington. State Department spokes- woman Margaret Tutwiler said the government will seek a U.N. vote within two weeks to over- turn the “‘odious” anti-Israel res- olution equating Zionism with racism. Zionism is the philosoph- ical underpinning of Israel, an expression that Jews should re- create their Biblical homeland. President Bush said in Sep- tember that the United States would try to have the 1975 reso- lution rescinded, but the timing of this announcement appeared calculated to woo the Israelis back into cooperation with the peace process. -At the same time, Ms. Tutwiler announced plans by the U.S. and Soviet co-sponsors of the peace process to plow ahead with the third phase of talks, de- spite the contentious attitudes holding up this current, second phase of bilateral talks that are Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 4, 1991 supposed to take place between Israel and the Palestinians, Jor- dan, Syria and Lebanon. She said the third phase, mul- tilateral talks dealing with region- al issues such as water, arms cCon- trol and environmental problems, would begin Jan. 28 in Moscow. The first phase was the largély ceremonial conference ee opened in October in Madrid. © Israeli leaders have claimed that the two weeks’ notice they got for resuming negotiations to- day was not enough time to pfe- pare. But they also were openly angered by what some called the dictatorial method with which the United States discounted Is- rael’s desires to hold the talks in or near the Middle East. , Israel did send Deputy Mintis- ter Benjamin Netanyahu _,to Washington on Tuesday to meet with State Department officials. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Stalled pacts symbolize Soviet leader’s fading power By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Washington — Two Soviet draft documents, a Union Treaty and a Treaty on Economic Com- munity, lie at the center of the struggle between Soviet Presi- dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the restive Soviet republics. If Mr. Gorbachev ever man- aged to rope the republics into signing both treaties, he would be back at the height of his power. The Union Treaty, which Mr. Gorbachev asked the republics to sign in mid-November, was a po- litical document that would have set up a successor nation to the So- viet Union. It was to be called the Union of Sovereign States. The new union would be a “democratic confederative state,” which would wield only those powers delegated to it by the republics, the treaty said. The draft provided for “‘com- mon armed forces” that would retain “central control of strate- gic defense, including nuclear -missiles.” The union government also would handle all the repub- lics’ diplomatic ties with foreign _ countries. On Nov. 14, Mr. Gorbachev got Russia and six smaller, most- ly Central Asian republics to agree in principle to the Union Treaty. But the commitment proved empty because most in- sisted that their parliaments would have to ratify it. Mr. Gorbachev has enjoyed marginally better luck with his proposed economic treaty. In No- vember, he persuaded the two_ biggest republics, Russia and Ukraine, as well as eight smaller republics, to sign a vaguely worded draft of a treaty to create “a common economic space.” The six-page draft pro- claimed the “benefits of econom- ic integration.” It spoke of acom- mon currency and a central bank but contained no details on how these or other crucial economic mechanisms would function. “It is pretty much a shell of an agreement,” said Steven Woehrel of the U.S. Congression- al Research Service. More recently, Ukraine has signaled that its Parliament won't ratify the economic treaty unless it can win a long list of ma- jor amendments from Moscow, including the right to create a Ukrainian currency.

Lacking a surprise develop- ment, serious bilateral discus- sions were not likely to get start- ed until Tuesday at the earliest, assuming the Arab delegations are willing to wait that long. The talking Wednesday, the day the American and Soviet co- sponsors of the peace process designated for a resumption of negotiations, was limited to mu- tual recriminations. “Israel has throughout tried to derail the entire process,” said Abdul Salam Majali, head of the joint Jordanian-Palestinian dele- gation, as he emerged from the State Department after a fruit- less half-hour wait for Israeli ne- gotiators who already had said they would not show up until Monday. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 5, 1991 “We are very much disap- pointed that the other side did not appear,” said Syrian delega- tion leader Moafac Allaf. He left the same building by another door, under procedural rules de- signed to fulfill Israeli desires to hold meetings with the three del- egations in separate places. “Israel officials are in town right now,” said Mr. Majali, ‘‘but instead of talking to us about peace they are at pains trying to explain away their failing to do that by talking to the media.” As Mr. Majali spoke, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Benja- min Netanyahu was holding a news conference across town, ac- cusing the Arab negotiators of “playing games” by “going to a room they know in advance is go- ing to be empty.” “TI don’t think the issue is Wednesday or Monday,” Mr. Ne- tanyahu said. “I think the issue is process. That is, is there a negoti- ation that takes place between Arabs and Israelis, or is there an Arab idea that somehow the United States will impose condi- tions on Israel?” That essentially is what hap- pened when the United States set a time and place — here on Wednesday — to resume talks. The Israelis wanted to meet in or close to the Middle East, the Ar- abs did not, and the Americans tried to dictate a solution. Israel refused to bow completely. “We have made our point,” said Israeli Ambassador Zalman Shoval. The Israelis promised to ap- pear for talks Monday, but sever- al Arab delegates said they prob- ably will not come that day. It is the fourth anniversary of the in- tifada, the Arab uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied terri- tories. Mr. Netanyahu did give one encouraging sign, that the Israeli negotiators will be ready to talk next week about substantive is- sues, not merely about where to hold the next meeting. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Both sides to gain from progress at talks By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Both Pales- tinians and Israelis have a stake in making fast progress when they finally sit down at Mideast peace talks this week, assuming they get as far as the negotiating table. Israelis are said to be carrying a 17-point proposal for the shape of Palestinian self-rule in the occu- pied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the Palestinians have their own formula with as many as 43 points to bargain. Ticking off a few points of agreement could be a political ton- ic for both sides to take home. They are not far apart on many of the elements likely to figure in transitional self-rule. They agree the Palestinians should elect local leaders to run affairs ranging from education to health care. That is why the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians are viewed more optimistically than Israel’s prospects of making peace with Syria and Lebanon. Still, the Israelis and Palestin- ians disagree on key points of self- rule, including control of water resources, some economic issues and the all-important question of security — how much control Isra- el will retain. The most difficult ANALYSI dispute will be over Israel’s wish to continue building Jewish settle- ments in the territories. Concentrating on the easy is- sues first may be in the interest of both Palestinians and Israelis, even to the extent of making an interim agreement that would allow the Palestinians to go home and begin making changes on the ground. Israelis suffered a bit of a black eye by boycotting the talks last week. Israeli officials did so be- cause they felt Washington was pushing them around by setting the time and place. The Israeli negotia- tors want such decisions made through direct contacts between themselves and the Arabs. By making progress on self-rule with the Palestinians, the Israelis would prove their point to Wash- ington. The government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, facing the prospect of elections next year — and maybe early elections — also would score points in the eyes of Israelis hungry for peace. Progress in the peace talks also could make the Bush administra- tion look more kindly on Israel’s request for $10 billion in loan guar- antees, a crucial issue for Israel Palm Beach Post - December 8, 1991 and its flood of Soviet immigrants. As for Palestinian negotiators, they also need to show their constit- uents something is to be gained by playing this peace game. They have a wary audience that so far has supported the peace process but still is subjected to calls by disgruntled radicals and fundamentalists who want to make peace by waging war. The opening of peace talks in Madrid in October brought the Palestinian delegates worldwide recognition and approv- al, which wasn’t a bad reward to take back home. In Washington, the Palestinian delegates are just as articulate and are saying the same words, but the applause meter barely has jiggled. Other subjects, from hostage re- leases to U.S. domestic politics, have stolen the scene. If the Palestinians fail to make some progress in talking with Is- raelis, they may face an increas- ingly hostile audience back home questioning the use of talking. Before the Israelis and Pales- tinians can even reach the sub- stance everyone claims they want to discuss, however, the questio’ remains whether they will be abl to cut through remaining procedur al disputes. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Israel starts talking with Arab neighbors By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — In a conten- tious resumption of Mideast peace talks Tuesday, Lebanese and Syrian negotiators joined substantive discussions with their Israeli counterparts, but Is- raelis and the joint Palestinian- Jordanian delegation stumbled into yet another procedural bar- rier. No one reported actual prog- ress in the talks, which never were expected to produce quick results. But all the parties agreed to meet again today, underscor- ing the fact that they are talking peace for the first time in more than 40 years, rather than ready- ing for war. “T think this was a good day,” said Israeli spokesman Benjamin Netanyahu, a deputy foreign minister. “We not only made contact, but we began discussing, believe it or not, substance.” The dispute that did not get ironed out Tuesday was over what “dual-track” talks should mean in reference to the Pales- tinian-Jordanian delegation, which wants to split into separate components to talk with the Is- raelis, The Palestinians and Jorda- nians said they are different peo- ples with different agendas, but the Israelis said the Palestinians “want to press their claim for separate statehood” by splitting Aa MR BUS DONT Cove SYRIAS Bares OF PAN EN | The Associated Press Demonstrators at the State Department in Washington on Tuesday blame acts of terrorism on Syria. the delegation. “The only progress was that they agreed to meet at 10 in the morning,” a Palestinian spokes- man said after the second round of talks broke around 6 p.m. with the impasse still intact. In both morning and after- noon sessions, the Israelis, Pal- estinians and Jordanians never even made it into negotiating rooms, but stayed in State De- partment corridors trying to fip- ure out what to do. The three heads of the groups sat on a sofa to talk. Other delegations at least got beyond corridors and into talks about issues. After 3% hours of discus- sions, the Israeli and Syrian teams each said the other side was sticking to old, intransigent positions. “There is no Syrian willing- ness as yet to engage in any sub- stantive exchange on the compo- nents of peace. And there is a con- tinuation of a focusing on the dimension of territory, as was the case in Madrid,” said Israeli Yossi Ben Aharon, referring to the cere- monial opening of the peace proc- ess in Madrid on Oct. 31. ' Syrian negotiator Moaffak Allaf gave a similar report, though he expressed hopes that today’s talks would bring an im- provement. “It was rather a repetition of the same attitudes by the Israeli delegation in Madrid, trying to talk on everything except with- drawal from territory, rejecting the principle of land for peace,” he said. The Syrians say they won't discuss peace agreements until they get some sign Israel is will- ing to talk about giving up terr}- tory — specifically the Golan Heights, which Israel has occu- pied since the 1967 war and which the Israeli Parliament just said it never will return. The Lebanese and Israeli del- egations met both in the morning and the afternoon, for talks that Israeli Yosef Hadass said were “cordial” and conducted “in a very businesslike atmosphere.” These talks are promising be- cause Israel says it does not want to keep the Lebanese land where it has carved out a “security zone” next to its border, but only wants guarantees that if it leaves this strip the Lebanese won't open it again to terrorist groups staging attacks on Israel.

        "ocr_text": "Arab-Israeli discussions go nowhere, but all sides keep talking By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Scant prog- ress was reported in Middle East peace talks Wednesday as Israel and the joint Palestinian-Jorda- nian delegation remained sty- mied over a procedural dispute that kept them talking in corri- dors for a second day. Israeli and Syrian negotiators _ both said their talks got nowhere, but they agreed to return for more discussions today. Talks between the Israelis and Lebanese apparently contin- ued in the most positive vein, with discussions of what Israeli spokesman Benjamin Netanyahu called a “detailed framework” that could become the basis of a peace treaty. They also will meet again today. Israelis and the Palestinians and Jordanians traded written proposals to break the deadlock that so far has prevented them even from entering a negotiating room. But they were unable to reach a compromise on whether to split into two groups — Israe- lis talking primarily to Palestin- ians in one room and to Jordani- ans in a second — as the Arabs want to do. Without some agreement on how to proceed, the negotiators have been unable to decide whether to enter one room or two, much less get down to sub- stantive talks. Heads of the dele- gation continued talking Wednesday on a corridor sofa. “They are still in the hall- way,” an Israeli spokeswoman said after Wednesday’s second round of talks finished around 7 p.m. with no success. Earlier, Palestinian spokes- woman Hanan Ashrawi had said she is optimistic the disagree- ment will be resolved soon, since the Israelis have accepted the concept of the “dual-track” ap- proach the Arabs want. Mr. Netanyahu again claimed the Palestinians are trying to “move the goal posts” after the game has begun, trying to renege on their agreement for a joint delegation with Jordanian nego- tiators. The Israelis object not only to what they say is an effort to change the rules, but protest that the Palestinians want recogni- tion as an independent delega- tion as a step toward winning an independent state in the occu- pied West Bank and Gaza Strip. These negotiations are supposed to draw a blueprint for Palestin- ian self-rule in the territories, but both sides agreed years ago that the issue of final sovereignty is to be put off for three years.

Israelis and Palestinians said they came closer to bridging their disparate positions on how to structure the talks. The Palestinians want sepa- rate discussions with Israel, not as part of a joint delegation with Jordanians, in order to underline their separate identity. Israel has stuck to the origi- nal call for a joint Palestinian- Jordanian delegation, even while agreeing to a “dual track” for the talks. “There was some improve- ment in the Israeli position,” said Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi. Israeli spokesman Benjamin Netanyahu gave a similar assess- ment, saying, ‘‘The gap appar- ently is narrowing.” But they were unable to reach an accord by the end of their sec- ond session of the day and will return Monday to continue talk- ing about procedure rather than substantive issues. The most positive develop- ment was Israel’s announcement that its negotiators will continue talking at least through the mid- dle of next week, after originally committing to only a few days. All the sides agreed to stop the talks until Monday, apparently for the Muslim, Jewish and Christian days of religious observance Fri- day, Saturday and Sunday.

The fact that they are ex- changing views and interpreta- tions of peace is ‘“‘a sign that we are making some progress,” Mr. Ben Aharon said. Syrian negotiator Moaffak Allaf told journalists his country is ready for “the establishment of peace and all the attributes of that peace,” implying for the first time that Syria might be willing to enter a detailed peace treaty with Israel and offer diplo- matic recognition. But, he said, Israel still re- fuses to talk about the other side of the equation — exchanging land for peace. Among the Arab territories Israel still occupies from the 1967 war is the Golan Heights, which had been part of Syria. \f"

        "ocr_text": "White House outlines role for other nations in Soviets’ breakup By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The Bush ad- ministration, saying other na- tions cannot remain ‘‘mere by- standers”’ as the Soviet Union dissolves, announced plans Thursday to aid the Soviet peo- ple, dismantle the vast Soviet nu- clear network and help the re- publics create democratic gov- ernments and free market economies. The major policy package includes: & An international confer- ence hosted early next month by President Bush to assess and help meet immediate humanitar- ian needs this winter. |. & The appointment of Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to coordinate a raft oF programs to help republics committed.to democratic princi- es, muclear control and a free marketplace. - The effort to stem a slide toward social chaos on one hand, and authoritarian rule on the oth- er, was announced by the White House and by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. *“Strategically, both of these alternatives — anarchy or reac- tion — could become threats to the West’s vital interests when they shake a land that is still home to nearly 30,000 nuclear weapons and the most powerful arsenal of conventional weapon- = ever amassed in Europe,’’ Mr. aker said in a speech at Prince- ton University. ~ **Taken together, these dan- rs serve, I think, as a call to ac- on for America and the West,”’ he! said. Mr. Baker emphasized that the United States will seek to eerdinate an international ef- rt rather than extend a safety met unilaterally. * The January conference — to lude industrial democracies, tes of Central and Eastern Eu- rope, the Persian Gulf War coali- 10m and international financial stitutions — will open that co- : rdination. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 13, 1991 For months, analysts have faulted the administration for - continuing to support Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev against the splintering of the So- viet Union and for not moving on behalf of democratic reformers fighting hunger and fear in the republics. On Thursday, Mr. Baker re- peatedly spoke of directing help to individual republics, but he also made a single reference to supporting ‘‘any common entity”’ committed to Western ideals. And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the admin- istration has not changed its poli- cy: It is still dealing with Mr. Gorbachev, who is trying to save the central Soviet structure from extinction, as well as with lead- ers of the republics. Mr. Baker made it clear that aid will not be given to every re- public asking for it. He named five republics he said already are showing democratic initiatives — Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kirghizia — and deserve help. ; But he singled out Georgia as an example of republics slipping toward authoritarianism and said those ‘fare equally unde- serving of our acceptance and support.’’ Nor will republics such as Azerbaijan, which is arming it- self for conflict with neighboring republics, win Western support by following such ‘‘misguided and anachronistic policies,’’ he said. Controlling weapons, both nuclear and conventional, is a key element in the package Mr. Baker outlined. He said the ad- ministration already has begun exchanges between U.S. and So- viet weapons experts to consult on destroying and dismantling weapons systems. He said the President plans to use the $400 ' million Congress just authorized to help take apart the Soviets’ Cold War military machine. Mr. Bush signed that legislation Thursday night. \f"

Passage requires a simple majority of those voting. With 166 members, 84 votes would be necessary if all the mem- bers were present and voted. Abstentions do not count.

But the United States, with its pees cam. eras, has ascertained that the fences actually, sur- round exactly 56 silos holding $S-24 missiles’ pro- grammed to hit targets in North America, Some other silos hold ‘older $S-19 missiles, Officers in the basement of the Pentagon can punch up profiles on their computer screens showing how many of the more than 600 warheads at Pervoymaysk are half-megaton weapons (25 times as powerful as Hiroshima) and how many are 4- megaton weapons (200 times Hiroshima.) Of the 27,000 warheads in the former Soviet Union, only about 12,200 are counted as strategic — meaning that they are intended to hit North America via missiles, bombers or submarines, These are the warheads that have been under direct electronic control of President Mikhail Gorbachev's “football.” The outside world can be safe in assuming that these strategic heavy hitters are in only four repub- lics: roughly 9,650 in Russia, 1,300 in Ukraine, 1,150 in Kazakhstan and 100 in Byelorussia, Unhappily, that leaves a grab bag of about 14,800 more “tactical” warheads, They are much harder to track. They include the business ends of nuclear- tipped torpedoes, nuclear anti-tank shells, nuclear bombs and nuclear anti-aircraft rockets, From satellite photography and other spying techniques, Western intelligence agencies have a good fix on the locations of the scores of storage depots in the new Russian-led com- monwealth that were built to store tactical nuclear warheads. The depots are typically miles from the military units that would fire the warheads, and they are guarded by elite military custodi- ans who report directly to the gen- eral staff in Moscow. These tactical depots are dis- tributed in seven of the 12 former Soviet republics: Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Kazakhstan and three smaller Asian republics that have not been identified. Tracing what happens at these tactical warhead depots is one of the CIA’s biggest assignments. An episode reported two years ago in the southern republic of Azerbaijan illustrates the risks. In January 1990, a Muslim fundamen- talist group broke into a Soviet iniiitary base near Baku that housed tactical nuclear weapons. Although the Soviet guards held off the invaders, Moscow soon pulled all warheads out of the republic. Now, as the former communist empire keeps coming apart at the Soviet NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENTS Numbers indicate RUSSIA total number of 19,000 nuclear weapons ( Moscow BYELORUSSIA 1,250 KAZAKHSTAN Mest: Ca 1,800 ar ontia ae GEORGIA UZBEKISTAN mmm 4320 ae KIRGIZIA ee ; ne _ Oe TURKMENISTAN : | D [AZERBAWAN LY S01 125 by 3 jy ~~: 1300 Soe » coe N TAD TAN Ronee ae A 75 seams, not even the CIA claims to know exactly where every one of the 27,000 strategic and tactical relics of Soviet superpowerdom are arrayed. “There are some indications that even the Soviet general staff in Moscow may not have a complete picture of the disposition of its own nuclear forces,” said Bruce Blair, an expert on Soviet nuclear com- mand-and-control at Washington’s Brookings Institution. Mr. Blair said that U.S. intelli- gence agencies have noticed “cer- tain discrepancies” over the years when monitoring the periodic Sovi- et army maneuvers in which the special Soviet troops guarding war- head sites are ordered to unlock the storage bunkers and get ready to send tactical nuclear warheads to front-line battle units. “There have been times when the Soviet troops would report back that they don’t have these kind of weapons or that the weapons had been moved or that they don’t have the numbers they were supposed to,” Mr. Blair said. One clue as to how difficult it is for outsiders to get the full picture: Ukraine’s defense minister, Col.-Gen. Konstantin Morozov, ac- knowledged in Kiev last month that he had not been able to discover how many Soviet tactical warheads were based in his own republic. \f"

        "ocr_text": "U.N. lifts racism tag on Zionism U.S.-engineered repeal is big, victory for Israel By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU ashington — The U.N. General Assembly vot- ed overwhelmingly Monday to repeal its 1975 resolu- tion equating Zionism with rac- ism, effectively capping the bit- ter era of Cold War ideological strife in the world body. The 111-25 vote, secured through diligent lobbying by the Bush administration, under- scored the sweeping range of U.S. influence as the victor of the Cold War and the sole remaining superpower. The U.N. action also was a boost for the morale and international image of Israel. “The Jewish people are grateful for the president’s lead- ership and rejoice in the outcome of the U.N. vate,” was Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir’s message to President Bush in a Monday evening telephone call, according to a White House spokesman. The vote to repeal, on which 13 delegations abstained and an- other 17 did not participate, marked only the second time the General Assembly ever has over- turned one of its decisions. The first time was the Nov. 4, 1950, decision to rescind a 1946 resolu- tion that barred Spain from U.N. membership because it support- ed the Axis powers in World War II. Mostly Arab and Islamic na- tions voted against the repeal, in- cluding the three countries cur- rently engaged in peace talks in Washington with Israel — Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Those neg- ative votes reflected the sour note on which the second week of negotiations opened Monday, with Arabs and Israelis saying no progress was made and trading accusations that the other was acting to sabotage the peace process. While the repeal action had no di- rect connection to the peace process begun in October in Madrid, the vote breakdown signified the deep anger and distrust that remains between the two peoples. It was Arab nations that 16 years ago corralled support of Soviet bloc and Third World countries to pass by a 72-35 vote the resolution that dealt a profound blow to the Jewish state. With the collapse of the East bloc, many former Communist nations have resumed diplomatic relations with Israel, and most voted for the re- peal on Monday. A few remaining hard-line Communist states voted against repeal. Zionism is the philosophical un- derpinning of the Jewish state, for- warding the concept that Jews must remake their national home on the lands of biblical Israel. The determi- nation that Zionism was a form of racism questioned the legitimacy of the state of Israel. Atlanta’s Jewish community was thrilled to learn of the repeal, said Sherry Frank, southeastern director of the American Jewish Committee. In Ms. Frank’s view, the ‘“Zionism-is- racism” resolution legitimized anti- Semitism as well as anti-Zionism. “Today's vote says something to Zionism is the philosophical underpinning of the Jewish state. us in the Jewish community about the growing acceptance of in the world that discrimination against Is- rael should not be tolerated and should not be promoted through a world body,” Ms. Frank said. The Atlanta AJC chapter, like others in major American cities, had lobbied local consulates for more than a year to urge their countries to support the repeal. The chapter also asked black leaders such as Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and former At- lanta mayor Andrew Young to use their influence to line up Africa’s 59 U.N. members for repeal. Scott M. Dayan, an Atlanta law- er who headed up the consular cam- paign, said many of the diplomats at first argued that American Jews made too much of the resolution, since it had no binding force on U.N. members. But in the months follow- ing the Gulf War, all but a few of the countries represented in Atlanta promised to vote in favor of repealing it. “After the Gulf War it seemed to take on a life of its own, culminating in President Bush’s decision to come out in favor of repealing it,” Mr. Da- yan said. “Once he got behind it, things seemed to fall into place.” Arabs closely tied to the peace process in Washington said it would have been impossible domestically for most of the Arab nations to vote for the repeal, especially with peace talks going so poorly. Nations voting against the repeal were: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangla- desh, Brunei, Cuba, North Korea, In- donesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritania, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Soma- lia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Yemen. Abstaining or not participating were Angola, Bahrain, Burkina Faso, Chad, China, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ku- wait, Laos, Maldives, Mauritius, Mo- rocco, Myanmar (Burma), Niger, Oman, Senegal, South Africa, Trini- dad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Tanzania, Vanuatu and Zim- babwe.

Watkins said Monday that one of 66 safety rods malfunctioned during the restart of the K reactor at South Carolina’s Savannah River Site, forcing a halt in the countdown toward a controlled nuclear re- action there. -.-Over the weekend, 66 of the 16-foot rods were supposed to drop smoothly into metal chan- ne]s leading into the core of the reactor, which produces tritium - for the nation’s nuclear weapons. During several attempts to seat the rods, however, one of them repeatedly stuck part way in. The safety rods hang from a crane above the reactor. If the reactor operators should need to shut down in an emergency, they could activate switches in the control room, and gravity would pull the safety rods into the reac- tor core. The rods, which contain the element cadmium, would ab- sorb neutrons and halt the nucle- ar reaction. “We've just gone through a whole day of engineering review of that stuck rod [and] what’s causing it,” Mr. Watkins said ata James Watkins, U.S. energy secre- , praised SRS overseers for their cau- tion and con- cern for safety. news conference. “This is the growing pains we are going to see. We haven't even gotten to criticality yet. I don’t know when we'll get to criticality. But there is no rush to criticali He said nuclear experts are hoping the problem can be over- come quickly by replacing a part called an actuator. But he said it also is possible that at least one safety rod may have to be replaced. “It looks like an actuator re- placement will come first,” he said. “If that doesn’t work, we may have a longer shutdown peri Testing the safety rods was one of the first actions at the Sa- vannah River Site after Mr. Wat- kins gave his long-anticipated or- der Friday to put K reactor bac into operation to make tritium, which enhances the explosive power orf nuclear warneads. Mr. Watkins said that during the first test drop over the week- end, a considerable number of the 66 safety rods failed to seat them- selves in their proper “snugging position” inside the reactor. After some adjustments, the reactor overseers tried another test drop. That time, the number of improperly positioned rods declined to three. ‘Everything looked pretty good at that point,” Mr.-Watkins said, “but prudence said, ‘Let’s do it again.’ They did it again, and one rod stuck.” The secretary, a former ad- miral, saluted the reactor over- seers at Savannah River for their caution, saying their actions proved that they take nuclear safety questions more seriously than did some past operators during the four decades Savan- nah River’s reactors have béen making nuclear weapons ingre- dients for the military. “They are incredibly cotfipe- tent people and they are dging their job in a fantastic way,” Mr. Watkins said. “For example,, they found a leak in a fresh water line from the emergency generator; It was just a drip, and they stopped everything.

With Israeli negotiators threatening to go home after to- day’s talks, the prospect for progress on substantive issues was not promising. “On the substance, there is a problem, and that is why today we are a bit disappointed and saddened, although I wouldn’t say we are by any means desper- ate or anything of the kind,” said Eli Rubinstein, Israel’s top nego- tiator in talks with a joint Pales- tinian-Jordanian delegation. Palestinian leader Haidar Abdul Shafi said it will be up to the United States to intervene if the negotiators reach an impasse. “It seems as though we are heading to a deadlock; I hope not,” he said. “I still will be hop- ing that in the last minute there will be a breakthrough.” There was likewise no prog- ress reported in Syria’s talks with Israel, though the Israeli and Lebanese negotiators appar- ently maintained more fruitful discussions. Bush wants movement The U.S. administration, which has kept a formal distance from this second stage of the talks that opened in Madrid in October, called on the Arabs and Israelis to put aside procedural issues and get on with substan- tive talks. President Bush per- sonally delivered that message to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Tuesday in Washington. “We've been wrangling over the meeting size and rooms and tables and those kind of things, and we think it’s — we’d like to urge them to move on to the sub- stantive issues,” said White House spokesman Marlin Fitz- water, emphasizing that the mes- sage was intended for all parties. Talks between Israel and the joint Palestinian-Jordanian dele- gation have not even reached the stage of formal negotiations. Their top negotiators have talked for five days on a sofa in a State De- partment corridor, because they cannot agree on a format for talks. The Arabs want to break into a two-track format in which Isra- el holds separate discussions with Palestinians and with Jordanians, keeping only a symbolic frame- work of a joint delegation. Such a division would allow Palestin- ians, who want an independent state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, greater rec- ognition as a separate people. Arabs offer proposals The Palestinians and Jorda- nians on Tuesday submitted two written proposals to the Israelis in an effort to skirt the dispute and get into negotiations. The Associated Press+ Haidar Abdul Shafi, leader of the Palestinian delegation, - says Tuesday in Washington that the United States must try- to prevent a deadlock in the current Middle East peace = talks. At left is Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi. One contended that Israel’s “escalation of settlement activity places the entire peace process in jeopardy and presents a direct threat to this round of talks in Washington,” and it asked whether Israel was ready to “put an immediate and unequivocal end” to its settlement policies. Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said expansion of settlements on the West Bank and the confiscation of Arab-held properties violates the peace process, because the future of the disputed land held by Israel is supposed to be decided in ne- gotiations. Stopping settlements has been a high Arab priority as well as a U.S. goal. The second proposal asks the Israelis whether they are willing to enter bilateral negotiations without preconditions and, if so, when. The options on timing in- cluded any day until the end of next week, Mrs. Ashrawi said. ‘Not the end of the story’ The Israelis, who arrived nearly a week late for the talks, have twice delayed their depar- ture. Israeli spokesman Benjamin, Netanyahu indicated that a depar-, ture today was not certain, either.; He said the Israelis on Tues~ day proposed resolving the for-: mat problem by rotating joint: meetings with sequential meet: ings with Jordan and the Pales- tinians. “Let me Say that even if we do not arrive at an agreement here, we will not consider it the end of the story,” Mr. Netanyahu saids “We'll meet again after the holi-* days and we’ll pick up where we« left off.” Moving the talks to a location, closer to the Middle East has, been a high Israeli priority, but: Mr. Netanyahu indicated a soft- ening of that position Tuesday, saying that choosing a venue, again may require American as-, sistance. The U.§. government chose Washington for this round of talks when the two sides could, not agree on a site. - = Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 18, 1991 \f"

In one new wrinkle, the Israe- lis indicated they consider the American role in the talks fin- ished and do not intend to let the American sponsors help mediate any impasses that may develop. “It’s no secret that no real progress was achieved during the two weeks of negotiations here in Washington,” said Syrian negotiator Moaffak Allaf, who echoed sentiments of Palestin- ians and Jordanians. The problem, he said, ‘was the Israeli insistence on creating obstacles, sometimes in the pro- cedural matters and some other times, which is more important, during the few hours during which some sort of substantive discussion took place.” On the other side his Israeli priorities, I think, is in itself a positive development,” he said. The Syrian-Israeli talks got into substantive issues in the six days of talks, but not far. Discus- sions closed in deadlock over dif- fering interpretations of U.N. Se- curity Council Resolution 242, which calls on Israel to give up occupied land in exchange for peace from the Arabs. Syria wants the occupied Go- lan Heights to be returned, but Israelis say they already gave up enough territory when they re- turned the Sinai to Egypt. Israel Arabs gloomy as talks end is focusing on the half of the equation mandating peace. The Lebanese have said little about their low-key talks, but Is- raelis say they have held serious discussion en route to a peace agreement. A sticking point here is Leba- non’s insistence that Israel first withdraw its troops from the swath of Lebanese territory the Israelis patrol as a security zone. Israel does not want to leave un- til Syria withdraws all its from Lebanese land, to insu safety from potential Syrian cursions. The Israelis and negotiator for the Palestinian-Jordaniag delegation never resolved thei dispute over the Arabs’ view thi Israel should hold separate tall with the two groups.

        "ocr_text": "Palestinians working on a ‘nice guy tmage Speaking softly: Palestinians seek to erase their violent image in the West. By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Palestinian negotiator Haidar Abdul Shafi turned down a choice opportu- nity last week to verbally skew- er the man who is the nemesis of many Palestinians — hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. It was a softball question ata news briefing, when Mr. Abdul Shafi was asked about Mr. Sha- mir’s early career in a Jewish mi- litia that made terrorist assaults on Arabs and British colonialists running what was then Palestine. “I was old enough to know what was going on, but I must say that I never heard the name of Shamir in that time,” said the soft-spoken, elderly physician, fi » silencing his question- repeated invitations to at- tack Mr. Shamir. This courtly, balding gentle- man was continuing his job of re- making the Western image of Palestinians. It is part of an effort to secure by persuasion and ne- gotiation what could not be won through decades of violence. The last two weeks in Wash- ington proved it will be a long, hard haul. The talks were so dis- mally unsuccessful as to raise concerns that Palestinians less patient than Mr. Abdul Shafi, those living under the restraints of continued occupation, may not: wait to see if the new approach’ works. After Israel’s Cabinet meet- ing Sunday,Israel announced it Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 23 would return to Washington on Jan. 7 and take part in the ad- journed talks. But making it clear that Isra- el still prefers to talk about pro- cedure rather than substance, Transport Minister Moshe Kat- zav told reporters that Israeli negotiators hope ‘‘to convince the Arab side [that] to be more efficient, it’s better to negotiate here around the Middle East and even in Europe.’’ Less emphasis on the past Nevertheless, cheap verbal shots at Israeli leaders are not in the Palestinian plan, which aims at convincing the world the Palestinian cause today is right. Forget about yesterday. There are Palestinian yes- terdays to forget, as well, as Mr. Abdul Shafi and his retinue of peace negotiators attempt to override the image of Palestin- ians hidden behind ski masks, leveling Kalashnikovs during hijackings. The entourage here consisted mostly of intellectuals and businessmen who jetted to Washington from prestigious universities or European capi- tals, Palestinians who have nev- er trod the grounds of terrorist training camps. Joining Mr. Abdul Shafi in propelling this metamorphosis has been Hanan Ashrawi, a col- lege professor and official spokeswoman of the Palestinian peace team. The Palestinians had been stars of the program when it . opened in Madrid in October. To much of the world they were new faces speaking measured words of reason, and the media were mesmerized. Showing an unexpected mastery of symbols, Palestinian negotiators walked into the show waving olive branches to signify their quest for peace. Washington was different. Cameras and journalists were on hand, but the peace process made little news in the consum- mate news town. Hostages were coming home, the Soviet Union finally was ripping asunder, a Kennedy was on trial — tele- vised — for alleged rape. Mideast peace talks were in the back of the newspapers and . the bottom of network broad- casts, on days when they didn’t fall completely out of the news. Ms. Ashrawi was reported to be dismayed at the change, whispering to Americans her suspicions that the State De- partment had instructed the media to downplay its coverage so what she perceives as Israel’s inflexible positions would not be publicized. Nothing to take home Worse, the talks themselves stalled over the Arabs’ insistence that the joint Palestinian-Jorda- nian delegation break down im- mediately for separate talks with Israelis. They never got beyond talks about procedure. Not only was there no news to report, in the end there was nothing for these new-era Pales- tinians to take home. The Israelis seemed in full control. They came late, left early and succeeded in Keeping American mediators at bay, de- spite Arab requests for U.S. help in breaking deadlocks. They also clamped down on Pal- estinians back home under oc- cupation, maintaining strict curfews, adding new travel re- strictions and evicting Arab families from their homes and turning the homes over to Jew- ish settlers.

Yeltsin rapidly. took command Wednesday of a shrunken Russian empire, only minutes after Mikhail S. Gorba- chev stepped down as head of a failed Soviet Union. Half an hour after Mr. Gorba- chev finished a brooding valedic- tory address, the familiar red Communist -hammer-and-sickle flag came down from the flagpole atop the Kremlin. In its place went up the red, white and blue flag of Mother Russia that had once flown under the czars — a symbolic end to nearly 712 dec- ades of Communist rule. Mr. Gorbachev’s last act as president was to sign a decree putting Mr. Yeltsin in charge of the 27,000 warheads in the for- mer Soviet nuclear arsenal — many of them aimed at the Unit- ed States. At 7:56 p.m. Moscow time, Mr. Gorbachev handed the 3- pound “‘little briefcase” contain- ing the launch codes and signals needed to authorize a nuclear strike to Marshal Yevgeny Sha- poshnikov, interim military com- mander of’ the new Common- wealth of Independent States, ac- cording to Gorbachev aide Andrei Grachev. 1991 > \fGorbachev: Soviet leader goes out with his empire Mr. Gorbachev used his final appearance of his vacated presi- dency to lament the decision by 11 former Soviet republics to wipe the Soviet Union off the map after 74 years of tightly cen- tralized power. _ “The policy prevailed of dis- membering this country and dis- uniting the state, which is some- thing I cannot subscribe to,” Mr. Gorbachev declared. _“T am concerned about the fact that the people in this coun- try. are ceasing to become citi- zens.of a great power, and the consequences may be very diffi- cult for all of us to deal with.” For millions of Russians wor- ried about the price and avail- “ability of basic food stuffs, Mr. Gorbachev’s exit failed to create anything like the great drama that seized the United States when Richard M. Nixon resigned as president in 1974. Only one of the four Moscow TV stations car- ried his 14-minute resignation address. As Raisa Kulikovskaya, a 43- year-old salesclerk, put it as she waited to board a Moscow sub- way, “Thanks to him, people like Yeltsin have come to power.” Mr. Yeltsin began to take over Mr. Gorbachev's final role, that of military commander in chief, earlier in the day. He did 80 by cropped that soldiers of vie will leg two regions on the southern fringe of the former Soviet mono- lith now plagued by ethnic strife. The removal order will bring thousands of Russian draftees back from the former Soviet re- public of Georgia, where 30 have died in a power struggle this week, and from the Armenian en- clave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, where hundreds have died over the past three years. On the economic front, the Russian president said he plans to push ahead with his plans to “liberalize” Russia’s consumer prices on Jan. 2, a draconian step aimed at moving quickly to a free- market economy. The move is ex- pected to triple overnight the price of meat, milk and most oth- er necessities in state-run food stores. But Mr. Yeltsin will try to cushion the impact by raising the minimum wage and pensions. “We have to undertake some unpopular measures, which the leadership of this country hasn’t had the courage to take in the past seven years,” Mr. Yeltsin said, in an obvious reference to the departed Mr. Gorbachev. In contrast to Mr. Gorba- chev's gloomy exit lines, Mr. Yeltsin told a CNN interviewer, “We're sick and tired of pessi- mism, which we’ve had over the past few years. The people here are weary of pessimism, and the share of pessimism is too much for the people to handle. Now they need some belief finally.” Mr. Gorbachev — the last of eight leaders chosen by the Com- munist Party since it seized pow- er in 1917 — reportedly plans to head the Fund for Socio-Political Research, a think tank he created after the August coup. “T won't hide in the woods,” he told a CNN interviewer. Mr. Yeltsin told the Russian Parliament that Mr. Gorbachev will retire with a government pen- sion of 4,000 rubles a month — a 24-carat parachute by the old So- viet standards but only $40 at the current tourist rate of exchange. Mr. Yeltsin said leaders of the 11 former Soviet republics that make up the new Common- wealth of Independent States have also agreed to give Mr. Gor- bachev an apartment, a dacha in the country, two limousines, 20 security guards and free medical care at the modern medical clin- ics once reserved for the Com- munist elite. In his farewell address, Mr. Gorbachev took credit for intro- ducing free elections and for ending “the mad militarization” that had badly deformed the So- viet economy. “The totalitarian system has been eliminated, which prevent: ed this country from becoming a prosperous and well-to-do coun- try a long time ago,” he said, “A breakthrough has been effected on the road of democratic changes. Free elections have be- come a reality.” He also took credit for trying. to reform the economy during his tenure, which began in 1985, but acknowledged that he and his Communist predecessors neyer did enough. “This country was suffocat: ing in the shackles of the bureau; cratic command system,” jhe said. “Doomed to cater to ideolo- gy and suffer and carry the oner: ous burden of the arms race, it found itself at the breaking point, “All the half-hearted attempts, all the half-hearted reforms, and there had been a lot of them, fel through, one after another,” The decision by the republic leaders to let Mr. Gorbachev re; tire as a public personage was,a first in the history of post-1917, Moscow transitions. All previous Soviet leaders either died in of- fice or were forced out. In justifying Mr. Gorbachev's generous retirement package; Mr. Yeltsin told the Russian Part liament: ms “It was: important to break the ruinous tradition which has existed here for a long time — the leader of the country quit his post, left politics and social activ- ity, went into oblivion, and ther was either reburied when he died or at least was stamped into the mud.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 26, 1991 (Continued) \f"

Some of the Moscow shopping scenes sound as if they might have been vignettes from “Ten Days That Shook The World,” the description of life in St. Petersburg in 1917 by author John Reed. “For milk and bread and sug- ar and tobacco, one had to stand in queue long hours in the chill rain,” Mr. Reed wrote about the last days of czarist Russia. “Coming home before dawn, I have seen the tail of the queue beginning to form before dawn, mostly women, some with babies in their arms.” In several food lines visited this week, women seemed to out- number men by more than two to one. “Most women work at offices, where it is easier to slip out and stand in lines,” explained Mari- na Shurova, 43, an engineer. “Men are mostly working in fac- tories on the outskirts of the city, where it is harder to get away.” productive waits in weeks. While Empty-handed wait One of the few lines where men predominated was a queue to buy cigarettes. Here, Stanislaw Sharkuto, 27, was standing proof that Russian males, too, are capable of en- durance. “I waited two hours in this line yesterday, and then the ciga- rettes ran out,” Mr. Sharkuto said. “Before I left, the salesman said there would be another truckload in the morning. So I came back at 8 o'clock, and I have been waiting for four hours.

But now the situation should be different.” Ms. Maksimova waited three hours in line, then nudged her way out of a food store with a tri- umphant smile. “Today I am really happy,” Ms. Maksimova said. “Now I have a present I can give to my grandchildren for New Year’s Day. Butter is the best present- you can give these days.” She was clutching 1.1 pounds of butter.

On the first day of post-Soviet history, that put Dmitri Potapenko in an even bleaker mood. “T regret that this day has come,” said the 31-year-old aeronautical engineer vis- iting Red Square. “I regret it for this ing that anything had really changed. “My point of view,” he said, “is that democracy is good but sausages are better.” Interior Ministry Sgt. Nikokai Gor- bunov, 30, part of the honor guard protect- ing Lenin’s Tomb, broke out of a daydream to answer a reporter’s question — an act of glasnost no guard would have dared a decade ago. “T have been just dreaming about hav- ing a good hunting rifle,” said Gorbunov. “Now I believe I will soon be ableito have one. The Russian flag should be above the Kremlin. It is a good ‘sign.” One who did know he had seen history unfolding was Potapenko. For him, the change was as vivid as if he had lost a relative. The first time Potapenko visit- ed Red Square, he said, Lenin’s Tomb was so crowded that he and his fellow second-graders had to line up at 4 a.m. Back then, in 1967, you knew who was boss —it was Leonid Brezhnev, And you could be sure the floors of the Lenin Mausoleum would be gleaming clean. On Thursday, the morning after Mikhail Gorbachev stepped down, Potapenko put on his dyed fur hat and his fake fur coat and came to Red Square again. He was in Mos- cow on a business trip and guessed it might be his last chance to see Lenin’s Tomb before it is closed. Potapenko didn’t even have ‘time to compose his thoughts be- fore he was passing almost face-to- face with Lenin’s putty-like visage inside his mausoleum.

A few minutes later he was out in Red Square, next to the red brick Kremlin wall that holds the tombs of the saints of communism. Potapenko looked down at the stone plaque with gold letters spell- ing the name of the late Aleksei Kosygin, who was Brezhnev’s Number 2 man when Potapenko first came to Red Square. Then he glanced sideways at the stone busts of past Soviet leaders Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Cher- nenko, Josef Stalin and the others. “Take Russia before the Revo- lution and compare it to what we have now,” he said. ‘There have been a lot of positive changes.” Red Square was not the only place where people went to mourn the death of the Soviet Union. Tanya, 35, an engineer from one of Russia’s ethnic autonomous re- gions, chose to visit the Tretyakov Gallery, across the Moscow River. The Tretyakov is one of the purest surviving symbols of pre- revolutionary Russia —a_ collec- tion of church paintings from four centuries when czars ruled Russia. “TI came here to say goodbye to Old Russia, to what we used to consider as our mot ierland,” Tan- ya said. “I feel sorry today for all the efforts people invested to get dif- ferent parts of our country togeth- er. So now we are all going back to the initial stage when we were all separate. “T feel sorry it happened.” For most Muscovites, the day after the Soviet Union ended was just another day.

His statement was one of sever- al omens portending a difficult ses- sion on Monday when the 11 presi- dents of the Commonwealth of Independent States convene in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. One prickle point is whether Russia or Ukraine should inherit the former Soviet Black Sea fleet and its home port at Sevastopol in southern Ukraine, where scores of cruisers, nuclear submarines and other warships equipped with hun- dreds of tactical nuclear torpedoes, depth charges, missiles and other warheads are based. The most valuable of the Black Sea ships, the aircraft carrier Ad- miral Kuznetsov, has slipped from Kravchuk’s grasp, the news agency Tass reported Friday. It said the big carrier — the only one in the former Soviet Navy that could han- dle modern fighter jets — docked Thursday in Murmansk, Russia, near northern Finland. Another disputed point on the agenda for Monday’s talks is how to formulate one or more oaths of allegiance for members of the 3.7 million-strong Soviet army, which is one of only a few major Soviet institutions which have not been dismembered. Defense ministers of the 11 for- mer Soviet republics signed a draft agreement on oaths of allegiance at their preparatory meeting in Moscow on Wednesday and Thurs- day. Ukrainian officials have draft- ed an oath to uphold their nation’s independence that they expect to administer soon to most, if not all, of the 1.5 million Soviet troops still on Ukrainian territory. The 11 defense ministers also reached three other tentative agreements on related defense is- sues, including the creation of a council of defense ministers, which THE ASSOCIATED PRESS a na es The prize of the former Soviet navy, the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, is docked in the Russian port of Murmansk. would presumably discuss nuclear weapons issues. As important as the military questions are to the outside world, they could get pushed aside as the commonwealth presidents grapple with a more pressing bread-and- butter question that also divides Russia from Ukraine. Russian President Boris Yeltsin and a cadre of young Western- oriented advisors are determined to end Communist-devised price controls throughout Russia on Thursday, causing overnight in- creases of fourfold or more on almost all consumer goods. Kravchuk leads a bloc of small- er republics pressing to delay or cancel Russia’s huge price changes, fearing that the market force of higher prices in Russia will suck the supply warehouses bare in their republics as winter is closing in. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar told worried Russian parliamentarians Saturday that ending artificial price ceilings was the only way for Russia to reach a free-market economy. Muscovites, on what they feared would be one of the last shopping days before the price es- calation, waited in long lines at state stores for butter, milk, cab- bage, vodka, champagne and other provisions for the coming New Year’s Eve holiday.

        "ocr_text": "Vodka becomes ‘hgqumd currency, but supplhy’s tigetat By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — As the ruble col- lapses, Muscovites have hit upon a new form of hard currency: pints of vodka. “People keep vodka in stock to use as liquid currency,” says Dmitr! Shmidrik, 40, a clerk in a scientific laboratory. “I have more than 20 bottles at home, and I don’t drink at all.” The reason: A repairman will yawn if you offer 20 rubles to get your car fixed or your ceiling plugged. But if you offer a bottle of vodka, the job gets done. Hoarding by ordinary people such as Mr. Shmidrik as well as big-time liquor speculators-has caused what many Russians call a scandalous shortage of their national drink. New Year’s Eve is supposed to be the cheeriest, most liquid night of the year in Moscow. Yet nearly all state liquor stores have been sold out of vodka for weeks. To buy vodka now, people pa- tronize numerous small private markets that spring up in vacant lots and oni street corners. There vodka often is available, but the price is about 80 rubles for a half-liter (about a pint). That is a week’s wages for a typical office worker. Shortages of glass, alcohol The few times vodka appears in state liquor stores, a bottle costs only 10 rubles. People line up for hours in 15-degree cold to buy one bottle. (At tourist exchange rates, 10 rubles is worth a dime.) One factor behind the vodka shortage is that Russian glass factories haven’t made enough bottles. Too late, liquor stores be- gan imposing a bottle recycling system, but the vodka factories still are short of bottles. Why? Several years ago, some _ of the bottle factories were closed as part of then-President Mikhail 8. Gorbachev's anti-alcoholism campaign. This summer, some remaining plants broke down for lack of spare parts. Then there was the shortage of raw alcohol. Usually, alcohol is supplied in abundance to the Moscow vod- ka factories by distilleries in Be- larus, Russia’s neighbor to the west. But this year Russian col- lective farms held back on grain deliveries to Belarus, provoking Belarus to halt alcohol ship- ments to Moscow. Fewer drunks sighted With all Russia’s other prob- | lems, no one has bothered to col- lect statistics on whether the Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 30, vodka shortage has reduced drunkenness. But if a reporter’s random impressions mean any- thing, there seem to be fewer drunks on Moscow’s streets than | there are on the streets of Wash- ington — a clear reversal since a decade ago. At Moscow’s biggest vodka factory, the chief executive, Viadi- mir Yamnikov, said last week that the bottleneck in bottles has been broken and alcohol has started flowing again from Belarus. Mr. Yamnikov says his plant, Kristall — which also makes Sto- lichnaya for export — is turning out half a million bottles of vodka a day under the Moscovskaya la- bel for Moscow drinkers. On paper, that should be enough to supply all the vodka Muscovites are entitled to drink under the government’s vodka rationing system. Yet he says it isn’t nearly enough to meet the demand. “This panic buying began in August,” he says. “People are us- ing it for trading, not just be- cause people drink vodka from morning until night.” ‘It’s total corruption’ He accuses the Moscow City Council's ‘trade committee of system and diverting some of the vodka to places unknown. “Unfortunately, rationing cards are being used for a second time in some way,” he says, “I am sure the vodka we make is going somewhere, but I have no idea what they [the trade committee] are doing with it. It is out of my competence.” Mikhail, 41, a night watch- man waiting in a vodka line, says he knows the answer, “It’s total corruption. Big people are sell- ing it to the speculators.” Igor, a driver, says he is.get- ting around the problem by brewing “moonshine” out of wa- ter, yeast and sugar. One pint of his home brew from his stainless steel contraption will get his car fixed just as readily. as a pint of factory-made vodka, Igor says. The only problem is that Mos- cow also is pinched by a sugar ‘Shortage. In fact, many believe it has been aggravated by a sharp increase in home brewing to overcome the vodka shortage. At the Moscow City Hall, Aleksei Taraskin of the city’s ‘consumer market department’ says the city is trying special holiday measures such as dis- tributing vodka to workers at fac- tories. But he says there is no way to meet the demand. 1991 \f"

Anastasia Sadovskaya, 78, spent New Year’s Eve waiting in a food store in hopes of buying anything edible to put into her plastic food satchel. Like most of Minsk’s 2 million inhabitants, Mrs. Sadovskaya was desperate Tuesday to accumulate whatever she could before consumer prices increase four- or five-fold later this week. Minsk’s 3-week-old role as seat of the new Commonwealth of Independent States has not al- tered the lot of most Belarus- sians. In fact, some grumble that Belarus’s leader, former Com- munist Stanislav Shushkevich, has been over-eager to please his commonwealth partners by ship- ping too much of their winter food supplies to Moscow. Mrs. Sadovskaya started to say that today’s food shortages are the most grievous she has ever seen in Minsk. But then her thoughts warmed to the hearty rice soup and milk that had been her meal the previous day. “We are poor, but I have suf- fered worse things than this,” she said, jutting out her chin. “I have survived the war.” _ Mrs. padovekaya was a young housewife, ed to a truck driver and with a baby son, when Hitler’s Panzers rolled into Minsk in 1941. During the chaos of the 1,100-day Nazi occupation, she fled to a nearby village with her son, losing track of her husband. Pe She remembers walking back through downtown Minsk after a Red Army assault drove the Ger- mans back from the city in 1944. “It was like an empty field,” she remembers. “All the houses were in ruins, and people were dead under the ruins.” _ In another section of the food store, Tamara, a 40-year-old clerk who said she was afraid to give her last name, was spending her day off waiting in a three- hour line for beef. “We are buying everything we can lay our eyes on; everyone is doing it,” she said. “People are even causing bread shortages by buying up bread to fry it and save it for the winter. People are be- coming cruel and evil in their ea- a to find some products to uy.” She expects that store shelves will fill up with food when the New Year's prices go into effect — and that the food will disap- pear again in about a month. “That’s what happened the last time they raised food prices.” Tamara said her family has a Minsk hag a thousand- year background as history's doormat. small food stockpile at home, in part because her grandfather just died and the family was able to save some food from the state- allocated funeral ration.

We will make do with vodka.” Minsk has a thousand-year background as __history’s doormat. Founded in 1067, it dominat- ed an ancient north-south river trade route linking the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Peace and prosperity lasted less than 20 years: In 1084, invaders from Po- land demolished Minsk, leaving behind “not a single body nor a single beast” alive, according to an old chronicle. Over the next muennium, the river Svisloch, Minsk’s water route, became unnavigable, and invaders swept through with dis- mal regularity to sack the city: the Tatars in 1505, King Charles XII of Sweden in 1708, Napoleon in 1796 and Hitler in 1941, Acquired by the Russian czars in 1793, Minsk and its sur- roundings were fenced off ad- ministratively by Moscow as a “Pale of Settlement,” the only place in the Russian empire ‘ where its millions of Jews could pursue the bittersweet lifestyle portrayed in the mustcal comedy “Fiddler on the Roof.” = But in 1881 a wave of po- groms swept Jewish quarters of Minsk and other cities, sending hundreds of thousands of Jewish families fleeing, mainly to the United States and Palestine. But thousands of Jews remained in Minsk, only to be slaughtered by the invading Nazis. Of the 140 synagogues func- tioning in 1917, only one or two are now active.

        "ocr_text": "Sticker shock in Moscow By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT oscow — Aeroflot more than tripled its air fares Wednesday, and Moscow supermarket workers were ordered to work late into the evening to triple and quadruple the prices on food shelves before the stores open today. Ordinary people waited like patients in a den- tist’s chair with no painkiller. Today brings them the heaviest jolt of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin’s historic experiment aimed at extracting commu- nism and replacing it with a profit-driven economy. “Who invaded us and made up these prices?” demanded Vla- dimir Galitsin, 49, a la- borer on his holiday from Moscow’s biggest meat factory. Mr. Galitsin spent New. Year's afternoon vainly trying to buy a loaf of white bread. He learned that panic buy- ing had cleaned out the state-run bread store in the Prolitarsky neigh- borhood where he lives. His neighbor, Var- Lhe vara Bebzova, a 78- year-old widow, settled foraloafofbrownbread © = — a staple whose price triples from 60 kopecks to 1.8 rubles today. The new bread price will translate into only © _ two pennies at the tour- ist exchange rate. But that increase was stiff enough to persuade Ms. Bebzova to swear off all shopping for the next few weeks, at least until she gets a promised increase in her 107-rubles-a-month pension. “T have several sacks of potatoes resting on my balcony and some cabbages behind my door,” she said. “I think I can survive on that for about three months.” Though most price increases take effect today, consumers will have to wait until about Jan. 10 to get their first installment of the Russian govern- ment’s promised doubling or tripling of minimum pay, pensions, student grants and army salaries. — Mr, Galitsin spoke in amazement of seeing a box of spaghetti for 15 rubles in a private shop around the corner — compared with the accus- tomed price of 1 ruble in the state stores. He ventured that once Mr. Yeltsin frees prices, it won't be long before a box of spaghetti costs 15 rubles everywhere. And from the skimpy details the Yeltsin government has announced so far, no one could prove Mr. Galitsin wrong. Official television said price ceilings will go up “from three to four times” today on such essential commodities as meat, baby food, bread, butter, salt, matches, sugar, gasoline, vodka and cooking oil. Everything else — presumably including spa- ghetti — can rise as much as people are willing to pay. Mr. Yeltsin’s price package, which also in- cludes wholesale land reforms and sales of govern- ment property, officially kicits in today. But at the downtown office of Aerofiot, reservation clerks were already charging higher rates by midafternoon Wednesday. : Aerofiot supervisor Svetlana ‘Urtchenko said the price of a ticket from Moscow to St. Peters- ‘burg had jumped from 43 to 129 rubles — up threefold overnight. For flights outside the Rus- sian republic, she said, the in- “| crease is steeper. A ticket to Kiev, capital of newl dent Ukraine, costs 248 rubles — 5.S times the old price of 4S ru- bles. The fare to Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, jumped. from 98 rubles to 392 rubles — four times the old price. That was a foretaste of the scale of other price increases that will start spreading today among the 290 million people in Russia, ‘Ukraine, Kazakhstan and most of the other former Soviet republics.

We are totally dependent on our sup- pliers.’ Even at 28 rubles, a Big Mac would be an almost unimaginable blowout for the mass of Russians living in working-class neighbor- hoods such as Prolitarsky, the district named for Marx’s “‘prole- tarian’”’ masses that is a _ half- hour’s drive from the onion- shaped domes of the Kremlin.

Private store burned, looted The real question is how he can survive on honest work, said bakery employee Anatoly Golos, 24, a Prolitarsky resident who works a double shift of 96 hours a week to support his wife and two sons. “You should steal something — that’s the only way to survive the way things are,” he said. Asked what tempted him, he pointed to one of the small, pri- vately operated food stores two blocks from his apartment that offer plentiful stocks of food at much higher than the govern- ment-set prices. “TI think that’s a good one,” he said. ‘“‘They have something you can steal.’’ He said he isn’t the first to get this idea: Another pri- vate store in the neighborhood burned down recently and its contents were looted. Mr. Golos said he spent New Year's Eve helping unload 12,000 loaves of bread to stock the shelves of Bread Store 767 for an expected morning rush on the last day of 60-ko k bread. “People bought out all the white bread in half an hour that should last a whole day. People were buying eight -loaves of bread. I couldn’t believe it. It looked like panic buying.”’ Anger at Yeltsin Even some who could afford higher prices expressed rage at the prospect. In part it was be- cause Mr. Yeltsin, a_ self-de- scribed democrat, is imposing the decision with minimal expla- nation and even less democratic participation. At the same bread store, 46- year-old Alexander Andreyev, a math teacher in a scientific re- search .institute, predicted “all sorts of social unrest soon.” “On Aug. 19 I was outside the White House [the Russian Par- liament building) blocking for’ Yeltsin,” he said. ‘Now I am strongly against %he people around Yeltsin. The empire is destroyed. We are well on our way to the total destruction of Russia as well.” At the state-run grocery store across the street — whose 150- yard-long food case was 99 per- cent empty — the manager said he was keeping his staff late Wednesday to mark up prices by “three to four times” by morning. He said his chief bookkeeper was meeting at a Moscow munic- ipal building with an official of the city’s trade council who would give the store its final price list. Official appeals for patience Not everyone was mad at Mr. Yeltsin. Farther away from food stores, it was easier to find an op- timist. Viadimir Grimalsky, for one, spent the afternoon strolling in the renown cemetery outside No- vodevichy Monastery, where Russian writers Gogol and Che- khov are buried, along with for- mer Communist leaders. “I believe in a bright future for Russia,” said Mr. Grimalsky, a 40-year-old accountant, paus- ing by former Soviet leader Ni- kita Khrushchev’s tombstone. “We live in_a (really at country. It is rich in mineral re- sources. Our people are very tal- ented. The current crisis was the result of silly decisions by previ- ous leaders, and we can over- come them.” Similarly, on evening televi- sion, Mr. Yeltsin’s 35-year-old deputy prime minister for eco- nomic affairs, Yegor Gaidar, ap- pealed for patience so that the eco- nomic plan will have time to work; He warned that if the Russian government is forced to resign because of the unpopularity of “price liberalization,” then it wil} probably be followed by a “non+ democratic government.” ; Mr. Gaidar criticized one of Mr. Yeltsin’s potential challeng- ers, Russian Vice President Al- exander Rutskoi, a retired Soviet fighter pilot who has publicly questioned freeing prices. Mr. Rutskoi has also made fun of Mr. Gaidar and other young aides té Mr. Yeltsin, calling them “the kids in pink trousers.” ' Asked about Mr. Rutskoi, Mr. Gaidar responded in a television interview: “His criticism is not quite honest. Nobody likes a gov- ernment which  unfreezeg prices.”” — 4 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 2, 1992 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": " Russians, Ukrainians swallow big price jumps Consumers pay triple, quadruple for ‘essentials’ By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — “What can we do about it?’ Vera Fralova, 66, sighed after paying four times the old, subsidized price for a box of heartburn pills. Her sullen _ resignation seemed to typify the reaction of the 200 million people in Russia and Ukraine after their govern- ments let prices rocket upward Thursday in their momentous experiment in building profit- run economies. Across Moscow, meat clerk Nina Vlasova, 55, looked at her empty meat cases and said she expects a new shipment of high- er-priced beef and pork soon. “We haven't had any meat for seven days,” she said. “People will hold off buying for a few days to eat what they have in stock. But then what can they do about it? They'll buy it.” At a gasoline station, drivers found one sign that read, ‘Prices increased by three times.” Anoth- “er sign announced, “No gasoline.” ‘+ Overnight, Muscovites found that bread, birth control pills, tea ‘bags, sugar, milk and bread had tripled and quadrupled in price.

Even in Moscow, the full brunt of the price increases didn’t register Thursday, with many stores — including the huge GUM department store — closed for post-holiday breaks. At stores that did open, lines were shorter than before the price increases, and it was easier to find white bread to buy. There were even a few bar- gains. Though milk prices tri- pled, one Moscow state super- market brought smiles to a line of children by selling off its in- ventory of ice cream bars for the old 80-kopeck price. And a state fish store was charging the old price for a new load of fresh fish called broad- heads, which swam in a tank as customers lined up with plastic bags. At most stores, virtually the only prices that were marked up immediately covered about a dozen “essential” commodities on which Russian President Bo- ris N. Yeltsin had set higher ceil- ing prices. His purpose was to shield pensioners and other low-income people from even sharper in- creases if he had wiped out all price protections. But what hap- pened on the first day of price de- control was that prices for his few “essential” commodities jumped immediately, while nearly évery other price re- mained unchanged. Neither fish nor ice cream was on Mr. Yeltsin’s “essential” list. And because the store man- agers hadn’t yet figured out what to charge, they stayed with the old prices. Managers of big state stores, who rose mostly through the ranks of the Communist Party, were groping with their new role as midwives in the birth of an economy of competition and profit. In Russia, Mr. Yeltsin left it up to them to set new prices, restricted by top limits for his “essentials.” Inga, the middle-aged man- ager of Moscow’s Vastiana Square supermarket, who de- clined to give her last name, told a reporter of a phone call she got Thursday morning from the head of an former Soviet state farm sin’s program, it is up to manag- ers like Inga to bargain. “We were talking about what price to set,” she recounted. “He suggested 45 rubles. I said we couldn’t pay that much, but how about 40 rubles? The guy said he would call back. He said he didn’t know how much his chick- en feed was going to cost.” Once Inga negotiates the new wholesale price, she will be enti- tled to tack on a markup of up to 25 percent, according to a front- page article in Thursday’s Izves- tia newspaper. She sets the final price, since chicken is not listed as an “essential” commodity. On Russian evening televi- sion, Agriculture Minister Victor Khlystun warned consumers that they should not expect the higher prices to end supermarket short- ages any time soon. Russia’s 1991 harvest ‘“com- pletely failed,” he said, adding that the nation cannot expect to become self-sufficient in agricul- tural products until 1995.

The Israeli expulsion order at least temporarily disrupted Plans to resume Mideast peace negotiations Tuesday in Wash- ington. Palestinian delegates an- mounced they are suspending their participation in the talks. However, a Palestinian with ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership said there was a strong possibility that the negotiators would travel to Washington by Monday and would not long delay resumption of talks. *“‘We have urged Israel at the highest levels to reconsider and to rescind its decision,’’ State De- partment spokesman Richard A. Boucher said Friday, after an- nouncing that the U.S. govern- ment ‘‘strongly condemns”’ the deportations. The Israeli government said Thursday that it would deport the 12 Palestinians from the oc- cupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in response to the killings of four Jewish settlers since October, when the peace talks opened. The most recent was a settler killed in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. Israel has deported 67 Pales- tinians since the uprising against Israeli occupation began four years ago. Most of the 12 selected for deportation are suspected of involvement in radical Palestin- ian groups, but Israel has not ac- cused any of them publicly of Participating in the four killings.

At the same time, he criti- cized Israel’s deportation deci- sion, Mr. Boucher also said the U.S. government condemns the Wednesday killing of the Jewish settler and expressed concerned about a rise in violent actions against Israelis. **Those who have carried out these acts of terror and murder against Israelis are quite simply enemies of peace,’’ Mr. Boucher said. ‘‘At the same time, we be- lieve deportations are a form of retaliation and are not a remedy, nor are they a deterrent to vi- olence.”’ Palestinians quickly respond- ~~ ed to the deportation orders by” announcing that their negotia-~ tors would not leave for Amman, , Jordan, as planned on Friday.

        "ocr_text": "Farms face chaos amid price hikes im Russia Workers just keep shoveling manure By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Miamontovo, Russia — Put yourself in the place of assistant dairy manager Taisiya Sudairi- kova, who is trying to make sure Gorky state farm’s 3,000 cows get milked and fed every day while her costs are spinning like Pinwheels. Since her boss, the dairy di- rector, went on vacation last month, she says she has had to deal with: & An eightfold increase in the cost of feed grains. & A sixfold increase in fertil- izer. & The quadrupling of the cost of veterinary medicines. &> And now, the last straw, the Price of farm machinery will Probably increase eight times. Educated in a provincial agronomy school and a rural Communist bureaucrat for the Past 22 years, Ms. Sudairikova in the last few days had to forget her. upbringing and roll the dice. Since the big excitement when they brought in milking machines in the 1970s, things haven’t changed very rapidly at Gorky state farm. Though it is but SO miles northeast of Mos- cow, its pine-fringed fields and wooden workers’ cottages could be from deepest rural Russia. But now, thanks to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin’s vol- ley of economic decrees, the farm and others like it are marching double-time in the vanguard of a revolution they never wanted. “We still milk our cows; we still shovel our cow dung,’’ said Payroll clerk Nina Guseva, one of the farm’s 900 employees. ‘‘*The situation is uncertain now, but we still keep on working.’’ Before the year is out, the country’s state and collective farms will not only help to deter- mine whether the cities go hun- ery — their workers must also decide whether to abolish the farms entirely and split the lands The Associated Press Russian shoppers in a St. Petersburg dairy store line up Friday to buy butter, which recently tripled in price. into private plots. - On Thursday — the day Mr. Yeltsin wiped away generations of Communist-inspired price controls Ms. Sudairikova raised the farm’s wholesale milk Price by a nervy 845 percent. **“Frankly, we were not pre- pared to make such an important decision,’’ she said. ‘‘But we had to do something. We had to make a decision; we were just forced to. We are just a link in the chain.’”’ On Friday, she was tending the 23,S00-acre government- owned farm from an _ office equipped with an old adding ma- chine and an abacus. Sharing the cramped space are the farm’s chief veterinarian and a plaster bust of Lenin. She said she and the other state farm directors calculated their new price by adding up all of the huge cost increases, throw- ing in a little cushion and praying that the customer didn’t walk away from the deal. *“We put the price at 7 rubles a liter, but we know that if there isn’t any demand, tomorrow we might have to come down to 5 ru- bles,’’ she said. The wholesale milk price her farm is demanding of the milk bottler in the nearby town of No- ginsk is more than three times as high as the new ceiling price of milk in retail food stores throughout Russia. - Gorky state farm produces 10. to 1S tons of milk a day. Ms. Su- dairikova would like to be able to assure the Russian consumer that her farm is going to produce more milk in coming months. But like most cattle farms in the former Soviet Union, this one expects to be short of feed grain. in the next few months. That probably means the cows will yield less milk. Ms. Sudairikova would also like to help her workers get more wages than the government wants to pay. The salaries of her milkmaids, which are on a par with schoolteachers, have just tripled to 1,500 rubles a month. To Ms. Sudairikova, that won’t be nearly enough to afford the enor- mous consumer inflation she sees coming. When her boss gets back next week, the next big. decision is whether the workers will want to take Mr. Yeltsin up on his decree offering state farm employees the right to vote to become a Western-style holding company. Or they could even vote to split the farm into private parcels. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 5, 1992 \f"

Georgian television reported that Mr. Gamsakhurdia fled south toward the neighboring republic of Armenia, which had offered him asylum. Armed opponents, who have threatened to put him on trial, gave chase in a military heli- copter, but by nightfall his entou- rage was believed to have escaped to an Armenian resort town.

The Parliament appar- ently caught fire when one of Mr. Gamsakhurdia’s ammunition storerooms was hit by a shell. Monday - Georgian novelist Gia Lo- madze, 38, said he saw opposition national guardsmen firing their rifles into the air around 11 a.m. to celebrate Mr. Gamsakhurdia’s departure. But he said the volleys stopped soon, as people recalled that at least 73 people have been killed in the fighting and several hundred wounded. “The whole affair makes me feel like I am in a house where someone has just died, and, at the same time, a‘child has been born,” Mr. Lomadze said. Mr. Gamsakhurdia, a long- time anti-Soviet dissident who was elected president with 70 percent of the vote 15 months ago, lost favor with Georgian in- tellectuals and rival politicians after he restricted their access to television, arrested some of his opponents and built what critics called a “cult of personality.” The president and his entou- rage had withstood sporadic pounding of the bunker. Only Sunday, he told Western inter- viewers that he was willing to put his continued rule to a popular referendum. When reporters Sunday sug- gested to Mr. Gamsakhurdia that he might be forced to flee, he re- plied, “It’s impossible.” Now he has become the first leader of a former Soviet repub- lic to be elected freely and then deposed militarily. In recent days, his base of support among workers had seemed to erode. Few of his orig- inal backers seemed willing to take to the streets against gun- man loyal to his opposition. Mr. Gamsakhurdia held out for two weeks in a steel-doored basement about 10 yards under- ground that had served as a cafe- teria and dining hall for the Par- liament, said Gamsakhurdia loy- alist Medea Tushmalishvili. The area is about half the size of a basketball court. Georgia’s deputy foreign minister, Nodar Gabashvili, also a Gamsakhurdia loyalist, said Saturday in Moscow that the building was made to withstand an atomic bomb on orders of the late Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, a native Georgian. It was con- structed with the forced labor of German prisoners of war, Mr. Gabashvili said.

At the frontier post, Geor- gian border guards waved cars along in both directions with only cursory checks. Just north of Tbilisi, a single roadblock staffed by rifle-toting civilians checked traffic in and out of the city. It was a remark- ably casual performance, given that Mr. Gamsakhurdia was still being hunted. After dark, there were few cars or people in Tbilisi’s streets and no air of celebration. Geor- gian television was broadcasting the evening’s highlight, a Christ- mas Eve service at Sioni Cathe- dral, the center of the Georgian Orthodox Church, about two miles from the flaming Parliament.

        "ocr_text": "Gunfire again breaks up protest march in Georgia By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Tbilisi, Georgia — Georgia’s victorious mili- tary council promised late Tuesday to keep crack- ing down relentlessly on protests, only hours after its plainclothesmen fired to scatter a peaceful crowd of loyalists demonstrating for exiled Presi- dent Zviad Gamsakhurdia. At least two of the 3,000 unarmed protesters were hit by slugs from Kalashnikov rifles when about a dozen security men, some wearing black woolen ski masks, fired at the crowd as the march- ers were about to leave for home on a subway. “I ordered it,’’ declared Dzhaba Ioseliani, a member of the provisional military council of the South Carolina-sized former Soviet republic. ‘And I will keep on doing it. I will do it tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, because there is a state of emergency in force.” The council has banned all rallies in Tbilisi, the capital. Mr. Gamsakhurdia, who on Monday was bliast- ed from his bunker beneath the Parliament build- ing and fled to neighboring Armenia, reportedly spent Tuesday seeking refuge outside the former Soviet empire. The Tass news agency, quoting Georgian television, said Mr. Gamsakhurdia in- tends to fly to the West. In Washington, visiting Armenian Foreign Min- ister Raffi Hovannisian said Mr. Gamsakhurdia has not been granted safe haven in Armenia. “But he will not be forced to leave,” Mr. Hovannisian told reporters after a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III at the State Department. KGB files at ousted leader’s home Also Tuesday, an official of the Georgian prose- cutor’s office began searching through official doc- uments taken from the basement of Mr. Gamsak- hurdia’s family villa, explaining that he was look- ing for evidence of crimes. A reporter allowed into Mr. Gamsakhurdia’s half-acre family compound on a Tbilisi hillside found the leather-jacketed prosecutor leafing through thousands of documents that had been carted out of the basement. Many files bore the stamp of the Georgian branch of the Soviet KGB. The prosecutor had lined up a dozen bulging boxes for preliminary inspection in the exiled pres- ident’s back yard, next to a wire chicken coop where a dozen of the family’s chickens scratched for food. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 8, 1992 The Associated Press An opposition gunman fires at support- ers of ousted Georgian President Zviad Gam- sakhurdia demonstrating Tuesday in Tbilisi. At least some of the thousands of papers were the KGB’s raw files on Mr. Gamsakhurdia during the decades when Communist authorities were ha- rassing him as an anti-Kremlin dissident. Somehow Mr. Gamsakhurdia had obtained them and stored them in his cellar. Other papers were financial records from the KGB’s finance de- partment and from the local Soviet Interior Minis- try branch. One KGB document volunteered by the prose- cutor was a report by a psychiatrist who examined Mr. Gamsakhurdia for headaches in 1957, when Mr. Gamsakhurdia was about 16 years old. Other files bore dates as recent as 1988. Mr. Gamsakhurdia’s wife, Manana, fled the house about two days ago, and within several hours thieves drove off with three carloads of video equipment and other family possessions. Mr. Gam- sakhurdia’s white Volga sedan was also stolen. The shootings at Tuesday’s rally marked the second time opponents of the deposed leader have fired on a peaceful pro-Gamsakhurdia demonstra- tion. On Friday, at least two people were killed and 25 were wounded. \f"

Nonetheless, analysts have cautiously predicted that the talks that have been least pro- ductive, those between Israel and the joint Palestinian-Jorda- nian delegation, are likely to move forward. Negotiations early last month stalled over the Palestinian-Jor- danian demand to split their del- egation in a ‘“‘two-track” ap- proach, so that Israel would talk separately with Palestinians and with Jordanians about issues rel- evant to each group. That would Promote an image of the Pales- tinians as an independent entity. Israel has accepted the dual- track approach but refused such. a definitive split in the delega- tion. In the previous round of talks, negotiators never made it past a corridor couch in the State Department. *‘With every caveat possible, | I can say it looks likely that some formula will be worked out to permit the negotiators to make it into the negotiating room,’’ said Robert Satloff, an analyst at the Washington East Policy. ‘That, in itself, would be a major achievement.’’ None of the three — Israelis, Palestinians nor Jordanians — ac- knowledged on arriving in Wash- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 12, 1992 Institute for Near ington that they had new propos- als or changed positions, but all expressed hope of quickly getting down to substantive talks. The Syrians and Jordanians did have substantive discussions with Israel during last month’s talks. . This new round of talks opens on a note of irritation after the Arab delegates caused almost a weeklong delay. They briefly boycotted the peace talks to pro- test Israel’s decision to deport 12 Palestinians in retaliation for the killings of four Israelis. The Arab negotiators decided ‘to rejoin the talks after the U.N. Security Council adopted a reso- lution strongly condemning the deportations. The Arabs arrived toward the end of the week, while the Israelis got to Washington in time for the talks to begin last Tuesday, as the United States had proposed. Israelis have been quoted variously as saying they want to end this round of talks by Wednesday or the _ following Monday, which would not leave much time for negotiating. An Is- raeli spokeswoman said late last week that no decision had been made on how long they would stay. Israelis want to move the talks closer to the Middle East, saying they need to be close to top leaders for consultations. If the Israelis and the Pales tinians do get past the couch an into serious talks, they alread are close to agreement on a num ber of issues related to self-rule for the 1.75 million Palestinians living under Israeli occupatio in the West Bank and Gaza Strip An interim agreement shift ing new authority to Palestinians is believed within easy reach, talks do not get hung up in more difficult issues such as Israel’s continued settlement-building i the occupied lands. \f"

        "ocr_text": "In one small city, Georgian war has been pretty tame By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Gori, sef Stalin’s birthplace, Alexei Mikanashvili has taken off from his job in an apple-sorting fac- tory so he can strap on a Kalash- nikov rifle and drive around town all night, doing his part to stave off a civil war. “The confrontation in Tbilisi could easily grow here into blood vendettas,” says Mr. Mikanash- vili, 39, a burly former standout on the Gori soccer team. What has happened in Gori, a town of 70,000 in the apple-grow- ing country 60 miles west of the Georgian capital, helps to ex- plain why few signs of a Geor- gian civil war have materialized, despite predictions of nation- wide turmoil by supporters of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia before he was deposed. Now, the 30-foot-tall bronze statute of Stalin in the town square is probably smiling an imperceptible smile. Here in Gori, at least, people who fa- vored Mr. Gamsakhurdia, the former anti-Communist dissi- dent, never had time to raise a peep before the town was taken over by allies of the new military regime that ousted him. On Monday morning, the day Mr. Gamsakhurdia fled into ex- ile, Mr. Mikanashvili got togeth- er with about 20 friends in Gori’s social club, a Communist-era edifice still called the Palace of Culture. — Herein Jo- | A legacy of Gorbachev Most were there as represen- tatives of the nationalistic societ- ies that have flowered in Georgia since Mikhail S.

Mr. Mikanash- vili represented the David the Constructor Society, a kind of Knights of Columbus that is named for an ancient Georgian Proclaiming themselves Gori’s Military Council, they left the Palace of Culture and set off across the town square, many of them wearing brown leather avi- ator jackets. During the fortnight Mr. Gamsakhurdia was under siege, some of Mr. Mikanashvili’s friends called to pledge support for the self-proclaimed Georgian Military Council, the coalition organizing the military attacks on the Parliament building, where the president was hiding. And on Monday, when they heard Mr. Gamsakhurdia had fled the presidential bunker in. Tbilisi, Mr. Mikanashvili and his friends decided it was their duty to take over the Gori Town Hall. A coup without bloodshed The town’s prefect, or mayor, Eduard Giunashvili, knew the president’s opponents would be coming for him. They would have to approach his fortress-like of- fice by crossing the wide open town square, underneath the statue of Stalin. As head of Mr. Gamsakhur- dia’s loyal forces, should Mr. Giunashvili fight? The prefect saw 20 rugged-looking Geor- gians heading toward his office, and he quickly decided it was no time for heroics. “I handed them my official stamp, the keys to the safe, the documents,” he said. ‘‘We shook hands, I went home and that was it.” Vladimir Duliashvili, 40, whc teaches tractor repair at a voca- fice without any shooting.” Mr. Mikanashvili took on the, less glorious job of organizing roadblocks and night patrols, perhaps because his military duty was in a tough Soviet Interi- or Ministry unit assigned to guard forced labor camps in northern Russia. tional college, took over Mr. Giun: ‘We'll avoid a civil war’ ashvili’s office and its two-line telephone. He set out to run the town’s day-to-day affairs as head of the Gori Military Council. It was kind of a grab for the jugular that Stalin might have admired. And it worked: Nobody has dared say they have no right to run things. “All the people here consider the [anti-Gamsakhurdia] opposi- tion as the real democrats,” Mr. Duliashvili said. “And the best evidence was that we took this of- Since their impromptu take- over, the Gori Military Council has formally subordinated itself to the national Military Council ’ in Tbilisi, which is sending direc- tives by telephone.

Palm Beach Post - January 12, 1992 > Did we win the peace in Iraq? ‘A year after the Gulf War began, many people feel that victory was declared before the fight was finished. By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — One year af- ter the United States led an unprec- edented alliance of nations into battle against Iraq Jan. 16, 1991,a troubling sense of incomplete vic- tory clings to America. There is not the angst and anger left by the war in Vietnam. Ameri- cans hold few doubts that the ene- my in the Persian Gulf War was worth fighting, or that American troops acquitted themselves well. But the land is powdered witha faint residue of bitterness that vic- tory did not produce better fruits. The same Saddam Hussein who provoked the war by invading neighboring Kuwait in August 1990, remains cocooned in layers of absolute power in Iraq. # ““Yes, we should have gone in and did what we did. The only thing is we should have gone all the way - and did away with Hussein and his henchmen,’’ said Edward Eric Rae, commander of American Le- gion Post 67 in North Miami. Polls show more and more Americans agree with him. Hussein’s country still is isolat- ed by economic sanctions and is diplomatically shunned in the com- munity of nations. But these penal- ties strike hardest at 18 million Iragis who are cut off from the world and are finding it increasing- ly difficult to feed and care for their families. It is not Hussein who is hungry. Then there is Kuwait, the oil barrel that the United States and 27 other countries united to liberate from the clutches of Hussein’s sol- diers. The old Kuwaiti regime re- turned to rule seemingly unchas- tened by its experience, unwilling still to adopt the values of freedom and democracy that at least par- tially propelled the battle on its behalf. Since the war ended Feb. 28, after six weeks of aerial bombard- ment and five short days of war- fare on the ground, disturbing dis- closures have mounted. There were the 35 U.S. soldiers mistakenly killed and 72 wounded by ‘“‘friendly fire’’ from their own comrades in arms, a fact that the Pentagon hid for months — even from the families of the dead. Add the postwar discovery by U.N. inspectors that Iraq was far advanced in building nuclear weap- ons, an alarming development that had escaped the most sophisticated spy network in the world. Bedrock support for the war itself has not eroded. Pollsters ask- ing Americans whether they think it was a mistake to get involved in the war consistently have drawn more than 70 percent saying it was not. But a series of polls asking Americans whether they believe the cease-fire was ordered too soon before Hussein was toppled from power — show most Ameri- cans wishing our troops had gone on to Baghdad. This uneasiness shows not only in polls but on talk shows and in resolutions such as the one Ed Rae heartily endorsed at the American Legion annual convention in Phoe- nix, Ariz., in September. It calls on President Bush and the United Na- tions to apprehend Hussein and his fellow rulers in Iraq and to try them for war crimes — whether they are in custody or not. Yet the objectives of the war, as stated in U.N. resolutions, by the politicians and by the generals, were clearly limited to driving Iraqi troops out of Kuwait and restoring the legitimate Kuwaiti government. The accomplishment of simply stopping Hussein also should as- suage Americans who may ques- tion what was gained by the war. Laurie Mylroie, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College and co- author of a recent book about Hus- sein, pointed out that the Iraqi leader controlled more than 20 per- cent of the world’s oil reserves once he sucked up Kuwait. Even had he not edged into Saudi Arabia, as American intelligence predicted he would do, Hussein would have “threatened”? another 20 percent of the reserves lying under Saudi de- serts. Plus, she noted, the Iraqis likely would have finished building their own nuclear weapon had the United Nations stuck merely with an em- bargo. Under the cease-fire agree- ment, the United Nations is dis- mantling the nuclear complex it uncovered in postwar inspectiors. DESERT STORM A YEAR LATER For all the high-tech weaponry unleashed in the Persian Gulf War, fire wreaked some of the worst damage after Iraqi troops set hundreds of oil wells afire: @ AT ITS WORST, the plume of smoke from the 732 burning or damaged wells stretched a distance equal to that from New York City to the Florida Keys. The last fire was extinguished Nov. 5. @ ABOUT HALF of Kuwait is covered with soot or oil lakes. Charles Pilcher, a Kuwait-based wildlife researcher, said oil trapped and killed thousands of birds migrating from Europe last autumn. @ THE SPRAY of unburned oil from the wells was carried by winds across Kuwait and far out over the Persian Gulf. Much of the oil settled in the gulf’s fish-rich waters. @ FIRES GENERATED an estimated 500,000 tons of air pollution a day, ranging from unburned oil that fell from the sky like rain to exotic carcinogenic chemicals, such as benzo(a)pyrene. But it could take years for accelerated disease rates to show up. @ BLACK RAIN was reported in Iran, and acid rain attribut- able to the fires has been noted from India to the Mediterranean. But Environmental Protection Agency stud- ies showed the smoke did not contain elevated levels of heavy metals, as had been feared. @ SOME SPECULATED the smoke plume would bring the equivalent of a ‘nuclear winter,’ in which the planet would cool down because of the blocked sunlight, and vast amounts of crops would die. For that dire scenario, the smoke would have had to risen to the stratosphere, about 35,000 feet, to be spread worldwide, But the smoke rose FILE PHOTO Kuwaiti oil wells burn after being set alight by Iraq. only about 15,000 feet, because soot absorbed water and fell to Earth quicker than expected. WHEN IRAQIS vandalized the Sea Island Loading Termi- nal, an oil slick estimated at 3.5 billion barrels — about 1,000 times bigger than the Exxon Valdez spill — caked hundreds of miles of coastline and clogged delicate salt marshes. Much of the oil fell to the bottom of the sea, where it smothered sea-bed life. It is expected to form tar balls that will wash up on shore for years.

CIA chief Robert Gates told a Senate hearing that Iraq’s secret germ-warfare projects sustained considerably less damage from the six-week allied onslaught than its nuclear and chemical warfare programs. His estimate was the clearest acknowledgment by the Bush ad- ministration that Operation De- sert Storm did not knock out all of Saddam’s potential for deliv- ering horror weapons on Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and other neighbors. “We are having some diffi- culty finding them,” Mr. Gates said of Iraq’s remaining Scud missiles. After the war, U.N. inspec- tors found and destroyed a small number of unused Scud war- heads already filled with liquid Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 16, 1992 warheads could theoretically be launched atop some of Iraq’s hid- den Scud missiles to disperse the biological agents at such long- distance targets as Tehran, Ku- wait City, Riyadh, Tel Aviv or the Israeli nuclear weapons complex in the Negev Desert. The CIA chief’s assessment diverged sharply from the judg- ment presented a few days after Mr. Bush ordered a halt to the al- lied air and ground attacks. In his March 6 televised speech to Congress, the president said: “Tonight in Iraq, Saddam walks amidst ruins. His war machine is crushed. His ability to threaten mass destruction is itself de- stroyed.” In his reappraisal Wednesday, Mr. Gates said. that while Iraq’s nuclear, chemical and biological warfare factories were “severely damaged,” critical weapons-mak- ing equipment survived — along with Saddam’s determination to build superweapons. “In our opinion, Iraq will re- main a primary proliferation threat at least as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power,” Mr. Gates said. “The cadre of scien- tists and engineers trained for these programs will be able to re- constitute any dormant program rapidly.” The CIA director said much | of Iraq’s “hard-to-get production equipment” for making nerve gas and other chemical warfare agents was removed from fac- tories there and “hidden” before the allied bombing attacks be- gan. He said even though the al- lied bombers heavily damaged Iraqi chemical warfare factories, the chemical-making equipment survived the war and “would be available for reconstruction.”’ “If U.N. sanctions are re- laxed, we believe Iraq could pro- duce modest quantities of chemi- cal agents almost immediately, but it would take a year or more to recover the chemical warfare capability it. previous}; :en- joyed,” Mr. Gates told a Senate Government Operations Com- mittee hearing. Mr. Gates testified that the al- lied air attacks devastated much of Iraq’s secret complex for mak- ing bomb-grade uranium, impos- ing a more telling setback on Saddam’s aspirations to make nuclear bombs. Even so, he said, the CIA esti- mates that Saddam is capable of rebuilding his nuclear weapons program in a “few” years be- cause “the technical expertise is still there.” Mr. Gates said that, prior to the allied bombing campaign that began last January, Sad- dam’s regime did have an offen- sive biological warfare program encompassing both the manufac- ture of biological agents and the design of weapons to disperse’ them. “The biological weapons pro- gram also was damaged, but crit- ical pallipusenit for it, too, was \f"

Few Iraqis mark war's start Some blame Saddam, while many are bitter at' destruction by U.S. By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT » Iraq — Still weighted by oner- ous international sanctions and the lingering impact of massive allied bombardment, Iraq mustered only a few mild demonstrations Thursday and early today to mark the first’ anniversary of the start of the Gulf War. © At 2:30 a.m. today, exactly a year after the first U.S. bombers flashed across the Bagh- dad skies, about 2,000 Iraqi youths marched through the streets carrying anti-American banners. Government-controlled media had predicted a turnout of 100,000. “Last year at this time, the first bombs came to Baghdad, and we came to tell [Presi- dent] Bush and the other armies that we are still strong,”’ said Majid Mohsin, 30, an engi- neer who joined chanting marchers in the pre-dawn demonstration. Others said they came out in the middle of the night to protest continuing economic sanctions against their country. President Saddam Hussein’s regime used the occasion to flaunt its continued defiance . Of the international community, portraying Iraq and its people as victims of First World oppression. The Iraqi National Assembly celebrated the anniversary by awarding the “Order of the People’”’ to Saddam. “‘We have sensed the Iraqis’ desire to express their pride in their faithful son and struggling leader,” ex- plained Speaker Saadi Mehdi Saleh.

Why did he stop?”’ Outside the rubble of the old city airport, which has undergone enough repair to begin occasional domestic flights, this young father said many Iraqis felt the 42-day Gulf War ended unfinished. “They said the troops were only 120 kilo- meters [75 miles] away. Twenty-four hours and they would have taken Baghdad,” he said. But other Iraqis expressed hurt and an- ger that a nation they had admired wreaked such destruction here. “See what you did to us? Are you proud of — yourselves?” a man who did not identify him- self asked several foreign reporters. Curious and friendly at first, the man held quiet anger in his eyes when he learned’ the foreigners were journalists and included: Americans. While outward signs of the war barely in- trude on Baghdad’s urban environment to- day — a few remnants of bombed buildings and bridges fringe traffic-laden streets and open shops — the population still is paying for Iraq’s takeover of Kuwait in exorbitantly higher prices and scarce commodities, in un- employment and ill health. International trade sanctions, combined with war damage that disrupted basic ser- vices providing electricity, clean water and sanitation, continue to affect the bulk of Ira-’ qis who are not wealthy enough to absorb in- flated costs. That is part of the theme of the govern- ment’s observance of this first anniversary — that aggression still continues through, trade sanctions it says are causing food and’ medicine shortages. The other part is that Iraq will keep on struggling. “Traq will not give in to the whims of its enemies,” Saddam said in a speech made public Thursday. In a country that normally pays loud and public honor to its war dead, the anniversary strangely failed to include any memorial to the soldiers killed in the operation dubbed “Desert Storm” by the American-led al- liance. One focus on sanctions Thursday was the’ opening of a photographic exhibit called “They Kill Childhood, Don’t They.” It dis- played 64 gruesome pictures of babies and small children, mostly suffering from malnu-| trition or diseases, such as polio and pneu- —monia, that normally can be treated with proper food and medication. “TI want the exhibit to be like a scream against the embargo,” said photographer Ta- lib Chewkher, who visited hospitals and clin- ics around Iraq as part of the Ministry of In- formation project. He said he usually takes tourism pictures. \f"

Saddam admits military loss but claims a moral victory By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Baghdad, Iraq — Giving a religious rationale for Iraq’s devastating loss in the Persian Gulf War, which began one year ago, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein proclaimed Friday that his people were moral victors and promised they would regain the splendor of ancient Baghdad. For the first time, he admitted that Iraq lost the military battle. But he promised to rebuild “‘an in- fluential military capability.” Saddam’s televised speech to the nation fit the pattern his regime has adopted in this anniversary week: Talk positive and minimize defeat. “God allowed the believers to have less equip- ment and forces, while the infidels had more and superior equipment,” Saddam said. ‘“‘That gap was evidence of God’s will. . .. The courage of that bat- tle is the victory of faith against infidelity.” Discounting “materialistic calculations” of win- ning and losing, Saddam said the Iraqis, as faithful Islamic believers, “carried out a clear victory.” The enemy did not dare to attack Iraq, he said, until mounting an alliance of some 30 nations. Saddam acknowledged that Iraq was suffering as a result of international economic sanctions, but he put it in a historical perspective. He elevated the situation by comparing it to the days when Islam’s Prophet Mohammed was driven from the holy city of Mecca 1,400 years ago and iso- lated by a similar embargo by non-believers. Mo- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 18, 1992 hammed’s teachings are the basis of the Muslim faith. Saddam also told the Iraqi people that they will achieve great prosperity if their efforts are backed by a great faith, promising to re-create Baghdad as it used to be, “a shining center for Muslims and Arabs.” Baghdad once was the capital of an Islamic em- pire stretching from the Middle East to Europe. The speech was cast from molds used often by Saddam, although it did not carry the usual belli- cose imagery threatening to incinerate enemies. Clearly aiming to create a positive mood, Sad- dam avoided mention of losses. He never spoke the word “Kuwait,” whose invasion by his troops led to the Gulf War. Nor did he talk about the thousands of Iraqi troops who perished in battle, and whose numbers still have not been made public. While the anniversary ‘observations have steered clear of mentioning specific military losses, they have emphasized the damage done by allied bombing to civilian facilities and the subse- quent reconstruction achieved with notable speed for a country under economic sanctions. At 2:30 a.m., the hour the first bombs of the war homed in on Baghdad targets one year ago, Iraqi television showed videos of civilian destruction from all over the country. Several Iraqis said this was the first time the bombing film had been shown, including footage of the laser-guided bombs that blew up a bomb shelter and killed an estimated 400 civilians Feb. 13. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Exhibit in Iraq struts progress made since war Some segments of society still suffer By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Baghdad, Iraq — The com- puter in an old downtown castle simulates an Iraqi petrochemi- cal factory being bombed by U.S.-led allies during the Per- sian Gulf War. A message from the pro- grammer, a young woman named Betoula, flashes after each simulated hit: “This is ag- gression against humanity.” Computer simulations like this — along with photographs, scale models, graphs and charts — have been put on display here one year after the start of the Gulf War in a presentation appropriately named “The Steadfastness and Defiance Ex- hibition.” Housed in a sprawling, tur- reted complex, that once was the seat of government, it shows the war’s destruction in Iraq, but it also expresses anger and claims an impressive degree of repair. Officials said at the exhibit’s opening that 75 percent of the: nation’s power grid has been | restored, as well as 85 percent. of its oil-refining industry and: four-fifths of the bridges. knocked out by allied bombs. Only six months ago, it was predicted that eight-hour blackouts would continue in cit-: ies indefinitely. Now, blackouts seldom disturb urban areas. “Perhaps this war, instead of affecting the morale of Ira- qis, has increased their determi- nation to rebuild better than be- fore,” said Samir Halabiya, a chemical engineer with the Min- istry of Industries, who helped assemble the exhibit. “Iraq is an old country, very proud of its history. It is not the first time it was attacked,” he said. “In spite of that, it came back up. Always Iraq will come up.” A sense of victimization per- vades the government exhibit, and there is no hint that Presi- dent Saddam Hussein made a moral, diplomatic or military mistake in ordering the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The occupation was followed in early 1991 by a U.S.-led counterattack, sanctioned by the United Na- tions, which drove Iraqi troops out of the Kuwaiti emirate. Reaching the limit Despite the record of prog- ress running through the exhibit, there are signs that Iraq is ap- proaching the far edge of its ca- pabilities. It has reconstructed largely without outside help, be- cause international economic sanctions preclude it from buy- ing the spare parts and equip- ment it would import to service ' an industrial network that is mostly foreign-made. The sanctions are to stay in place until Iraq has complied with U.N. Security Council de- mands to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction. With much of its industry de- mands to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction. With much of its industry de- signed and built by Japanese, French, Americans, Germans, Russians and others, Iraqis have had to cannibalize and copy and in some cases simply stop short of finishing repairs. Jawad Qadem, a chemical en- gineer from a_ petrochemical complex in Basra, said rebuild- ing has required “some modifi- cation” because of spare parts problems. For example, a bomb- damaged chlorine and caustic soda plant is only 30 percent completed because Iraqis have not yet been able to duplicate some of the equipment imported from the United States. “We're trying now to study the cells and build them here,” Mr. Qadem said. At a scale model of a phos- phate complex, where more than a dozen flashing red lights marked each bomb blast, an en- gineer explained that the alumi- num fluoride plant cannot be re- built until the blockade ends. While impressive, the exhibit reflects only the segment of Iraqi - society that has been the focus of renewal. It does not take into ac- count the daily struggle of mil- lions of Iragis who barely can af- ford inflated prices for food and other necessities. Nor does it show the plight of the Kurds and Shiite Muslims who staged rebel- lions just after the war and in many cases still are refugees in their own country. Iraqis interviewed at the ex- hibit, professional men and women who themselves have worked on the reconstruction, clearly are proud of what they have accomplished. “We ourselves can’t under- stand how we did it,” said Ali Mohsin, an engineer at an elec- tric power plant in Najaf. ‘After the aggression and after the op- position [uprisings], all of Iraq worked 20 hours a day.” Most of these people also said they think the United States at- tacked their industrial base be- cause Iraq was growing too strong. “They want to stop our prog- ress,” said Venus Abdullah Had- dad, a draftswoman who works for a group of textile factories.

Envoys from Japan, Germany and Kuwait are coming here too, along with some from not-so-rich countries such as Poland and Greece, which worry about chaos and fascism in their neighborhoods if the post-Soviet gov- ernments collapse. Neutral Switzerland and the Vatican will take part as well. The State Department has refused to name the roughly 47 countries and seven in- ternational organizations that will partici- pate in the “coordinating conference on as- sistance’”’ that is being mounted this week by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. But calls to Washington embassies dis- closed that Mr. Baker’s guest list has already left one nation feeling bruised: the Israelis aren’t coming because they weren’t invited. Some of their oil-rich Arab rivals, including Kuwait and Qatar, did get a Baker invitation and will be here. “We understand it is a meeting for coun- tries with big checkbooks,” said one Israeli diplomat, confirming that Israel received no invitation. ‘‘We believe there is more than one way to help, but apparently the criterion was financial.” Other nations left out But evidently not the only criterion. Oil- producing countries on bad terms with Wash- ington, including Iraq, Iran and Libya, aren’t coming to Washington despite their wealth. Proximity was not an automatic ticket ei- ther. China, which shares the longest border with the former Soviet Union, isn’t coming. Nor are the three Baltic states, which broke from Moscow last year. Mr. Baker said he would send invitations to “the advanced industrial democracies,” the members of the Persian Gulf War coali- tion and central and Eastern European states, along with international organizations such as the World Bank. The meetings Wednesday and Thursday are guaranteed to spread sparks: not only over whom the Bush administration chose to Americans may build model farm in Russia FROM OUR NEWS SERVICES Washington — A team of U.S. farm experts departed Monday for Russia, where they will explore opportunities for developing a model farm near St. Petersburg. Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan said the project is aimed at demonstrating U.S. agricultural exper- tise to Russian farmers. “American farmers lead the world in efficient food and fiber production,” he said. “If we are successful, this ef- fort can be of great value to the Russian people as they progress toward a mar- ket-based economy.’ The American team is headed by Keith Bjerke, administrator of the Ag- riculture Department’s Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. Team members will meet with Rus- sian officials and farmers to discuss the proposed model farm’s location, what commodities and livestock are to be produced, building and equipment re- quirements and processing and mar- keting opportunities. Mr. Madigan said the team also would work with Russian officials on assessing the ability of privatized farms in the St. Petersburg area to adopt technology and roe used on the model farm. invite, but also over what expectations the session is raising and over whether it is too late to do any good. First impression of democracy Against the backdrop of bread-price riots in newly independent Uzbekistan and raging inflation in Russia, the theme of the confer- ence is likely to be that the rest of the world had better do something — the sooner the better. “‘We don’t think it is wise to leave the peo- ple over there in a vacuum of any kind,” sail a German diplomat involved in planning the- conference. “If the population is confrontéd’ by misery and hunger as the first sign of Mm dependence and democratic development,. this would be a bad start. They might bey tempted to call for a strong hand.” t France has belatedly decided to send tip ministers, despite President Francois Mit-- terrand’s observation a fortnight ago that the: meeting is ‘‘a little bit superfluous.”’ Z Mr. Mitterrand dismissed the conferendin when Mr. Baker announced it last month,- saying European Community countries, which provide four-fifths of the aid to the for-- mer Soviet republics, had already héld “many conferences of this nature.” If the Washington conference does noth-— ing else, it will give Russia’s embattled presi- dent, Boris N. Yeltsin, a gesture of world sup- port to be played on Moscow TV news. 4 The meeting will also give the United States, Canada, Japan and the West Europe- ans a chance to talk about how to get food aid through the notorious bottlenecks at Russian ports and warehouses, so it can reach needy consumers. One of the main items at the conference, a German diplomat said, will be a discussion \"of\" whether NATO countries should use NATO military planes to deliver food and medicine’ directly to the worst-hit regions. The need is’ most likely to arise in March and April, he said, if people use up their winter food stock- piles and there is still no food on the shelves. Wealth, generosity may be key Beyond symbolism and logistics, the best hope for extra tangible help this winter may, well be some grand gesture by petroleum heavyweights Saudi Arabia, Brunei and Kuwait. : ‘ The Bush administration, facing elec- tions and a recession at home, would be stretched to give much more than the $3.75 billion in credits for grain purchases that are committed already. The West Europeans have their own budget squeezes. Kuwait, at least, seems primed to give. “We feel a commitment to support the new democracies,” said a Kuwaiti diplomat. “And remember, we gave the Soviet Union $1 billion under President Gorbachev.” <' Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 21, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Bush offers another SBOOO maillion to aid ex-Soviet republics By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE WASHINGTON — President Bush offered $600 million in new foreign aid to alleviate hunger and disease in the former Soviet repub- lics Wednesday. Opening a 47-nation conference on how to help the collapsed su- perpower, Bush challenged other nations to “seize the moment” to Signal their support to “coura- geous” new leaders like President Boris Y. Yeltsin of Russia. “The United States ... cannot and will not falter at the moment when these new states are strug- gling to achieve the very ideals that America was founded to pre- serve,” he said. Bush said the new aid would bring the American contribution to more than $5 billion, most of which is credits to buy American farm products. His pledge to ask Congress to appropriate an extra $600 million in technical aid this year was a sur- prise for the ministers invited by the State Department from Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. American aides had stressed that the session would not be a “pledging conference.” Dayton Daily News - January 23, 1992 In a follow-up speech, Secretary of State James A. Baker III hinted that some of the new money may go to hire Russian nuclear scien- tists who might otherwise be tempted to work in would-be nu- clear states such as Libya or Paki- stan. Baker said a team of American experts has been touring the for- mer Soviet republics this month to outline what he called a “brain gain” proposal. The purpose, he said, would be to find ways for sci- entists from American nuclear weapons laboratories to work with Russian nuclear scientists “to ad- vance scientific knowledge instead of design weapons.” Baker read a letter he received on the eve of the conference from Yeltsin promising to make sure any aid is fairly distributed. The 604 ministers and their as- sistants arrived in a stately proces- sion of about 150 limousines and vans. In one of the ironies of the chilly Washington morning, the limousine parade passed within a block of a site where about 20 Washington homeless people have lived for months on top of a side- walk heat vent. \f"

But one of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin’s closest eco- nomic advisors, Harvard eco- nomics professor Jeffrey Sachs, reacted sourly, saying the for- eign ministers failed to talk about the Russian government's most desperate need — billions in cash to help the republic end its hyperinflation and stabilize the ruble. “This was a conference in which they buried their heads in the sand,” said Mr. Sachs, who flew back from Moscow in recent days and was in Washington to lobby foreign ministers to give more than the humanitarian and technical aid advocated by the State Department. “They need dollars desper- ately,” Mr. Sachs told a group of . scholars, He said the Russian treasury was “totally drained of - foreign currency” when Mr. Yeltsin took over from Soviet President Mikhail §, Gorbachev in December.

        "ocr_text": "No weapon sacred in ‘peace dividend’ battle Sun Belt at risk: Southern and Western states, home to many Pentagon projects, face huge job losses. By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Even sacro- sanct defense projects like the Air Force F-22 Stealth fighter will be flung up for grabs this week as Congress and the Bush administration begin the biggest Capitol cat fight over a “‘peace dividend” since the end of the Vietnam War. In his State of the Union ad- dress Tuesday night, President Bush is expected to call for slashing plans to buy almost all next-generation planes, tanks, ships and missiles. Dozens of weapons initiated during the Reagan administra- tion’s buildup against the Soviet “evil empire’”’ would be held in- definitely in the prototype stage — and the F-22 advanced tactical fighter may well be among them. The Sun Belt states, which traditionally have enjoyed a hus- ky fraction of the nation’s high- paying civilian defense jobs, are at risk of suffering a high share of the layoffs. “We are going to have some cutbacks in Georgia, like every- where else,” Senate Armed Ser- vices Chairman Sam Nunn (D- Ga.) warned in a session with home state reporters. He added, “I hope we will have as light a burden as possible in terms of cuts, and certainly I want to make sure we are treated fairly.” Mr. Bush’s military budget will start a yearlong melee in which Congress will make the ul- timate decision on how much to cut the $291 billion Pentagon budget. With tens of thousands of jobs at stake in an election year, Congress will have.to balance whether to sacrifice the jobs of active-duty troops, reservists or assembly-line workers. Mr. Bush’s weapons cuts — coupled with his anticipated slices in National Guard and Re- serve forces — would shrink the Pentagon’s five-year, $1.2 tril- lion defense spending plan about 4.5 percent. That would yield a post-Soviet ‘peace dividend”’ of $7 billion in the next fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and $50 billion over the next five fiscal years. While stretching out weapons purchasing, the Bush budget will argue vehemently against sub- stantial cuts in the number of ac- tive-duty troops beyond those al- ready under way. And there has been no sign that Mr. Bush will call for large-scale base closings in this election year. For the first time, Mr. Nunn acknowledged that Georgia’s most promising defense contract, the Lockheed project to build the F-22 Stealth fighter in Marietta, now faces the prospect of a cut- ‘back. If that happens, the cuts also would affect dozens of sub- contractors, notably its engine plant in Palm Beach County, Fla. “T think it will survive,’ Mr. Nunn told reporters Friday, “‘but any program that costs a lot of dollars will have to come under scrutiny as to whether we need to do it as rapidly [as planned]. I think the question will come up on that fighter as to how rapidly we need to do it and how many: we need to buy.” Last year, before the final col- lapse of the Soviet Union, not a single lawmaker spoke out against the F-22 as its $1.6 billion development budget whistled through Congress. But now, even some pro-defense conservatives are beginning to line up against it, saying the Air Force ought to make do with its F-15 fighter, which ruled the skies in the Per- sian Gulf War. “I think we have the world’s best fighter now, and I don’t per- ceive any threat to it,’’ Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), the ranking Republican on the Senate De- fense Appropriations Subcom- mittee, said in an interview. “I think we should pursue a minimum rate of procurement [for the F-22], but not pursue any general replacement of the fight- er force itself, and see what evolves.’’ The president’s budget is also expected to call for: &» Putting on indefinite hold the Army’s plan to begin produc- ing its next-generation M1-A2 tanks at the Lima Army Tank plant in Ohio. By 1995, the Army had planned to spend $740 mil- lion a year to replace its M1-A1 Abrams tanks. > Curtailing the Navy’s plans to build a dozen more super-qui- et Seawolf attack submarines, each costing $2 billion, by the year 2000. & Cutting back, but not elimi- nating, the Air Force B-2 bomber. Mr. Stevens predicted that the president’s budget would set off “horrendous battles” between the four major House and Senate committees that have jurisdiction over military spending. These contests in committee will pit lawmakers pitching for next-generation weapons against members trying to revive older weapons the Pentagon has want- ed to cancel. Leading liberals, including Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Maine) and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), have called for cuts of $100 bil- lion to $210 billion in the $1.2 trillion spending planned over the next five years. Defense Secretary Dick Che- ney already is honing counterar- guments. After Vietnam, Mr. Cheney said, ‘‘we cut our forces too far, too fast, and we didn’t take care of our troops. What we got was a hollow force.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 26, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Festival extols Iraq's ‘moral victory, but security belies the hype ‘By Marcia Kunstel {STAFF CORRESPONDENT Baghdad, Iraq — Iraqis cel- -ebrated the first anniversary of ’.the Persian Gulf War this week- ‘end with the sound of music. _ The National Theater was ‘decked out in colored balloons sand festive paper streamers. The \" ‘National Symphony played in tuxes and gowns. A huge multi- -national chorale and a youth choir extolled President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi people and the Umm al Ma’arak — the “Mother of All Battles” — from a rotating stage that would be the envy of any world-class rock group. The five-day music festival, which will end Wednesday, stresses the government’s official anniversary theme: Iraq won a moral victory when it lost the Persian Gulf War, because it faced the most powerful collec- tion of armies ever to gather for a battle. Saturday’s opening concert was virtually a private party. Once singers from the chorale left their seats to go on stage, only a light scattering of people were left to watch and listen. The high offices of the re- maining spectators explained the lonely look. The government easily could -have produced a standing-room- only crowd, but the point was se- curity. Some things in Iraq just don’t mix, and some people don’t mingle. Some things that do mingle were displayed at the Exhibit of Steadfastness and Defiance, which chronicles postwar recon- struction by Iraqis. Among the models and pho- tos of radio towers and industries bombed by allied warplanes were models and photos of simi- lar structures that weren't bombed but were destroyed in the uprisings that exploded among Shiite Muslims in the south and Kurds in the north af- ter the war stopped. One chart showed that nearly half of major radio and television stations crippled in Iraq were damaged by Iraqi rebels, not by allied bombs. Photos of damage to mosques — some of the holiest shrines in the Shiite branch of Is- lam — during the abortive rebel- lion were displayed next to pic- tures of war-damaged schools. No effort is made in Baghdad to hide the fact that two large segments of Iraq’s population were dissatisfied enough with Saddam to lay their lives on the line. Instead, the millions of re bels are linked with foreign ene mies by describing them as foe equal to the Americans, British, Saudis and others. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 27, 1992 \f"

Shrinking the nuclear threat | Yeltsin matches Bush call for major weapons cuts - F-22 fighter scores win in budget Georgia-built jet gets funds boost By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The Air Force’s F-22 Stealth fighter came out a big winner in the new mili- tary budget Wednesday, with the Bush administration proposing an increase to $2.2 billion for the project even as two dozen other weapons were getting slashed. The biggest weapons cut- backs in the new budget were: >» The Navy’s Seawolf attack submarine, a super-quiet model that costs $2 billion apiece, will be canceled, saving taxpayers $17.5 billion by 1997, but hurting General Dynamics’ Electric Boat Division in Groton, Conn., and Newport News Shipbuilding in Norfolk, Va. > The Air Force’s B-2 Stealth bomber’s production line will be shut down after 20 planes, in- stead of the 75 the Air Force pro- posed last year. This would save $14.5 billion through 1997 and force future layoffs at Northrop’s California plant. >The Army will save $3.4 billion through 1997 by postpon- ing indefinitely the production of 1,292 Comanche helicopters, Defense Secretary Dick Che- ney said the fighter project cen- tered at Lockheed’s Marietta, Ga., plant “appears to be well in hand and moving forward with- out any significant problems at this point.” Asked why he wasn’t stretch- ing out the F-22 project at the same time he is Congress to chop funds for the Navy’s Seawolf submarines and the Army’s Comanche helicopters, Mr. Cheney replied: “T think it’s vital that we do what we have to do to guarantee that we'll always be able to main- tain air superiority over any fu- ture battlefield. The F-22 satis- fies those requirements.” Though the F-22 is still in the development stage, it emerged as the sixth-largest procurement project in the new $286 billion military budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. For the pre- sent fiscal year, the plane’s con- gressionally approved budget is $1.6 billion. Among the services, the Air Force came out on top with an in- crease from $80.2 billion to $83.9 By T. Elaine Carey and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Russian Presi- dent Boris N, Yeltsin pre- pared Wednesday to fly to Washington for what could be a historic conference at Camp Da- vid this weekend on shrinking the world’s bloat of nuclear warheads. In a_ nationally televised speech, Mr. Yeltsin pledged huge arms reductions just hours after President Bush made simi- lar proposals in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. Mr. Bush followed through Wednesday. unveiling a $1.52 trillion budget that would whittle $50 billion over the next five years from the amount he fore- saw authorizing the military to spend just a year ago. That would leave defense spending next year at $281 bil- lion — $9.4 billion less than en- acted for 1992 and $7.4 billion less than would be needed to stay even with inflation. Besides his arms reduction _ pledge, Mr. Yeltsin also declared that Russia will no longer aim its strategic nuclear weapons at tar- gets in the United States, thus re- moving hundreds of U.S. mili- tary bases from the Russian nu- clear targeting list. Only days ago he dropped all American cit- ies as targets in the Russian plan for nuclear war. Defense Secretary Dick Che- ney praised Mr. Yeltsin’s speech as a “very positive step forward” toward reducing superpower nu- clear arsenals and added, “We look forward to having the op- portunity to discuss that with him this weekend up at Camp David.” Gen. Colin L. Powell, chair- man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that if the Yeltsin and Bush arms cut proposals can be meshed, the U.S. stockpile of roughly 19,000 nuclear warheads can be reduced to 6,300 war- heads over a few years. Meanwhile, in an interview with ABC-TV to be broadcast Friday, Mr. Yeltsin pledged to increase by five times the pay of Russia’s thousands of nuclear weapons experts in an attempt to stop them from peddling their services overseas. The United States is concerned that they might go to Third World nations seeking to produce nuclear weapons. Mr. Yeltsin used his speech Wednesday to urge the world’s _ Please see RUSSIA, A4 > Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 30, 1992 > \fSU) DEFENSE BUDGET FY 1993: $286 < D> Budget proposal represents a $10 billion cut i ‘hctiole Spending from FY 1992, about a 3 percent decline. > Over next five years, another $50 billion oo Russia: Yeltsin to discuss disarmament with Bush > Continued from Al other nuclear powers — China, Britain and France — to join Russia in “all-out nuclear dis- armament.” He called for cre- ation of an international watch- dog agency to monitor dis- armament. Mr. Yeltsin said he had urged the leaders of Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the other for- mer Soviet republics with nucle- ar arms, to match Russia's moves. In all, the four states have about 30,000 nuclear warheads, CIA Director Robert Gates esti- mated this month. Mr. Yeltsin’s challenge to dis- arm set the stage for his most ambitious trip to the industrial- ized world since he replaced So- viet President Mikhail S. Gorba- chev as the most important lead- er for the West to deal with after the demise of the Soviet Union. He is to leave today to meet _ British Prime Minister John Ma- jor in London. On Friday he trav- els to New York to address the United Nations. However, the pinnacle of his trip will be his Saturday meeting with Mr. Bush at the president’s mountain re- treat at Camp David, Md. He and Mr. Bush will try to formalize some of their respec- tive proposals during their ses- sion at Camp David. White House spokesman Marlin Fitz- water, responding favorably af- ter Mr. Yeltsin’s announcement, said “it certainly sets the stage for very productive talks” be- tween the two leaders. Major elements of Mr. Yelt- sin’s announcement include: » Taking off alert status about 600 strategic land and sea- based nuclear missiles carrying a total of 1,250 warheads. The Pentagon believes the Russian republic has 1,035 land-based missiles, each carrying up to 10 warheads. In addition, Russia will eliminate 130 land-based missile silos. > Halting production of the TU-160 “Black Jack” and TU- 95MS “Bear” heavy bombers. Russia is estimated to have about Boris Yeltsin, Russian presi- dent, leaves to- day for the United States, where he will address the United Nations. 70 such bombers, while Ukraine is believed to have 30. > Ending production of long- range air- and sea-based cruise missiles. Russia also will not de- sign new cruise missiles and will destroy’ existing sea-based cruise missiles if the United States does the same. >» Dismantling the launching systems aboard six submarines - armed with nuclear missiles. Russia will cut by 50 percent the number of missile submarines on combat patrols and is pre- pared to stop such patrols alto- gether if the United States fol- lows suit. » Stopping production of warheads for land-based tactical missiles. Russia plans to elimi- nate one-third of sea-based tacti- cal nuclear weapons and half the ‘nuclear warheads for anti-air- craft missiles. Jet: Air Force gets hike in budget; Army takes big cut & Continued from Al billion. The Navy budget stayed approximately flat at $84.6 bil- lion, while the Army budget dropped from $67 billion to $63.3 billion. Overall, Mr. Cheney said the disintegration of the Soviet Un- ion will make it possible for the military establishment to get by with $9.8 billion less in the next fiscal year. One unexpected source of short-term savings will be a speedup in the plans to shrink the uniformed fighting forces. The new budget says total mili- tary strength vil drop another 237,000, instead of the previous- ly planned 179,000, by Sept. 30, 1993. As a result, the armed forces will bottom out at 1.6 million by late 1994, two years sooner than previously planned. This will mean fewer openings for fresh recruits, slower promotions and more pressure on servicemen and women to get out of the mili- tary before reaching their 20- year retirements. A senior defense official said the military services hope bonus- es will persuade 71,000 service people to leave voluntarily prior to retirement in the next 18 months. The restywould finish their enlistments or retire. The budget’s call for cuts of about 150,000 in National Guard and Reserve forces by late 1993 will draw resistance in Congress. While allowing the F-22 to proceed, Mr. Cheney announced ‘a tough “new approach to de- fense acquisition” that raised questions about whether the Lockheed-built Stealth fighter will go into full production in 1996, as the Air Force still plans. Mr. Cheney said that from now on, the Defense Department will “emphasize technology demonstration and _ prototype evaluation programs” and will buy fewer and fewer production- line weapons.

        "ocr_text": " Kennedy urges Pentagon to slash $50 billion more By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) led a Democratic charge Friday for deeper cuts in mili- tary spending, telling Defense Secre- tary Dick Cheney that he could safely cut another $50 billion from the Penta- gon’s $1.4 trillion five-year defense plan. Borrowing a tactic of Pentagon wit- nesses, Mr. Kennedy produced a graph as big as a subway poster depicting the ups and downs of military spending since World War II. He said it showed that while cele- brating the collapse of the Soviet threat, President Bush is devoting just as many inflation-adjusted dollars to preparing for war as did Presidents John F. Ken- nedy, Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. Nixon in the heyday of Soviet power. “We don’t have a hot war as we had in Korea or Vietnam, and we don’t have a Cold War,” said Mr. Kennedy. “So isn’t your budget, Mr. Secretary, really business as usual from now to 1997?” Mr. Cheney, flanked at the Senate Armed Services Committee’s witness table by his own pile of oversized charts, argued that the world’s continuing un- certainties make it too risky to shrink the military below the planned level of 1.6 million troops by 1995. “Obviously, there may be an un- bridgeable gap between us,” the de- fense secretary told Mr. Kennedy. The exchange amounted to the open- ing shots in a yearlong political fight that the Senate’s longest-serving veter- an, Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), called “the battle of the budget.” The Bush administration and nearly all congressional Republicans are mass- ing to hold the line around Mr. Bush’s new military spending plan, which would nip $50 billion — half of Mr. Ken- nedy’s proposal — from the money the Pentagon had been planning to spend through 1997. So far, Democrats appear split, with some pressing for a bigger “peace divi- dend” than Mr. Bush has offered and others fighting for unbudgeted military projects they favor. Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, “We exist to fight. We're not a social agency. We exist to go kick someone’s butt if neces- sary. I believe if you look like you can kick someone’s butt, most often it will not be necessary. Gentlemen, don’t lose this, don’t break this.” Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D- Ga.) also sounded critical of budget-cut- ting moves by some fellow Democrats, observing that some “seem to be basing the size of their proposed reductions on the latest public opinion polls.” He once again prodded Mr. Cheney to come up with more compelling logic to justify the budget to avoid a congressional “bid- ding war.” Mr. Nunn warned that even the Bush administration's budget would result a loss of 2 million defense-related i by 1996. “T hope that those who are proposing we go much further will also understafl what's already coming down the ae Mr. Nunn said. General Powell also warned of it creasing the jobless rolls. “Tf you cut the force structure, I'm giving you unemployment, and I’m giv- ing you unemployment among you! people who suffer with the highest rates, and I'm giving you unemployment tha’ 25 percent minority,” he said. * Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 2, 1992 \f"

The Iraqi government is con- tributing to what one diplomat called “the pauperization of the middle class” by refusing to accept U.N. Security Council conditions for selling oil, which would provide cash to import food and medicine. Even if President Saddam Hus- sein reaches an agreement on oil sales, the combination of war, re- bellion and 18 months of economic sanctions is likely to leave Iraq’s once modernizing economy in shambles for the foreseeable fu- ture. + Throughout the city, Iraqis who ehcounter the occasional foreign visitor say the U.N. economic em- bargo — rather than their own government’s recalcitrance — is making them suffer. '.’ “I need money. I need medicine. Ineed food, everything,” said Sa- mira Mohammad Murad, 35, a mother of five whose soldier hus- band was killed in the Gulf War. “I ask Mr. Bush to lift the embargo. When the embargo is lifted, the prices will go down.” She is a poor resident of Sad- dam City, a teeming suburb of mostly Shiite Muslims. Murad makes a small income selling pota- toes from a blanket on a garbage- strewn sidewalk, but even families with more money are having trou- ble. Few people spared A U.N. agency has discovered vitamin A deficiencies in an afflu- ent Baghdad neighborhood, indicat- ing a lack of milk and fresh vegeta- bles and fruits in the diet. Abdullah Zathi al-Kaysi, 52, is teacher who earns 400 Iraqi dinar: a month, placing him in Iraq’: middle-income range of 300 to 60( dinars. - “The biggest problem is the medicine and maybe milk for the children and other luxurious things, like shoes or clothes,” he said. » These are goods he used to be able to afford. A university student said his father had to quit his government job because he cannot get medicine for a heart ailment. This young man blames sanctions for his fam- ily’s worsening straits. He said Hussein was mistaken to invade Kuwait, which led to the imposition of sanctions nearly 18 months ago. But he held that Bush is making a second mistake by continuing the embargo now that Kuwait is free. The problem is not scarcity, but price. . The government’ spends $90 million to $100 million monthly to support its ration system, ac- cording to a well-connected Euro- pean diplomat. That provides basic food at token prices but only enough to last a family about 10 days each month. . For the rest of their needs, Iraqis must go to a new, favored class of marketeers who have been permitted an unprecedented free hand to provide what the govern- ment cannot. Iraq has virtually erased import taxes and trade con- trols, which previously had kept most international trade under the purview of government ministries, and has let prices soar. Hundreds of privately contract- ed trucks travel back and forth to Jordan and Turkey daily, sharing the roads with cars and vans of smaller-scale entrepreneurs who are becoming rich. One young Iraqi with military connections who frequently passes between Amman, the Jordanian capital, and Baghdad on trade mis- sions has done well enough to accu- mulate a stable of cars and several apartments. He said he spends be- tween 1,500 and 2,000 dinars each month just to maintain his family, excluding spending on luxury items such as his BMW. At least some of these imports are international contraband, ille- gal under the U.N. embargo prohib- iting everything but food and medi- cine to be sold to Iraq. Supplies of auto parts and tires come into the country to keep some Iraqis’ Japanese, German and American vehicles running, for ex- ample, but still not enough to make them widely affordable. A garage owner who said his parts are imported through Jordan cited exorbitant retail price in- creases: spark plugs that used to cost 200 fils, or one-fifth of a dinar, now sell for 27 dinars each, while tires are at least 14 times more expensive than they once were. The Iraqi government could al- leviate some of the worst suffering by accepting the Security Council’s resolution on Iraqi oil sales. It would allow Iraq to sell $1.6 billion worth of oil and use nearly $900,000 of the proceeds to buy food and medicine. The rest of the money would go toward repara- tions to Kuwait and other war- related costs. The oil sales, purchases of goods and then the distribution would be closely controlled by the United Nations, under conditions that Iraqi officials say are humili- ating and unacceptable. “U.N. officials will come to treat Iraqis like these hungry tribes of Chad and Ethiopia,” said one highly placed official who asked not to be identified. He also complained the condi tions would make oil sales cumber some and lengthy and would result in lower prices for Iraqi oil than competing oil on the market. “It is formulated deliberately to harm Iraq,” he said of the resolu- tion. “We totally reject that resolu- tion. It completely abrogates Iraqi sovereignty. It is a complete insult to the Iraqi population.” Talks progressing But he and ‘the media in Iraq characterized recent talks in Vien- na as making progress toward a compromise on the oil deal, and the official expressed some optimism that an agreement could be reached within a few months. The European diplomat said the Iraqi regime will finally agree to the plan when money runs too short to support the ration system and more important, to provide privi- leges and salaries to people critical to the regime: leaders of the mili- tary and the Baath Party. “If they refuse to export oil, that means they still have re- serves,” he said. “It’s a tactic right now to get better export condi- tions.” An East European diplomat agreed that Hussein will accept conditional oil sales “if he consid- ers the situation dangerous.” “To continue means to let the country be really destroyed,” he said, citing greater losses to come as major state-run industries re- main closed down, parts for re- paired power plants and communi- cations systems cannot be replaced or cannibalized any longer, and the economy distorts further on wildly inflated prices and the wads of Palm Beach Post - February 22, 1992 \f"

This unusual ‘peace divi- dend”’ for the Sun Belt is the brainchild of a Mesa, Ariz., businessman who figured a way the Russians could pay for pre- fabs worth hundreds of millions of dollars even when the ruble is almost worthless. The Russians have come prepared to barter some of Rus- sia’s immense timber supplies, along with scrap metal, in ex- change for the Arizona-made prefabricated houses, common- wealth air force Maj. Gen. Nik- olai Stolyarov, announced at a press conference Monday in Washington. General Stolyarov said the former Soviet armed forces ur- gently need at least 100,000 homes for officers being or- dered back to Russia from the former East Germany and the newly independent Baltic states. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 4, 1992 General Stolyarov credited Bennett B. McCutcheon Jr., president of a tiny Mesa trading company called Russport Ari- zona Inc., with the ‘“steadfast- ness’”’ needed to penetrate the former Soviet Union’s perva- sive bureaucracy and create the possibility of a barter deal. Mr. McCutcheon later said a three-way barter arrangement is ‘‘being seriously negotiated,”’ but he stressed that nothing is binding unless a contract is signed. “I don’t want to box anyone in, either myself or him [General Stolyarov],’” Mr. McCutcheon said, stressing that crucial details of a deal, in- cluding prices and quantities, remain to be agreed upon. Mr. McCutcheon said that depending on how many prefab units the Russians buy, such a barter deal could create 400 to 1,600 new factory jobs in Arizo- na and perhaps in other states. Mr. McCutcheon said the Russians are traveling to Phoe- nix this week to visit Cavco In- dustries Inc., the manufacturer that would make the modular homes to the Russians’ specifi- cations.

That was the thrust of three hours of congressional testimony Wednesday by Bush administra- tion nuclear experts just back from a sometimes frustrating trip to the former Soviet Union in search of ways to use American foreign aid to speed up its denu- clearization. “We were told that some weapons have already been disas- sembled into component parts,” Assistant Secretary of Defense James Baker Ill, secretary of state, says he'll seek deeper cuts in super- power nuclear arsenals. Stephen J. Hadley told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said senior Russian offi- cials also gave assurances that all tactical (short-range) nuclear weapons, which were deployed in all the 15 Soviet republics as re- cently as 1990, have now been consolidated into three republics: Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. By July 1, Russian officials plan to bring back to Russia all tactical warheads still in Belarus and Ukraine and “do not want our help on this part of the proc- ess,” Mr. Hadley testified. Mr. Hadley said the Bush ad- ministration is considering wheth- er to send the Russians high-secu- rity rail cars formerly used to transport U.S. nuclear warheads. They could be used when the Rus- sians get-around to removing big- ger strategic (long-range) war- heads from outlying sites. Mr. Hadley said the U.S. gov- ernment may also provide Amer- ican-made storage containers, which have sophisticated anti- tampering devices, to reduce the risk of theft while ex-Soviet war- heads are being transported. Earlier Wednesday, Secre- tary of State James A. Baker III told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that when he visits Moscow on Feb. 15-16 he will work toward reducing nuclear arsenals below the limits already negotiated in the wipe Arms Reduction Treaty.

Retooling for peace difficult, says ex-Soviet weapons maker By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — During the Cold War, Alek- sandr Zakbarov’s factory in St. Petersburg made detonators for Soviet artillery shells. Now it is making razors as well. “We were one of the lucky ones,” he told sena- tors who invited half a dozen executives from the Russian military-industrial complex to give a foretaste of the problems in converting U.S. de- fense plants to civilian production.

To take up the slack, the 120-year-old factory in Russia’s second-largest city makes home alarm systems, compressors and cassette players, in addition to razors. He earns the equivalent of $50 a month as di- rector of the factory. It belongs to the Russian Ministry of Ammunition and Chemical Warfare, which took over from a Soviet ministry when the Soviet Union was abolished in December. Even though the Russian public would proba- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 7, 1992 bly buy all the consumer goods his factory could turn out, Mr. Zakbarov has been forced to channel his products toward foreign markets. There is no shortage of demand in Russia, he said. Instead, the problem is a shortage of compo- nents to make consumer goods because other Russian factories aren’t interested in selling them for near-worthless rubles. “We still have a market that is really not a market,” Mr. Zakbarov told the Senate Armed Services Committee. “They [factories] can basi- cally do what they want to do.” His work force has slipped from 8,000 to 7,000 in two years and “we are going to have to lay off more people,” he said. Even so, he is still in business. Senators sympathized and tried to draw paral- lels with the plight of American defense workers and troops facing comparable cutbacks. “The Strategic Air Command is located in my state and we have had a 25 percent reduction in force,” said Sen.

Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Commit- tee. ‘‘Those are dollars that are not being used to train troops or buy what we need. We ought to close unneeded bases.”’ It was the first time a senior Bush administration official has acknowledged that it might be possible to make further trims in its new defense budget without damaging the national interest. President Bush used his State of the Union mes- sage to warn Congress against enlarging his pro- posed military cuts, saying, ‘““You must know my resolve: this deep and no deeper.’’ Speaking nine days later, General Powell said, “If left to my own devices and without the obvious constraints that exist, I would try to submit another base closure package tomorrow. “‘We haven’t taken down enough base structure. We still have an Army base structure left over from the Indian wars. We still have a Navy base struc- ture that’s a combination of World War II and some of the more recent initiatives.’’ He disagreed with a proposal by Rep.

No new base closings were included in Mr. Bush’s budget, in deference to congressional reluc- tance to consider the unpopular topic of base clos- ings during election years. A Powell spokesperson, Capt. Robin Crumm, said the general ‘‘is not going to name names’”’ of domestic bases he considers superfluous, and is not prepared to estimate potential budget savings.

        "ocr_text": "Stabilizing ruble critical but risky By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The White House and Congress, which resisted sending milk and meat to hungry Russians, are about to grapple with a much more costly and risky proposi- tion: creating a multibillion- dollar fund to prop up the shaky ruble. A ruble stabilization fund, supplied by wealthy nations, is a top priority of Russian planners trying to turn a Com- munist economy upside down and create a free-market system. Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin recently told Presi- dent Bush he urgently needs $S billion to $6 billion. And Ambassador Robert Ss. Strauss, Mr. Bush’s envoy to Moscow, said last December that a_ stabilization fund is needed within six or eight months to propel reform. Just last week, as he launched a food airlift to the former Soviet republics, Sec- retary of State James A. Baker III gave the first hints that the administration is Se a contribution. But in an election year with the U.S. economy dragged down in recession and voters feeling stingy about foreign aid, steps to but- tress the ruble with a couple of billion U.S. dollars could land in political quicksand. **I don’t know if people have the stomach for that this year,’’ said a congressional aide on a key committee. “It would be a damned tough sell. ... It would really take leadership from the White House on this.”’ An added complication is that a currency stabilization fund might not work as intend- ed. Ideally, it is a backstop that . ‘will never have to be used. As Mr. Baker was quick to Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 16, 1992 point out, creation of a fund. must go hand in hand with ex- tensive economic reforms within Russia, reforms sub- stantial enough to gain Russia membership in the Interna- tional Monetary Fund. Reducing the budget defi- cit, pegging the ruble to a real- istic rate of exchange against the dollar and controlling the - money supply are among pre- — requisites. “‘They can’t keep a finger on the start button of the [ru- ble] printing press,’’ said an IMF official who requested - anonymity. s The confusing dual system for valuing the ruble, in which - Russians pay much less in ru- bles for items purchased at higher prices by foreigners, would have to end. Russia would have to establish a con-— vertible currency. Other reforms, such as ‘dropping all price controls, Privatizing land ownership | and creating laws to protect - investment, also would have - to be in the works. Russia is moving in the right direction, and its appli- cation for IMF membership — should be processed ‘“‘within a matter of months,’’ the IMF official said. At some point in this re- form process the moneyed na- - tions would ante up the bil- lions for a support fund, which would be available if skittish Russians or foreign investors . decided they wanted to trade in their rubles. The simple existence of” the fund supposedly would prevent that from happening, creating confidence in the ru- ble by showing that the rest of the world has confidence in - the reforms. Poland is one of the few - Places such a fund has been ~ created during economic re- _ forms, and it has worked. \f"

He said the department will begin negotiating the sale any day now to an unidentified purchaser, eight months after the govern- ment put it up for sale. From 1983 until last year, the abandoned Sulphur Mines site in Louisiana stored 26 million bar- rels of crude oil — equal to about petroleum imports. But over the Past year the Energy Depart- ment has pumped Sulphur Mines nearly dry, transferring the oil by pipeline to a bigger, more effi- | Er : cient storage cavern near Beau- mont, Texas.

After selling the Louisiana cavern, the government’s emer- gency oil complex will consist of five underground sites with a to- tal capacity of 7SO million bar- rels. A 1990 law authorized ex- panding to 1 billion barrels of storage capacity, but no funds, have been budgeted to buy or lease the extra caverns. The Louisiana cavern was purchased in 1979 by the Carter administration for $8.3 million.

        "ocr_text": "Shop talk . . . Despite cuts, Pentagon maintains wish list By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT © Cox News Service WASHINGTON — Looking to- ward wars of the future, the Army wants to make it easier for sol- diers to dig foxholes. It has invited contractors to come up with some kind of “‘man- portable” digging device that “can create a two-man fighting posi- tion.” How would such a thing work? Perhaps it could rely on “explosive technology,” hinted the U.S. Army’s Forces Command in Atlanta in a recent notice to con- tractors. And so this April, a dozen con- tractors will assemble on a firing range at Fort Campbell, Ky., and try to demonstrate that their ‘“‘fox- hole digging solution” is worth a slice of a future military budget. Replacing the shovel is one of thousands of brainstorms rico- cheting around the Pentagon and its research affiliates these days. While much of the military is being pared, Pentagon spending on research and development is going up — from $36.9 billion this year to $38.8 billion in the Bush administration’s budget for the fis- cal year starting Oct. 1. One recent government notice was a tip-off that the Army has big plans for the “electric gun” proj- ect it has been pursuing at the Pi- catinny Arsenal in New Jersey. The notice said the Army wants to “assess” how such a gun could be used as a tank gun, as an artillery weapon, as an anti-aircraft device or even for shooting down incom- ing missiles. The first prototype of the Ar- my’s electric gun — which is de- signed to propel shells at high speeds using lightning-like electric charges — will be tested this sum- mer at Yuma Proving Ground, Among other projects in the works: @ The Marine Corps is trying to put some extra oomph in its com- bat bulldozers. It has asked con- tractors to develop ‘enhanced productivity” blades that can be attached to Marine bulldozers for use in “land clearing, berm con- struction, trench filling and possi- bly shallow mine clearing.” The new blades can vibrate or include mechanized moving parts, the contract notice said. m The Army has a new idea for avoiding “friendly fire” casualties: It wants contractors to supply a patch of unique material that could be attached to a soldier’s uniform and spotted at a distance, perhaps through an_ infrared scope. Or, each soldier could wear an identifying device whose sig- nals would be somehow encoded so “friendly” soldiers could detect it and enemies couldn’t. mThe Army wants someone to design a mobile, self-contained “all-climate kitchen” to feed 500 troops. And for field hospitals in hot climates, the Army wants “‘one prototype field ice maker” that can withstand rough handling. mFor counter-terrorist oper- ations, the Army and Marines are trying to buy an exotic “controlled penetration” rifle projectile. At very short range, it would kill a terrorist wearing a_ bulletproof vest. But when it hits a door or wall, the projectile wouldn't pene- trate, thus sparing hostages in a nearby room. @The Air Force is trying to build a “fourth generation” ejec- tion seat that would keep fighter pilots alive even when ejecting at speeds of 700 mph, or when the plane is flying straight down. From foxhole diggers to electric guns, most of the projects are like- ly to prosper while they are in the esearch stages. But it isn’t clear that any of them will ever be de- ployed. As the Defense Depart- ment said last month in outlining its “new approach to defense ac- quisition,” the country has to move aggressively in pursuing new weapons technologies. But once it comes time to move to- ward full production, ‘there will be no funds for useful, but not critical, weapons systems.” Louisville Courier-Journal - February 17, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "US., Russian subs collide Incident off Murmansk stirs unease in Moscow By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — A U.S. nucle- ar-powered submarine, which evidently was gathering intelli- gence in disputed waters near Russia’s biggest naval base, has been ordered home for possible repairs and an investigation af- ter it collided last week with a Russian nuclear-powered sub- marine. The two submarines survived their jarring bump with no re- ported injuries. And there was no measurable radioactive release into the icy Barents Sea outside the Russian port of Murmansk, 1,000 miles north of Moscow. But the episode clearly bruised the feelings of some Rus- sian military leaders, who al- ready were uneasy about Rus- sian President Boris N. Yeltsin’s moves to slash military spending and embrace Washington as a potential ally. The Interfax news agency in Moscow quoted Adm. Ivan Kapi- tans as saying, “The fact that.a foreign submarine secretly oper- ated in our territorial water arouses legitimate concern in the Russian leadership.” Jurisdiction in dispute The USS Baton Rouge and the unnamed Russian sub collided Feb. 11 in a strip of ocean outside Murmansk that the U.S. Navy says is international waters and the Russian navy says is not. A Pentagon spokesman, Bob Hall, insisted Tuesday that the incident occurred “in an area that we deem international wa- ters, beyond the 12-mile bound- ary.” This flare-up of Cold War rhet- oric — coming less than three weeks after the two nations de- clared they no longer are potential enemies — grew out of a lingering dispute between the world’s two biggest navies over how territorial waters are defined. The United States has long in- sisted on the right to operate warships as close as 12 miles from the nearest point on the ac- tual coastline of the former Sovi- et Union — or any other coastline in the world. Cat-and-mouse game But Soviet naval chartmakers traditionally have measured their 12-mile belt of territorial waters as extending outward from the mouths of smaller bays and harbors rather than from the irregularities of the coastline. Interfax said that, in this in- stance, Russia defines its territo- rial waters as extending 12 miles Knight-Ridder Tribune from the mouth of Kola Bay, the icy harbor outside the Mur- mansk naval base. Since the 1950s, Soviet and U.S. submarines have played a cat-and-mouse game dramatized by the book “The Hunt for Red October.” The most devastating acci- dent reported so far involved a 1970 collision between a U.S. at- tack submarine and a Soviet mis- sile-firing submarine it was shadowing in the Northern Pacif- ic. In that incident, the Soviet sub sank, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune last year. Incident kept secret In this case, Mr. Hall told re- porters, the Los Angeles-class Baton Rouge was operating “at periscope depth” and the Rus- sian submarine was rising toward the surface when the ac- cident occurred. He said the U.S. sub then “observed” the Russian sub proceeding toward port but did not contact it by radio. Mr. Hall said Defense Secre- tary Dick Cheney learned of the incident through U.S. military channels the next day. But the Pentagon kept the incident se- cret until the Tass news agency reported Friday that a Russian submarine had struck an un- known object. On Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III broke the news in Moscow to Mr. Yelt- sin that the hidden obstacle was a U.S. submarine. Mr. Hall said the Baton Rouge’s crew could not detect any damage, even though Rus- sian news reports said metal parts were found on the deck of the Russian sub. Mr. Hall said that, as a “safety” precaution, the submarine is heading to its home port of Norfolk, Va., where it is due Tuesday. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 19, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Israeli forces, Arabs swap rocket attacks across border By Louis J. Salome and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Jerusalem — Retaliatory at- tacks on both sides of Israel’s border with Lebanon increased Tuesday amid warnings of a ma- jor escalation yet to come in the two-day rocket war. Early concerns abated that the fighting would stall Mideast peace talks, scheduled to resume next week in Washington, as both Arabs and Israelis said they would participate. The talks also had been jeopardized by Israel’s imprisonment of two Palestinian negotiators, an act the Bush ad- ministration decried Tuesday. In the border clashes Tues- day, an Israeli helicopter fired a rocket into the home of Ali Ezze- dine, an official with Hezbollah, wounding his daughter, reports from Lebanon said. This second attack in three days on Hezbollah leaders came in the village of Zawtar al-Gharbiyeh, just north of Israel’s self-styled security zone in south Lebanon. “‘There was an air strike,’’ is all the Israeli military would say. But it was clear that Israeli air- craft had targeted Mr. Ezze- dine’s house, as tens of thou- sands of pro-Iranian Hezbollah mourners buried Sheik Abbas Musawi. Sheik Musawi, his wife and 6- year-old son were killed Sunday in a pinpoint helicopter strike on an Hezbollah motorcade. That assault capped a weekend of vio- lence in which Arabs stabbed and hacked to death three Israeli soldiers at a training base in Is- rael and Israel struck back with lethal raids against Hezbollah and Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. As Sheik Musawi was buried in his hometown of Nabi Sheet, Hezbollah’s ruling council unan--— imously elected Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, a hard-line protege of Sheik Musawi’s, as its new leader. Also Tuesday, the South Leb- \" The Associated Press Shiite women grieve Tuesday for Hezbollah leader Sheik Abbas Miusawi (in picture) at his funeral in Baalbek, Lebanon. anon Army, Israel’s surrogate force im Lebanon, warned resi- dents of three villages outside Is- rael’s security zone to flee by S a.m. today to escape ‘‘massive re- taliation from Israeli forces.’’ An Israeli military official said Tuesday night that ‘“‘this cir- cle of violence is heating up. It’s at a certain level now that if an Israeli is killed by a rocket fired into Israel, it’s going to be a new ball game. It will take a quantum. leap.’’ As the official spoke shortly before midnight Tuesday, he re- ported that more Katyusha rock- ets were landing in the Israeli border town of Metulla. Reports from Lebanon said Hezbollah fired at least 40 rock- ets into Israel and 2S more at the security zone Tuesday. Israel reported no casualties but some property damage. Re- ports from Lebanon said Israeli attacks on three villages killed one person and wounded 11. In Washington, the Bush ad- ministration reiterated pleas that all parties ‘‘exercise maxi- mum restraint”’ arid ‘‘continue to pursue the avenue towards peace that’s offered by these negotia- tions’’ set to resume Monday. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher also said the administration ‘‘expressed our opposition’”’ to Israel’s imprison- ment of two Palestinian negotia- tors without formal charges or trial. He urged the Palestinians not to let the arrests impede ne- gotiations. Palestinians initially an- nounced they were suspending travel plans, but an official of the Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion said later in Damascus, Syr- ia, that the delegates would not boycott the next round. The Palestinians were react- ing to the arrests of Mohammed Hourani, a psychology professor detained Jan. 9, and Jamal Sho- baki, a geography professor ar- rested Sunday. Israelis had pre- vented Mr. Shobaki from leaving the occupied territories to attend the last round of peace talks. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 19, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Israeli offensive in Lebanon meets resistance from Arabs By Louis J. Salome STAFF CORRESPONDENT and Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Naquora, Lebanon — Israe- li tanks and bulldozers, backed by helicopter gunships, smashed their way past U.N. peacekeep- ers Thursday and seized Hezbol- lah villages in southern Lebanon as they attempted to wipe out Shiite guerrillas who have been rocketing the Jewish state. Israel said two of its soldiers were killed and three wounded. Two U.N. peacekeepers were also wounded during a confron- tation with Israeli troops. The U.N. forces were trying to block the Israeli advance, and _ fist- fights broke out before the Israe- li soldiers burst through and cap- tured the southern Lebanon vil- lages of Yater and Kafra. The Israelis encountered stiff resistance as Palestinians and previously quiet moderate Leba- nese Muslims joined with Hez- bollah (Party of God) guerrillas in a fight that threatens to esca- late into a major battle. The Israeli army said several Lebanese were killed and wounded in the fighting, but re- fused to give a number. Reports from Lebanon said seven Shiites had been killed and 17 others wounded. Israeli leaders vowed the fighting would not expand into a replay of the 1982 war, begun when Israeli troops similarly in- vaded south Lebanon. But ex- perts in Washington analyzed the incursion as bigger and better planned than a simple series of attacks and retaliations. U.N. Secretary-General Bou- tros Boutros-Ghali demanded Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 21, 1992 that Israeli troops withdraw, and the Bush administration urged all sides to back off amid con- cerns that the incursion will es- calate into all-out war. Yoram Aridor, Israel’s am- bassador to the United Nations, was summoned to receive a pro- test over the incursion “and a de- mand that the Israeli and “de facto forces” be immediately withdrawn,” according to a U.N. statement. The “de facto forces” are sol- diers of the Army, which help protect a “‘se- curity zone” that Israel seized and controls in southern Leb- anon. The United States, which hosts the next round of the Mid- dle East peace talks in Washing- ton on Monday, made high-level diplomatic contacts with officials South Lebanon: ing “the exercise of maximum restraint,’’ State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Thursday. Syria largely controls the Lebanese government, and it is feared that Syrian and regular Lebanese army troops both could become involved if the fighting does not conclude soon. Israeli leader Yitzhak Sha- mir, speaking Thursday as he _ ‘was about to be renominated as the dominant Likud Party’s can- didate for prime minister, said the fighting was “serious but it’s ‘ not very serious.” A U.N. official in Lebanda ‘said the world body’s officials in New York were negotiating with Israel in an attempt to force Is- raeli tanks and troops out of the U.N. peacekeeping area north of Israel’s self-declared security of Israel, Lebanon and Syria urg- —- zone in South Lebanon. \f"

In one case, an Iraqi shell lodged harm- lessly in the armor of an M1-Al, and in another case a shell simply bounced off. No. 7,856 will probably never be used by the peacetime military, By 1995, the slimmed-down Army and Marines will need only 4,700 tanks for all active armored units and all wartime emergency reserve de- pots, according to Army spokes- man Maj. Peter Keating, Even so, the Pentagon is com- mitted to buy 8,113 Abrams tanks before the last U.S. order runs out in late 1993. By 1995, that will mean the military will own 3,000 more Abrams tanks than the ac- tive forces need, Daily, the 90,000 people in and around Lima are gnawed by the prospect that their most lucrative employer — with a payroll ap- proaching $90 million a year — may have only a few years to live before the Army locks the gates and leaves only a few guards on the payroll. “To tell you the truth, Lima is going to the devil,” worries Mary Barton, 71, a lifelong neighbor of the factory who watched it sprout from the cornfields in May 1941 as the nation mobilized before World War II. “I am afraid that the only thing that can get our town going again is a war, God forbid.” tod, says, “My boy got laid off at the tank plant last year.

The Army contracts the tank- building work inside the fence to General Dynamics’ Land Systems Division. Once before, in the post-Korean War demobilization, the Army mothballed the Lima plant and left it empty from 1959 to 1976, Harold Gerton, 43, the Army ci- vilian deputy plant manager, re- members what it was like when the Army decided in 1976 to reopen the plant after the Army got the go-ahead to replace the old Patton tank with the Abrams, “There was some rust, but noth- ing serious,” Gerton recalls, “The machines were in pretty good shape.” All the same, he said, it took four years from the Army’s announcement until the first Abrams was finished, Layoffs and retirements have dropped the tank plant's work force from 2,500 to 2,000 over the past 18 months.

        "ocr_text": "Lockheed hopes to sell Navy on F-22 Getting contract would preserve jobs in Southeast By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — In a move that could secure hundreds of aerospace jobs in the Southeast in the late 1990s, Lockheed Corp. said Monday that it would design a carrier-based version of the Air Force F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter and try to sell it to the Navy as its bomber of the future. Micky Blackwell, manager of the F-22 project for Lockheed, said at a news conference that his company will try to persuade the Navy that it can build a cheaper naval bomber than any of its competitors because of the high- tech work it already is doing for the Air Force. At stake is which of the na- tion’s hard-pressed defense con- tractors will win a Pentagon con- tract to build the AX, the plane the Navy says it needs to replace the A-6 Intruder, which has flown thousands of bombing raids in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. “We are going to do every- thing in our power to cannibalize the F-22 to the maximum extent possible to go into our AX entry,” Mr. Blackwell said. “No. 1, it makes the most sense, and No. 2, we hope it is the most affordable solution.” Lockheed’s competitors for the Navy fighter-bomber will in- clude California-based Northrop Corp., whose existence is threat- ened by the impending cutoff of Lockheed, which builds F-22s at its plant in Marietta, hopes the Navy will opt for the same plane. Sen. Sam Nunn (left) and Rep. Les Aspin (right) questioned military witnesses last week. the B-2 bomber, and Grumman Corp., whose plant on Long Is- land, N.Y., has specialized in building carrier-based planes for the Navy for half a century. Also in the running are Tex- as-based General Dynamics Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Co. of St. Louis, whose joint con- tract to build an earlier variant of the new Navy fighter-bomber was canceled in 1991 by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney because of cost overruns. For the winning company and region, the AX contract looms as one of the richest prizes in the shrinking defense budgets of the mid-1990s. Even after the demise of the Cold War, the Navy’s long-range plans call for the purchase of 575 of the planes, Navy spokesman Roger Copeland said Monday. “That number is subject to change; it is not a final decision,” he cautioned. All five main contractors have been awarded small study con- tracts for the AX, and next year the Navy is expected to give out larger ‘‘demonstration-valida- tion” contracts to enable two fi- nalists to build flying prototypes. The winning contractor probably will not be chosen until 1995. From Lockheed’s viewpoint, one hurdle is that the fighter it is building for the Air Force is 62 feet long, 7 feet longer than the Navy A-6 bomber it would re- place. The Lockheed F-22 also is substantially heavier than an A-6, posing potential problems in de- signing an undercarriage that could withstand carrier takeoffs and landings. Lockheed’s quest for the Navy AX contract comes at a time when some key members of Congress are starting to zero in on Lockheed’s F-22 as a possible source of future defense cuts. Lockheed won a preliminary order last year to build 648 of the stealth fighters at its plant in Mar- ietta, Ga., with full production scheduled to start in about 1996. But last week, Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, sug- gested that the demise of the Cold War may make it possible to slash the production order to a low number, relegating the F-22 to the role of a limited “magic bullet” weapon reserved for a few specialized Air Force units. For his part, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, asked Navy and Air Force wit- nesses at a hearing last week whether the Pentagon could economize over the long run by adapting the F-22 fighter to serve as a carrier-based bomber. The witnesses said the two services were trying to adopt common airplane designs, but they were noncommittal on whether the F-22 would serve the Navy’s purposes. Mr. Blackwell said the Air Force has given Lockheed no in- dication that the 648-plane order of F-22s is at risk of being cut. “We are meeting all the critical milestones,” he said.

Baker III's plan to multiply spending on foreign peacekeeping troops, re- flecting growing election-year chagrin over troubles at home. Apparently responding to money concerns sweeping their home districts, both Republicans and Democrats on a House ap- propriations subcommittee gave heated critiques of Mr. Baker's request to raise the $107 million budgeted for U.N. peacekeeping troops this year to $460 million in the coming fiscal year, with an added special supplement this year of $350 million. “You're going in peacekeep- ing from $107 million to $700- plus million, and we're being asked to cut every single domes- tic program!” said Rep. Joseph D. Early (D-Mass.). ‘How is that looking out for the taxpayer?” “Around the Congress here it’s very difficult. Anything that's connected with foreign seems to have a bad connotation now,” said Rep. Neal Smith (D-lowa), the subcommittee chairman. “It’s not easy to get the money.” A large share of the funds would help finance 22,000 peace- keeping troops scheduled to go to Cambodia to do everything from routine guard duty to overseeing elections in the battle-wracked nation now heading toward rec- onciliation, Yugoslavia and El Salvador also are among nations expected to get peacekeeping contingents. “It's a new world,” Mr. Baker countered. “We have resolved a lot of big conflicts where there was a lot of tragedy and suffering going on, and we've done so, I think, very much in the national: security interests of the United States,” Peacekeeping forces are es: sential in finally ending waning regional hostilities, he said, add- ing that they are “a good buy” because it will be cheaper “if we can solve these problems politi- cally and diplomatically than if we end up having to solve them through force or militarily.” While most committee mem- bers accepted the notion that peacekeeping troops can be use- ful and cost-effective, they re- flected another national trend in grousing that the United States is PT James Baker, FPG secretary of BA) state, defended his request for $810 million extra for peacekeeping efforts. bearing too much of the load in being assessed 30 percent of the total costs. Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) questioned why the United States pays so much while Germany is asked to contribute only 6.9 per: cent and Japan 12.45 percent. “It's not fair for us to pay such ahuge share of the bill compared to Japan, Germany and other countries that are knocking our socks off in the economic world these days,” Mr, Rogers said.

        "ocr_text": "Israeli negotiator Seal _ By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Palestinian peace ne- gotiators called for elections in the occupied _ territories by September as part of a detailed plan for interim self-government that they presented Tuesday to their Israeli counter- parts, who quickly denounced the proposal. Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan _ Ashrawi called the plan “a historic document of tremendous significance” which she said complies with all United Nations resolutions and international law in general. “If they reject this, this means they have rejected the basis of the negotiations and the whole peace process,” she said. Israeli negotiator Josef Ben-Aharon quickly responded that the plan is “an at- tempt to present the model of a Palestinian state,” which he called “just futile and unnec- essary.” Haidar Abdel Shafi, head of the Palestin- ian delegation, acknowledged that the docu- ment presented Tuesday specifically calls for the transition period to lead to establish- ment of a Palestinian state. Israel has proclaimed it will not permit a Palestinian state in the territories it occu- pied in the 1967 war. Ashrawi admitted the 12-page document with a four-page cover letter has virtually no overlap with Israel’s first proposal on inter- im self-rule, since the two sides begin “from totally different premises.” Although Israel has proposed Palestinian elections in the past, this we Israeli olan carries no provision for elections or any central Palestinian authority to handle the administrative tasks the Israelis say they are willing to turn over, The Palestinian plan calls for a 190-member legislative authority to be elected under international supervision, Other points at which the Israelis are sure to balk: @ East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed and says it will never relinquish, is included in the area of interim self-rule, and Palestin- ians there would elect members of the legis- lative body, Hi Israel would be required to “prepare conditions for elections” by the end of July, including lifting censorship, permitting free political activity, releasing political prison- ers and administrative detainees, returning deportees and lifting other restrictions. : @ Any Jewish settlers in the territories would be subject to the interim government, rather than remaining as islands under Israe- li control.

        "ocr_text": " Pentagon takes heat for spending on recruiting ads By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The Pentagon was castigated Wednesday for awarding a $57 million contract for slick Army recrult- ing ads at a time when military ranks are shrinking. “I wonder if some of these advertise- ments are nothing more than a propagan- da campaign used to uphold the Penta- gon’s image and to promote military spending,” Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) said in a floor speech. Young & Rubicam, a New York adver- tising agency, won the contract last month to create and pay for one year of Army TV ads, radio jingles, newspaper ads, billboards and direct-mail liter- ature. “We are trying to whip our defense budget into shape, and to do so, we must trim away the fat,” Mr. Pryor said. “In the case of recruiting, the big-city Madi- son Avenue advertising agencies are among those who continue to get fat.” Last year, Advertising Age magazine ranked the Army 84th on its list of 200 “mega-brands,” topping clients such as Campbell’s Soup and Reebok shoes, ac- cording to Mr. Pryor. Across Capitol Hill, Defense Secre- tary Dick Cheney countered by telling a House committee that the military must advertise to attract the best high school graduates. “The really top-drawer recruit that you want has options,” Mr. Cheney said. “They can go do other things; they don’t have to join the military.” Mr. Cheney said it makes sense to keep enlisting new 18-year-olds even when declining defense budgets are forc- ing a 25 percent contraction of military ranks and inducing thousands of senior soldiers to terminate their careers early. “If you stop recruiting for a year or two and don’t take anybody in, you end up with a big distortion in the force,” Mr. Cheney said. “We are cutting back signif- icantly on recruiting, but we think it is important to continue.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 5, 1992 \f"

It was a puzzling lapse in the U.S. Navy’s surveillance operations.

        "ocr_text": "U.S.-backed loans would retool Israel $10 billion urged for immigrant aid also would fund economic facelift By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The $10 bil- lion in loan guarantees that Isra- el wants from the United States, billed as humanitarian relief for immigrants from the former So- viet Union, in fact would help support a sweeping economic facelift for the Jewish state, fix- ing everything from sagging rail- way lines to gridlock in Tel Aviv. Israeli leaders have drawn up a plan that goes far beyond ad- dressing the immediate needs of hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants. It would correct deep-seated problems not direct- ly tied to the immigrant issue, problems that have plagued both Israel’s infrastructure and its economy for years. “Tt can change all of our soci- ety,” Amnon Neubach, minister for economic affairs at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said in an interview this week. “If we implement it well and open the market well, and the pri- vate sector takes this opportunity, then five or six years from now, this will be another economy.” Israeli officials acknowledge their vast development plans when asked. But in their attempt to secure American approval, for months they have emphasized the more appealing humanitar- ian dimension of housing and putting to work as many as 1 mil- lion Jewish immigrants who may The total program of $60 bil- lion to $70 billion, described in an Israeli document titled ‘“Ab- sorption of Soviet Jewry Immi- gration,” would include: ' > $4.4 billion to build a major north-south artery called “High- way 6,” new metropolitan road networks for Tel Aviv, Jerusa- lem and Haifa, and other road system improvements. _ > $1 billion for two new 747 jumbo jets and other equipment for El Al, Israel’s national airline. > $6.5 billion for new power plants and oil refinery im- provements. > $1 billion to $1.5 billion to expand and improve port facili- ties. ; > $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion to improve the deteriorated railway system, including new commuter train networks. > $2.5 billion for education, plus $1.9 billion for school con- struction over the decade. > $3 billion for health ser- vices in a system that is primari- ly publicly funded. > $9.5 billion for government- funded housing and mortgages. U.S. taxpayers may balk In Washington, the loan issue has centered on a hot political debate: the Bush administra- tion’s efforts to condition the guarantees on Israel’s halting the construction of Jewish settle- ments in occupied Arab territo- ries. That may come to a head any day, with Secretary of State James A. Baker III backfrom a European trip. This emotional issue, along with lesser concerns about Isra- el’s ability to repay the loans that the U.S. government would be co-signing through the guaran- tees, have obscured the fact that Israel’s broader goal is to lift its economy out of stagnation and into a vigorous new role in the world marketplace. That has drawn some ques- tions, most notably from Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.), whose . House subcommittee on foreign operations recently held a hear- ing on the loan guarantees. “This is the dilemma for the average American: We cannot get support in this city for job creation or job expansion pro- grams in our own country,” Mr. Obey said. “We're going to have a devil of a time convincing the American people, in light of our own economic situation, that we have an obligation to retool the Israeli economy.” He particularly questioned the infrastructure improve- ments. Israel would fund only about one-third of them directly, but would make loans available to private enterprise to accom- plish the rest. Atlanta Journal-Constitution March 12, 1992 Economy undergoing change Likewise, many billions of dol- lars would be lent to private busi- ness to expand and help create the 620,000 new jobs Israel expects to need by 1996 to accommodate both immigrants and growth in the Israeli population. The goal, according to the planning docu- ment and Israeli officials, is to buttress the nation’s weak private sector and redirect it into lucra- tive export production. ‘ Israel doesn’t have enough money either for its own budget or for the loans to business, which is why it wants the $10 billion in loan the guarantees would show U.S, government confidence in their plans, making it possible not only to get loans at low interest rates in Washington, but also enabling Is- rael to borrow another $10 billion in other foreign financial markets. How much the loan guaran- tees would cost the U.S. budget in the short term is unknown. Under a “scoring” System based on the recipient’s creditworthiness, a percentage of the amount guaran- teed will have to be set aside in the event Israel is unable to repay loans and Washington is tapped for payment as a co-signer. Israel's economy is beginning to emerge from a socialistic ori- entation in which government has run everything from food subsi- dies to most of the nation’s indus- trial machine. Whether it is able to push ahead with reform in such. areas as privatization and trade_ liberalization will determine whether the ambitious plan for absorbing immigrants and re- charging the economy will work. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Nunn urges more aid for struggling Russia Senator says U.S. security hinges on it By Joseph Albright and Andrew Glass WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — In the face of polls showing Americans turning isolationist, Sen. Sam Nunn (D- Ga.) called \"Wednesday for wide- ranging U.S. aid to the former Soviet Union, including a “fair share”’ of a $6 billion internation- al fund to steady the Russian ruble. Fresh from a bipartisan fact- finding trip to Russia and Ukraine, Mr. Nunn appealed to President Bush to take the politi- cal risks of speaking out for rapid American assistance aimed at staving off the collapse of Rus- sian President Boris N. Yeltsin’s government. “The place in history of Pres- ident Bush will be judged by what happens in our own govern- ment in treating this as a priority over the next several months,’’ said Mr. Nunn, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “‘It may not gain any importance in the polls, but I think it certainly is critical for our national security.”’ Mr. Nunn emerged as the most prominent elected leader of either party to champion the idea that long-range American securi- ty hinges on using U.S. taxpayer dollars to aid the Russian econo- my. Only former President Rich- ard Nixon has been as outspoken in calling for increased aid. At a Capitol Hill news confer- ence, Mr. Nunn joined Sens. John Warner (R-Va.), Richard G. Lu- gar (R-Ind.) and Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) in calling for the Unit- ed States to contribute an un- specified share of a new $6 bil- lion international standby fund to back the ruble and help end Russia’s hyperinflation. “I think that, if we wake up three or four or five years from now and we have a different set of leaders in Russia, this genera- tion of leaders, including those in the White House and those in the Congress, will be held account- able,’”? Mr. Nunn said. No presidential candidate of either party has talked much about the notion that long-range U.S. security might be linked to aid to the former Soviet repub- lics. Even Mr. Bush’s ambassa- dor to Moscow, Democrat Robert Strauss, expressed surprise at that Wednesday. Mr. Bush, who is still strug- gling against Republican chal- lenger Pat Buchanan’s “America First’”’ theme in forthcoming Mid- western presidential primaries, insisted at a news conference that he is committed to U.S. world leadership. But he added that his. administration has no “blank check” for larger aid programs. Even as the foreign policy de- bate simmered on Capitol Hill, Mr. Nixon also challenged Mr. Bush to show more spunk on the Russian aid issue. Speaking without notes at a Nixon Library policy conference in Washington, Mr. Nixon raised the specter of ‘“‘a new despotism’’ in the one-time Soviet lands should the current effort to install market-based democracies fail. “If freedom fails,’’ Mr. Nixon added, “the new despotism which will take its place will mean that the peace dividend is finished, we will have to rearm, and that’s going to cost infinitely more than would the aid that we provide at the present time.”’ ‘When he came face-to-face with Mr. Bush later Wednesday, Mr. Nixon denied that there is a | rift between him and the presi- | dent over Russia. There was no hint of problems when Mr. Nixon introduced the president for a dinner speech. : Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 12, 1992 \f"

If such a diversion occurred, China theo- retically could use the information to perfect “technical tricks” that would allow Chinese- designed offensive missiles to increase their chances of penetrating the Patriot’s “Scud- busting” radar shield, according to Theodore Postol, a Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy expert on the anti-missile system. That raised a puzzling question for which there is no obvious answer: How could Israel possibly gain by delivering Patriot data to China, a country that has made a practice of gelling offensive missiles to Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq? _ However murky the motivations, senior US, officials confirmed that Washington is investigating fresh intelligence reports sug- gesting that either a Patriot missile or relat: ed anti-missile technology has been diverted from Israel to China. “Tt is a subject of concern to us, and we are looking into it,” said a Washington offi- cial who insisted on anonymity, The investigation, first disclosed by The Washington Times, strains the already rag- ged relationship between Washington and Is- rael just as Congress approaches a March 31 deadline on whether to approve a $10 billion loan guarantee to Israel, The official said secret reports on the al- leged diversion reached senior Bush admin: istration officials by early this week. When a reporter asked whether the information is deemed to have passed “some threshold of credibility,” the official said, “Yes,” This flew in the\\face of an absolute denial issued four hours earlier by a spokesman for Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens, who was in New York on a fund-raising trip and is to confer Monday in Washington with De- fense Secretary Dick Cheney. “These are totally false and baseless re- ports,” said Israeli spokesman Danny Naveh. “Israel has not transferred any Patriot mis- siles or technology of this missile to China. These reports are lies and have no basis.” At the White House, press secretary Mar- lin Fitzwater said the United States has cer- tain “intelligence information and conclu- sions” and has been in contact with Israel. He refused to say more, but an Israeli Embassy official said Israel conveyed an “absolute denial” to Washington through diplomatic channels Tuesday. Pentagon records show that in September 1990, the month after Iraq’s invasion of Ku- wait, the United States secretly agreed to give Israel two complete Patriot batteries, including five launchers and 64 missiles, These weapons, worth $117 million, were taken out of U.S, Army war depots and sent to Israel early in January 1991, only days be- fore the Gulf War. A U.S, diplomatic note authorizing the transfer said none of the missiles or technol- ogy could be transferred to a third party — an obligation Israel is said to have confirmed in writing, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 13, 1992 \f"

Every day, half a dozen cities telephone a Pentagon annex in Arlington, Va., to get the rules for what may be the nation’s single oe new-jobs competition of 1992.

        "ocr_text": "COPINION By MARCIA KUNSTEL ‘ ASHINGTON — The current journalistic ap- proach to the Mideast peace talks may be seriously off-track. What we need are garden- ers. Instead of asking geopolitical analysts to gauge progress in the negotiations, the question might better be posed to lawn specialists. They know about watching the grass grow. It’s moving that slowly. Everybody is complaining about the other guy — Arabs denouncing Israel for intransigence, Israel accus- ing the Arabs of blocking the tiniest steps forward. Think-tankers are waxing pessimistic since the fourth round of talks ended earlier this month with no tangible gains. i But viewed in a longer perspective, longer than it takes the St. Augustine grass to turn green and long, the transformation already made in Arab-Israeli relations is startling. From completely rejecting Israel — talking only with bullets, never with words — the Arabs now are engaged with Israel at the negotiating table. From refusing to recognize the existence of the Jewish state, all the Arab neighbors now accept at least Marcia Kunstel is a reporter in the Washington Bureau of Cox Newspapers. She has co-written a book, Their Promised Land, about the Middle East. Finding agreement between the Israelis and Arabs won't be easy, but there are hopeful signs. the 1967 prewar boundaries, a development made clear ’ during the last round of talks earlier this month in comments by the head of the Syrian delegation, Moaffak al-Allaf. He also uttered words the Israelis once would have swooned to hear: that Syria is “ready to make peace with Israel, with all the attributes of that peace.” That means treaties, diplomatic exchanges, normal rela- tions. And in Israel, all the serious politicians know that scuttling the peace talks now, just months before elections, would be political disaster among the hopeful population. In fact, polls show about two-thirds of Israelis favor trading land for peace, compared with less than 50 percent as recently as a year ago, before Secretary of State James Baker flipped the ignition on peace. After more than seven staggering decades of emo- tional conflict and bloodshed, movement toward recon- ciliation naturally will be slow. And the opposing sides naturally will lay on the table first their maximalist positions, not what they actually iN a Parte ey ae 2 3 $ ; i expect to achieve. It’s like scattering bags of grass seed ona semi-arid landscape and waiting for some to sprout. The Israeli and Palestinian blueprints for Palestin- ian self-rule are the clearest example. Israel’s proposal, more meager than one it agreed to in 1981 and another it made in 1989, would allot the Palestinians no political rights at all. The Palestinians’ plan is an unrealistic wish list that would make the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip an independent state in everything but name. But the plans are full of seeds, and what will be crucial in coming rounds of talks is whether anybody tries to tend and preserve those seeds with potential for growth. ; Palestinian adviser Nabil Shaath, an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said after this past round of talks that the Palestinian plan must contain “20 items that have already bee! eed upon by the Israelis,” whether at Camp David or the 1989 proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. These include creation of a strong local police force, withdrawal of Israeli troops to agreed-upon security zones and, most important, elections. The Israeli proposal, sparse as it is, would give the Palestinians civil control over spheres of life ranging from education and taxation to industry and commerce, If that means Israelis would not be permitted to close schools as a collective punishment, it’s worth something to Palestinians. So is having control over licensing, Palm Beach Post - March 15, 1992 > \fNeither side backing out on talks But Israel’s elections could hinder progress whether granting a business or driver’s license, which is a power Israel has used to aggravate Pales- tinians to distraction. After negotiations ended last time, Mr. Baker urged both sides to work on those points where ground for agreement exists. Whether that will happen, at least soon, is ques- tionable. While Israeli leaders need to keep the talks going at least for political reasons, they could face a small but crucial backlash if too much progress scares right-wing voters. There is _ considerable thought that Israel won’t bend much in negotiations until after the June elections. Nor have the Palestinians indi- cated yet a willingness to accept Mr. Baker’s advice. “We are not very convinced with this,” said Palestinian head negotiator Haidar Abdel Shafi, who along with Arabs from other dele- gations complain that it is useless to move on small points when Isra- el has shown no willingness even to discuss the major issues separating the sides. At least Mr. Abdel Shafi said the Palestinians “are listening very carefully” and considering sugges- tions, such as Mr. Baker’s, with an open mind. And everybody has forcefully said they want to continue the talks. “We are not pulling out of the peace process, by any means,” said a Jordanian spokesman. “We remain totally committed, undividedly committed to the peace process,” said a Lebanese negotiator. “I believe that we should not give up, it is too early to give up,” said a Syrian. A problem will arise, however, if no one decides to nurture the seeds for agreement sown for the first time in a terrain where there exists some real potential to live. They still could dry up and blow away. Palm Beach Post - March 15, 1992 (Continued) \f"

Seiten D Washington — U.S.-Israeli relations took a downward turn on two fronts Monday as pros- pects dimmed for approval of $10 billion in U.S. loan guaran- tees to Israel and officials of the two allies failed to end a painful dispute over allegations that Is- rael sold U.S. weapons technol- ogy to China. Bargaining on the Israeli loan guarantees will reach a critical Stage today, when President Bush meets with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcom- mittee on foreign aid, for what may be the last stab at reaching agreement between Senate lead- ers and the administration. The loan guarantees were in deepening trouble on Capitol Hill after weekend negotiations involving Mr. Bush, Secretary of State James Baker and key sena- tors failed to produce a com- promise. The administration wants to link the loan guarantees to a halt. in Israeli construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories, which it says hinders peace talks. Mr. Leahy canceled a sub- committee meeting originally called for today to act on a com- promise that would authorize a first installment of the loan guar- antees but would let the adminis- tration block the rest if it objected to continued settlement activity. Proceeds from the loan guar- antees would retool the Israeli economy so the Jewish state could absorb up to a million Jew- ish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The White House _ comes against a background of evident mistrust between the Is- raeli and American military es- tablishments. Emerging after a one-hour session at the Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens said he had told U.S. Defense Sec- retary Dick Cheney “there was no grounds at all” for claims that Is- rael transferred Patriot missiles or related technology to China. Mr. Arens said Mr. Cheney told him the United States had “some intelligence reports” re garding a possible Israeli diver- sion to the Beijing regime. The Pentagon later issued a capsule account of the meeting, which did not say whether Mr. camer see accepts the veracity of Is- rael’s Israel cites agreed to let a team of American experts come to Is- rael to inspect its operations and “ensure that there are not any misunderstandings on technol- ogy transfer questions,” State Department spokeswoman Mar- garet Tutwiler said Monday. “We welcome this Israeli ges- ture, which is in keeping with the strong ties between our two countries,” said Ms. Tutwiler, who acknowledged that the Unit- ed States asked for the expert visit and Israel acquiesced.

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT — Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Air Force’s dream fighter, the Lock- heed F'-22, has grown 20 percent over its original weight goal and may never be able to fly as far as once envisioned, the chairman of the Senate defense appropriations subcommittee said Tuesday. “Tf vou want to bring down the weight, you may have to compro- mise on range and performance,” Sen.

Instead of using the K reactor to generate tritium this spring, the Department of Energy will launch a series of tests and modi- fications that include connecting the reactor to a nearly completed cooling tower.

Baghdad’s concession re- lieves President Bush of any im- mediate need to decide whether to order a risky attempt to eradi- cate Iraq’s weapons complex by military power. Earlier this week, the Pentagon ordered F-4G “Wild | Weasel” electronic warplanes to the Persian Gulf region in a well- advertised signal of preparations for a possible allied air strike.

Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told senators that U.S. forces were already in position if Mr. Bush orders an attack. “The Iraqi government has to, at the end of the day, comply with the agreements they made under the various U.N. resolu- tions,” General Powell said. “They can do it the easy way; they can do it the hard way.” The next step in testing the Iraqi promises comes today when Mr. Ekeus sends 35 U.N. inspectors into Baghdad. A U.N.

The U.N. civilian inspectors are under orders to verify Iraq’s new declaration that over the last year it has unilaterally destroyed a large number of Scuds. And the inspectors also will be looking for a new batch of chemical war- heads for Scud missiles. The new list of weaponry, along with Baghdad’s pledge to destroy the Scud-making plants, were contained in a letter handed to Mr. Ekeus late Thursday by Iraq’s U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Anbari. “Iraq now declares a substan- tial amount more of weapons which it had denied before,” Mr. Ekeus said. Mr. Ekeus said Iraq provided fresh information about its Scud missile inventory, including an nals once contained 800 of the Soviet-designed missiles. That number matches the U.N. esti- mates, Mr. Ekeus said. That will be the starting point for the inspectors’ effort to ac- count for every Iraqi Scud to en- sure that none are still hidden. During last year’s Gulf War, Iraq launched roughly 80 Scuds against Israel and Saudi Arabia. Then Saddam’s government de- clared and destroyed 62 leftover Scuds in the first post-war months. Now, the big uncertainty is how many Scuds Iraq fired off earlier, during its eight-year war with Iran. Left unaddressed by the Iraqi letter is whether Saddam is also willing to allow the destruction of his prized Al Atheer nuclear re- search site south of Baghdad, which the United Nations says was once a center of Iraq’s ambi- \f"

By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Two Rus- sians on a commission investigat- ing the August coup warned Friday that many of the officials behind the coup attempt still hold power- ful positions and are struggling to overwhelm pro-democratic forces. One example, said Lev Pono- maryov and Father Gleb Yakunin, both members of the Russian Par- liament, is that their commission suddenly has been terminated by the president of the Parliament after beginning to expose intrica- cies of the KGB spy network. “So this ends our investigation, even though a lot of blank spaces remain to be filled,” Ponomaryov said at a news conference. “The KGB, re-organized as the Ministry of Security, is still ac- tive,’ said Ponomaryov, a physi- cist. “Many generals who partici- pated in the coup attempt are still in the armed forces.” Added Yakunin, a Russian Or- thodox priest: “Eighty to ninety percent of the bureaucrats today are former Communist Party offi- cials. They are violently opposed to reforms and opposed to democra- cy.” Palm Beach Post - March 21, 1992 Ponomaryov said the investiga- tive commission did not find specif- ic information that anyone is pre- paring a coup now. Their commission, called the Supreme Soviet Presidium’s Par- liamentary Commission on the Causes and Circumstances of the Coup d’Etat, was established last September to help prevent a repeat effort. They alleged it was dissolved at the behest of Russian Patriarch Aleksii, national head of the Rus- sian Orthodox Church.

That adjustment, ordered by the DOE's field office in Albuquerque, N.M., had the effect of more than doubling the anticipated cost of centralizing operations at Mound lab in Miamisburg, Howard Charbeneau, a Mound spokes- man, disputed the department's claim, “We validated those figures and they were approved by our management for submis- The department also accused unidentified Mound officials of making “two major errors” in cal- culating the jobs savings Mound could achieve if it was chosen to take over non-nuclear operations from other weapons-making facili- ties in Colorado, Florida, Tennes- see, Texas and Missouri. In both instances, the report said, Mound made unrealistic claims that it could do the same amount of work with fewer people. To offset Mound’s “errors,” the Al- buquerque field office added 838 people back into the Mound esti- mate, according to the report. It said Mound’s credibility was further undermined by its claim that it could quickly take over work from the Kansas City plant for a complicated weapon compo- sion, When it comes to putting in proposals, Energy Department to justify closing you obviously don't send in something \\oynd, that's preposterous. vrpig Deborah Smit, a Department of Energy U.S, Rep, Tony Hall, D-Dayton sai, | amazing te the Energy ona to at- Spokeswoman, said Mound's alleged mis. tack Mound’s figures at the same time sup- calculations didn't play a major part in En- pressing the original report that contained ergy Secretary James Watkins’ decision in them, I have no more reason to believe the December to close Mound, “I don’t think that one factor was critical in the decisions that were made,” she said, Mounds scheduled to close by 1995, Energy Department’s figures than I have to believe their broken promises for an open and unbiased process.” Hall has been leading efforts to get the 147-page report on Monday as part of the department’s step-by- step plan for restructuring the nu- clear weapons complex.

Seventy-five of the 380 sup- ply troops in the three Indiana units report persistent ailments ranging from aching teeth to chronic fatigue, the Army said Wednesday. Other complaints include loss of hair, aching joints and diarrhea. “Certainly there is real ill- ness here,” said Steve Strom- vall, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Command in At- lanta, which is leading the Army’s inquiry. “These are sick soldiers that need to be taken care of.” In Washington, a spokes- woman for the Army surgeon general’s office said some of the Reservists have theorized that their injuries may have re- sulted from exposure to micro- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 26, 1992 wave radiation.

The symptoms are not those that would be expected from micro- wave radiation.” Staff Sgt. Allen Remaly of Rossville, Ind., said 12 of the 43 members of his platoon have lingering symptoms, although he has not been affected. Mr. Stromvall said the Army has determined that the cluster of ailments somehow occurred “in the line of duty”. and not after the troops re- turned to civilian life nearly a year ago. He said that in some cases the Reservists may be re- turned to active duty so they can qualify for treatment in military hospitals. \f"

The congressmen and scientists explored prospects for using the Soviet-made Energia heavy-lift rocket to help build a U.S. space station, for cooperative research on hypersonic aircraft, for conduct- ing joint experiments on the Soviet Mir space station and for further loosening restrictions on exporting U.S. technology to Russia. Russians and Americans eyed each other on video monitors, their words and grainy images beamed through a Soviet satellite from Moscow to New York, to Atlanta and on to Washington. It was the third video telecon- ference by the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which is trying to reach scientific experts without bringing them to Washington. It was the first hookup with Moscow. The Russians and Americans appear eager to share at least some of the technological secrets they Palm Beach Post - March 26, 1992 have tried to withhold throughout the Cold War.

The commission late last month dropped an investigation into com- plaints of political detentions in Syria. It was a consensus decision, Which means no one, including the USS. delegate, moved to keep Syria on the hot seat. In the same month, the State Department published a scorching human rights analysis accusing Syria of everything from torture to withholding freedom of speech, press and assembly. It also charged Syria with holding as many as 7,500 political and security prisoners. Human rights activists have criticized what they call a Bush administration pattern: saying the right words promoting human rights, but letting politics obstruct action. Jack Healey, executive director of Amnesty International, USA, said the administration is trying to “build up” Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in spite of his human rights policies, in the same way Iraq’s Saddam Hussein was wooed prior to the Gulf War. Sentiment for dropping the U.N.

The Near East bureau has more reason to soft-peddle Syria’s hu- man rights conduct.

Florida would lose 2,606 reserve and Na- tional Guard troops in the } next two years, most in Army- affiliated units primarily as- signed to the de- fense of West- ern Europe against the War. Cheney saw Pact. Over the next five years, Che- ney’s plan would eliminate 16.49 percent of the Florida Army Na- tional Guard troops, according to one unreleased Pentagon study. Its calculations showed that only 12 of the 50 states would suffer lighter percentage losses in Army Nation- al Guard troops. “We're not a social welfare agency,” Cheney said. “We're not an employment agency that’s oper- ated on the basis of what makes sense for some member of Con- gress back home in the district. This is a military organization.” ’ “We have to focus on how we defend the nation with less money,” he said. But already, a tempest was building in the Capitol. Asked how Cheney’s proposal was being received in Congress, Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., replied: ‘‘Like a lead balloon.” Cheney’s plan would reverse the Reagan administration’s rapid increase in reserve strength and bring reservists down to 920,000 in 1995 — still 6 percent larger than their strength in 1980, President Carter’s last year in office. Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined Cheney in urging the cuts, saying the end of the Soviet threat made bigger reserve forces unnecessary. A 60-member communications unit in West Palm Beach is the only Palm Beach County unit scheduled to be eliminated.

        "ocr_text": "Most of aid to Soviets still unsent By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Bush administration, under fire for responding slowly to urgent needs in the former Soviet Union, so far has spent less than one- fifth of the $500 million in emergency aid Congress voted for the republics before Thanksgiving. A sluggish start and myriad problems on the ground are drags on progress. Nor has the administration formally proposed a broader package that would help stabilize the repub- lics’ critically weak economies, although officials have promised proposals are in the works and should come out of the White House this week. Of the $500 million already committed, $400 mil- lion was designated by Congress for helping dismantle the old Soviet nuclear program. Apparently none of that money has been spent. The administration has committed $25 million of that to set up a science center to help employ Soviet scientists and keep them from selling their nuclear skills abroad. President Bush said Sunday he’s readying a com- prehensive new plan, though he declined to discuss the scope of the effort, saying only “it will be good.” Bush is reportedly considering a $1 billion contri- bution to stabilize the ruble, as well as fighting for a $12 billion increase in U.S. support for the Internation- al Monetary Fund, Part of the reason for slow progress may be that retired Army Maj, Gen. William Burns took over as head the effort only about three weeks ago. His report to Congress late last week also outlined a thicket of technical problems Americans and Russians are en- countering in trying to figure out how to store and transport massive amounts of fissile material and nuclear weapons, “T never thought I would be ina position to explain why we were not spending money quickly,” Burns told the House Armed Ser- vices Committee. Committee Chairman Les As- pin, D-Wis., had opened the meet- ing asking “why the process is moving so slowly.” Of the remaining $100 million designated for transporting emer- gency stocks of food and medicine + with the aim of preventing a crisis this winter — less than $20 million has been spent, accord- ing to Richard Armitage, the State Department’s coordinator of Hu- manitarian Assistance and Defense Conversion in the CIS. He has been on the job about six weeks. So far 2,200 tons of food, medi- cine and medical supplies have been delivered to the republics un- der Operation Provide Hope. Armi- tage said Provide Hope II should send another 15,000 tons of excess military food and several hundred tons of medicine and supplies into all 12 republics by mid-June. Armitage explained the food Palm Beach Post - March 30, 1992 has “long shelf life” and should still be available if the citizens of the republics need it next winter. Food was not as serious a prob- lem this winter as had been expect- ed, he maintained, though prices were high and caloric intake and nutrition clearly were down. A larger problem is medicine, Armitage said. “It’s the one completely consis- tent item we have found from east to west in the former Soviet Union and in all of the republics — lack of such basic medicines as insulin, any antibiotics, heart medicine. There’s a great lack of all vac- cines,”’ he said. While the former Soviet repub- lics generally are moving ahead with weapons dismantling, U.S. ef- forts to assist have hit one snag after another. For example, con- tainers the U.S. wanted to supply for holding fissile material taken from nuclear weapons were the wrong size and never have been approved by international authori- ties, Burns said. \f"

The “package proposal” de- scribed Monday by State Depart- ment spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler calls for the fifth round of peace talks to begin in Wash- ington on April 27. But it also asks all parties to submit a list of sites “closer to the region” to hold the subsequent round of talks, and says the department | will announce a new site before the April 27 round. Since the peace talks opened last October, Israel has pressed to move negotiations to the Mid- dle East, or at least some place besides Washington. The Arab participants have resisted a change of venue. Besides making logistics eas- ier — negotiators wouldn’t have to travel so far and could consult more easily with their govern- ment leaders — talks would be outside the media spotlight and further from the influence of American officials.

The Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians and Jordanians are ex- pected to meet later this week in Beirut to discuss their response to the proposal. The Palestinians are more disposed than the other Arab ne- gotiators to depart from Wash- ington, since their advisors from, the Palestine Liberation Organi- zation usually are denied visas to enter the United States. The PLO: is unofficially guiding the Pales- tinian negotiators, but cannot participate formally in talks be- cause of Israeli objections. Ruth Yaron, spokeswoman at the Israeli Embassy here, said the proposal clearly links hold- ing the fifth round in Washington with a subsequent.move. “This is pretty much consis- tent with what we would like to see and consistent with what the administration has said — that in due time the talks would move closer to the region,” she said. | \f"
