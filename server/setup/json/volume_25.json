Eighteen months ago, hunks of lard and tinned fish prevailed at this typical government food em- porium. Now privatized, the store sells not only eggs and sausage, but crystal ware, exotic liquors and bright metallic balloons, Yet shoppers still scowl and grimly count out rubles. Working-class Muscovites eye a broader selection, but they suffer from the inflated prices attached to virtually everything they need. In Tokyo, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was beaming Thursday over $3 billion in aid handed to him by leaders at the global economic conference. The money is desperately needed to spur Russia further down the road to a private economy, But if a walk through the Gastronome is any ba- rometer, Mr. Yeltsin's free- market policies have yet to make him a popular man at home.

One day last week, for example, mo chicken was available at Proletarsky Gas- tronome. Some items have gotten cheaper — vodka, for-.instance. (Production had been capped by Mikhail Gorbachev to cut down on alcoholism.) Also, luxury items whose supply had been ar- tificially limited are becoming cheaper. The Proletarsky Gastronome, owned by the government two years ago, has turned into what its director calls a ‘“‘profitable’”’ collective operation owned by the employees. The store’s boss, Oleg Pihza- kov, 48, said the transformation took nearly a year and a half, but workers paid only a “‘symbolic Price”’ for the business. He said the owner-workers now earn more than employees at similar stores — about 375 a month as of July 1. But the price is paid by the customers. it still offers — ‘barely adequate supplies.

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Ekaterinburg, Russia — Im- agine Bill Clinton’s chagrin if Ar- kansas suddenly volunteered to rewrite its relationship with the United States. As if hyperinflation and con- stant power struggles weren’t enough to keep him occupied, Russian President Boris Yeltsin is facing just that. Sverdlovsk, the province of Mr. Yeltsin’s birth and the place he bossed for the Communist Party for 10 years, has declared its semi-independence and deliv- ered a constitutional challenge that Moscow fears could splinter the country before it has a chance to revive itself. It’s as though the centrifugal swirl that flung chunks of territo- ry off the old Soviet Union — and destroyed it — is now nibbling at the mother country. Provinces from the Far East to this Detroit-like bulwark in the Ural Mountains are chafing at leashes held thousands of miles away by Moscow bureau- crats who, it is argued, gouge them with taxes, resist reform and ignore local needs. But Sverdlovsk is the most crucial of three provinces that just this month declared them- selves autonomous republics. Sverdlovsk once had the nick- name of Tankograd, for the ar- mor it supplied the Red Army. Russia’s military-industrial complex still employs nearly 500,000 people, about one-fourth of the work force in the province of 5 million people. It was this region that Francis Gary Powers tried to photograph with cameras mounted on his U- 2 spy plane in 1960. Soviet forces shot him down.

But in a local vote held con- currently with the national refer- endum, more than 80 percent ap- proved the idea of making the province an autonomous re- public. “The oblasts [provinces] transfer money to the center and they don’t even know what it is used for,” said Yevgeny Gra- chev, deputy economist for Sverdlovsk Oblast.

        "ocr_text": " CLAIMANT TO THE THRONE Russia’s oe fidgets a lot Grand duke, 12, touring country his ancestors Eee bare STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Ekaterinburg, Russia — Fighting to suppress royal yawns, the pretender to the Russian throne, 12-year-old Grand Duke Georgy Mikhailovich, fidgeted through a daylong welcome from the city where his czarist ancestors were murdered. Bemedaled Cossack officers, descen- dants of the last czar’s royal coterie, stood and clapped for the pale, 4-foot-8 school- boy. But since democracy is the rage these days, the royalist fawners made up only a small fringe at Tuesday’s ceremonies. “He looked bored,” a Moscow Universi- ty history professor said of the bantam duke, who is on vacation from his English- speaking school in Spain. And a city coun- cilman fired off a petition to the local news- papers warning that restoring the Russian monarchy would re-create a police state. Nonetheless, with the sanction of Rus- sia’s post-Communist authorities, Georgy and his mother and grandmother, along with an entourage of more than 25 ex-no- . blemen and other bureaucrats-in-waiting, have been meandering through Russia by train and riverboat for the past three months, It is their fifth and longest post- Communist visit. This week represents the highlight of his return, for it commemorates the 75th anniversary of the execution of Czar Nicho- las II by Bolshevik revolutionaries on the night of July 16-17, 1918. Any lingering doubts about the royal family’s fate were dispelled last week. Brit- ish scientists said DNA extracted from bones unearthed at a mass grave near Eka- terinburg in 1991 provided irrefutable proof that the bodies were those of the czar and his relatives. And despite a burst of recent British, American and Russian scientific investiga- tions, minor mysteries still surround the fate of Nicholas, his wife Czarina Alexan- dra, their five children, their doctor and VADIM RUSAKOV / Special _ Grand Duke Georgy Mikhailovich, 12, descendant of czars, helps lay the foundation for an Orthodox church in Siberia during a tour of Russia. two of their manservants. Many Western historians, citing the di- aries of Leon Trotsky and other Bolsheviks, have long been on record that Czar Nicho- las, his family and retainers were shot on the personal orders of the Russian Commu- nist leader, Vladimir Lenin. But at a historical conference in Ekate- rinburg, Russian historians said their hunt through KGB files yielded no proof Lenin gave the execution order. ~ And University of Florida pathologist William Maples said a four-year study of the mass grave found no trace of two young missing royals, the czar’s daughter Anasta- — sia, 16, and son Alexei, 13. Mr. Maples called for a renewed hunt by archaeologists to find a rumored “fire pit” near Ekaterinburg where he believes Bolshevik guards incinerated two of the 11 victims. But Georgy shows no signs of acknowl- edging the downside of royal employment. He squirmed through the first 20 minutes of Tuesday’s conference, then left the room. Wearing his blue double-breasted blaz- er and tie with the Romanov crest, he dart- ed among adults in the hallway, pausing to sign autographs in a flamboyant Cyrillic script. Besides passable Russian, Georgy speaks Spanish, French and English. He affectionately held hands and joked with a burly blond guard named Alek, who is on loan from President Boris Yeltsin’s stable of security guards. The scene was generally repeated at stops throughout the day: Georgy sitting briefly for formalities, then cutting out to horse around with bodyguards. He lasted about 10 minutes at tea with the bearded Russian Orthodox archbishop, and even less time at the meeting with mu- nicipal authorities. At City Hall, Georgy left the conference table within minutes to sit at a nearby desk, then inspect a computer, walk over to look out the window, talk to Alek, then go back to the conference table. As the grandson of the last czar’s cousin Vladimir Kirillovich, the young duke has but a slender claim on the Romanov throne. There is an awkward fact, never men- tioned by his handlers: Georgy’s last name is not Romanov. As the son of German Prince Franz-Michael von Hollenzollern, he is a descendant of the Romanov family’s female lineage. Some Romanov genealo- gists say this disqualifies him from suc- cession. Yet one City Hall aide, Victor Mezerya- kov, said he believes this line of the royal family might be back on the throne.again someday in Russia. “Tt could be the same as in Europe,” he said. In Spain and Britain, for example, the monarchy sits but has no power. As for Georgy, the aide said, one shouldn’t dwell on his antics. ‘“He’s only a kid,” Mr. Mezeryakov said.

By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel COX NEWS SERVICE Moscow — A chemical explo- sion in the accident-prone Chelya- binsk-65 nuclear complex spread radioactive elements — possibly including plutonium — into the air, authorities disclosed Monday. A sketchy report released by the Russian Atomic Energy Minis- try’s press office called the inci- dent “insignificant.” There was no reported effort to evacuate vil- lagers from around the once-se- cret Cold War site in Siberia 930 miles east of Moscow. Nonetheless, the Interfax news agency cited official reports saying that radioactive particles had leaked into the atmosphere Satur- day night from a plant that was purifying plutonium-238. Russian news reports said the radioactivity escaped through a ventilator after a 20-liter (5.28- gallon) container exploded inside a reinforced concrete silo. Russian television said the explosion stemmed from an _ unexplained “temporary situation.” Plutonium-238 is used by both Russia and the United States to generate heat inside space cap- sules during space flight. The iso- tope is not a bomb ingredient. It was the second episode this year in which plutonium — one of the world’s most poisonous sub- stances — may have escaped into the atmosphere as a result of a chemical explosion in Russia's ag- ing nuclear-weapons plants. After the previous episode in a nuclear reprocessing complex near Tomsk in April, the Atomic Energy Ministry was strongly crit- icized for issuing belated and un- derstated accounts. Even so, this time there was no public announcement for 48 hours after the explosion. It took place at the so-called Mayak Com- bine at the secret city of Chelya- binsk-65, a suburb of the larger city of Chelyabinsk. During its heyday as a producer of plutonium for warheads, Che- lyabinsk-65 was the site of two of the world’s worst nuclear acci- dents. On Sept. 29, 1957, a huge steel tank containing nuclear wastes exploded, spewing radioac- tivity and causing the evacuation of nearly 11,000 people. In the summer of 1967, a lake used to store radioactive waste in- side the Chelyabinsk-65 complex dried up. Wind spread radioactive particles, forcing 9,000 people to evacuate.

        "ocr_text": "Vying for the soul of Russia Lines drawn: As foreign missionaries pour into Russia, a new law to restrict their activities has the su rt of the Orthodox Ch urch. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Nearly 1,500 Russians dipped into bap- tismal pools Saturday and accepted the gospel preached by Jehovah’s Witnesses, a bitter- sweet moment accented by fears that Russia soon will curb free worship once again. Americans, Finns and Japa- nese were among the throng clapping endlessly as lines of Russian men and women in bath- ing suits were dunked in three portable swimming pools in the religion’s first mass baptism in Moscow. Tears and prayers in 11 languages filled a stadium more used to rowdy soccer fans than 25,000 pious celebrants. Yet clouding the joyous mile- stone for the long-persecuted group were fears that a new Rus- sian law soon will fetter efforts by all foreign missionaries to spread their faith. “This one may be the last [group baptism]. That’s what some of the Russian brothers tol: us,” said delegate Delbert Jack: son, 36, a railroad signalman fro: Fargo, N.D. “I am glad we are here to show them support. It gives them a shot in the arm if they have to go underground The new flowering of diverse spirituality in Russia could be stunted under a law pushed by the Russian Orthodox Church, passed by the Russian Parlia- ment and awaiting only the sig- nature of President Boris Yeltsin to take effect. The law, passed July 14, is one sign that strong elements of Russian society want to brake the dislocating change that con- tinues to rumble across the coun- alien social and economic values. The deputy who sponsored the bill, the Rev. Vyacheslav Po- losin, said his amendments to a 1990 law stipulate “that foreign- ers are denied the right to carry. out missionary, publishing and advertising and propagandistic activities.” They would not be permitted to recruit new mem- bers, he said. Father Polosin, an Orthodox priest and chairman of the Par- liament’s Committee on Free- dom of Conscience and Religion, cast the legislation as regulation of foreigners’ “labor activities” and no infringement on freedom of worship. However, another Orthodox priest and legislator, maverick liberal Gleb Yakunin, said the re- strictions constitute ‘“‘a new dis- criminatory law” aimed at bene- fiting the current administration of the Russian Orthodox Church, “which is using its lobby in the Supreme Soviet to muzzle all competing organizations.” Under communism, Father Yakunin spent years in prison for. criticizing the regime, and he of- ten accused the church hierar- chy of being too compliant. The law’s sponsors say it is merely aimed at calming a chaotic climate, which now accommo- dates everything from shaved- and-robed Hare Krishnas mass- ing in Red Square to TV preaching by American evangelists — an ex- pensive promotion against which the Russian Orthodox Church Says it cannot com; Foreign-based religious groups would need state accredi- tation, but requirements haven’t been set. They may have to affili- ate with a Russian church or re- establish themselves as a Rus- sian church even to hold services. About 200 foreign religious groups are registered with the government now, officials said, but they still would need new ac- creditation. As many as 1,000 groups are believed to be converts across this huge nation spiritually dominated for centu- ries by the Orthodox Church, then by Communist atheism. Concerns already have been lodged by U.S. Mee diplomats and senators and by at least seven for- eign-based denominations, who claim the legisla- tion threatens a return to old-style repression and a closed society. Last week, a senior U.S. diplomat in Moscow pointed to the pending law as the sole exception to Russia's charge toward freedom and democracy, making a rare acknowledgement that U.S. diplo- § mats are trying to sway domestic policy in anoth- er country, While Westerners and reformers want Mr. Yeltsin to oppose the restrictions, the Orthodox Church is promoting them. Given Russia's politi- cal chaos, it is unclear what will happen if Mr. Yeltsin refuses to sign the law and Parliament tries to override him. The Russian Orthodox Church, which claims 60 million members, is angling to reassert itself as a powerhouse of Russian society by aligning with conservative, anti-reform elements. The Russian Orthodox Church — one of sever: al ancient jurisdictions that constitute the Ortho- dox Church — may symbolize Russian culture more than any institution or force. With its Byzan- tine-style traditions, it was a slender lifeline of spirituality during the Mongol occupation, then became the state religion through the reign of the czars, But the church today — conservative, nation- Alistic and authoritarian — has been discredited in the eyes of some Russians. After initial perse- cutions that killed many believers and most cler- gy, it weakly survived the ensuing Communist decades by often cooperating with Soviet authori- ties, who used the church as a cover for spying both at home and abroad, according to recently published archives. Some Orthodox in Russia today are loyal to foreign-based bishops and shun the official Rus- sian hierarchy, and they might be affected by the new law themselves, Associated Three thousand Russians were tized Saturday in Moscow as Jehovah's Wit- nesses. The of such groups wor- ries many Russian Orthodox traditionalists. The sight of tens of thousands of converts to religions scarcely known in Russia before is a jolt that helped produce the new law. The Jehovah’s Witnesses are not newcomers to Russia. They suffered more than 40 years of re- ligious oppression, using exile not to languish but to spread their religious word underground. Vasily Kalin, whose family was deported to the camps in Siberia when he was a child, said the Witnesses have nearly 40,000 members in this country now that they can operate freely. “Stalin’s purpose was to destroy the Jehovah's Witnesses, but thanks to his help a great expan- sion took place,” said Mr. Kalin, chairman of the Russian organization. “Stalin lost.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 25, 1993 \f"

        "ocr_text": "What happened to crown jewels: of Russia’s czar? KGB pa P pers say Stalin's police unearthed treasure 60 years ago By Joseph and Marcia Kuroee STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Russia is launching a worldwide search for its missing crown jewels — in- cluding a diamond the size of a walnut — in the wake of a recently published KGB account of how secret police unearthed a czarist trove 60 year's ago, The three-volume secret police archive tells a mystery-laden story of agents forcing a Russian Orthodox nun and a fish merchant to lead them to the priceless collection buried on instructions of Czar Nicholas II. But the KGB archive — reproduced by two Rus- sian historians in book form last month — also cre- ates a new puzzle: If the baubles were in the hands of Communist dictator Josef Stalin's police six dec- ades ago, where are they today? “We have nothing like these things in our collec tion now,” said Irina Polinina, head of the Kremlin Museum's renowned diamond collection. “Maybe it was sold, maybe it was recut and sold, Maybe it is still in the vaults of Gohran [the former name of the Soviet state treasury). Who knows?” In fish merchant’s basement According to the KGB documents, in November 1933 the Soviet secret police found the late Em- press Alexandra's 100-carat diamond brooch. With it were two glass jars full of crown jewels, includ- ing a diadem, a diamond coat of arms and a pair of hatpins tipped with 36-carat diamonds, Internal reports by OGPU, the predecessor agency of the KGB, said a total of 154 items of jew- elry were found in the fish merchant's basement in Tobolsk, 750 miles east of Moscow. Czar Nicholas, his wife and children were held captive there be- fore their execution in July 1918, The archives valued the collection at 3.2 million gold rubles, a pre-Revolutionary currency unit that would have been worth $970,000 at the time of the czar’s death, Jewelry experts said it would be im- possible to place a current value on the collection without seeing the items, In New York, diamond expert Laurence Krashes of Harry Winston jewelers said that as far as he knew, the Soviet govern- ment auctioned off all the czar’s jewels it recovered in a huge Moscow sale in 1925. He said he had never heard of a second batch of jewels found in the 1930s. . Historians Benyamin Alekse- vich and Mikhail Denisevich, who uncovered the KGB documents, said that despite attempts to pin down Moscow officials, they had been unable to learn what hap- pened to the jewels after 1933. Officials responsible for managing Russia’s national trea- sures said the historians’ find- ings caught them by surprise. Evgeny Bychkov, head of the huge state diamond consortium, said he had never known of the KGB documents. But he said they appeared to shed new light on what happened to the czar’s enormous treasures after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. Mr. Bychkov said his agency soon would begin an internation- al inquiry aimed at finding whether major Romanov gems are still in private Western col- lections. Mr. Bychkov said the inquiry, originally intended to trace crown jewels known to have been auctioned in 1925, would be ex- panded in light of the KGB docu- ments to target jewels listed as: having been recovered in 1933. Mr. Bychkov and two other Officials speculated that Soviet authorities may have sold the gems abroad to raise money dur- ing a food shortage between 1933 and 1936. But they said they had no proof. According to the recently re- leased records, agents of the Sta- linist secret police found the trail of the missing jewels in the fall of , 1933 when a priest in Tobolsk’ gave them the name of one of the empress’s former cham- bermaids. Under interrogation, the maid gave agents the name of a nun at a nearby monastery. She said the nun had helped conceal royal jewels entrusted to Ortho- dox clergymen who attended the gs royal family in its final months. The secret police files say the nun, Marfa Andreyevich, broke down and told how she had hid- den the jewels in a well and in the graveyard of the Ivanov monas- tery near Tobolsk in the early 1920s. Increasingly afraid of being caught, “I resolved to throw the jewelry into the Irtysh River,” she was quoted as saying in her — confession.

When confronted by police agents, Mr. Kornilov also report- edly confessed the jewels’ whereabouts. “I never looked at the jewels. I never took them away,” he insisted. : A few days later, agents dug up the jewels, according to the documents, which say police continued their search for more czarist jewels throughout 1934. One suspect, a businessman’s wife identified as Annil Pecha- kos, is portrayed as having com- mitted suicide in 1934 by swal- lowing sections of an aluminum fork. Ms. Pechakos allegedly told the police that she knew where some jewels were hidden. Then, according to the files, she died from swallowing the fork before police could find the hiding place. Seven years later, in 1941, the three-volume dossier called “File Number 2094, Romanov Jewelry” was ordered closed. 3. aieere a diamond Fin 4. ‘Diamond half moon, totaling 70 carats. a 5, Balt ot staal pear wes {1 . _large rubies and a sprinkling of : diamonds and rubies.

The 35-year-old ally of Rus- sian President Boris Yeltsin said the Central Bank acted alone in rushing the Uzbeks a cash infusion of 50 million ru- bles (roughly $50,000), even though it is up to his Finance Ministry to dispense Russian state credit. “The bank has disavowed its own explanations of reasons for the exchange of money and de- prived Russia of all its possible advantages,” Mr. Fyodorov said.

Under the Russian system, he reports to Parliament and not to Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Fyodorov’s revelation that the Central Bank favored the Uzbeks with easy rubles will only add to the torrent of complaints about why the Rus- sian Central Bank unilaterally announced last weekend that all pre-1993 rubles were being junked. Adding to the bitterness was TV coverage of Mr. Fyodorov’s statement, which showed pic- tures of Central Bank printing presses churning out boxloads of the highly coveted new ru- bles, supposedly for Uzbek- istan. The Interfax news agency reported that a “special air- plane” on “Friday hauled enough of the new rubles from Russia to Uzbekistan so that the Uzbek government could pay all wages, pensions and student grants for the first half of Au- gust. \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Norilsk, Russia — Because America wants to breathe clean air, this city lies smothered in a cloud of sulfur dioxide that clogs lungs, drives away herds of rein- deer and fouls Arctic air as far away as Canada. ; Houseplants wither, children are kept indoors, old people wheeze, all for the love of plati- num — a love that survived the harshest years of the Cold War because of America’s love affair with the automobile. Out of this immense mining and smelting complex comes the platinum that is sprinkled through the catalytic converters of U.S. cars to help reduce nox- ious exhaust. One of every five cars on U.S. roads contains a catalytic con- verter made with platinum and related rare metals produced in Norilsk. But with the collapse of the Soviet dictatorship, the people of Norilsk have become free to question the sacrifice of their air for ours —: as have similar com- munities in ecological disaster zones. “When we developed our pro- duction, we didn’t have in mind that it will be harmful for us and Fz insist ee 5885 JOSEPH ALBRIGHT / Stai Russians in Norilsk are surrounded by smokestacks spewing pollution into the gray sky.

The city’s smoke-belching factories pour an astonishing 2.5 million tons of pollutants into the air each year. They are blamed for high cancer and infant mor- tality rates, as well as for an ever-widening swath of waste- land in the surrounding region, where even moss and lichen can- not grow. Pollution has killed 125,000 acres of surrounding forest. ' “It’s impossible to live here because of harmful conditions,” said Vladimir Lylim, editor of the daily newspaper Polar Prav- daand. “On the other hand, we cannot leave here because we don’t have enough money.” But as residents awaken to the personal costs they pay, it might not be long before cities such as Norilsk demand that fac- tories be shut down, or at least that the plants charge enough for the metals and re- sources they produce to repair some of the damage. “People shouldn’t live here for a long time,” warned botanist Tatiana Vlasova of the Far North Agricultural Institute, who esti- mates that the Norilsk no-life zone is growing 5S percent to 10 percent a year. She said the only way to re- store vegetation is by shutting down all industrial activity. “Then it would take 200 years,” she said. The curiously sterile city, where 300,000 people battle bit- ing whips of dust and try to hu- manize broad avenues of ponder- ous buildings by adding blue, rose and yellow paint, exempli- fies how disasters quietly grew during the Soviet reign. For 30 years, until 1953, No- rilsk was a secret city not even shown on Soviet maps. After platinum was discov- ered in the area in 1924, the young Soviet government of Jo- sef Stalin built an industry and a city on the sweat of labor camp prisoners. According to the Norilsk His- torical Museum, 750,000 victims of Stalin’s purges labored through Arctic blizzards to cre- ate Norilsk. Thousands died in winter temperatures that rou- tinely hit 60 below zero. Once the government ac- knowledged Norilsk’s existence in 1953, prisoner labor was phased out and Soviets willing to defy isolation and brutal condi- tions began arriving. The incen- tive: salaries five to eight times higher than those on “the main- land,” as the rest of Russia is known to those in the outpost 1,700 miles northeast of Moscow. Norilsk remained a closed city for almost 40 more years.

Petty transgressions, too, proliferate throughout the coun- try, signalling a widespread lack. of respect for authority. Average citizens don’t bother to buy bus tickets costing less than half a penny apiece. And entire regions have simply declared that they are independent, not bound by the laws of the central Russian government. A diphtheria epidemic grips Russia, and new outbreaks of old diseases, such as cholera and an- thrax, are appearing. People fear that vaccinations in poorly equipped, unsanitary clinics are too risky. And Moscow teacher Nina Mamina says young women to- day are refraining from having children because they are so un- certain about the future. “The only women sure of themselves are the wives of businessmen,” she explains. Buttressing her observation, the newspaper “Arguments and Facts” reported Friday that the birth rate dropped 12 percent in Russia in 1992 from the previous year. While a small percentage of Russians have built astonishing | profits from the turn to a free- | market system, even those busi- | nessmen who operate above- board often are equated with crooks by a population still sus- picious after 70 years of anti- capitalist propaganda. The accumulation of woes, in- cluding consumer prices far out- stripping the increase of wages and pensions, is leading more Russians to believe they would have been better off had the pro- Communist coup succeeded two years ago, according to a new poll. The poll found that 14 per- cent of Russians hold that view now, compared with only 4 per- cent two years ago, according to The Associated Press. Despite complaints and pes- simism, however, Russians would give up much positive change if they did allow democ- racy to fail. A host of freedoms taken for granted in the West are newly available, from the free press to free political expression. Yet some proponents of de- ’mocracy, such as former KGB Gen. Oleg Kalugin, now an activ- ist in the democracy movement, fear another coup attempt. “Disappointment has grown into apathy, which prevails among the considerable part of our population,” General Kalu- gin said. “These people will not go onto the streets if something happens. They will not defend the White House.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 21, 1993 \f"

Unscientific reconnaissance in downtown streets and stores sug- gests that perhaps one-fourth of the under-30 females wear either a miniskirt or a cross. What’s more, there is a dis- cernible trend toward a sexy- demure combo: wearing both a short skirt and a cross.

Real Russians started wearing the skirt-and-cross ensemble before Julia. “I only wear my cross with a certain style of dress, with an open neck,” explains Lena Griglak, 23, shopping in her midthigh black gathered skirt and low-cut turquoise jersey. “If I had a closed blouse on, I wouldn’t wear it,” says Ms. Griglak, who explains she has been a Christian since she was 18 but “not a fanatic.” Ludmilla Lukova, 27, says she Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 29, 1993 has worn a Russian Orthodox cross since she was 15.

By Marcia Kumstel and joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS rkutsk, Russia Three women — two Russians and an American have em- barked on a punishing 6,000-mile bike expedition that they hope will stretch Russians’ limited vi- sion of the role of women. Led by New Hampshire gym- mastics teacher Juni Pierce, 49, the women are bicycling over steppes and mountains, through polluted industrial cities and Si- berian woodland hamlets, across the breadth of Russia from Vlad- ivostok, on the Sea of Japan, westward to St. Petersburg, on the Gulf of Finland. *“Sometimes, it’s really scary,”’ said Ms. Pierce. ““These trucks go so fast and kick up so much dust, you worry that they won’t see you.’”’ Ms. Pierce organized and largely financed the $20,000 ex- pedition as a personal challenge as well as to make an imprint on the emerging democratic Russia. “One goal is to show Russian women that they can set goals for themselves, to show them they can dream,’’ Ms. Pierce said. -““Even if just one person tries to change their lifestyle and do something different, it’s worth it.”? She also wants to take back to America a broader view of to- day’s Russia. ‘“There’s not just the KGB and communism and poverty,” said Ms. cited scores of wildflowers and the quick, warm hospitality of average Russians as attributes ‘unknown to most Americans. 4qmericans declined offer Ms. Pierce, a teacher in the Nashua, N.H., public school sys- tem, was at an Intourist Hotel, enjoying one of a handful of over- might comfort breaks scheduled for the four-month tour. Her Russian companions from St. Pe- tersburg — Tanya Beznosenko, 43, also a teacher, and Galya Kli- movich, 45, an engineer planned to forgo hotels and camp out for the duration. The American found the Rus- Sian bikers through a mutual friend she met while teaching on temporary assignment in St. Pe- tersburg a few years ago. Ms. Pierce failed to find American cyclists willing to help undertake the tiresome arrangements for the tour, as well as make a stab at learning rudimentary Russian. So the group is only three women, plus a young Russian man, Volodya Smaryshev, who drives the van with their camp- ing “gear, food and spare equipment. The cyclists expressed de- light at the response of Russians they have encountered on the road, whom they often leave with a tailor-made T-shirt or button depicting two women bicycling on a globe, arms across each oth- er’s shoulders, with Russian and American flags in the background. *“*“For me, the most surprising thing was the reaction of the peo- ple, especially the women,’ said Ms. Klimovich. Ms. Pierce described one stop at a gas station about 35 miles east of Blagoveshchensk on the Chinese border, where three female attendants said they had no gas to refuel the group’s van. But after a blitzkrieg of questions about America and families and women biking across a continent, the spell- bound attendants tapped into their VIP reserve tank. “‘Women are really happy to see us, but men don’t seem to know what to think. They’re sort of neutral,’’ Ms. Pierce said. Daunting physical obstacles Less than halfway through the trip they began July 5, the cy- clists literally came to the end of the road. The main roadway was suddenly replaced by tiny ones that were not solid enough to support their van. So they and the van piled onto a train for 900 miles after Blago- veshchensk.

Ms. Pierce, who has cycled in Europe and China, and who turns S50 on Aug. 31, said the trip is no vacation. She described bone-weary . nights, dubious food, debilitating heat and heart-stopping mo- ments on mountain roads where trucks barrel through hairpin turns. ““‘We had personnel problems, financial problems and logistical problems. But we all agreed to finish the trip,’’ Ms. Pierce said. “If we can’t get along, how can governments?’’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - August 30, 1993 \f"

        "ocr_text": "XS Ts A treasure-trove for science By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Lake Baikal, Russia — Can you imagine a lake so voluminous that it could cover the state of Georgia with 500 feet of ice water? Or that this natural reservoir — one-fifth of the world’s fresh water supply — has sur- vived 25 million to 50 million years without turning into a cesspool? Or that it is so remote that evolution has yielded a unique species of chubby, furry freshwater seals, along with 1,500 other species of fish and plants found nowhere else on Earth? Because Lake Baikal is the deepest, old- est and among the purest sources of water on Earth, it is enticing an ever-growing riv- ii ulet of the world’s scientists to this southern Siberian plateau 75 miles from Mongolia. With the opening of Russia, the annual num- ber of visiting scientists has quadrupled to! more than 100 over the last four years. “Tt is Russia’s single greatest natural re-. source,” says Charles Goldman, whose spe- , cialty is limnology — the study of fresh wa- ter — at the University of California at Da- vis, “It is of inestimable value to Russia and the rest of the world.” Probing Lake Baikal’s secrets With diving suits, DNA-cloning centri- fuges and gas chromatographs, scientists are prying at the secrets of life, evolution and climatological change. And with these results; » Cracking the mystery of the origin of Baikal’s 60,000 freshwater seals, the world’s only large herd not living in salt wa- ter. Molecular biologists from Russia’s Lim- nological Institute here compared strands of DNA from a Baikal seal’s liver to similar so-called “mitochondrial DNA” strands tak- en from Atlantic and Pacific seals. DNA codes of the Atlantic and Pacific seals were almost identical, suggesting those two seal species are closely related, But the DNA of Baikal seals had six or seven identifiable differences from the nucleo- tides of their seaborne cousins. Limnological Institute director Michael Grachev says this “molecular clock” indi- cates the Baikal seals branched genetically from the Pacific and Atlantic seals about 1 million years ago. This fits geological evidence showing that this is when a deepening arctic freeze stoppered great Siberian rivers. The rivers reversed course, flowing south and west toward Baikal. And — presumably — along came the distant ancestors of Baikal seals fleeing the growing ice pack. > Tracing the end of the latest ice age and the start of modern climate. The U.S. Geological Survey, working with Russian experts, has documented a fateful shift in the climate. Studies of a core of sediment from the deepest lake bottom found two layers. Abundant in one layer were algae called diatoms, while the layer VETICAal ad NO Wace diatoms. Lake Baikal, the deepest, oldest and among the purest sources of water on Earth, spans back mil- lions of years and is home to 1,500 s; cies of plants and fish found nowhere else. “It is of inestimable value to Russia and the rest of the world,” says a Uni- versity of California scientist. WILLIAM BERRY / Staff” Applying carbon-dating techniques to the sediments, the scientists calculated that the lake’s character changed about 6,000 B.C. They believe that a rise in the world’s average temperature melted the ice age’s cig temporarily deluging Baikal with gunk. For at least two millenniums, Baikal’s water was evidently too turbulent for the al- gae. Eventually, the glaciers melted and the diatoms could grow. How did Baikal start? Probably about 50 million years ago, the Indian subcontinent barreled into Asia, re- sulting in a cataclysmic crack in the Asian land mass. As the tectonic plates wrenched apart, a rift was formed and the rivers of Si- beria and Mongolia gradually filled it to form Lake Baikal. It is a region still prone to enormous earthquakes, and the Earth's movement has reshaped Baikal from three separate basins to one. Here, as in the once-pristine Himalayas, pollution threatens. Baikal water is not as pure as it was be- fore 1957, when a pollution-spewing de- fense plant arose on Baikal’s southern coastline. Originally producing cellulose for airplane tires, the factory now makes paper and chemical feedstocks for rayon. Every day the factory discharges 300,000 cubic yards of treated wastewater into Baikal. A trickle of DDT, PCBs and phe- nols slips into the lake. . Constantly escaping also is a film of bac- teria from the plant’s organic filtration sys- tem. The factory’s bacteria are measurable within a semicircle 18 miles in diameter, covering the southern tip of the lake. The ring of bacteria is expanding at one-half mile a year. In part because of the bacteria, scien- tists have found localized summer algae “blooms” in the waters near the cellulose factory. Similar “hot spots” of green slime occur 300 miles to the north, near the mouth of the polluted Barguzin River. But the Siberian winter freezes the lake surface for four months, and the water tem- perature stays in the 40s and 50s even in the ‘balmiest days of August. So organisms grow slowly. Trout may threaten native omul Scientists are charting intricacies of life in the fragile underwater world, in part for ammunition against further development that would endanger it, To the Limnological Institute’s Dr. Gra- chev, there is an even more dramatic threat: Can Baikal’s native salmonlike fish called the omul, which accounts for two-thirds of the commercial catch, survive an onslaught of rainbow trout? Last year, three rainbow fingerlings — never before seen in this part of Siberia — were caught by fishetmen in the Angara River, which flows out of Baikal, The trout had escaped from a fish hatchery, which since has been relocated, Scientists don’t yet know whether other rainbows might reach Baikal and be capable of multiplying in its frigid depths, But if they establish themselves, they will com- pete for the same food as the Baikal omul. “This could be an ecological catastrophe for Baikal,” said Dr. Grachev. “It may be too late, ... Rainbow trout has extinguished many, many species in America.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - September 4, 1993 \f"

In Lithuania, the Roman Catholic Church predominates, while in Russia the Russian Or- thodox Church has tried to con- strain the activities of foreign churches, including the Catholic Church. The watchful, somewhat re- served crowds that greeted the pope as he rode in his Popemo- bile through downtown Vilnius reflected the troubles of which the pontiff spoke. The square around the cathedral and streets leading to it held thousands of faithful, but they weren’t filled to capacity. The Roman Catholic Church was a mainstay in Lithuania’s ef- . forts to defend its national identi- ty and culture while it was ruled by the Soviet regime. Many priests and religious activists were exiled to Siberia, Independence, declared by Lithuanian activists in 1990 but not fully realized until a year lat- er, has brought Westernization, a new emphasis on materialism and a government run by former Communists who are not anti-re- ligious but are secular. The Rev.

By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Cox News Service VILNIUS, Lithuania — Standing amidst graves of the last victims of Soviet violence here, Pope John Paul II warned nations Sunday against “sinister new adventures” ignited by blind ideology and national pride. And he told the mourning fam- ilies of the slain that they must forgive their longtime communist oppressors and reject “the temp- tation of vengeance which always leads into useless labyrinths of hatred.” On the second day of his first visit to the former Soviet Union, the pontiff directed messages of conciliation to nations and to in- dividuals, raising the specter of new wars like the bloody out- breaks that have riddled the for- mer communist empire. He reminded one audience that Marxism “was not the only trage- dy of our century” that caused suffering based on ideological excesses. “How can we forget here the monstrous violence caused by Nazism, especially toward the Jewish people, offered as a holo- caust in the name of a supposed racial primacy and an insane plan of domination?” he said. Critics have faulted the Roman Catholic Church for having been slow to condemn Nazi atrocities and to resist the death camps where 200,000 Jews from Lithua- nia were among those killed. His speech referred to the his- tory of victimization suffered by this country. The most notorious example was the 1939 Molotov- Ribbentrop agreement in which Germany ceded Lithuania to the Soviets. At an outdoor Mass attended by 130,000 people in a steady drizzle, the pope set an example of forgiveness. In what appeared to be an ap- peal on behalf of the Russian mi- norities still living in the three Baltic nations he visits on this trip, John Paul II expressed hope that Russia will find peace “both inside and outside her borders.” Lithuania’s Russian minority, less than 10 percent of the popu- lation, gained widespread politi- cal rights following independence. But Russians have faced discriminatory laws in Estonia and Latvia, where Rus- sians respectively make up 30 percent and 34 percent of the populations. The most moving event in the 73-year-old pope’s schedule Sun- day was his morning visit to the graves of Lithuanians killed dur- ing the last days of struggle for freedom from the Soviet commu- nist regime in 1991. In the lushly forested ceme- tery, the pope spoke to a cluster of relatives of the citizens consid- ered martyrs here. Thirteen were killed in Janu- ary, 1991, when Soviet tanks barged into a nationalist demon- stration at the television tower, and another six were border guards shot execution-style by Soviet troops the following June. “May there grow on these crosses new resolutions of love, of hope and of forgiveness,” the pope said.

The area has long been a target of American nuclear war planners since it is the site of the huge Sovi- et-built missile production facility. Moscow’s Channel 1 evening news showed film of ripped piping and scattered debris but did not make clear whether the explosion involved the intercontinental mis- sile production facilities. Whether the explosion involved missile fuel was unknown, but it was clear that authorities were taken aback by the magnitude of the blast. “Tt was an explosion of enor- mous power,” said the announcer. “The emergency service does not have any analogies in the field of metallurgy.” In Washington, Ukraine Embas- sy press attache Dmitri Markov said he had no details on the blast. State Department officials in Washington said late Wednesday that they were unaware of the explosion. The Channel 1 report said the explosion centered on a building that was under repairs. It said de- bris was flung hundreds of meters, destroying buildings in its path. The accident came at a sensitive time in relations between Russia and Ukraine, since some Russian military officials are charging that Ukrainian scientists are trying to tinker with Russian-controlled in- tercontinental missiles to remove the control mechanisms that keep them from firing without Mos- cow’s permission.

The job not only would require monitoring the withdrawal of some 4,000 Russian troops, but also transferring west- ern know-how and principles to a former Soviet republic suffering a rugged hangover of communism. He didn’t expect to lose his $50,000-a-year pension and jeopar- dize his American citizenship, es- pecially not after a decorated ca- reer in Korea and in the Special Forces in Vietnam. “T’m an American citizen. I’m an American army officer,” Einseln said recently. “My country is the United States. My president is Clinton. I just happen to work here, trying to help build a nation.” He acquiesced to the Estonian president’s request because he was the most experienced Esto- nian-speaking officer in the world who didn’t grow up in the Soviet military apparatus. He is clearly \" still perplexed that: his idealistic mission could go so awry. The U.S. government simply has applied a law against Americans becoming mercenary soldiers. It strips pension benefits — for life — from any retired officer who joins the military service of another country. In his downtown office, which virtually overlooks the harbor where he fled Estonia with his mother at age 13, one day before Soviet troops invaded Talinn in 1944, Einseln acknowledged the law. “There may be some obscure law, but you know, there’s the let- ter of the law and spirit of the law,” he said. “I don’t believe they have to doit.” This week, the Senate passed an amendment by fellow Vietnam veteran U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-- Ariz., that would permit retired of- ficers such as Einseln to retain pensions if they receive approval to work abroad from the Secretary of State and the Secretary of De- fense. The measure must be ap- proved by the House, which has yet to consider it, before it can be- come law. Scott Celley, McCain’s press sec- retary, said there appears to be no House opposition. If approved, the measure could be applied retroac- tively to save Einseln’s pension, he said. Einseln was not optimistic that the State Department would go along, even if the law is changed. He seemed more assured that the American Embassy here will suc- ceed in helping him retain his U.S. citizenship, which he said authori- ties also have questioned.

To protect his foot- ing, stage hands swabbed the stage with towels as he sang. The pyrotechnic performance, set in a 100,000-seat soccer stadi- um, was the first big high-tech Western rock concert in Russia since the fall of communism. The promoter priced tickets ranging from $18 to $120 in a country where the subway costs only 1 penny and university professors earn $40 a month. One of the biggest ovations for Jackson came when he reached back to sing a medley of his less metallic oldies, including I'l) Be There. Printing house worker Lena Kruglyak, 20, said she traveled 400 miles from St. Petersburg and stood outside Jackson’s hotel for three days to catch a glimpse of her idol.

        "ocr_text": "joseph Albright ~ ad Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Russian Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin was in command of his country early today after winning the blessing of the KGB, the military and the state television in his bloodless coup against Russia’s hard-line parliament. In the old days of Soviet rule, such swift backing by those cen- ters of power would have as- sured the 62-year-old Yeltsin a lifetime lease on the Kremlin. But in the chaos attending the crackup of an empire, Yelt- sin still faces threats aplenty in the days ahead: labor strikes, an oil shortage, distant regions re- fusing to pay taxes, even the Russian anarchist tradition of assassination. The rosy-cheeked president felt comfortable enough to stroll through Moscow's downtown Pushkin Square on Wednesday, telling astonished passers by: “The majority of Russian re- gions support me as president in my resolute actions.” But as news dribbled in from across Russia’s 11 time zones, it became clear the support out- side Moscow was far from uni- versal. The opposition, so far tenta- tive and scattered, seemed to center among holdover Commu- nist city officials thousands of miles east of Moscow. News re- ports.said the municipal legisla- tive councils in the big industrial cities of Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Khabarovsk and Magadan issued statements opposing or question- ing the constitutionality of Yelt- sin’s dissolution of the Congress of People’s Deputies and his as- sertion that replacement elec- tions would be held in De- cember.

He said most Russians “support me as president in my resolute actions.” may soon depart for regions wherever local officials try to undermine Moscow’s edict. World leaders, including President Clinton, rallied around Yeltsin, but world stock markets continued their tumble from the uncertainty attending Yeltsin’s bold “ukase.” The German mark also dropped as_ investors jumped to gold and oil as safe havens. But in Moscow and other cit- ies, one of the most notable fea- tures of the event was how little public emotion it evoked. “Peo- ple are just waiting for some- thing more to happen,” said Ser- gei Zabolotnev, 24, an unem- ployed Muscovite. The main Russian evening TV broadcast broke into its cov- erage with an unconfirmed re- port that submachine guns were being passed out to anti-Yeltsin partisans guarding the make- shift barricades around the par- liament building in Moscow. But by early today, the num- bers of pro-Communist protest- ers arrayed around the sprawl- ing complex had dwindled to a symbolic presence of a few hun- dred. There were no subma- chine guns in sight, only bon- fires, red flags and some dis- carded vodka bottles. Inside the parliament build- ing, members were wondering what to do next after their angry vote to start impeachment pro- ceedings against Yeltsin had been ignored by the Russian mil- itary and international commu- nity, and played down by state television. Parliament Chairman Rus- lan Khasbulatov called for troops to disobey Yeltsin and urged a general strike, “This putsch will collapse with a crash,” he said in a hope- ful moment. Later, he an- nounced that he had a list of “Joyal” military units that might . be deployed in support of the parliament, but he declined to name them. Yeltsin owed his apparent victory to the remarkably stal- wart support from his defense minister, paratrooper Gen. Pa- vel Grachev, a longtime Yeltsin loyalist who had seemed cool to some of his boss’s policies in re- cent weeks. Clad in his general’s uni- form, a smiling Grachev shook hands with Yeltsin before TV cameras, adding that Yeltsin could count on “full support” from the armed forces. Underlining Grachev’s sup- port of Yeltsin’s legitimacy, and sending a message to world lead- ers, a Defense Ministry spokes- man said “the nuclear chain of command remains as it was be- fore yesterday’s events.

        "ocr_text": "[con joins Russian melee * Cellist Rostropovich, along with Solzhenitsyn’s son and Washington’s National Symphony, returns from exile By MARCIA KUNSTEL AND JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Cor News Service Moscow: The fitful mix of politics and arts that nourished genera- tions of Russians — and destroyed some as well — foments again this weekend as two exiled sons have come home to glorify their culture amid a political mael- strom. The names in Russia are leg- end: Rostropovich and Solzheni- tsyn. They will cause a stir, if not outright trouble. “T would have arrived whatever had happened, in any case,” Mstislav Rostropovich, in his last season as conductor of Washing- ton’s National Symphony Orches- tra, said at a news conference Thursday. What surprised him, he said, was that the whole orchestra showed up, too, in spite of the political trauma that broke out here Tuesday. That was the day | Russian President Boris Yeltsin bounced his parliament and raised Russian political conflict to a tem- perature short of warfare. Openly a Yeltsin advocate, this is the same Rostropovich who 25 years ago denied the Communist system, rather than his principles, by standing for the rights of artists gagged under Soviet dominion. For that the cellist and conductor lost his own rights to perform here, so, when stripped of Soviet citizenship in 1978, he took his tal- ents to exile. The Solzhenitsyn on this trip is of a younger generation, the 21- year-old pianist son of unyielding social critic Alexander Solzheni- tsyn, one of the artists Rostropov- ich defended. Communism drove the Solzhe- nitsyn family into exile when Ignat was 18 months old, and the boy is making his first trip home, his de- but before the demanding Russian audience. Rostropovich, Solzhenitsyn and the orchestra will not be welcome by everyone during this time of turmoil, when the old order is ing a stand, if not to turn back the clock, then at least to slow its hands. The two men — by their own words, and the orchestra, a sym- bol of the America whose presi- dent solidly backs Yeltsin — want the clock to speed forward. They are in the Yeltsin camp. The opposition includes Musco- vites manning barricades with guns to keep anyone from evicting the parliament Yeltsin declared nonexistent. The orchestra’s major event will be an outdoor performance in Red Square on Sunday, where it will play the work of Russian com- posing giants Prokoviev and seine cannon and pealing of Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture. In this open venue in this un- settled time, with this emotional music, they will surely draw at least random catcalls from the Yeltsin opposition, and will be lucky if that is all. The ebullient Rostropovich doesn’t veil his politics. On Thurs- day, he spoke of Yeltsin with awe, and openly denigrated the Russian president’s chief rival, Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president who parliament swore in as president this week in the duel for power. “When Rutskoi took the oath (as president), one thing came to mind,” Rostropovich said. That was the Hippocratic oath that doc- tors take before they are admitted to practice. “I could take this Hippocratic oath, but I could never be a sur- geon in my life. I think it is like this (with Rutskoi),” he said. The young Solzhenitzyn, a self- possessed and rather reluctant young man in the spotlight, was more reserved. “T think any move away from communism, any move toward a free market — there’s no free market here yet — any move to- ward democracy is obviously to be supported,” he said of Yeltsin’s actions. Solzhenitzyn, who will be fea- tured in the opening concert today at Moscow Conservatory, where Rostropovich used to teach, obvi- ren seh : aoe emo- ons, sights and thoughts filling this first trip back to his home- land. “It’s difficult to give anything but scattered impressions so far, to describe my inexpressible hap- piness at being home in Russia in jo city where I am born,” he said.

It was the first major show of troops in a standoff that began Tuesday night when Yeltsin de- creed the dissolution of the anti- reform Parliament and called elec- tions for a new legislature in December. He later called early presidential elections for June. Lawmakers responded by vot- ing to replace Yeltsin with Vice President Alexander Rutskoi. Third-party efforts to force a compromise appeared Friday. The Russian Supreme Court, which has brokered deadlocks between Yeltsin and anti-reform legislators in the past, proposed that both rescind their earlier actions and set elections for the presidency and the Parliament in December. Leaders of the autonomous Rus- sian republics circulated a letter urging a similar compromise. Regional leaders are scheduled to meet Sunday in St. Petersburg to discuss the continuing crisis. The deployment of troops Fri- day followed an assault on a mili- tary building the previous night, in which a policeman and a wom- an bystander were killed. Associated Press SHOW OF FORCE: Riot police in bulletproof vests march around the Russian Parliament building. On Friday night, they let people leave the area but not return. Moscow police arrested nine people in connection with the at- tack, and officials linked them to the anti-Yeltsin Union of Officers. Early Friday, Yeltsin directed government security forces to re- place and disarm Parliament's de- fense units, largely unofficial mili- tias rumored to be armed with anywhere from 100 to 400 auto- matic weapons. Throughout the day, Yeltsin's ministers condemned Thursday's attack as an example of the oppo- sition’s lawless tactics, despite the fact that Yeltsin's series of decrees apparently is unconstitutional. First Deputy Premier Vladimir Shumeiko, asked at a press con- ference whether any compromise was in sight, responded firmly: “No compromise with criminals.” Despite the increased tension, Yeltsin carried on presidential du- ties as though the political war was over and autocratic power was among his spoils. Rather than cancel a meeting of the Commonwealth of Indepen- dent States, Yeltsin plowed through the planned session and got nine of the 15 former Soviet republics to sign a new pact pledg- ing economic cooperation. Even reluctant Ukraine became an associate member of the new association, giving the Yeltsin gov- ernment an important nod of ac- ceptance by key neighboring states. rat Yeltsin also knocked out more directives detailing exactly how Russia will be run in the absence of a legislature. He created an Electoral Com- mission to run the balloting for the new State Duma of the Federal Assembly. Yeltsin wants the legis- lative body to take the place of the Parliament he dissolved. Wasting no time, he gave re- gional governments five days to submit nominees for the commis- sion. It was a message to anyone waffling in the struggle for power: Any republic, region or city that doesn’t hop on the Yeltsin train’ now may miss the trip entirely.

Gen. Pavel Grachev, Yeltsin’s bantam rooster of a defense min- ister, has stepped forward as the guardian of Yeltsin’s future. With Yeltsin and the Old Guard parliament each claiming the right to rule, Grachev has emerged as the main arbiter. Experts reason that if Gra- chev survives long enough to call in his chits, he will demand a more muscular — even jingoistic — Russian role in neighboring hot spots. Grachev also wants an ever bigger bite of the national pie for military housing, pay and weapons. Grachev has lent his weight to Yeltsin’s cause even though military watchers say he still is struggling to consolidate his own grip on the officers corps. “The real problem is that the armed services are split,” says Victor Kremenyuk, a military analyst at Russia’s USA and Can- ada Institute in Moscow. ‘‘The generals and admirals strongly support the president, but below them, in the officers corps, the situation is mixed.” A decade younger than the ‘generals he commands, Grachev is probably the youngest defense minister since Leon Trotsky was war commissar.

Yet nearly every day Rus- sians flick on the television news, there is Grachev at Yeltsin’s side in some new and faintly curious context: plunging with the presi- dent into a crowd of Muscovites, sitting behind him at a summit meeting, greeting concertgoers in Red Square. “TI can hardly imagine Yazov in the current situation,’’ chuck- led Navy Captain Vladimir Chou- pakhin, editor of the Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star. He was referring to the colorless Marshal Dmitri Yazov, the de- fense minister who led the abor- tive August 1991 coup. Grachev was in his 20s when he began his breakneck rise by leading the 103rd Russian Air- borne Division during the Af- ghan war, winning the honor of “‘Hero of the Soviet Union” for leading his troops in combat “with minimum losses.” He burst forth as a maverick in January 1991 when he object- ed to President Mikhail Gorba- chev’s dispatch of airborne troops to squash an uprising in Lithuania. \f"

They set a new Oct. 4 deadline for the deputies to surrender. But that drama, confined to a few downtown blocks, could be dwarfed by the spreading frag- mentation of Russia’s outer reaches. In the Siberian city of Novosgi- birsk, leaders of 14 oblasts (prov- inces) took the first potentially momentous steps toward form- ing a Siberian republic more than four times the size of Texas. A new Siberian republic would retain a loose allegiance to Moscow while asserting ‘broad powers, including the right to slash tax payments to the central treasury. Its creation remained in doubt, however, because Yelt- sin is popular in Siberia, and pro- Yeltsin Siberian leaders weren’t fully represented at the session. The Siberian participants gave Yeltsin’s government until Sunday to end its blockade against parliament, threatening to immediately suspend tax pay- ments as well as to expropriate federal property including ex- port supplies of coal, oil and gas. Russian television also re- ported Wednesday that Yeltsin’s home base in the machine-build- ing Ural region had approved a draft for a new Ural Republic, and was about to circulate it for public discussion. Taxes are the rallying point. “Refusing to pay taxes will cause disintegration of the uni- fied state, and this is the worst thing that may happen,” Yeltsin ally First Deputy Premier Vladi- mir Shumeiko warned. Andrei Treivish, an expert on regional problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said in an interview, “The Siberian case seems to be more dangerous toward the continued unity of the federation, because there is | higher level of separatism there and because of the financial con- sequences to the whole country.” Shumeiko charged that | legislative bodies were followi instructions of the Supreme viet, the body engaged in a head to-head clash with Yeltsin ov who will govern Russia. ‘ Yeltsin sparked the crisis lagt week when he declared he was dissolving the parliament — co sisting of the Supreme Soviet an the Congress of People’s Dep ties — and called elections for | new legislative body in Decem- ber.

The parliament’s bargaining team at Danilovsky Monastery will consist of two second-level anti- Yeltsin figures who head the par- liament’s two chambers. Striking a deal won’t be simple though. Yeltsin and parliament not only have to split the differ- ence on dates for new presidential and parliamentary elections. They also have to agree on a new dispen- sation of powers between Moscow and Russia’s increasingly feisty re- gional governments. Yeltsin’s friend-turned-foe, Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, said ina statement smuggled out ofthe barricaded Russian White House: “Your holy highness, you have in my person a resolute supporter of your efforts to organize a media- tory meeting.”’ Rutskoi, who appeared at a press conference wearing an auto- matic weapon, sounded at times Dayton Daily News - times hard-line. He sent a message to the mayor of Moscow that he was prepared to put into storage, but not hand over, all of the estimated 800 guns inside the parliament building. In exchange, Rutskoi said he wanted the electricity and heat turned on in the surrounded parliament building. Trying to put a brave face on parliament’s weak position, a top Rutskoi aide said the vice presi- dent’s staff had found a way to shuttle supporters in and out of the White House despite the ring of police, black-bereted Interior Ministry commandos and Army paratroopers. “It depends on the amount of the bribe,’’ the Rutskoi aide, who refused to be quoted by name, said.

They re- ported no progress in the Friday session mediated by Patriarch Aleksy, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. And both sides reiterated Fri- oY the bottom-line demands t so far have prevented reso- lution of the impasse. _ The parliament insists that Yeltsin withdraw thousands of rons ringing the Russian White ‘House, where legislators and their defenders are cloistered. Yeltsin says the legislators first must give up the arsenal they and their defenders are wielding. _ ,“To start real negotiations, it’s necessary to withdraw the troops and bring down the barri- cades,” said Russian Vice Presi- dent Alexander Rutskoi, whom. the feisty parliament declared president after Yeltsin’s decree il days ago. ' Rutskoi spoke at a press con- ference hours after the parlia- ment resolutely rejected an agreement two of its leaders had Atlanta Journal-Constitution - October 2, 1993 signed overnight. It committed parliament to lay down its weap- ons, and for a few short hours it raised hope that the danger of a violent eruption was receding. “It’s difficult even to deal with them,” Yeltsin said during an interview with Russian televi- sion after the legislative rebuff. He did, however, renew prom- ises not to stage an assault on the building. While Rutskoi held that only weapons normally maintained by the White House guard had been handed out to defenders, a Moscow city law enforcement chief said a huge arsenal has been collected there, including more than 3,500 automatic and semiautomatic weapons and handguns, 10 sharpshooter rifles and 12 grenade launchers. “Deputies have lost control over the situation in the White House; now it is controlled by field commanders,” Vladimir Pankratov, chief of Moscow’s In- ternal Affairs Department, said at a news conference. Few guns actually were in view Friday in the White House, which Yeltsin’s troops permitted journalists to enter after days of refusals. The grounds looked like a concentration camp. Soldiers and police, tanks and trucks and buses ringed the place, and a bright yellow armored personnel carrier screeched rock music — from the popular group SOS — directly at small groups of rag- ged parliamentary supporters warming themselves by fires that filled the air with wood smoke. Makeshift barricades of rocks and twisted metal had been raised by parliament’s defend- ers, some of whom were trying to sleep inside the White House on rugs ripped from staircases and laid on the white marble floors. It was impossible to tell how many parliamentarians or de- fenders populated the labyrinth of halls and rooms in the high- rise building. Officials claim that 400 members of the parliament have stuck with the protest against Yeltsin, and easily 500 supporters from around Russia have joined them in the edifice. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Hard-liners defy Yeltsin from White House bunker By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Below the Russian parliament, in a bunker built to withstand an atomic blast, a gaunt fighter from the St. Peters- burg Communist Party leans on a crate of gas masks, pulls a Chris- tian icon out of his shirt and says he is ready to die to stop Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin. The fire in Victor’s eyes is one reason the Russian power struggle will be hard to resolve by raw force. Another reason is the door behind which Victor is prepared to make his stand: It’s made of foot-thick steel. Based on 24 hours of explor- ing the labyrinthine corridors of the Russian White House, it seems clear that not even a large helicopter-borne force of Rus- sian commandos could seize par liament without great bloodshed. On Saturday, several hundred hard-line demonstrators clashed with riot police and put up a burning barricade across a cen- tral Moscow street several blocks from the parliament building. It was the biggest clash so far in Russia’s 12-day-old po- litical crisis. And defiant law- makers, holed up in the building, insisted on keeping their guns and speaking to the nation on live TV. Yeltsin’s preferred option — a church-moderated political compromise — now seems un- likely. Even a more limited deal, in which the parliament's de- fenders would lay down their arms in exchange for lifting of the police cordons outside, has been unpopular inside the complex. The anti-Yeltsin forces have plenty of bread, cheese, sausage, coffee and toilet paper — enough to keep going for days, if not weeks. Just as important, the anti- Yeltsin forces are beset by para- lyzing internal arguments that will make it harder for their par- liamentary leadership to accept any deal with Yeltsin. “Even the politicians here are trying to betray us,” said ra- dio operator Gennady Kurguzov, 54, who wears the uniform of the Don Cossack Regiment. “We won’t allow it.” In an indication of how the unelected defenders pressure the elected parliamentarians, a 19-year-old camouflage-clad vol- unteer was ushered to the podi- um Saturday to read a lengthy denunciation of “any form of compromise.” The Russian White House is a maze of intersecting corridors made of shiny hardwood floors between foot-thick marble or masonry walls. The defenders have turned dozens of stairwells and rooftops into hard-to-reach gun posts. On duty, even at 4 a.m., are alert-looking defenders with mil- itary backgrounds, carrying Ka- lashnikov assault weapons and zas masks. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - Hard-liners raise the flags of the Liberal Democratic Party (left) and the former Soviet Union after clashes with police. Smoke from burning barricades creates an eerie backdrop. Pro-Yeltsin newspapers have depicted the guards as vodka- swilling wild men, but two re- porters saw no drunken soldiers and very little vodka over the 24- hour period. The roughly 500 anti-Yeltsin people inside the White House seem to be arrayed in three dis- tinct camps. About 130 are the parliamen- tary deputies, legally elected men and women from across Russia, who have no guns. They were all once Communists, but now their outlook is a melange of political tendencies. Whatever their leanings, they see themselves as patriots de- fending democracy, not as the vi- olent thugs Yeltsin aides have sought to depict. “If Yeltsin gets away with. this, it will mean every time a president of Russia comes _to, power, he will know he can throw out the parliament and get away, with it,” said Rinat Valeyev, @' member of the Supreme Soviet . from the Ural Mountains. The second camp consists Of young soldiers who just hap-' pened to be on duty as body-. guards in parliament when the: trouble started. For the moment, : they are the ones carrying most of the Kalashnikovs. They sound the calmest and least political of the three groups. An adjunct to the bodyguards are parliament’s cafeteria work- ers and sweepers, who stayed be- cause it’s thei b. “We don’t care much about! politics,” said Nina Urupina, a cook. “We stay because no one. came to replace us, and because. they asked us to stay.” The third and most extreme. camp consists of perhaps 300, fighters and other supporters. from as far away as Eastern Si-. beria who volunteered to defend. the barricades. Among them are unrelated... bands of goose-stepping neo-Na-. zis, Communists and ethnic Cos- sacks. bie The supporters also include , grandmothers holding fast ..to: principles of communism and idealistic students who simply think Yeltsin broke the law by: dissolving parliament. 44 While many of the parliamen=; tarians sound open to compro- mise, their most vocal constitu-:: ents behind the barbed-wire bar-\" ricades are from among the unpredictable mix of extremist, | volunteers.

' Moscow television said Sun- day night that eight people had been killed in clashes at the main television center.

The ‘main all-Russia network had been forced off the air by 7:30 p.m., just half an hour after it had broadcast the first news most of the nation had received of the virtual counterrevolution under , way in the capital. ' All television stations were blacked out for a time. But later, an emergency broadcast reap- peared on local channels, report- ing developments from govern ing developments from govern- ment spokesmen and recapping the day’s frenzied events. Until then, the clashes were largely unknown to Moscow’s 9 million residents outside the affected area. Yeltsin, in a speech on Rus- sian TV at midmorning, said those holding the White House had planned a coup; he attacked a he called their ‘cynical es.” “This armed rebellion is doomed,” he said, asking Mos- cow residents to support his troops. Many of the approximately 10,000 protesters who rampaged through the streets were sup- porters of the anti-reform Rus- sian parliament, which Yeltsin dissolved Sept. 21, throwing the nation into a political crisis. Af- ter Yeltsin’s decree, about 500 deputies and their supporters barricaded themselves in the White House, refusing to yield. But the vanguard of the re- bellion on the brilliant autumn Sunday appeared to be radical Communist forces allied with neo-fascist ultra-nationalists — the so-called “red-brown al- liance.”’ “We will transfer power to the Soviets. This is only the first stage of our victory,” declared Ludmilla Gerashimova, 41, a Communist Party leader from Tatarstan, “Rutskoi is a transitional fig- ure,” she said, referring to Vice.

Police fired above the heads ' of the crowd, and some accounts said officers fired pump-action shotguns at the charging mob. Although dozens of shots rang out, the protesters were not stopped. Rutskoi quickly emerged onto a White House balcony to address the surging crowd. He called on “‘combat-ready young men” to form units and storm the nearby City Hall and then go on to capture the Ostan- kino Television Center, the Rus- Sian state broadcasting head- quarters. Demonstrators immediately commandeered military trucks and drove them a few hundred yards to City Hall, where they smashed through guard lines and through the plate-glass windows and doors to clear the way fo those behind. . “The revolution wins,” said schoolteacher Alexei Brumel, 50, who carried a small Communist flag but described himself as a monarchist. “It's the beginning. It’s only the beginning,” Formations of police and troops who had been stationed in the area throughout the 13-day crisis simply fell apart before the charging mob. Most did not have weapons with live ammunition, and many of those who did ap- parently chose not to shoot down their countrymen. Some elite Interior Ministry troops were reported by Russian media to have switched to the side of parliamentary support- ers, but that was not confirmed.

A ‘hour after Albright left the , ferocious fighting erupted. yf Albright CORRESPONDENT Moscow — “To Ostankino, to 0,” chanted the revolu- tionaries after they had raised the red flag over thes mayor’s office “One old Communist, Georgi Stetsenko, 71, never thought the police would crumble before his eyes. Neither did young monar- chist Dennis Kozlov, 17, still a lit- tle worried that he hadn’t told his mother he was going to a demon- stration. But now, with the adrenalin of the moment, both made a deci- sion. They would go all the way — about seven miles to the hated Bastille of the Yeltsin regime, thé Ostankino Television Center. ‘In one of those tiny accidents history may not remember, the retreating Interior Ministry po- . lice had made the mistake of leaving behind a score of mili- tary trucks and passenger buses. The keys were in the ignition. Kozlov hopped aboard. Stetsenko lumbered. And within a minute, these two improbable insurrectionists were wedged beside this report- er in a crush of people that seemed to make the bus sink. There were about 25 people on board, all of them men or boys, three of them clutching Ka-: lashnikov assault rifles. A half- dozen were swaddled in blue bul- letproof vests, the same kind Moscow police wear. Get away from the windows And so in a joyous, impetuous rush, the column of comman- deered trucks and buses raced away from the White House. At first, everyone aboard hunched away from _ the windows. But then, as the bus rounded’ the corner onto the Garden Ring, near the U.S. Embassy, hundreds of people were on the sidewalk om and waving clenched ts. After that, most of the 20- minute trip northward to Ostan- kino was like swimming through a school of impassive fish stares. But every few blocks, someone would smile and give the clenched fist of support. At first, Stetsenko was a bun- dle of misgivings. In Communist days, he used to occupy a certain prominence as a historian and journalist. Under Premier Leo- nid Brezhnev, the government would send him abroad to adver- tise the advantages of com- munism. Now Stetsenko considers himself a Communist moderate. That’s why, he confessed, he felt out of place in Sunday’s mixed crowd of fighting Communists, anarchists, monarchists, anti- Semites and fascists. Kozlov, a high school student who never had touched a bullet- proof vest before, said at one point, “I am scared.” Every time the bus passed a gold-domed church, Kozlov crossed himself over his bullet- proof vest. A “Yeltsin-oid, Yeltsin-oid,”’ the bus riders shouted out the windows. It was a derisive cry that roughly translates.as “Yelt- sin is paranoid.” Kozlov said he turned up at the demonstration not as a Com- munist Party member, but as a follower of an anti-Yeltsin televi- sion announcer. - “Alexander Nevzorov is my leader,” Kozlov said, referring to the anchorperson of the program “600 Seconds,” which has been the country’s only source of un- controlled and critical news dur- ing Russia’s 13-day crisis. Feared police peek out As the bus turned north onto Prospekt Mira (Peace Avenue), he and others again hunched be- hind their seats. Lumbering up ahead was a column of big Interi- or Ministry trucks retreating from the crowd. From out of the green canvas tops peeked the faces of the feared OMON police comman- dos, peering out the back from behind plastic riot shields. The faces in the first OMON truck looked threatening. People in the insurrection’s bus ducked but nothing happened. Then, from the back of sec- ond and third OMON truck, the troops smiled and show clenched fists as a sign = support.

Nearly a half-hour after they arrived, negotiations with army paratroopers inside the television center failed to end a stalemate and fierce fighting broke out.

And so it was Sunday, when he . led his hard-headed followers in the charge through police lines and on to storm the Ostankino Televi- sion Centre. When it came time for someone to walk in front of Yeltsin's sol- diers and ask them to lay down their arms, it was Anpilov who stepped forward with his mega- phone. Anpilov views Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, proclaimed by parliament as acting president, as only a transitional leader. In an interview in front of the Ostankino TV tower Sunday, An- pilov said: “I believe Rutskoi has the right to carry out the functions of the president according to the present law. “But I am against the institution of president here in Russia. I be- lieve in the slogan, ‘All power to the Soviets.’ ” His Communist Workers’ Party was founded in the fall of 1991 at a congress in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. It is part of the United Workers’ Front, a neo-Bol- shevik movement that rejects the movement to a market economy. His party characterized the early economic reforms of former Com- munist leader Mikhail Gorbachev as “right-opportunistic, capitulat- ionist, and ruinous for the party.” Seen joining Anpilov in the as- sault on the TV tower was another potential insurrectionary leader, retired Maj,Gen, Albert Makashov. Makashov ran unsuccessfully against Yeltsin for president in 1991 and has indicated he might want to run again as a Russian na- tionalist. Like Anpilov, he is determined to recreate the former Soviet Union. He was the general in charge of defending parliament over the last 13 days. _ Units under his direct command have many of the hundreds of guns, anti-tank rockets and mines that Yeltsin forces have been striving to recover, A member of the Russian parlia- ment, Makashov reacted to Yeltsin's suspension of parliament by leading a group of retired mil- itary officers in trying to seize a Civil Defence command centre last week, Cox News Service Ottawa Citizen (Canada) - October 4, 1993 \f"

MOSCOW HOSPITAL Power struggle takes toll in suffering © On di = Doctors and nurses to heal the broken bodies of the crisis’s casualties, but oe can’t assuage the anger an grief on both sides. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Doctors and nurses at the “‘Sklif’’ hospital have labored day and night patching bodies damaged in Russia’s political cataclysm. But they could not heal the wounded spirits. Ageravated families awaited prognoses for injured sons and daughters Monday at Sklifosovskovo Institute, Moscow’s hospi- tal specializing in emergency care. Sur- geons fumed that politicians could trigger such havoc. “‘I was really shocked by one of the women. She was shot right in the center of her breast. And she is 13 weeks pregnant,”’ said Dr. Igor Kirdayev, 34, who headed for the hospital and dozens of emergency sur- geries as soon as he saw rebel attackers had blacked out Russian television Sunday night. The woman patient was a translator at the television station. “First, I felt really sorry for these peo- ple,’’ said Kirdayev. “‘Then I was mad about this band of bandits from the [parlia- mentary] White House. I don’t know what I can call them but bandits.” Long after amputations and surgeries have begun to heal, the anger and fear gen- erated by violently clashing political ambi- tions will linger. Even at this hospital, where the purely physical impact of three days of street bat- tle was overwhelming, the emotional lega- cy was just as clear. Frantic Muscovites sought news of friends and family who had been missing since demonstrations led by Communists and neo-fascists turned into violent as- saults Sunday, provoking President Boris Yeltsin’s government to storm the hard-lin- ers’ political base in the parliament build- ing on Monday. Arguments erupt in halls of hospital Throughout the nearly two weeks since Yeltsin disbanded parliament and hard- liners holed up at the White House, the public largely had gone about its business. The biggest rallies for either side drew about 15,000, and most just a few thousand, in a city of 9 million people. But at the emergency room, like brake linings worn thin, people’s emotional cush- ion grated at the slightest friction. Arguments broke out in hospital corri- dors between people supporting opposing political sides. One woman searching for a friend’s son spat and walked away from a reporter identified as an American. The American administration supported Yeltsin. According to pro-Yeltsin Russian tele- vision, 72 percent of all Muscovites sur- veyed in the past few days believed he was on the right side of the dispute with the conservative parliament. Only 9 percent backed the parliament; 19 percent declined to state a preference. But at the hospital, anti-Yeltsin parti- sans weren’t hard to find. A man who would identify himself only as Vladimir — because he is a police officer who does not support his own government — sat tearful and angry outside the hospital. His 38- year-old brother, who had been among the insurgents charging the television station, had just had his leg amputated. “Under a normal president, this wouldn’t have happened,’’ Vladimir said. “If he dies, I will put a sign on my car say- ing my brother died from the dictatorship of Yeltsin.”’ His wife, Tanya, added: ‘‘The president is responsible for this bloodshed.

        "ocr_text": " Russian youth transfixed by violence in Moscow By MARCIA KUNSTEL And JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau MOSCOW — Jenia Imamova, like thousands of other young Muscovites, was transfixed by the political violence that surged through her city this week. For her, one thing was worse than the firefight she witnessed ~ Monday at the parliament building, the Russian White House. “It was terrible for me that people cried ‘Hurray!’ when the tanks fired at the White House,” said Imamova, 20. “It was our Russian people in there.” Interviews with young people Monday at the scene of fighting and Tuesday around Moscow found many of them confused and unhappy with political leaders on both sides of the battle lines. But the interviews also dis- proved theories popular in the press and Western television that largely young crowds drawn to gawk at the battle viewed it about as seriously as a soccer match. “I was enraged by that,’’ said Vadim Poegli, the 29-year-old dep- uty editor of Moscovsky Komsomo- lets, a newspaper mostly run by and for the younger generation. “People weren’t there for fun. They wanted to witness the his- torical process. They wanted to know what the future of their country was going to be,” said Poegli, who saw a dozen civilians wounded in the fury. Poegli maintained, as_ inter- views with young Muscovites gen- erally bore out, that the grim end- ing to the political standoff between President Boris Yeltsin and parliamentary hard-liners will not make the broken remnants of the Russian White House the symbol of a failed political system. Rather, Poegli said, the charred White House is ‘‘a symbol that you should fight for democra- cy. I think for the next elections the turnout will be very high be- cause of these events.” That does not mean Russian youth are satisfied with their lead- ers. Imamova, a journalism student at Moscow University, was glad in the end that Yeltsin’s side won. But she believes both Yeltsin and his chief opponent, Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, share the blame for events. “T hope in the future there will be a leader more intelligent, more clever, and maybe more kind,” she said. Even those who consider themselves’ political dropouts, such as chemistry student Dmitri Olenkov, find some reason for hope amid the chaos of recent events. Olenkov expressed alarm at Yeltsin’s crackdown on opposition forces, including the closing of newspapers and firing of some regional leaders. But he looked forward to the parliamentary elec- tions Yeltsin called for December. “‘Now I have at least a hope that it will change for the better. I hope a new parliament will have people better able to meet the tests of power. They will think not just about their prosperity, but also about the country,” he said.

He said the rebellion was plotted months in advance in the Russian parliament building, known as the White House, where hard-line legislators had barricaded themselves after Yeltsin’s Sept. 21 decree dissolv- ing parliament. Their purpose, Yeltsin claimed, “was to estab- lish in Russia a bloody Commu- nist-fascist dictatorship.” Yeltsin stopped short of ban- ning regional and local councils and ordering new elections for them in December.

They didn’t imagine studying Russian here would be quite so lively. All 13 of them are safe, sound and awed at having witnessed one of the most dramatic moments of modern times at the Russian parliament building. “I forbade them to go to the White House. But of course when I got up, they all were gone,” said John Duke, the leader of the Texas group. His tone of voice suggested he wasn't about to ship anyone home for taking a taste of history. A few students in their dormi- tory Wednesday recounted how most of them went out during the siege, which also attracted thousands of Muscovites. The Texans — like the Musco- vites — wanted to watch the events that some of them believe were the last gasp of communism, and others fear were only the start of a long era of trouble. They went to watch troops loyal to President Boris Yeltsin stage a monumental assault Monday on the _ parliament building, where anti-Yeltsin leg- islators had been holed up for 13 days. “It was almost like that won- derful little thing in Waco. We all knew it was going to happen. _We just didn’t know when,” said Christy Fleming, 21, of Dallas, referring to the deadly February assault on the Branch Davidian compound. When it did happen, they knew it quickly, since their dor- mitory sits little more than a subway stop from the parlia- ment. The whomp of shells from tank guns and crackle of auto- matic weapons was unmistakable. ; Among the first drawn to the site of the siege were Charlie Earthman, 22, of Houston, and Anne Sablatura, 23, of New Braunfels, who are among the students spending at least a semester at the Moscow Lin- guistics University. They inadvertently wandered onto a boulevard that they quickly discovered had become a sniper’s alley for militants who had escaped from the White House. Associated Press photo Russian army soldiers atop an armored vehicle keep watch in front of the burned Russian Parliament building Wednesday. Armored vehi- cles began pulling away from the building Wednesday, two days after hard-liners were forced out. A group of University of Texas students studying in Moscow witnessed the assault on the building by forces loyal to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. “We were just in the wrong place,” said Earthman, a liberal arts honors student. “We were hiding under a phone booth. We saw the police turn to face our building, and then they raised their guns and fired — right at the corner of the building where we were.” “When they started firing, we were freaked. Pieces of building fell on our heads,” — said Sablatura. “It wasn’t till I got back that I started thinking, ‘Oh my God,” she said. When they finally left the scene, they had to maneuver past dozens of police check- points. Earthman was stopped and frisked every few yards, and once was thrown up a against a wall by an officer who probably saw the bulge under the student’s jacket and wasn’t taking chances. It was a camera.

Many don’t know what to make of it. _ “CNN brought all of its equip- ment to the White House two days before the events began,” complained Lima Gamukina, 55, a retired telephone operator, speaking of last week’s dramatic’ nfrontation at the Russian par- liament building in Moscow. “Tt | zeans the Americans knew: hae this tragedy even before it started.” ' Gamukina said she had no choice but to stay up until dawn | on Monday and Tuesday, mes- merized and horrified by the re- broadcasts of CNN’s coverage. ' , Shoppers at Centralny Mar- _ ket are angry at everybody in Moscow: President Boris yeit- Ulianov, the provincial Ru em gin, deposed Vice President Al- exander Rutskoi, the Commu- nists, the neo-fascists, the cor-} rupt bureaucrats, the network of ; organized crime, the business- men and the American Embassy. Gamukina said she used to be “a passionate follower” of Yelt- gin, voting for him for president im 1991 and again six months ago in Russia’s democracy refer- endum. ‘ Never again, she says now. “I not a Communist, and I am against what those people in par- liament did, too. But Yeltsin’s power is not worth so much lood.” ' Galina Sapozhinskaya, a 65- year-old retired accountant and veteran of an Army medical de- tachment in World War II, said she got no sleep for two days, staying up instead to watch tele-| ‘vision. She shares Gamukina’s re- vulsion over Russians killing ‘Russians. But she doesn’t blame Yeltsin. | “At least five members of my family were killed in the Great ‘Patriotic War [World War II], ‘and we have seen enough blood,” she said. “But I don’t want to ‘have communism all over again. ' “The rebirth of the church is our best chance,” she said. “As far as politics, it will be better to, ‘have Yeltsin.” , _ Oleg, 35, an oilfield engineer, isaid the Moscow crisis is bad for ‘Tyumen. “Now Yeltsin will give jour oil and gas to Americans, and (I am against that because I am a patriot,” he said. | Television is not the only me- ‘dium for emotions. Oksana Schindler, 24, a teacher, also complains that loca radio sta- ut TV brought anger and fear ‘tions seem to have been stressing |songs about war. ._. Schindler says her 6-year-old son was almost in tears after hearing a rock ’n’ roll tune called “Civil War” sung by DDT, a Rus- sian rock group. ‘He asked me whether we would have a war here.” Tyumenites learned in school that after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, marauding troops brought anarchy and spread civil war to Ekaterinburg, 200 miles to the west. Now people are afraid that a civil war might spread to Tyumen. The city of Tyumen began as a military outpost of Tatar war- riors more than four centuries ago. In the 16th century, Russian traders pushed east and gained a foothold at the city because of abundant salt supplies nearby. About four centuries ago, czarist armies took over the city in the first wave of Russia’s coloniza- tion of Siberia. Tyumen became a boom town | after oil was found in 1961 in the nearly inaccessible marshlands of Tyumen province, 400 miles to | the north. | If the surrounding province, | also named Tyumen, were turned into a country, it would rank with Saudi Arabia asone of - the richest nations per capita in the world. The province, slightly small- er than Alaska, has only 2.9 mil- lion inhabitants. But it produces 5 million barrels of oil a day, more than half the oil produced by all the republics of the former Soviet Union combined, as well as 70 percent of Russia’s natura Despite Tyumen’s potential leverage, there is almost no talk of retaliating against what is uni- versally seen as Moscow’s botched handling of the political crisis. Like Sapozhinskaya, many in Tyumen can point to grandfa- thers or great-grandfathers who were exiled to Siberia’s wind- swept wastelands during czarist or Communist rule. Others are descended from generations of soldiers posted in the area to guard Moscow’s eastern frontier. One of the few who doesn’t sound anguished these days is Sergei Denisov, president of a private oil-trading company, Tyumen Stock Exchange. ‘ Denisov figures that Yeltsin’s ascendancy will be good for busi- ness. “There is a Russian old say- ing, ‘You can’t have two bears trying to rule one den,’ ” he said. “Businessmen need clarity and order.

        "ocr_text": "Regions warning Yeltsin’s tough rule could backfire By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Staff Writers TYUMEN, Russia — Leaders here and throughout the broad Russian Federation are angry about chafing controls from Mos- cow and warn that they will bring new political turmoil. In this region of western Siberia, which accounts for 70 percent of the oil and gas produced in Russia, threats to stop oil supplies to Moscow have virtually collapsed in the face of President Boris Yeltsin’s iron rule. And on Thursday, the regional council obediently agreed to dissolve itself, as Yelt- sin urged all local legislatures to do in a speech Wednesday. But local leaders said Yeltsin’s political crackdown will backfire. “T think now we will see a very strong use of presidential power, and the regions won't be able to speak for our own rights,” said Vladimir Ulyanov, chairman of the Tyumen Regional Soviet of Peoples’ Depu- ties that agreed to disband. “T don’t know how long it will last, maybe three months. Maybe one year. Maybe two years. But this problem of unequal rights is like a spring forced togeth- er. In time it will have to be released,” Ulyanov warned. Since Monday, when Yeltsin’s army crushed an armed insurrection led by parlia- mentary leaders who had seized the legisla- tive headquarters, the president has moved to block vestiges of pro-communist and ultra-nationalist movements. Swept up in the tide of his political vengeance are local legislatures, many of which sided with the parliament after Yelt- sin decreed its dissolution Sept. 21. Some are pro-communist bodies elected in the final throes of the old order. Others are democratic bodies that did not like Yeltsin’s blunt tactics. The regional council here was moderate by Russian standards, refusing to endorse the threats by more extreme factions to halt the flow of oil to the capital. Even those threats have been silenced by fears that the bloody violence that erupted in Moscow could be repeated elsewhere. “That statement from Novosibirsk about stopping the railroad, that was from before,” said Gennadi Oleinick, deputy di- rector of the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy office here. “It is not on the agenda any more.” Palm Beach Post - October 8, 1993 \f"

By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Vladivostok, Russia — He feels that the old KGB apparatus is against him. He can’t control who gets the best apartments. These days, it’s tough being President Boris Yeltsin’s whip- cracker 5,500 miles from Moscow. “The territorial governor has a staff of 1,000 people, and I only have five working with me,” la- mented bespectacled, mild-man- nered Valery Butov, a former navy prosecutor. “Yes, it is in- deed very difficult.” The vicissitudes of Yeltsin’s 53-year-old “personal represen- tative” for the Maritime Territo- ry were a sign that, beyond Mos- cow’s outer ring road, regional power brokers are reasserting control despite Yeltsin’s meant to rule Russia by decree. Ever since Peter the Great in the 1700s, Russian rulers have tried to control their vast nation by dispatching imperial agents such as Butov and the 80-odd other “‘personal representatives” Yeltsin has installed over the past two years in Russia’s re- gional capitals. Rule by proxy was most ruth- lessly effective during the hey- day of communism, when the Kremlin’s man could call out KGB enforcers. But summoning the secret police agency wouldn’t work now, Yeltsin’s man said in an interview in his office over- looking the Sea of Japan. Butov said the Vladivostok branch of the KGB’s successor agency, the Ministry of Security, is still in the hands of officers loyal to Victor Barannikov. He is the anti-Yeltsin former security minister now imprisoned in Mos- cow as one of the leaders of the parliamentary insurrection two Vladivostok, Russia The vital port city 1s 5.500 mil Troatierieciea tare Rerse-lasregis, of President Boris Yelts “It’s a very serious problem,” Butov said. “Barannikov has po- sitioned his people everywhere in Russia.” The rebellious governor In Vladivostok, on the far- thest rim of Russia, a vital port city that handles 50 percent of Russia’s shipping, the territorial government is effectively in the hands of a tight-knit association of 39 local factory bosses. They are determined to squeeze as much economic independence as possible from Moscow, even if that means declaring the territo- ry an “‘autonomous republic.” One of the circle’s members, 44-year-old former gold mine ex- ecutive Yevgeny Nazdratenko, was picked by Yeltsin as the ter- ritorial governor four months ago. The governor, who served in parliament with Yeltsin in 1990, calls himself a personal friend of the president. Butov maintains that, instead of trying to buttress Yeltsin, the new governor has been trying to “blackmail’”’ the central govern- ment to give Vladivostok tax privileges and higher fishing quotas. Last week, Butov tried to re- assert Moscow’s authority by de- manding that Nazdratenko re- sign as governor. Butov charged that Nazdratenko had been dis- loyal to Yeltsin during the storm- ing of the parliament building in Moscow, claiming that he left the city for two days rather than choose sides. Butov also accused one of the governor’s deputies of evading $2.4 million in taxes. at Butov, saying, “I have never heard him make a constructive suggestion.” The governor said he had not wavered in his sup- port of Yeltsin — then went on to denounce the Yeltsin govern- ment for raising bread prices. Confusing orders from afar Butov’s troubles last week started when the local office of the Interior Ministry received a coded telephone call from Mos- cow ordering that militiamen move in and seal the offices of all local city councils. Militiamen were dispatched to control City Hall. Nobody bothered to consult Butov. When members of the Viadi- vostok City Soviet came to work at 7:30 a.m., they begged to get in, if only to collect their busi- ness cards and Rolodexes. Some were barred. In a City Hall corridor, one councilman called a militiaman ‘a stupid oaf.” A fistfight erupted between militia and councilors.

The City Hall siege dragged on until midafternoon, making Yelt- sin look both dictatorial and in- decisive.

        "ocr_text": " Russia wants warheads returned — The leaking weapons are caught in a customs dispute on the Russian-Ukrainian border. By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau MOSCOW — Two leaking atomic war- heads, described as ‘‘on the brink of failure,” have been languishing for two weeks in a railroad car on the Russian-Ukrainian border because of a customs dispute, a Russian gener- al complained Tuesday. The Russians, evidently worried about a radiation spill, have been trying to hustle the warheads out of Ukraine so they can be - repaired at a nuclear weapons factory in Russia. But the Ukrainians are demanding that Russia promise to pay compensation to the Ukraine government for the nuclear materials in the warheads. The disclosure came as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to leave Wednes- day to tour former Soviet republics hoping to persuade them to junk most of their atomic weapons. Christopher plans to visit Ukraine, Russia and Belarus and Kazakhstan, which also have ex-Soviet warheads on their soil. Colonel-Gen. Yevgeny Maslin, chief of the Defense Ministry’s primary department for nuclear ammunition, told the Interfax news agency that the Ukrainians either don’t under- stand the dangers of such “misconduct” with nuclear weapons or else are distracted by “disorder in supreme power echelons.” Interfax said an unspecified quantity of “hydrogen” was found on the two weapons in January. While the Russians did not provide details, the likeliest explanation would be that canisters holding liquid tritium have sprung a leak inside the warheads. Tritium is employed by Russian and Ameri- can bomb designers to multiply the explosive power of a warhead, turning an atomic bomb into a hydrogen bomb. The substance is highly radioactive but a leak of tritium alone is not a likely cause of an accidental nuclear detonation. Several months ago, Russian and Ukrainian officers agreed to transport the warheads back to Russia. But on Oct. 5, according to Maslin, Ukraine stopped the shipment at the border “under the pretext of customs inspection.” The warheads, originally intended for tar- gets inside the United States, are typically more than 10 times as powerful as Hiroshima; size bombs. Most are configured to be prot pelled by SS-19 and SS-24 missiles from a nuclear rocket base in Ukraine called Pervo- maysk. i With the Ukrainian economy in shambles and winter fuel supplies dwindling, Ukrainians would like to extract the uranium and plutoni- um from the Soviet warheads and use it for nuclear fuel. By their reckoning, each warhead is worth more than $1 million. The weapons were stopped by Ukrainian customs one day after the former Ukrainian defense minister, Gen. Konstantin Morozov, resigned in an internal Ukraine dispute. _ Morozov's successor frightened the Rus: sian Defense Ministry by dispatching a tele- gram on Oct. 14 demanding that the transport: ed warheads be included when it comes time to calculate the “compensation” that Russia will pay to Ukraine.

It is struggling to get the 100,000 signatures needed to secure a place on the December ballot for par- ltamentary elections, and in the process it 1 raising issues other parties are ig- noring as the country heaves from a communist to a democratic, free-market system. “We realized that these (other) parties do not understand women’s problems,” a candidate says. “We realized these parties do not un- derstand women’s problems, They don’t even see women’s problems,” said 53- year-old Alevtina Fedulova, a candidate on the Women of Russia ticket. Behind the fresh activism by this and other women’s groups is a mix of economic and cultural bad news: B At least 70 per cent of Russia’s hun- dreds of thousands of unemployed workers are women. @ Numbers of women in official posi- tions have plummeted since communist quotas have been replaced by a democ- ratic old-boy network. The last elected parliament had 5.6 per cent women, Under the old communist system, leg- islative bodies had 30 per cent to 40 per cent female representation. @ Pay for women, even in female-ori- ented work like teaching and medicine, has dropped to less than 40 per cent of what men earn, The ratio used to be 70 The Gazette (Montreal, Canada) - November 1, 1993 @ General health conditions have eroded, with the death rate for the first time since World War II exceeding the birth rate, The rates of infant mortality and women dying in childbirth have gone up, and congenital birth defects have ins creased as much as 40 percent. This rapid deterioration has happened in the eight years since former leader Mikhail Gor- bachev began the restructuring which finally shattered state communism, Ruptured in the process was a social system that guaranteed education, jobs, health care and other benefits to all citizens, male or female, Not only did many of those benefits vanish, but the transformation to market economy and re» duction in defense industries has brought an up- heaval that is expected to deepen as more face tories are closed or streamlined. “All of us live worse than we used to, but for women it is much worse,” said Fedulova, whose job as chairman of the Women’s Union of Rus sia has shown her that Russian women have been subjected to the same kind of political and job discrimination experienced in western na- tions. Her group, a privatized version of a former Communist Party women’s organization, joined with groups of women in business and in the Navy to found the party weeks after Pres- ident Boris Yeltsin dissolved parliament Sept. 21 and set December elections. They acted after sending questionnaires on women’s issues to 27 political parties. Three bothered to respond. Anastasia Posadskava. director of the gov- erment's Moscow Centre for Gender Studies, said the Russian movement toward political and economic pluralism has spawned a contra- diction for women, which she called “a period of post-communist patriarchal renaissance.” She is co-chairman of the Independent Women’s Forum, which focuses not just on sex discrimination, but on the same broad, domes tic social programs as the new women’s party. The forum, however, offers technical support to women candidates in all parties. “The real rebirth of Russia is impossible if so- cial problems, if the problems which worry a majority of the people in this country, are solved after budget balancing problems and combating inflation,” Posadskaya said, Forum members also were exasperated last week when a female radio reporter at a news conference echoed the kinds of remarks Amer- ican feminists encountered 10 years ago. She of- fered only one question: How many of you are married? \f"

        "ocr_text": " Will a new constitution help Russia? A : Boris Yeltsin | Says it’s needed to put | Russia on the right track, but many people fear that it’s just a power grab. . i By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — The next stage in' Russia’s power struggle opens! today, as President Boris Yeltsin’ begins a five-week campaign to’ sell testy local leaders and a sul-: len public a new constitution heavily weighted with executive power. Yeltsin is scheduled to meet today with provincial leaders to present his constitution, and he probably will face a flinty group of local politicians who feel cheated of power. “None of the drafts we have considered yet meets all of our demands,” said Boris Preobraz- henski, deputy governor of Vor- onesh province in south-central Russia. i Provincial leaders remain ag- itated over a power-sharing plan that grants some regions more: * clout than others. But far-reach- ing questions also remain over; the broad command this consti-' tution would give the president, without checks by other branches of government. In some ways, the constitu-, tion resembles Russia’s 1906 Constitution, with Yeltsin’s pow- ers paralleling the autocratic ju- risdiction of Nicholas II, the last Russian czar. For example, Yeltsin’s chief of staff, Sergei Filatov, says the new constitution allows the president to simply dissolve the new parlia- ment under three conditions: _ If the parliament votes no- confidence in the Cabinet and the president disagrees. Besides the 1906 Czarist Constitution, Russia has had four major Soviet-era constitutions. Shaping the law of the land, they were introduce in 1918, 1924, 1936 and 1977. 2 » If the government puts the no-confidence question to parlia- ment and parliament votes no confidence, the president may decide whether to kick out his government or replace the par- liament. Critics also question how Russians can cast m votes on a document of nearly 140 articles that will have been public for only a month. The text is expected to be published next week, and the referendum will be held along with parliamentary elections Dec. 12. It is a document made by and |g for Yeltsin, who is expected to give his final word Friday on ex- |. actly what is in the finished prod- |} uct. Members of his hand-picked constitutional conference wrote the original draft in the summer, and it was amended to account for protests by the parliament and regional leaders. But after Yeltsin abolished his obstructive parliament, then smashed a violent revolt by par- liamentary supporters last month, he resumed work on the new constitution without the con- straints of legislative meddling. He unilaterally decided to speed up completion of a draft and put it up for a vote in December. “We are fully aware of the’ toughness of the measures we had to resort to’”’ in crushing the insurrection, Yeltsin said Tues- day. “‘But we were forced to take these measures in order to save democracy. ... Otherwise, the political gangrene of former So- viet power would have spread across the country and society.”’ Although the final document has not been made public, St. Pe- tersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak said all compromise amend- ments tentatively adopted before the Oct. 3-4 revolt would be de- leted.

Russian television concentrated on noting the contrast between the ghostly emptiness of Red Square this year and the scene during previous Soviet-era pageants, which resembled a cross be- tween a military processional and a Rose Bowl parade. Police, determined to reclaim their tough rep- utation after being overwhelmed by protesters during the Oct. 3-4 insurrection, used bullhorns to remind the crowd that the mayor had banned demonstrations in the city. ““Disperse or we will use tear gas and water cannon,” an officer warned a crowd of 500 Com- munist stalwarts who showed up early at the tra- ditional starting point for parades to the Kremlin. Without waiting for a response, a line of police rushed forward, using their metal shields to push the demonstrators into the nearby Oktyabrskaya Square subway station. “‘TBoris] Yeltsin is a murderer!’’ the protesters screamed of the Russian president. ‘‘Fascists, fascists!’’ After being forced down the subway escala- tors, the Communists made their way by metro to their alternate demonstration site, a snow-cov- ered birch grove just beyond the city limits. There a crowd that reached 2,000 heard for- mer KGB chief Anatoly Kruychkov urge follow- ers to boycott the December parliamentary elec- tions. His audience came from five hard-line fac- tions that oppose the main-line Russian Communist Party’s decision to compete for par- liamentary seats. Kruychkov, who is on trial for organizing the unsuccessful August 1991 attempt to restore Sovi- et rule, led the bucolic Revolution Day celebra- tion in one minute of silence honoring the more than 150 killed in last month’s failed insurrection.

Russian authorities are in- vestigating the incident, which occurred in a southern suburb of Moscow. ~ No one was injured, and prop- erty damage at the facility was “very limited,” said Polly Howes, a spokeswoman at Coca- Cola’s international headquar- ters in Atlanta. Coke still plans to open the plant in phases, begin- ning by year’s end, she said. In Moscow, a local Coca-Cola official refused to confirm re- ports in Moscow newspapers and on radio Friday that a projectile from a rocket-propelled grenade launcher was fired into the plant. One newspaper reported that the blast shattered nearby win- dows and set off security alarms of cars parked in the area. “There has been a security is- sue at the plant, and nobody has been hurt,” said Volodya Ak- sionov, external affairs manager of the Moscow office of the Coca- Cola Export Co. “We are cooper- ating with authorities who are in- vestigating.” Coke contacted the regional security office of the U.S. Em- bassy about the incident, but an embassy spokeswoman said the office normally does not investi- gate crimes at private busi- nesses. There has been no public claim of responsibility for the in- cident, which occurred Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. There is no evidence that the act was aimed at American investors. The facility, which will pro- duce Coca-Cola and Fanta for franchised outlets and kiosks around Moscow, is located in an area south of Moscow, outside the main ring road. The area is reputed to be a center for crimi- nalgangs. Coca-Cola recently has thrust a bold new profile onto the Mos- cow marketing scene in a head- on clash with Pepsico Inc., which had monopolized the soft drink market in Russia and earlier in the Soviet Union since 1974. In Moscow, the company is franchising kiosks built to look like Coca-Cola cans and driving -red-and-white advertisements down city streets on public bus- .es. The franchising-marketing operation, of which the plant is a part, is called Coca-Cola Re- freshments Moscow. Coca-Cola also opened a bot- tling plant in the former Sve republic of Georgia this summer, is building a production facility in St. Petersburg and started producing its trademark contour drink bottles in Russian factories last spring. Analysts say Coke is gaining on Pepsi’s 3-to-1 sales margin — it has moved up from a recent 4- to-1 advantage — but Pepsi has fought back with big-bucks pro- motions. . Pepsi recently opened : first fast-food stand inside th city’s underground subway sys- tem, which wafts the scent of ta- cos through the Park Kultury station.

A: Though I’m trying to be an optimist . . ., I’m afraid that what happened on Oct. 3-4 in Rus- sia may be the volcano which was sleeping and woke up for the first time. Wise government poli- cy will be required, and a lot of patience from the people will be required, and the mass media will be required to be responsible so it does not grow into large-scale civil war. Q: We’re especially interested in television and newspapers during this campaign period. (Russia votes for a new parliament and new con- stitution in December.) How free is state televi- . sion, and how fair? A: It’s hard to talk about freedom of televi- sion, because in recent time, in the time of con- frontation between the government and the Su- preme Soviet, it was not free. Because the gov- ernment and parliament, two branches of power, were struggling for it. Now that one of the branches of power has won, television has be- come even less free. Who is freer, a slave who has two masters or a slave who has just one? This sort of freedom — this is slavery any way. Maybe this new master is better than the oth- er one which could have appeared, meaning the ~ parliament. This master is more modern, more agreeable . . @: Do you use the word “slavery” as meta- phor, or is it that in reality? A: I used it meaning “very firm depen- ‘dence.”’, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 13, 1993 - If television tries to evade the line be- = 5 - ing dictated by the government, the question .about who is in charge of the television will be, decided immediately. There is another factor: A majority otjourne- ists, including those on television, objectively .. . ‘support democratic forces which are now in power. Q: How is this manifested on television? A: First of all, in the absence of criticism.~ And in what always used to be typical features of propaganda — when all achievements are exag- gerated and all shortcomings are muffled. Q: If I were the person preparing the 9 .o’clock news, would somebody tell me, ““You cqn use this or you can't use this?” __ #3 There is no censorship, but there is an un- derstanding, what is allowed and what is not. television is distinguished specifically by that — I mean our state television. es One doesn’t need to write orders to love Yelt- sin or to be against Comnnueiat.

Q: Is it Yeltsin himself who wants to create-a single voice on television? A: This is not Yeltsin. Because I know many examples that show Yeltsin can tolerate and ac- cept criticism. ...

He must be the president of communists and older generation too. I think this is one of the biggest problems of our policy. Q: What do you think will be the impact of. television on this election? As: I think it will be very strong. ... There are many new political forces emerged, many new names, and people are not well oriented in this political spectrum.

But he plays along, pursuing a pa- tient career trying to broadcast balanced news across 11 time zones. One problem, he acknowl- edges, is that Russian state tele- vision has almost no history of trying to give fair coverage to a Kremlin leader’s opponents. In Soviet tradition, television re- mains the servant of those in power. “Subconsciously, always and everywhere,” Ogorodnikov says, “there exists here a perception of fear and mistrust toward any more or less distinguished politi- cal figure except for government members or the president's team.” In the month after Yeltsin suspended parliament on Sept. 21, Ostankino viewers often didn’t see what Yeltsin’s oppo- nents were doing. For instance, Ostankino gave only glancing and long-delayed mentions of the late-September votes in parliament to impeach Yeltsin and elevate Vice Presi- dent Alexander Rutskoi as acting, president. Ostankino also ig- nored Rutskoi’s daily news con- ferences in the week before the Oct. 3-4 storming of parliament. | In other words, for most Rus- sians, the other side didn’t exist.

Ogorodnikov insists that the imbalance in the early coverage “wasn’t because Bragin was tak- ing part in the campaign.” Rather, the anchorman says, Ostankino editors and news an- chors simply had to improvise staging major campaign events before its rival parties got or- ganized. After three days, the news staff and the higher-ups settled on broadcasting a batch of cam- paign news lasting three or four minutes, with the day’s activities by each major party given an equal slot of about 40 seconds. Equal access to Ostankino is only a quick fix. As soon as the election is over, the practice of offering divergent viewpoints will be shelved, possibly to be dusted off for special occasions.

Last night, doing his once-a- week turn anchoring the 9 p.m. news on Channel 1, Ogorodnikov had an audience of about 120 million viewers — more than four of every 10 Russians. In the United States, the Super Bowl would command such a great rating. One reason for Ogorodni- kov’s big draw is anemic compe- tition, which on a typical Tues- day night is “The Wonderful World of Ballet” and the series “My Love, My Sadness.” Attempted coups and other political upheaval also are atten- tion-getting issues in Russia today. ‘Fairness’ isn’t the norm Ogorodnikov § sometimes chafes at serving as a pedal in anyone’s political Wurlitzer. But he plays along, pursuing a pa- tient career trying to broadcast balanced news across 11 time zones. One problem, he acknowl- edges, is that Russian state tele- vision has almost no history of trying to give fair coverage to a Kremlin leader’s opponents. In Soviet tradition, television re- mains the servant of those in power. “Subconsciously, always and everywhere,” Ogorodnikov says, “there exists here a perception of fear and mistrust toward any more or less distinguished politi- cal figure except for government members or the president's team.” In the month after Yeltsin suspended parliament on Sept. 21, Ostankino viewers often didn’t see what Yeltsin’s oppo- nents were doing. For instance, Ostankino gave only glancing and long-delayed mentions of the late-September votes in parliament to impeach Yeltsin and elevate Vice Presi- dent Alexander Rutskoi as acting, president. Ostankino also ig- nored Rutskoi’s daily news con- ferences in the week before the Oct. 3-4 storming of parliament. | In other words, for most Rus- sians, the other side didn’t exist.

Nonetheless, Ostankino is the most comprehensive source of news, commentary, game shows, talk shows and dubbed Mexican soap operas for the 80 percent of Russian households that have television sets. It also reaches the Baltics, Ukraine and nearly all other former Soviet republics.

Among the demands were a major aid package from Western powers and international assurances that Russia would respect Ukraine’s security. Asked when Ukraine is likely to begin giving up its inherited stockpile of Soviet nuclear war- heads, leading parliamentary deputy Serhiy Hol- vaty replied, “Quite frankly, never.” Holvaty added, “It’s practically impossible for these conditions to be met by the West. The West will never accept these conditions.” On paper the parliament, dominated by for- mer Communists, voted to take the first step toward disarmament by ratifying the long-pend- ing, U.S.-backed Strategic Arms Limitation Trea- ty,or@TARTI = \\ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - November 19, 1993 Under the terms of the treaty, Ukraine would dismantle 63 of its 176 long-range missiles and 520 of its 1,240 nuclear warheads, But the lawmakers placed 13 conditions on the treaty. Among them: > A pledge by Russia to pay Ukraine compen- sation for several thousand smaller tactical nucle- ar warheads already withdrawn from Ukraine. > A promise by all Ukraine’s neighbors to re- frain from exerting “economic pressure.” > Acommitment by other countries, including Russia, to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and not use economic pressure against it. Holvaty, speaking to reporters in subfreezing temperatures in the square outside the closed par- liamentary session, said, “We have talked about these conditions for over a year now. It should not be a surprise. Ukraine has done everything it could. Why should we deny our own interest?” Ukraine’s parliamentary vote was greeted by a curious silence on the Moscow evening news.

        "ocr_text": "Democracy catches Russians unprepared As vote nears, most plain folk still confused By Marcia Kunstel and Whitney Mason oscow — At Proletarsky IM District Gastronome, the elections that will help shape Russia’s future next Sun- day are amounting to a compli- cated nuisance. “We will vote. But we don’t know anybody,” grumbled Va- lentina Glushakova, 49, a shop- per in the working-class Moscow district focusing on the sale price of cooking oil, not the merits of reformers versus Communists. “These parties just entered our life, so it’s hard to tell which to vote for. We’re not ready yet. We're used to one party.” Eight time zones away, on the Pacific Coast, Russians likewise are suffering advanced disaffec- tion a week before the nation’s first multiparty, democratic elections for a new parliament. Outsiders view the election as a crucial milestone on Russia’s path to democracy. But many here fear it may just be a pothole on the road to chaos. Russia’s Choice, the main pro-government party associat- ed with President Boris Yeltsin, was holding its lead, thank part to cheerless voters who see no alternatives. Yeltsin “is a relic of the old system, and the country needs a new generation of leaders,” said Igor Gorodshonov, 28, who works in tourism on Sakhalin Is- land, 4,130 miles east of Moscow. “Still, I'll probably support him because, if we don’t, who knows what will happen?” ‘Enthusiasm can be found. But it’s in short supply as Rus- sians try to untangle the 13 par- ties running for the new parlia- ment, whose members will be elected to two chambers by three different methods. i They also must decide wheth- er to approve a constitution un- veiled only a month ago. ‘One poll predicted as few as 43 percent of 107 million eligible Russians may vote, while news- papers in the Far Eastern cities of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk project a meager 25 percent turnout. But most analysts be- lieve at least half the nation will vote. The turnout will be critical for the referendum on the consti- tution, which will be adopted only if a majority of people vote and if a majority of those voting Says eS The constitution is even more important to Yeltsin than parlia- ment, because it would give the Russian president broad powers, including the authority to dis- solve the legislature. Polls show Russia’s Choice has steadily slipped after a Strong start. But the polls indi- cate its slate, top-heavy with offi- cials in Yeltsin’s administration, remains the most popular. At the same time, polls show support for the Communist Party has increased slightly during the six-week campaign. The Com- munists and their anti- Yeltsin al- lies are expected to draw 15 per- cent to 30 percent of the vote. Helping the Communists is a heated competition among three new parties that generally sup- port the Yeltsin government. Their leaders refuse to cooperate with one another, so in some dis- tricts they will split the reform vote and pave the way for Com- munist victories. Besides the confusing prolif- eration of parties, the complex system for electing the new Fed- eral Assembly, or parliament, also has alienated voters. : The upper house, the Federa- tion Council, will have 178 mem- bers, two from each of 89 regions similar to American states. All the candidates in a region will run against one another, with the top two vote-getters winning. The State Duma is the lower house, and it will have 450 mem- bers. Of those, 225 will be elected from single-member districts. The rest will be elected under a system of proportional represen- tation in which the parties win seats in proportion to the per- centage of votes they receive na- tionwide. A party must get at least 5 percent of the vote to be eligible for a share of seats, and less than half a dozen parties are projected to pull in enough ballots. Only one of nearly a dozen people interviewed in the neigh- borhood could name any of the parties running. More than a third said they absolutely would Not vote. “T’m not going to vote. My husband won’t vote. My mother won’t vote. It’s all just pointless,” said Rita Petruchenka, 27, a waitress at a cafe across the street from the supermarket. “T’m sure that 50 percent of the people think the same way I do.” In an effort to sweeten Rus- sians’ bitter attitude toward poli- tics, the Yeltsin government has approved $1.2 billion in new sub- sidies to a range of industries and has raised pensions. That won the loyalty of 69- year-old Ina Ivanlina. After see- ing her pension jump from 29,000 rubles (about $29) to 41,000 rubles (about $41) last month, she pledged to vote “for those who are running the coun- try now.” She just wasn’t sure exactly which party that meant. For some Russians, the deci- sion will be made the easy, tradi- tional way. Galya, a 27-year-old teacher selling pig parts from the hood of a car outside the super- market, said she won’t have a problem when she drives the 80 miles back to her village of Luk- ~hovitsy. “Whomever they tell us to vote for in the village council,” she said, “we’ll vote for.” Staff correspondent Marcia Kunstel reported from Moscow.

As a loyalist of President Boris Yeltsin, he is starting a campaign swing through small-town Russia in the country's first multiparty election since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. The scenes could be a montage from a New Hampshire primary, featuring an urbane athlete- turned-politician slogging through the snow with posters and but- tons, trying to sell himself to skep- tical farm folk. But the resemblance might be deceptive. For as Davituliany ac- knowledges, not only the future of Russia's current leaders remains in doubt in Sunday's election, but also the future of Russia as a democracy. “Speaking frankly, | think it is too early to introduce democracy into the Russian land,” says Davi- tuliany. He is a candidate of Rus- sia’s Choice, the main pro-Yeltsin party that is favored to win a plurality nationally against 12 other parties. “Why?” asks Davituliany. “It is because people do not under- stand anything. “They are politically passive, Any adventurist might carry them away to anywhere, even to the side of fascism. That is why very strong presidential power is need- ed.” Like others in Yeltsin's entou- rage, Davituliany says he is wor- ried that Russian voters might re- ject Yeltsin's new draft con- stitution, under which the president would have widespread powers, including authority to dis- solve a recalcitrant Parliament. “If the constitution is not ac- cepted, Yeltsin must establish a dictatorship,” Davituliany tells a correspondent. “There won't be any other way to save Russia. And America must support him about that. Otherwise war and blood will spill everywhere.” After a two-hour drive through Russia's fertile “black soil” belt, Davituliany’s chauffeur wheels into the village of Muchkapsky 300 miles south of Moscow. Davituliany, 56, bounds out of the Volga. He is ushered to the council room inside the village hall, where it is 55 degrees and most of his 85 listeners are bun- died in bulky coats and fur caps. Leaders of local collective farms press him to defend Yeltsin's Oct. 27 order allowing millions of acres of Russian farmland to be sold to individuals. Didn't Mikhail Gorbachev waste Russia's money three years ago when as president he distributed public land as an experiment in private farming, demands one col- lective farmer?

Cynicism and anxiety are the emotional undercurrent that com- munist and extreme nationalist parties are trying to divert into votes.

        "ocr_text": " Voters testing Russia reform Today’s election picks post-Soviet parliament, validates constitution strengthening president By Marcia Kunstel and Whitney Mason Cox News Service _ VLADIVOSTOK, Russia — Rus- sians began voting this morning for a new constitution and parliament, ending a confusing and dour cam- gn that could spur new political umult instead of ending the coun- try’s power struggle. President Boris Yeltsin has staked his and Russia’s political future on the voting. Yeltsin unilat- erally dissolved the old Soviet-era parliament in September and de- creed elections to a new, two-cham- ber Federal Assembly based on his eee new constitution. n different parties, many of them ill-defined, are battling for seats. Although Yeltsin backers are leading in the polls, right-wing can- didates have surged at the end of an acrimonious campaign that left mil- lions of Russians undecided. Results are not-expected before tomorrow. “The fact that people didn’t know whom to vote for is very strange,” said Masha Volkenstein, president of Validata-Yankelovich polling agency. “If they don’t know who the candidates are, it means we can have very unexpected results.” While Muscovites were still asleep seven time zones westward, Natasha Voran-Kavalskaya, 65, stood in line in the 14-degree mist early today to vote for the new Women of Russia party. “They know how to make order in their houses and will do the same in the parliament, not like those men who just gossip and get nothing done,” she said. At a polling place near the huge Dalzavod military shipyard, facto manager Anatoly Rudnev, 58, sai he was voting against the constitt tion because “it was written by on small group of men for the advan- tage of themselves alone.” But 19-year-old navy machinist Alexei Ulanov, who marched to the polls with 20 other sailors, said, “I am for the constitution because it is better for the people — it guaran- tees personal freedom.” Russian opinion pollster Aleksei Levinson predicts that those who vote will favor the constitution by a 2-1 ratio. But the draft document can be adopted only if turnout exceeds 50 percent of 107 million eligible voters — something that is far from certain, especially with cold, wet weather in the populous western regions. Failure to adopt the constitution would leave the parliament elected today without legal underpinnings. “The deputies may find them- selves suspended in a non-legal state,” explained Russian Academy of Sciences constitutional scholar Vladimir Tumanov, “because the body to which they were elected does not exist.” Yeltsin's anxiety that half the electorate may not vote was cou- pled at week’s end with fears of an upsurge in right-wing sentiment. Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirin- ovsky, the bombastic leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, had been | | dismissed as a buffoon until some opinion polls last week suddenly showed his party in second place. ‘The public was not aware of the surge because law prohibits publi- cation of poll results in the 10 days] _ before an election. But the Yeltsin administration responded swiftly. Kremlin-con- trolled television interrupted its af- ternoon programming yesterday with a stark, hour-long documenta- ry that portrayed Zhirinovsky as an admirer of Iraqi dictator ee with links to European neo-Nazis and Russian anti-Semites. The polls also show that the scrum of parties grabbing for posi- tions in the new parliament has perplexed, if not repelled, many potential voters. Along with Zhirinovsky’s party, the Communist party is also expect- ed to exceed 5 percent of the vote, making it eligible for a share of the seats in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. The party Russia's Choice, found- ed by key members of Yeltsin’s administration, still is leading in the polls with about 20 percent of the vote. However, millions of voters were still undecided at week’s end. More than 1,000 foreign observ- ers are deploying in polling stations and counting centers to monitor elections for the first time in Russia. The political complexion of the new parliament will take days or | weeks to clarify, due to the compli- cated electoral process in Russia’s first democratic, multi-party elec- tion since the 1917 Bolshevik | Revolution. But Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia’s Choice, remarked last week that he has been afflicted by a persistent nightmare: “I enter the | parliament floor and I see the same old faces. ... What changes we are going to have in the representative branch will not be necessarily changes for the better.” ddam — Hussein and a former KGB employ- | Election facts Key aspects of Russia’s parliamentary elections today: ELECTIONS: Russians will vote for candidates to both houses of the new parliament and for a new constitution. President Boris Yeltsin or- dered the elections in Septem- ber after dissolving the previ- . ous parliament, which had opposed his reforms. PARLIAMENT: The parlia- ment is called the Federal Assembly. It consists of two houses. The State Dumais the lower house, and the Federa- tion Council is the upper house. STATE DUMA: Has 450 members, of which 225 will be elected according to party lists. The other 225 will be elected by geographical con- stituencies. FEDERATION COUNCIL: Has 176 members, two from each of Russia's 88 republics and regions. TERMS: Members of par- liament normally will serve four-year terms, but the first parliament elected will serve only for two years because Yeltsin says Russia is in a period of transition. CONSTITUTION: Re- places document adopted in 1978 under Soviet leader Leo- nid Brezhnev and amended hundreds of times in recent years by Russian lawmakers. Key provisions include the right to private ownership of land, freedom of trade and freedom of movement. For- bids censorship. Strengthens powers of president. BALLOTS: Voters will re- ceive at least four ballots: two for the State Duma, of which one is for the party list and one for the voter's geographical constituency, one for the Fed- eration Council, and one for the constitution. In regions, republics and towns, where local elections are being held, voters will get other ballots. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - December 12, 1993 \f"

Preliminary results from the [ first multiparty balloting since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution raised the prospect of a bitter and uncompromising opposition bloc like the one that led Yeltsin to dissolve the old parliament in September. Reformers clearly were wor- ried by the extremists’ showing in Sunday’s election. Most promi- nent is ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who advocates ex- panding Russia’s borders and once threatened to take back Alaska from the United States. In Washington, the news that A Moscow woman studies the fine print on her ballot Sunday as Russians voted on a par- the constitution had been ap- jiament and on Boris Yeltsin’s proposed constitution. It passed by a very thin margin. proved was greeted with relief. “I think we've skirted disas- ter in these elections,” Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of. the House Foreign Relations | Committee, said on CNN’s “Late Edition.” “The worst has not hap- pened. The constitution is going to be adopted,” Hamilton said. Had the constitution failed, Yeltsin would have been left in a legal vacuum, with no rules to guide the new parliament and no solution in his quest for strong- er, clearer presidential powers. Looming large in the new parliament will be the powerful, telegenic presence of Zhirin- ovsky, who has denounced non- Russian minorities. Unofficial exit polls showed Zhirinovsky’s Liberal Demo- _.cratic Party running even with the pro-Yeltsin Russia’s Choice Party, each with about 20 per- cent of the vote, which was di- vided among 13 parties. The re- vived Communist Party was gaining about 10 percent, giving extremists on both sides nearly one-third of the total vote. In a surprising development,: a women’s bloc opposed to Yelt- sin, calling itself Women of Rus- ia, made a solid showing and seemed likely to exceed the 5 percent threshold needed to win seats in parliament. Nikolai Ryabov, chairman of the Central Election Commis- sion, told Yeltsin early today that about 55 percent of Russia’s 107 million voters cast ballots and that nearly 60 percent of those supported the constitu- tion, the Interfax news agency reported. The vote on the constitution, which guarantees human rights and greatly expands Yeltsin’s powers, had needed at least a 50 percent turnout to become valid. » A new constitution, a new kind of opposition leader As \f"

        "ocr_text": "Charter promises human rights, but power remains centralized By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — The proposed new Russian constitution guar- antees citizens rights that often were abused under 70 years of Communist rule, but it also grants expansive powers to the nation’s president. Here are some of the major provisions among its 137 ar- ticles: Russians are granted the ba- sic freedoms of speech, assem- bly, association, religion and mass media. Censorship, prac- ticed as recently as October by President Boris Yeltsin, is pro- hibited. Equal rights are granted to all citizens, regardless of sex, race, religious belief, property or employment status, or any other circumstances. Men and women specifically are granted equal rights and equal opportunities. However, a vague section au- thorizes the restriction of human and civil rights if required to protect the constitutional sys- tem, the morality, health and rights of other persons, or for the defense and security of the country. Private ownership of land is guaranteed, as well as the right to buy and sell land. A broad socialfstic provision Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 13, 1993 Boris Yeltsin and succeeding shears will ve the power to restrict rights under broadly defined circumstances. commits the state to providing a minimum wage and support “for family, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood, and also for the disabled and for elderly citi- zens.” Another grants everyone the right to a home. A third gives “the right to health care and medical assistance.” Russia is guaranteed a multi- party system, and the state can- not mandate any single ideology as the Communists did. The president has a right, yet to be defined by law, to impose a state of emergency in which citi- zen rights otherwise guaranteed are set aside. He also can sus- pend laws enacted by republics and provinces, pending action by an appropriate court. One of the most controversial provisions allows the president to dissolve the lower chamber of parliament, the State Duma, if it rejects his choice for prime min- ister three times. He also may dissolve the Duma on votes no confidence in the government, and he disagrees. Another grant of broad exec- utive power requires the presi- dent’s administration to agree before any proposals on taxation or spending even are introduced in the legislature. Torture, violence or other harsh and humiliating treatment is prohibited, specifically includ- ing the medical and scientific ex- periments the Soviet state for- merly practiced on prisoners without their consent. Wiretaps, opening of mail, and other intrusions of privacy are permitted only under court order, but no standards are set for obtaining an order. Entering a home without permission will be permitted if stipulated by a federal law or under court order. Citizens are granted freedom to leave the country and to re- turn, and also freedom of move- ment within Russia. However, cities including Moscow have in- dicated intentions to maintain re- quirements for residency per- mits, which in practice are ex- tremely difficult to obtain. One unusual provision allows the possession and use of land ‘and other natural resources, as long as this does not damage the environment or infringe on the rights of others. If enforced, Rus- sia’s polluting industrial network would be crippled. \f"

For three days during the congressional recess, he had taken on the task of see- - ing if Russia’s elections for a ‘new Parliament and new consti- tution were conducted freely.

He talked to the local election Austin American-Statesman - December 13, 1993 chief and to a voter with the aid of an interpreter. Then he watched voters slide their com- pleted ballots through a slot in a trunk-sized wooden voting box, which was sealed with string and blue wax. “Clearly the sanctity of the secret ballot is being observed,” Wilson said. “We’ve got here in the build- ing the news media; we’ve got foreign media; we have Ameri- can observers. I mean these people must feel like they’re in the zoo,” he said. “The bottom line is, this elec- tion compares very favorably with those of South Texas — or even East Texas — or Cook County, Ill.,” he said, referring to some historically rough-and- tumble U.S. polling places. “What I saw compares satis- factorily with the average elec- tions . throughout America,” Wilson said. The main difference between the U.S. and Russian systems, he said, is that Russians rely ex- clusively on paper ballots and count ballots by hand. \f"

By Marcia Kunstel and joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Back in Janu- ary, it was easy to dismiss Vladimir Zhirinovsky as he posed in green military garb and sent a pathetic squad of paramilitary followers to sup- port Iraq against “reckless ag- gression by America and Israel.” But now that the combative nationalist has emerged as the big vote-getter in Sunday’s par- liamentary election, his stunned opponents are treating him as the worst menace since Adolf Hitler. “A situation similar to that in Weimar Germany” confronts Russia’s tender democracy, moaned Vice Prime Minister Igor Gaidar, whose reformist party was humiliated by Zhirin- ovsky and his ability to tap themes that flourished during the Russia of the czars: an expan- sionist drive, Slavic brotherhood and anti-Semitism. Reformers scrambled Mon- day to form an “anti-fascist coali- tion” — possibly even with the Communists — to protect Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin’s reforms. \"all 3 Associated Press Wladimir Zhirinovsky talks with reporters Mionday in Moscow after his ultranationalists rode public anger over painful economic reforms to a strong showing in elections. Long-term trouble Yet the truth is that after the snow has settled for a few weeks, Zhirinovsky probably will look much less menacing. In the long run, what makes Zhirinovsky troubling is that, at 47, he is young enough to be a po- litical contender for a genera- tion. He says he is absolutely sure he will be Russia’s presi- dent someday, and no one can doubt he will keep trying. Zhirinovsky tried to play down his extremist image Mon- day, saying he would cooperate with Yeltsin. “I am not a fascist,” he told reporters. _ For now, Yeltsin’s monopoly over the mass media and his quiver of presidential powers under the new constitution are likely to push Zhirinovsky (pro- nounced zheer-in-OFF-skee) back into the shadows. From the instant the cam- paign ended, official Russian ra- dio and television stopped grant- ing Zhirinovsky airtime and be- gan pounding him as a simplistic demagogue. Zhirinovsky says he wants to replace Yeltsin’s prime minister, vice prime minister and most deputy ministers. Yet even if the entire parliament flocks to sup- port Zhirinovsky, the members would be powerless to force Yelt- sin’s hand under the new consti- tution. What’s more, the constitution says parliament cannot even pro- pose a new tax or spending meas- ure without approval from Yelt- sin’s executive branch. Nor can Zhirinovsky put into effect his ideas of aligning with Iraq’s Saddam Hussein or othe dictators. Foreign policy deci- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 14, 1993 > \f THE RUSSIAN ELECTIONS sions are reserved by the consti- tution to Yeltsin and people he controls. Proven appeal As of Monday night, Zhirin- ovsky’s Liberal Democratic Par- ty had won 25 percent of the na- tionwide vote, with 53 of the 89 districts reporting. His party was followed by: >Gaidar’s (and Yeltsin’s) party, Russia’s Choice, with 15 percent. >The Communist Party, 11 percent. > The pro-Communist Agrar- ian Party, 9 percent. > Women of Russia, 9 percent. Although Zhirinovsky’s party was the top vote-getter, it will not necessarily command a majority of the seats in the Duma, or legis- lative assembly. Under a complex election procedure, half the mem- bers are apportioned to parties on the basis of the percentage of na- tionwide vote they get. The other half are elected independently from single-member districts. Why did Zhirinovsky’s popu- larity take off? Russians such as Valery Matrosov — confused, disappointed, materially worse off than before Yeltsin — are the “They say under communism (9 4 it was bad, but I lived better =, “iy then,” said Matrosov, 54.

I can’t change colors easily. But I won't support the Communist Party.” To Matrosov, Zhirinovsky looked like the answer, “What he’s saying makes sense,” Matrosov said, noting Zhirinovsky’s pledge to cut sup- port to other former Soviet re- publics. Zhirinovsky also prom: ised to halt defense conversion. Underlying fears Zhirinovsky has moved away from his 1991 fringe-oriented campaign themes, which includ- ed distributing cheap vodka “on every street corner” and re- claiming Finland, Poland and Alaska. Two years later, he has been campaigning on the problems that gnaw at the gut of millions of suffering, soul-damaged Rus- sians: inflation, fear of the fu- ture, loss of national esteem. Zhirinovsky told voters over and over that he is the only lead- er of any major party who was — never a member of the Commu- — nist Party. | His oddly named Liberal | Democratic Party flatly promised — voters a 100 percent rise in living standards in only six months. How?

Thus Zhirinovsky’s demands for removal of members of Yeltsin’s existing team are wishful think- ing.

Empires win attention. But even if he is voted chair- man of the Duma, Zhirinovsky will have no real power for now over Russia’s foreign policy. That is in the president’s hands. | @: Is he smart? A: He is obviously quick on his feet at press conferences. And he knows how to go for the jugular on television when at- tacked by an opponent. He is a lawyer by training who speaks Turkish and some English, French and German. @: Could Zhirinovsky rekin- dle a new Cold War? 4: As a parliamentarian, he has no power over the military. But he did receive heavy rank- and-file support from within the army because of his pro-mili- tary, expansionist policies. If his popularity infects the military hierarchy, Zhirinovsky could be- come more important as a politi- cal vehicle for the powerful armed forces. @z Why does he have a repu- tation as anti-Semitic? &xz These days Zhirinovsky says he is ‘“‘against anti-Semitism and against Zionism.”’ Unlike some other Russian right-wing- ers, he is not overtly attributing Russia’s problems to Jews. But The Associated Press reports that he once blamed Jews for starting the two world wars. He strongly supported Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, sending a dozen young fighters last January to help the Iraqi dic- tator combat What the Russian called ‘‘reckless aggression by America and Israel.”’ Last week Zhirinovsky also proclaimed that anti-Semitism ‘is provoked by those who consider themselves part of the Jewish nation.”’ The New York-based Nation- al Conference on Soviet Jewry said Zhirinovsky was elected in 1988 to the board of Shalom, which it described as a Soviet- sponsored anti-Zionist group in Russia, made up largely of Jews, that served as ‘‘a parallel re- sponse”’ to emerging Jewish dis- sident groups. Zhirinovsky has sometimes been described as at least partly Jewish himself, but he now vig- orously denies it. @: Will Yeltsin and Zhirin- ovsky ever square off against each other? Az Even before the elections, Yeltsin retreated from his Sep- tember commitment to hold ear- ly presidential elections next summer. Now, with Zhirinovsky looming as an already an- nounced candidate, elections in 1994 are even less likely. 1993 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Where, oh where, is Yeltsin? He’s hard to find since vote By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — President Clinton has had his say, as has Germany’s Helmut Kohl and other Europe- an leaders. In fact, one of the few world leaders who has had nothing to say about the wave of Russian ul- tra-nationalism expressed in last week’s election _is Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin, who has yet to respond to the wide- spread voter rejection of his reformist policies, has virtually disappeared from public view since last being seen on television while walking into a voting booth Dec. 12. “He’s kind of in shock now,” ventured Russia expert Vladimir Brovkin, a professor at Harvard University who has been in Mos- cow observing the election. Yeltsin’s control of the mass media gives him the lead position on state television even for the most innocuous photo opportuni- Boris Yeltsin ty. He has given no sign of whether he will try to keep the machines of economic change revved up or will slow the pace, as demanded by a majority of Russians who went to the polls. Russian reporters expect that Yeltsin will break his silence at a news conference this week. So far, he has not defended, criticized or even commented on the results of Dec. 12. That day, Russians stunned the world by giv- ing nearly 24 percent of the vote for seats in par- liament to the party of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who wants to restrain Russia’s move toward a free-market economy and expand its boundaries to their 1900 heyday as an empire. While Yeltsin is one of the few world leaders who has said nothing to his constituents about the election results, he has let his prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, attack leading members of his own Cabinet for having pursued policies that have caused deprivation among the Russian people. Yeltsin has refrained from defending his for- eign minister and his economics chief since Zhir- inovsky called for their firing a week ago. ' Itis a Yeltsin pattern to duck the public eye af- ter a crisis or during political agitation. In the heat of the summer, when parliamenta- ry leaders blocked his legislative program, the president sat back and said nothing until an Aug. 19 news conference at which he predicted a “‘seri- ous political struggle” in the fall. A month later, he suspended the parliament and called new elections. During the Oct. 3-4 insurrection that followed, Yeltsin also kept a low profile except for a prere- corded television speech in which he announced that army tanks were shelling resistant members of parliament and their allies who staged the vio- lent revolt. He made a trip to Japan after that, but he didn’t appear again in Russia for nearly two weeks, when he spoke with reporters for about five minutes during an out-of-Moscow ap- pearance. In some ways, Yeltsin already seems to have bowed to Zhirinovsky. During his Dec. 15 appear- ance with Vice President Al Gore, Yeltsin casti- gated neighbor Ukraine in language laced with Zhirinovskian imagery. Out of camera range, what Yeltsin has done since the election is to fire four senior aides. He also signed an order tightening border controls to keep aliens out, a policy that surely would please Zhirinovsky. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 21, 1993 \f"

        "ocr_text": "In Russia, play the game — and bend with adoption rules By Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENT Moscow — A prohibition against foreigners adopting healthy Russian children has not inhibited Americans from mak- ing Russia one of the most popu- lar adoption centers in the world. Officials of Russian social welfare agencies worry, though, that the trend will produce a backlash and even tighter re- Strictions. “Some people and left-wing organizations are trying to make a political problem of interna- tional adoptions,” said Alla Dzu- gaeva, a government legal ex- pert on adoption. “This is sort of a false patriotism.” As many as 1,000 Russian children may wind up in Ameri- can arms this year, a time when Russians are waiting one to three years to complete an adoption. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow also issues immigrant visas for adopted children from Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other former Soviet republics except the Bal- tic nations. Last year, Russia ranked sec- ond only to South Korea as the top places where Americans went for foreign adoptions, and in the past few months, Russia’s numbers have increased dra- matically. For example, the U.S. Em- bassy in Moscow processed 80 visas for adopted children in Au- gust, 102 in September and 122 in October. Russia opened up as a signif- icant site for international adop- tions after the collapse of the So- viet empire in 1991. Since then, private American agencies have established branches, spreading contacts throughout the vast country. Local and regional offi- cials have the final say. Technically, Americans may adopt only Russian children with medical problems that can- not be treated easily in Russia, said Dzugaeva, a legal specialist in the Ministry of Education’s department of rehabilitation. A U.S. Embassy official said those adopted by Americans vary widely in physical and mental condition. Some are seri- ously handicapped, but others have only ‘sainor medical problems. ; Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 26, 1993 “It’s their interpretation and their law, and we don’t get into second-guessing them,” the offi- cial said. Dzugaeva said some Ameri- cans believe they are adopting virtually unblemished children because Russian medical stan- dards are tougher than those in the United States. “We have a paradox of American doctors diagnosing children in a different way from our doctors,” she said. “We call this upgraded illnesses. Our doctors say the problems are more serious.” Because local authorities have so much discretion over which medical problems can qualify childrya for adoption, Americans have had widely dif- fering experiences across the country. Some had to wait much longer than expected to get ap- proval. Some simply haven't got- ten the approval. “Some local authorities don’t accept the idea of international adoption for political reasons, others just because of their igno- rance,” Dzugaeva said. “They believe this talk of selling chil- dren for their organs or for slavery.” She helped draft legislation to remove the medical restric- tions and bring Russian rules in iine with international standards on adoption. The legislation was passed by the now-defunct Rus- sian parliament last summer, but Pgesident Boris Yeltsin has yet to sign it into law. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Russia’s new banks targeted Emerging capitalists ‘looking down the barrel of the gun’ By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — Last Dec. 29, Viadimir Rovensky, vice chairman of ' Moscow Tekhkombank, was slain on his doorstep. Since then, at least 36 other Russian businessmen — six of them in the banking industry — have been killed as Russia's cap- italist class tries to deflect an on- slaught of racketeers. It is a voracious struggle for Russia’s new pockets of wealth. “Their chief goal is to create an atmosphere of fear under which bankers will sign any doc- uments dictated by criminal groups,” said Alexander Za- gryadsky, a spokesman for the Association of Russian Commer- cial Banks. “Criminal groups can kill whomever they want,” he said. “They are very well informed. They have their agents in various state bodies.” In_ post-Soviet Russia, it doesn’t take criminals long to re- alize that the 1,900 private banks are. gatekeepers between the chaos of the marketplace and the Central Bank’s power to print mapney. ' nkers have trouble sorting out reliable creditors to whom they can pass along the Central Bank’s cheap credits, especially when two-thirds of Russian com- panies have ties to organized crime, according to estimates that President Boris Yeltsin of- fered at a conference on crime early this year. Some banks are no cleaner than their customers. Many of the smaller current banks evolved out of seedy currency exchanges and street-corner cig- arette kiosks that existed in a le- gal netherworld in the last years of communism. The larger com- mercial banks are mostly off- In post-Soviet Russia, it doesn’t take criminals long to realize that the 1,900 private banks are gatekeepers between the chaos of the marketplace and the Central Bank’s power to print money. shoots of Soviet-built banking in- stitutions. “There is a natural connec- tion between the banks and the mafia,” The Moscow Times re- ported last week. “‘Most Russian banks are hungry for hard-cur- rency deposits, and nearly all the dollar earnings in the country come from trade. “Tllegal export, meanwhile, is the predominant business of or- ganized crime,” the Times said. “Some banks, however, don't have to be pressured by the ma- fia — they are the mafia.” After Rovensky was gunned down and his bodyguard wound- ed, the bankers’ association said nothing for fear of retribution. But the assault continued: > In January, the chairman of the big coal region bank Kuzbas- prombank was killed. >In April, a bomb exploded in the apartment of the chairman of the Europe-Asian Bank. Two weeks later, the daughter of the chief accountant of another bank was kidnapped. ®In May, the chairman of Belbuisnessbank was killed. > In June, the vice chairman of the Timber Industry Develop- ment Bank was slain. In July, the bankers took their case public after a fifth sen- ior bank officer, the St. Peters- burg branch manager for Inkom- bank, was slain as he left for work. “Society and its new financial and entrepreneurial institutions find themselves looking down the barrel of the gun of a well-or- ganized bandit armed with state- of-the-art weaponry,” the bank- ers wrote in an open letter to Yeltsin. Despairing of getting protec- tion from the Interior and Secu- rity ministries, the bankers’ as- sociation hired a high-powered private security firm made up of former Soviet intelligence agents led by the retired chief of KGB counterintelligence, Maj. Gen. Viktor Budanov. The Budanov firm concluded that Russia’s weak debt collec- tion laws had given crooks an un- fortunate toehold in the banking industry. Igor Borisov, the firm’s exec- utive director, says this is how the first penetration often oc- curred: Posing as commercial expediters, underworld enforc- ers found out about delinquent loans and offered their services to bankers as collection agents. If the banker said yes, the debtor was beaten up. Later the banker was threatened with ex- posure to police as an accessory to a murder attempt. “Once they get involved in these criminal spheres, they be- come sort of hostages, because they don’t know the rules of the game,” Borisov said. ‘‘Very often they underestimate who is in- volved in those spheres.” In other cases, criminals came to the bank and took out loans on behalf of non-existent companies. Later a confederate showed up at the bank and of- fered to get half the loan repaid, no questions asked. When Rovensky was killed a year ago, the going price to hirea professional killer ran as high as $5,000, newspapers said. Now, with inflation, “it costs not less than $10,000 for a profes- sional killer, and they are paid only in dollars,” Borisov said. “It is not hard to find a hit man.” That was demonstrated in September when a sniper killed the chairman of Moscow’s Pragma Bank. ' There was proof again Dec. 2, when Nikolai Likhachev, chair- man of the huge Russian Agricul- tural Bank, dismissed his body- guards early after reaching the lobby outside his apartment. As he turned the lock, he was hit with shots to the head, proba- bly from a silencer pistol, at close range. “It had the signs of a contract killing,” said Valery Konev, head of major crime investigations at the Moscow city prosecutor’s office. Konev said he couldn’t re- member when such a contract killing had been solved. And with the paltry resources available to police and prosecutors, Konev offered little hope in such cases. “You know what we have for 27 investigators?” he asked. “We have one car, which gets broken down every other day. ... You think we have computers? No, we don’t. There are a couple of com- puters that someone bought re- cently, but they are still wrapped up, because nobody knows how to use them. “You think we have typewrit- ers? We have two or three that were given to us by a big compa- ny,” Konev said. ‘‘Sometimes we lack paper and pens to write court documents. We are living under extreme scarcities, as if in a time of civil war.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 28, 1993 \f"

With the second-largest bloc in the lower house behind him, . Zhirinovsky was poised for an at- tempt to win the chairmanship of the State Duma commission on defense and international affairs. “We shall not tolerate the for- mula of a strong president, a semi-strong government and a weak parliament,” Zhirinovsky told followers Monday.

Opening with a foreign dateline was a major departure for Russian television, which al- most always leads with domestic stories, According to a Reuters breakdown of the incoming par- liament, Zhirinovsky will be joined by 64 political novices who joined his Liberal Demo- cratic Party and who are riding into the State Duma on his coattails. The Zhirninovskyites, as they are called, include a television hypnotist, the administrator of a folk music group, a Moscow prosecutor, an expert on non-fer- rous metals, a vice chief of a col- lective farm and an official of Yeltsin’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, On some issues, Zhirinovsky can also win the backing of the Communist Party, which con- trols 48 seats, and the pro-Com- munist Agrarians, who won 33 seats, Lined up against this anti-re- form bloc and its 146 seats are the pro-Yeltsin Russia’s Choice party and its allies, who control 106 seats. For parliamentary victories, Yeltsin’s camp must look to the other 198 delegates, many of whom were elected in single- party districts and are consid- ered less vulnerable to party pressures. Half the Duma’s 450 mem- bers were elected on nationwide party lists, and the other half in single-member districts. Yeltsin’s chief supporter in the lower house, Igor Gaidar, glumly warned that Zhirinovsky may join with Communists and \\ Agrarians to “usurp control over the key committees and commis; sions,” including the ceteasy commission. Leading a pre-emptive strike against Yeltsin’s foes in the ins coming parliament, Gaidar warned that some of Zhirins ovsky’s ultra-nationalist states; ments could be punishable by up to eight years in prison for sow? ing the seeds of war. Meanwhile, Yeltsin’s press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikoy; warned at a Kremlin news con:, ference that Communists and exr, treme nationalists were prepar- ing to attack the Cabinet and nett constitution. “When you criticize the gov« ernment and speak of the impere fections of democracy,” Kostikov. said, “look at your bloody legacy; and draw your own lessons,” Yeltsin also reminded the na- tion of Communist crimes by for: mally pardoning the long-dead sailors and workers involved it the 1921 Kronstadt uprising, the first anti-Communist rebellion during the decades of Soviet rule. ‘ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 11, 1994 \f"

The first day of Russia’s new Duma was a raucous, almost co- medic affair in cramped, tempo- rary quarters — and there were indications that the new parlia- ment may be even more un- wieldy than the one President Boris Yeltsin abolished in Sep- tember. Yeltsin on Tuesday pledged to uphold a new constitution and meet frequently with legislative leaders, but his aides issued barely veiled reminders of the bloody October confrontation that ended with a Yeltsin-or- dered tank assault on the old par- liament. “There are still reserve tank shells in the Taman Division. ... Let us work more constructive- ly,” said Yeltsin aide Mikhail Poltoranin. Ultranationalist leader Vladi- mir Zhirinovsky, whose party won the largest share of votes in the December elections, attract- ed a raucous mob of cameras and the curious every time he set foot in the corridors with his crew- cut bodyguards. After one such melee, a body- guard stood with blood dripping froma’ 2-inch forehead gash while Zhirinovsky waxed pro- vocative. He had no kind words for Clinton, who is pressing for fur- ther Russian reform and who spearheaded new relations be- tween NATO and former Soviet-. bloc nations, most of which Zhir- inovsky wants back inside a Rus- sian sphere of influence. ; “It’s not necessary [for him] to come to Moscow. There can be. no results from this visit,’’ he said of today’s Clinton-Yeltsin. summit. . But by afternoon, even Zhir- inovsky grew tired of the circus. . ¥ou must switch off all micro- .phones,” he said as shouting leg- islators milled about in the hall. “Forbid deputies to approach the um, and call in police to take tl who disobey out of the ' dn its only action before ad- journing until Thursday, the Duma held more than a dozen close votes on an obscure proce- dural issue before finally reach- ing a compromise. : It seemed clear that neither the pro-Yeltsin faction nor the combination of Communists and ultranationalists who oppose his policies can command an easy majority. “What ‘distinguishes this Duma is that it will be weak and unable to pass any radical, im- portant laws,” said pro-reform deputy Gleb Yakunin, a Russian Orthodox priest who spent years in.Soviet prisons. By contrast, Yeltsin opened the session of the Federative Council, the less powerful upper chamber of parliament, Tuesday with an appeal that lawmakers not succumb to “petty politick- ing” and resort to violence. _ But the Russian president’s 111 days of virtual one-man rule since the last parliament was dis- solved — in which time he has is- sued nearly 1,000 uncontested decrees — have been wiped away by the emergence of Zhirinovsky and his stunning December victory. -- In the lower chamber, Zhirin- ovsky called for amnesty for all prisoners charged with political or economic crimes, an end to Russian aid to other countries, a halt to conversion of military in- dustries and a big anti-crime budget. “Clinton has ruled out any méeting with Zhirinovsky, a snub the ultranationalist called a “big gift’? that would lead to greater pdpularity among Russians. \"The one development Zhirin- ‘.ovsky fully approved was the agreement Clinton ; announced Monday in which Ukraine has agreed to surrender its remain- ing nuclear weapons. <“It’s good,” he said in halting English. “No nuclear weapons for Ukraine. No weapons.” “The Duma met Tuesday across the street from the former parliament building in a high- rise that once housed the trade offices of the Warsaw Pact. ‘Besides the circus surround- ing Zhirinovsky, the Duma was disrupted by a revolt against the temporary chairman, voting ma- chine troubles, a lack of space for thé:audience and a malfunction- ing sound system. “The Federation Council met in ‘smaller quarters and had to vote by show of hands because electronic voting machines have not-yet been installed. The old parliament building, bashed and blackened by Yelt- sin’s tanks Oct. 4, has been lav- ishly refurbished, only to be claimed by his prime minister and Cabinet. Yeltsin aides have said the government will spend $500 million to build new quar- ters for the parliament at an un- determined location. Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of a bloc committed to democracy, said the initial fits and starts were “nothing unexpected.” “It’s the beginning of democ- racy in our country. It’s the cre- ating of a new parliament, or something like a parliament, for the transitional period,” he said during a break. “So you have to understand how long is the road to democracy. The Western world had 200 years, 300 years for that. We have had two or three.” ; Russia has been without a democratically elected, multi- party parliament since January 1918, when Communist leader Vladimir Lenin dissolved Rus- sia’s Constituent Assembly.

        "ocr_text": " mt b rf The church rises again Clinton to meet influential Orthodox leader today By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Crowds of Russians filtered through the newest church on Red Square, burning hundreds of candles to suffuse the close, jewel-like chambers with a beatific glow. There was no service. This was no holiday. Yet a stream of people bundled in fur hats and burly , coats stopped in Our Lady of Kazan Cathedral to light a candle, say a prayer and gaze at the icons, gold fixtures and shimmering Christmas deco- rations. “My mother was a strong believer, but I always was critical of her,” admitted Valentina Lulkova, 53, a recent convert who was leaving the graceful church Monday. She is part of the popular renaissance that the Russian Orthodox Church is undergoing in the post-Communist era. President Clinton will augment the internation- al image of the church when he meets today with the increasingly influential Patriarch Aleksy II, leader of the Russian Orthodox faithful. “The Orthodox Church seems to be one of the few institutions functioning Russia-wide,” said Blair Ruble, director of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies in Washington. “And it has resources. In that sense, it will be a player.” Under Aleksy, the Russian Church not only has refurbished and reopened about 6,000 churches that had been relegated to being warehouses or worse under dictator Josef Stalin, but it also is sub- tly restoring its historic power partnership with the Just last week, an Orthodox bishop swung clouds of incense through the new office of Russia’s prime minister, consecrating the renovated Rus- sian White House. Three months ago, the building was shelled by army tanks to end an insurrection by rogue parliamentarians. The standoff was sparked by a political feud that Patriarch Aleksy had tried to mediate. The Moscow city government paid $830,000 toward the rebuilding of the Kazan Cathedral, which was raised on the site of a 17th-century church that Josef Stalin destroyed in 1936 during a campaign against religion. Yeltsin joined the audi- ence for its dedication in November. Priests elected to the old parliament easily won support to restrict the activities of foreign religions in Russia, where Western denominations are try-. ing to win converts. The law was passed, but then was lost when Yeltsin dissolved the parliament in September. The Russian Orthodox Church’s alliance with the government is a tradition that goes back centu- ries, beginning with Prince Vladimir’s conversion of his court in 988. The church usually was supportive of the mon- archy, and some critics claimed that before the Bolshevik Revolution, it had become virtually an- other branch of the czarist bureaucracy. During the 70-year Communist period, churches were closed, clerics were imprisoned and believers were harassed or arrested. Most of the Orthodox hierarchy in place at the time of the revo- lution was wiped out. Some elements of the church administration were permitted to function openly, but often they were exploited by the Communist state, and some cooperated with the government’s intelligence arm, the KGB. Now no political party enjoys a monopolistic re- lationship with the church — not for lack of trying. “But we are firmly convinced that being a state church is absolutely out of the question,” said Alex- ander Boulekov, the church’s communications di- rector. Boulekov said it would be a pragmatic error to align with any one of the ideologies flourishing un- der Russia’s new democratic system, because the rest might feel excluded. Lulkova, the convert interviewed outside Kazan Cathedral, said she became interested in religion when she saw an old church near her dacha being refurbished, then discovered books and articles on religion, which ceased to be a forbidden topic in the final years of the Soviet Union. “You know religion was banned in our schools,” she said. “In the Young Pioneer League, we threw things at icons.” Meeting the demands of people suddenly free to be religious again is difficult, Boulekov said, citing the lack of churches and priests, the loss of tech- niques for spreading the faith. But the church is trying. For example, in 1990 only 200 Orthodox churches functioned in the Mos- cow area, Boulekov said. Now there are 1,200, al- most all reclaimed from the Communist dustbin. In. addition, there are 30 seminaries, a tenfold in- crease from 1990 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 13, 1994 \f"

Harder to gauge was the out- come from Yeltsin’s viewpoint. Though he managed to stave off efforts by Poland and other former Soviet satellites to become full NATO partners, he failed to win any significant infusion of new U.S. foreign aid.

It took just 24 hours for the afterglow of the Clin- , : ton-Yeltsin summit to van- Met's ish. And now Yeltsin must  . ‘deal with the triple wham- * my of a Cabinet in disar- “ ray, a parliament in the grip of an alliance be- tween Communists and ul- ; tra-nationalists, and a 'gor Gaidar split among his own dwindling group of par- liamentary supporters. “T cannot be simultaneously in the gov- ernment and in opposition to it,” Gaidar, 37, whose title was first deputy prime minister, said in a toughly-worded letter that cited “ruinous” spending plans adopted over his ‘objections. Social Welfare Minister Ella Pamfilova quit as well. She said it was useless to stay when “you just become a punching bag, when they make decisions and you simply have to answer for them and hear insults and all kinds of accusations.” A key Gaidar ally in parliament said that Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Gaidar’s tight-money soulmate, also will leave the government soon. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 17, 1994 The departure of Gaidar, the Yeltsin aide most strongly committed to a free-market system, may further alarm international fi- nancial institutions, which are already un- happy with Russia’s progress toward capital- ist enterprise. Gaidar’s exit had been vociferously de- manded by ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky. It will be welcomed by the emerging majority of Communists and ultra- nationalists in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, which is bullying Yeltsin to put a brake on the move to capitalism. Yeltsin pledged only last month that Gai- dar and his policies would remain in place. But President Clinton, speaking Sunday aboard Air Force One while returning from a European trip that included a summit with Yeltsin, said the Russian president told him several days ago that Gaidar was going to resign. — “He said, ‘We are not going to reverse our . reform course. ... But we do want to cushion the impact of it. We want to have a better sense of how it affects people.’” U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christo- pher soft-pedaled Gaidar’s move, saying on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that gains by anti- reformers in Russia’s December parliamen- tary elections showed the need for new think- ing. “I’m not sure it’s a bad thing that there are one or two changes,” Christopher said. Gaidar heads Russia’s Choice, the largest single faction or party in the new parliament. But as the Duma opened last week, Russia’s Choice and the smaller democratic, pro-re- form parties suffered a series of defeats after they failed to coordinate their efforts. In resigning as first deputy prime minis- ter, Gaidar condemned two recent. actions Yeltsin took against his advice. - ; Gaidar said that establishing a ruble zone with neighboring Belarus would “open the way for the return of [financial] chaos” that would leave Russians subsidizing Belarus- sians who have not accepted the same sacri- fices in wage and pension benefits. Gaidar also was outraged over a new $500 million parliament complex Yeltsin has com- mitted to build, questioning how the govern- ment can budget it and still explain cutbacks in science, education and the environment. One measure of Yeltsin’s isolation is that Yeltsin’s press secretary, Vyacheslav Kosti- kov, sought to induce Gaidar to reconsider his dep 2 despite the bitter blast at Yeltsin. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Industrial cash crunch undercuts reformers By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service TOGLIATTI, Russia — The mam- moth AutoVAZ car plant has laid off 100,000 workers, as Russia’s sturdi- est civilian manufacturers feel the cash crunch that paralyzed weaker defense industries threc years ago. Here along the frozen Volga River, 500 miles south of Moscow, the AutoVAZ layoff is a sign of spread- ing financial wea in Russia’s industrial heartland. It led Presi- dent Boris Yeltsin last week to veer o the path of anti-inflationary re forms. In December, AutoVAZ assembly lines simply choked and workers were sent home. That left tens of thousands of half-completed Nevas, Ladas and Zhigulis filling every available cranny inside the plant that has three times the daily capac- ity as the largest American car factory in Lordstown, Ohio. ‘“‘We know for a fact that there were at least 50,000 of them lyin around the plant,’ says lai paint shop worker Aleksander Rad- yonov, 41. The rejected hulks couldn’t be finished because AutoVAZ had run out of cash to pay its suppliers for tires and about 30 other necessary parts. During the layoff, repair crews have been finishing the cars by hand. AutoVAZ is far from the only problem. About 180 miles east of Moscow, the Vladimir Tractor Fac- tory also shut down in December, sending home 8,000 workers. The company said customers had failed to pay for hundreds of tractors and tractor engines. And in Moscow, the ZiL truck company laid off 24,000 workers, also — slow-paying customers pu com ina cash crunch. pay These separate financial crises pose a huge challenge to Yeltsin and his replacement crop of pro-factory policymakers: how to prop up the big ee without plunging the country into hyperinflation or giving industry so many tax breaks that Moscow’s own treasury withers. Russia's industries have not yet Tebounded from Soviet days when central planners told them what to —_ and got them the resources to jo it. “In fact, money didn’t exist in the relationship between customers and suppliers,”’ said construction execu- tive Iosif Dovbnich, whose company is owed $3 million by AutoVAZ. In December, when the AutoVAZ layoff was merely arumoar, voters in Togliatti gave ultranationalist Vla- oil Zhirinovsky a 22 percent plu- ity. There seems no sign that Zhirinov- “We used to get parts from Ukraine and Belarus and everywhere,” lamented Aleksander Kargin, 40, a laid-off paint shop worker. “But now all that is broken away. And now the plant owes a lot of money to its suppliers, but a lot of people owe us money too.”’ sky has picked up support here since then, judging from interviews with voters, | journalists and politi- cians. In fact, several Zhirinovsky voters said they are disillusioned with his antics. Yet a senior AutoVAZ official, who refused to be quoted by name, said that if Togliatti’s economy slides into worse trouble, ‘‘then they vote for Zhirinovsky — this is the im- pact.\"’ Untangling the financial mess in Togliatti won't be easy. ‘“We used to get parts from Ukraine and Belarus and everywhere,” lamented Alek- sander Kargin, 40, a laid-off paint shop worker. ‘‘But now all that is broken away. And now the plant owes a lot of money to its suppliers, but a lot of people owe us money too.’’ Though AutoVAZ disagrees, some outsiders say the company blun- dered into the cash crunch when it virtually doubled the sticker price of cars last October, to keep up with costs and inflation. “Their market dried up when selling price of a Lada a ed meee higher lass an —C such as a Volvo or a BMW,” said Leo Kalageorgi, a resident General Mo- tors executive working with Auto- VAZ on a joint project. The most expensive latest-model Lada costs $10,000 and the cheapest is $3,000. The plant’s metallurgical shops are still short of metal to make cars, but management has broadcast as- eu ances that the layoff will end on eb. 1. After no pay in December, Auto- VAZ workers receive during the lay-off what they call a ‘‘welfare\" stipend of 50,000 to 75,000 rubles, about $33 to $50 at the current, lower value of the ruble. That equals the monthly salary of many Russians on the low end of the pay scale. But the car workers normally draw at least 200,000 rubles a month, which has pulled up other Togliatti salaries, as well. That meant they earned at least $166 monthly last time they were paid, before the ruble fell.

In recent days, as Presi- ; dent Boris Yeltsin has Victor kept himself Chernomyrdin virtually i visible, Chernomyrdin ’s face has dominated the news on state tele- vision. His role resembles an up- and-coming No. 2 executive ina nearly bankrupt American cor- poration. But the direction he fi- nally chooses will be felt in the smallest Russian village and is likely to determine how deeply the United States commits itself to Russia’s economic recovery. Since being appointed a little more than a year ago, Cherno- myrdin (pronounced Cher-no- MEER-din) has hewed closely to Yeltsin’s reform program al- though Chernomyrdin personal- ly has been considered sympa- thetic to Yeltsin’s opponents. But last month’s parliamenta- ry elections gave Communists and extreme nationalists strong support against reformers; and as a result, Chernomyrdin has gained a long leash from Yeltsin to fashion a government in his own image. After four days of reportedly tough discussions with Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin declared the era of ‘‘market romanticism” over and announced a Cabinet weight- ed with men known as conserva- tive or moderate on the issue of Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 26, 1994 economic reform. Western financial advisers have thrown up their hands in despair and left. Apparently to avoid further upsetting Western governments that will be underwriting the Russian economy, Chernomyr- din on Monday stopped short of making another dramatic move. Instead, he threw to his boss, Yeltsin, the decision on whether to let pro-Western, pro-reform Finance Minister Boris Fyo- dorov resign. On Tuesday, Russia’s govern- ment promised a colossal farm subsidy program that seemed likely to set off another punish- ing round of inflation and would undermine already faltering market reforms. Chernomyrdin went to the ag- ricultural heartland to unveil a farm program that could cost 100 trillion rubles — hundreds of millions of dollars — in the next few years, the Interfax news agency said. He also said the government will spend 4 trillion rubles in the next few months to pay bills, wages and agricultural subsidies from 1993. Virtually the only way the government can spend this kind of money is to print it — the clas- sic recipe for runaway inflation. The team Chernomyrdin has assembled is exactly what ob- servers expected of him back when Yeltsin appointed him prime minister in a _ surprise move in December 1992. The Soviet-era parliament had demanded a brake on reform and refused to accept Yeltsin’s first choice, economist Igor Gai- dar. Chernomyrdin, a one-time Communist apparatchik, was embraced by the lawmakers. Chernomyrdin, despite his reservations about reform, proved one of Yeltsin’s strongest allies last year in the bitter strug- gle with the former parliament. \f"

By accepting the passionate and prolonged resignation of Western- trained Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov, Yeltsin finished sweep- ing the Kremlin clean of economic aides committed to extracting Russia from its communist heritage. “Boris Nikolaeyvich, the coun- try has had an economic coup, our only hope is you,” pleaded the 35- year-old Fyodorov in a brooding lament after Yeltsin met with him and decided not to keep him on. His reformist ally Yegor Gaidar, who left as economics minister 10 days earlier, said, “The period of reforms has ended from the top. down.” For the last 150 years, the lords of the Kremlin have alternated be- tween entrusting governance to Western-influenced reformists and inward-looking Slavophile conservatives. Now once again, the reformists are on the outs and no one knows for how long. _ “Where’s the drama?” insisted Vladimir Shumeiko, a Yeltsin loy- alist who chairs the upper house of the parliament. He said that the Moscow news media was putting too much weight on the departures from the cee pt of himself. Fvo- orov an From a public ‘relations stand- point, Shumeiko was right: There was no drama. Yeltsin did his best to de-em- phasize the import of what hap- pened. He did not appear on state television, thus extending the peri- od of near invisibility that began when he waved goodbye to Presi- dent Clinton at their recent summit. Yet not since late 1990 when Yeltsin’s predecessor, Soviet Pres- ident Mikhail Gorbachev, turned sharply away from perestroika re- forms to gain army and KGB sup- port, has Moscow seen: such an abrupt turn away from a reformist course. This latest reversal began with December elections for parlia- ment, in which Communists and ultranationalists out-polled reform blocs led by Yeltsin’s Cabinet offi- cials. Yeltsin gradually abandoned the most extreme pro-capitalist policies, which brought the resig- nations of his Westward-looking aides and foreign advisers. Yeltsin’s top three economic ad- visers are men who rose through the hierarchy of huge Communist- designed industries. They blame Russia’s troubles on Western- made tight money policies and be- lieve the answer is to keep ruble- gobbling monster state enterprises running with the help of multitril- lion-ruble public subsidies.

Lukin said U.S. officials call for democracy in Russia “and then in the next voice say that three or four charismatic personalities will personify all this democracy. Dem- ocratic institutions are not so im- portant as those two or three charismatic personalities.” “If it is the American under- standing of what democracy is, it is strange for me,” he said. At the State Department, spokesman Mike McCurry said the administration’s concern is “less the personalities at issue and more the policy.” He acknowledged the adminis- tration felt that Gaidar and Fyo- dorov were most closely associated — with changes the United States sought in Russia and were “in the best position to carry out those policies, but that’s speculative on our part.” Austin American-Statesman - January 27, 1994 \f"

One on one, the man Russian democrats call a “frightening fascist” is cool, calm and ration- al. He says he is for peace and nuclear disarmament, against racism and anti-Semitism, and seeks “only cooperation” with Western Europe, Japan and the United States. But put him in front of a crowd and his rhetoric glows white hot. President Clinton is a “coward.” AIDS is a “plague from the United States.” If Ger- many and Japan don’t stop ha- rassing Russia, “bombs will fall” on their cities. To many beleaguered Rus- sians who have experienced the loss of empire, economic disar- ray and rising crime, Zhirin- ovsky’s is the only voice of opti- mism and respect in their post- inist world. In the 1991 presidential elec- tion, he won 6 million votes. In parliamentary elections two months ago, his Liberal Demo- cratic Party picked up 12 million, nearly one-fourth of the total. When presidential elections are held again in 1996, he ex- pects to win. And he freely ad- mits that he plans a dictatorship.' Just ‘sit and read the Bible’ Zhirinovsky is especially popular with the military, the el- derly, the unemployed and oth- ers who are suffering through Russia’s depression. His ascent has many parallels to Hitler’s rise in Weimar Germany, though some observers think he lacks Hitler’s charisma and is too mer- curial to hold power. During one tantrum on the floor of Russia’s parliament, Zhirinovsky told independent lawmakers that they should “sit and read the Bible” while his party made the important deci- sions. On another day, he had a fistfight with a reformist law- maker over who would be served first in the cafeteria. Among the most striking attri- butes he shares with Hitler are a lifelong ambition for power and a complete willingness to say be- forehand what he would do with it. Yet extensive inquiries into the Russian _ ultranationalist leader’s early years show that ‘few others saw much of anything special in him.

Zhirinovsky recently gave autographed copies to at least two former diplomats, from France and Sweden, but countries in His hobby was memorizing the life stories of military heroes. “This wasn’t the sort of thing we learned in school,” playmate Dragun said. “He must have read books from the library.” Dragun recalls a_ skinny, freckle-faced Zhirinovsky sitting outside on torrid summer days, wearing only the underpants his mother sewed him. He captivated friends with stories about Konstantin Roko- sovsky, the Red Army command- er who helped smash the Nazi of- fensive in 1943, and Alexander Suvorov, the Russian army founder who drove the Austrians back across the Alps in the 18th century. Such were the men who forged the kind of empires Zhir- inovsky wants to recreate now. No one knew father was a Jew In his teens, Zhirinovsky lived on a wooded downtown street in Almaty, a Soviet provin- cial backwater _ that has since emerged as the capital of inde- pendent Kazakhstan.

Neighbors say at least two step- fathers lived with them in the one-room apartment as Zhirin- ovsky was growing up. There is no record that Zhir- inovsky was discriminated against, or even recognized, as possibly having Jewish heritage. “Nobody knew who his father was,” Dragun said. Known as a dedicated young Communist, Zhirinovsky was chosen to head the school’s “comrades’ court.” He built an above-average academic record with an emphasis on English. He came to see himself as part of a beleaguered Russian minority in Kazakhstan’s melt- ing pot of Russians, Kazakhs, Germans, Jews and Ukrainians. He found petty slights every- where. “The Russian kids would come crying,” Zhirinovsky re- membered in his self-pitying autobiography and political manifesto, “The Final March South. “If he answers a question, he gets a mark of 2 [average]. If a Kazakh answers the same ques- tion with the same amount of preparation, he gets a 4 [ex- cellent].” In kindergarten, he recalled, a teacher punished him for acci- dentally running into an ethnic Kazakh boy in the hall, giving him a bloody nose. “That was an unfair act which hurt me in my very early child- hood,” Zhirinovsky wrote. “I was named a hooligan.” Years later, the Kazakh boy, Mikhail Iskakov, has a different recollection. “Yes, we collided in the hall and we both got bumps, ’ badly, but nobody was punished,” Iska- [ kov said. ‘He was not branded a hooligan, I know that.” Book full of imagined slights Again and again through Zhirinovsky’s bumbling adoles- cence and into his 20s, he would agonize over perceived disap- pointments. A neighbor, who is now 70 and calls herself Aunty Lyusa, said that at age 16, Zhirinovsky spent a lot of time sitting on the same backyard bench, usually F alone with a book. “Unfortunately,” she said, “I don’t know who treated him so why he became so callous.” Zhirinovsky devoted one-_ third of his autobiography, pub- lished last year, to detailing the sadnesses of his youth: > At 17, his attempt to seduce a girl during a school trip to the Black Sea ended in embarrassing failure. “I wanted to fall in love, I wanted to date someone, but I could not,” he wrote. “I spent too much of my energy on studying, and that was the cost of my un- luckiness in private life.” > That year, he failed to gain admittance into the most prestig- ious International Relations In- stitute in Moscow. Instead, he settled for Moscow’s Institute of Foreign Languages, where “I keep getting blows — they refuse at first to give me a scholarship.” He blamed his problems on un- fair grading at his high school.

(In con- rae Slav neighbors are called the ‘“Nemtsy” — the ‘dumb ones.” In ancient times, Nemtsy was the Slavic name for anyone who wasn’t a Slav — especially Germans.) Following the Hun invasion of Europe in the Fourth Century, some Slavs migrated north and -populated Russia, while others made it to the Balkans and be- _— om the progenitors of today’s rbs. In the Middle Ages, the Serbs and later the Russians converted. to Orthodox Christianity. After that, their histories di- verged for nearly five centuries, as Russia grew into an empire under the czars and the Serbs fell under the domination of the Otto- man Turks until 1918. Even then, Russia continued to feel a kin- ship, and by early in this century the czars were expressing Rus- sia’s vital interest in the Balkans in order to protect the Orthodox During World War II, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin marveled at the similarity between the Serbi- an and Russian languages. “We really are one people,” he told Milovan Dijilas, an envoy from Yugoslav guerrilla leader Josip Broz Tito, in 1944. \f"

Shaking off two centuries of Russian domination, Kazakhstan’s leaders dream of a near future of new wealth. They see a spectrum of new industries and economic liaisons with Westerners, who once were as rare here as peach blossoms on the desert plain. Oil is the primary fuel for these dreams. By next century Ka- zakhstan could be among the world’s top five oil exporters, and American companies already have staked out a corner of the trade. Besides oil, this former Soviet republic nearly four times the size of Texas also conceals lodes of riches including coal, iron, copper and gold. “We have everything beneath our ground for production of tele- vision sets, electronics, cars and so on,” said Kadir Baikenov, min- ister of energy and fuel resources. “So we are going to invest our (oil) money into the development of new production, which will manufacture these kinds of mod- ern things.” Kazakhstan, a nation where desert nomads still live in felt huts, does not want to copy free- spending Arab oil sheiks. It wants to rebuild an economy suffering near hyperinflation, falling produc- tion and deepening poverty as it staggers out of the Soviet commu- nist orbit toward capitalism. “Tomorrow if Kuwait runs out of oil, what happens? No oil, no country,” Baikenov said in an in- terview. ‘“‘We have to develop the whole structure of the economy.” A test of democracy Kazakhstan President Nursul- tan Nazarbayev told Western jour- nalists last week he also wants to “increase the credibility” of Ka- zakhstan as a country where Westerners can do business.

Western officials view ratifica- tion of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty as more important than re- maining hurdles to democracy and a free market — hurdles such as protracted state ownership of in- dustry, sharpening ethnic dis- putes, and lingering power strug- gles with Moscow. Independent for only two years, Kazakhstan at least has moved quickly to exploit its major re- source. Last April it entered a 40- year agreement allowing Chevron Oil Co. to pump the Tengiz field on the desolate shores of the Cas- pian Sea, first exploited three dec- ades ago by the Soviets. “It’s a world-class field, without any question,” said Charlie Auver- mann, the local liaison for Tengiz- chevroil, the joint venture owned 50-50 by Chevron and the Kazakh- stan government. Lots of oil to be pumped Though most of the Tengiz wells are still capped, Chevron es- timates it easily could pump oil from the field at a rate of 72,000 barrels a day. The Kazakh govern- ment projects an output of 700,000 barrels a day by the year 2010. “What you have here in this field is the ability to offset the (OPEC) consortium. It gives you flexibility,” said Auvermann, who works on a hardship rotation ba- sis, 28 days here and 28 days back home in Dawsonville, Ga. Late last year a group of seven western oil companies including Mobil Oil signed a deal to explore in the Caspian Sea, in what is believed to be one of the world’s most promising offshore areas. Energy Minister Baikenov pre- dicted the offshore capacity would be at a minimum three times as great as the Tengiz field. So within 20 years Kazakhstan could be pro- ducing 3 million barrels of oil dai- ly, putting it in a league with Iran and Kuwait. Now, however, there is no way to get such vast amounts of oil out of this landlocked nation. The main oil pipeline runs north through Russia, which quickly curtailed tan’s use of it once Chevron began producing. A new pipeline is planned, but it would be a joint project also traversing Russia westward to the Black Sea. Other potential routes are much longer or cross unstable nations boiling with armed conflict, aijan and Georgia on oil Ethic conflict brewing Cooperation from Moscow may depend on Russia getting a piece of the oil action. But it also may hinge on the status of the 36 per- cent ethnic Russian population here, which is suffering increasing discrimination, according to the new U.S. State Department Hu- man Rights Report. It is a side effect of the deterio- rated economy, plus growing na- tionalism among ethnic Kazakhs, who are 38 percent of the popula- tion and, for the first time in gen- erations, masters in their own country. Pessimistic observers predict oil riches may come too late, that the friction literally may split the country as ethnic Russians con- centrated in the north secede. “If ethnic conflict occurs, the northern part of Kazakhstan will automatically join Russia,” said Nurbulat Masanov, an ethnogra- pher and historian. “There is con- siderable chance it will happen. It can be provoked by economic cri- sis.’ At least 200,000 ethnic Rus- sians have left already, including many trained professionals. For those who stay, both Ka- zakhs and Russians, the notion of megabucks flowing on the spray of oil wells is a distant dream. Yelena Vlasova is a 27-year-old divorced mother who sells liquor at a kiosk outside the vegetable market in this capital city, where few shoppers were buying last week from a bounty of meat and produce. “We've heard about this,” said Vlasova, whose biggest concern was not oil, but the news that her child’s kindergarten fee had just quadrupled. “In the long run we hope it will be good.

        "ocr_text": "Russian diplomat turned Serb tide By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service MOSCOW — Forty-eight hours of hammer-like warnings from a Russian envoy applied the final force that apparently buckled Bos- nian Serb resistance to the pull- back of heavy artillery from Sarajevo. “T talked to all of them,” Russian special envoy Vitaly Churkin said Friday, providing the first details of his round of crisis meetings with Serbia’s President Slobodan Milo- sevic, Bosnian Serb leader Rado- van Karadzic and a cast of other Serb politicians and _ military commanders. “And I know they understand what we told them immediately af- ter the explosion in the Sarajevo market on Feb. 5,” Churkin said. “Immediately after that we told Milosevic that it was time to lift the siege of Sarajevo. And it must be done now, not a month later, not two weeks later, it must be done now.” Along with the warnings, Chur- kin said, he also traveled to Bos- nia-Herzegovina this week with a letter signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. In it, Yeltsin pledged to transfer a contingent of Russian paratroopers to U.N. peacekeeping duty in the Sarajevo area. “Obviously, the numbers of Rus- sian troops is not as important as is their symbolic and _ political quality,” Churkin said. “This is the main guarantee to the Serbian side that no surprises will take ” piace. Churkin said the Serbs ‘“‘needed some assurance” that their Mus- lim rivals in Sarajevo wouldn’t ex- ploit the impending pullout of the Serbs’ heavy guns to seize fresh ground in the hills over the city. The 42-year-old Churkin, who doubles as Yeltsin’s diplomatic -trouble-shooter and deputy minis- ter of the Russian Foreign Minis- try, may turn out to have pulled off the most sure-footed feat of super- powcr shuttle diplomacy in years. If all goes his way this weekend, Churkin will have achieved the Russian objective of staving off a NATO airstrike in the Balkans, while also bringing the intractable Bosnian tragedy closer to a politi- cal solution. Three years ago, the then-Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev, tried to pull off a similar last-min- ute peace deal to avoid the Desert Storm ground attack against Iraq. Churkin, who then served as the chief Foreign Ministry press spokesman, had a front-row van- tage point to watch that effort collapse. This time in Bosnia, Churkin in- sisted, the Serbs’ commitments are too solid for a repetition of Mos- cow’s failure in 1991. Warning the West not to carry through on its NATO airstrike ul- timatum, Churkin said, ““To take advantage of some technical detail and resort to air strikes while the Serbs are withdrawing would be an absolutely unforgivable crime.” Churkin wrapped up his deal at 4 p.m. Thursday, during a meeting with Serb military commanders at the former Bosnian ski town of Pale, east of Sarajevo. He said he had talked “three or four times” with Milosevic, “sever- al times” with Karadzic, as well as 0 AT) + 2 * Venerais rie AIBO managed to fit in meetings with leaders of Bosnia’s Muslim-led go- vernment, President Alija Izetbe- govic and Haris Silajdzic. Lacking a Kissinger-style spe- cial jet, Churkin headed back for Russia by car through the Bosnian mountains. He later caught a com- mercial airliner from Budapest to Moscow. One reason he returned, he said, was to ask leaders of the newly in- stalled Russian parliament to au- thorize the dispatch of “several hundreds” more troops from Rus- sia to peacekeeping assignments in the Sarajevo area. “I don’t expect any problem at all from the parliament on this is- sue,” Churkin said, despite criti- cisms sounded by nationalist lawmakers. “I think I have the right arguments to talk to them.” ‘Today, Churkin planned to head back to Yugoslavia with a Russian military delegation. They will meet with a 400-member contingent of Russian paratroopers serving as U.N. peacekeepers in neighboring Croatia. As early as next week, they will move into the Sarajevo area, he said. Churkin seemed eager to press ahead on the diplomatic front in Bosnia, attempting to advance from a military pullback to the po- litical settlement that has eluded the rest of the world’s diplomats. This could pave the way for an- other longstanding Russian diplo- matic objective: dropping the U.N. boycott against Yugoslavia, which has cost Russia millions of dollars in petroleum exports. “It is an incredibly, unbelievably great opportunity to move toward a political settlement of the con- flict in Bosnia-Herzegovina over- all,” Churkin said, “and we intend to take up this opportunity. We in Russia are now extremely well po- sitioned to do that.” Austin American-Statesman - February 19, 1994 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Money talks: Russia’s poverty may be the real threat to the coun *s spy agencies, because it makes employees easy targets for American bribes. Russian spy system hobbled? ldoscovw fears owr agerts cart be trusted By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS oscow — A former top KGB spy said Wednesday that the arrest of CIA officer Aldrich Ames is “a major defeat” for Rus- sian intelligence and probably cut off a prime source of tips about which influential Russians are American informants. “I think ... [his arrest] is a major coup for the U.S. counterintelligence, as it was a major coup for the Soviet intelligence when Mr. Ames was re- cruited,” said former KGB Gen. Oleg Kalugin. The alleged monitoring of CIA recruitment suggests a deep Russian fear: that the collapsing Soviet empire made demoralized officials cheap and easily purchased by U.S. intelligence agencies. From 1985, when Ames was allegedly recruit- ed, to 1991, when he was deliberately transferred to less sensitive work in counternarcotics, well over half the U.S. intelligence program was devot- ed to prying secrets from the Soviet Union and its successor states. In a January reorganization of Russia’s inter- nal intelligence agency, President Boris Yeltsin ordered the reappointment of seven of the top_ eight officials in the security ministry. He made no mention of the eighth official, a former KGB agent in Yeltsin’s home city of Eka- terinburg. More than 300 KGB officials with ranks of general are awaiting reappointment to the Rus- sian counterintelligence agency. All these former overseers of the Soviet security apparatus are be- ing required to face full security screenings — a sign that the Ames case may be causing ripples in Moscow as well as in Washington. Where the spies are “Russia Has Become a Mecca for Spies” was the headline on an interview with a top counterin- telligence official published in December in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. Kalugin is a former chief of KGB counterintel- ligence, now a member of parliament supporting President Boris Yeltsin. He joined spokesmen for Russia’s secret intelligence services on Wednes- day in trying to play down any diplomatic strains the Ames case might cause. “After all, the CIA has its spies in Russia, and the Russians have their spies in the United States,” said Kalugin. “We have to live with it, you know, and simply take it, and not make a great Aldrich Hazen Ames, shown Tuesda helped the Kremlin catch Russians wo row over this thing.” Ames has already been charged in an FBI affi- davit with betraying to Moscow someone called “Prologue,” the CIA’s code name for an American double agent in Soviet counterintelligence. But inquiries by the Journal-Constitution on Wednesday show a broader pattern in which as many as six Russian-double agents were trapped by the KGB after allegedly passing information to the CIA in recent years. The New York Times reported in its Thursday editions that the number might be even higher. The newspaper said it had learned from govern- ment sources that the FBI has concluded that Ames betrayed at least 10 Russians working for US. intelligence and that all were convicted of treason and executed in Moscow after their work as double agents was revealed. The Russian government has never denied that it executed at least two double agents — KGB Col. Valery Martynov and KGB Maj. Sergei Motorin. Soviet was on U.S. payroll Martynov was reportedly unmasked as a CIA source in November 1985. He had se ears at the Soviet Embassy i ing Associated Press after his arraignment in Washington, allegedly ing for the CIA. They reportedly were ex KGB's “Line X” division, handling scientific in- telligence. Motorin was allegedly uncovered after four years in Washington as a political intelligence of- fice. Like Ames, Motorin was accused of selling out his country for money. At his trial, Soviet prosecutors cited his purchase of a waterbed as proof that he had “succumbed to decadent capi- talist ways.” At the Russian Intelligence Agency, the over- seas arm of the former KGB, spokesman Yuri Ka- baladze confirmed Wednesday that Motorin had been tried and executed for treason. He said he did not recall the Martynov case. Asked if Ames had provided the tipoffs that led to the arrest of Russian turncoats, Kabaladze said tersely, “No comment — it is your guess, it is as good as mine.” From Russia’s new internal intelligence agen- cy, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, came word that at least four Russians have been arrest- ed on charges of espionage for the West in the past two years. “I know of three cases,” said spokesman Vla- dimir Tomakovsky, whose new counterintelli- gence agency was part of the former KGB before the breakup of the Sovi ‘The investiga- re Atlanta Constitution - February 24, 1994 \f"

They are hoping his speech, re- puted to run 75 pages, will pre- scribe an antidote for what appears to be an expanding eco- nomic collapse. Thousands of factories across Russia are captured in the same kind of chain reaction ensnaring Pavel Skrinsky’s factory, which sprawls over several blocks just south of downtown Moscow. *““We have a four-day work week. Seven hundred people laid off,” said Skrinsky, director of the huge plant, which produces industrial engines and washing machines. Russian consumers can’t afford his washing machines, and neither can other Russian manufacturers afford the 2,000-pound electric’ motors he produces. Consumer products are selling so slowly in these days of near hy- perinflation that Skrinsky must put his washing machines in stores on a consignment basis. “\"They’re supposed to pay us back after they sell them. Unfortu- nately, only 30 percent are hon- est,” he said. As for industrial goods, factory director Viktor Krivorotko in Krasnodar, 700 miles south of Moscow, said he can’t buy Skrinsky’s engines for his plant any more because nobody is buy- ing his cooling units and compres- sors. Farmers, for example, aren’t buying his big refrigerators for cooling milk and vegetables. “Apart from our _ agricultural customers, we supply oil and gas industry workers who explore new wells. They also need our equip- ment, but they also cannot buy it because they also have debts,” said Krivorotko, who has laid off 2,500 \" AP age cadet. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, center fore- ground, was at the Fatherland holiday tribute. Anticipated Yeltsin address to reveal state of Russian economic reforms of his 3,000 workers. Yeltsin has let his Soviet-style prime minister, Viktor Cherno- myrdin, usher most economic re- formers to the door and bring into the government supporters of easy credits to the old agricultural and industrial behemoths. Yeltsin has said almost nothing for weeks about the Cabinet sha- keup or about economic policy. Re- formers are hoping he will reassert more discipline over government spending and monetary policy now that he is in public favor and let in- dustrialists like Skrinsky fend for themselves on the free market. But the new Cabinet believes the subsidy cuts, tighter money sup- ply, higher taxes and privatization demanded by the reformers caused Russia’s economic trouble. Alexander Khandruyev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Central Bank, said the government’s main job for two to three years will be **to survive and slow down the cri- sis,” even tempering anti-inflation measures if necessary to staunch unemployment and hardship.

        "ocr_text": "Yeltsin vows to attack crime, slow reforms By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Staff Writers MOSCOW — In his first ad- dress on the state of the nation, President Boris Yeltsin declared Thursday Russia must conduct a blitzkrieg against crime and slack- en the pace of disruptive economic reforms. “Tt is impossible to transform such a country as Russia at one stroke,” Yeltsin admitted in a speech brimming with compro- mises offered to a parliament weighted with opponents. It was Yeltsin’s most compre- hensive pronouncement to legisla- tors since he became president in 1991 and his first real response to the drubbing his reformist sup- porters took at the polls in Decem- ber. His effort at conciliation drew faint praise, but also faint criticism. He targeted the same hot-but- ton populist issues that drew votes for communists and nationalists. Speaking before a joint session of parliament at the Kremlin, Yelt- sin signaled, for example, that Russia is ready to resume a “more active” foreign policy and to flex its muscle regionally, especially on behalf of Russians subjected to discrimination in neighboring re- publics. “In 1994 we must put an end to the faulty practice of unilateral concessions,” Yeltsin said, adding: Seah pe En ee ‘It is impossible to transform such a country as Russia at one stroke.’ “Until now our foreign policy has been short on initiative and cre- ativity.” He said nothing about Presi- dent Clinton’s brusque protest over Russian espionage, choosing instead to emphasize the panoply of domestic obstacles vexing Rus- sia’s 149 million inhabitants. Nor did Yeltsin address the looming conflict between his gov- ernment and the feisty lower chamber of parliament, which on the eve of his speech overwhelm- ingly adopted a resolution giving amnesty to the communists who staged the aborted coup of August 1991, and the Yeltsin foes who more recently led last October’s bloody rebellion in the streets. Yeltsin officials have stridently condemned the resolution without declaring whether Yeltsin will per- mit his jailed opponents to walk free. Attempts to block the amnesty would carry “a killing  signifi- cance” for Yeltsin, said Vladimir Isakov, a leader of the pro-commu- nist Agrarian Party and chairman of the Duma’s Justice and Law Committee. His comment was a hint that the opposition could initi- Palm Beach Post - February 25, 1994 BORIS YELTSIN ate impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin in that case. Prosecutor General Alexei Ka- zannik said Thursday that he is prepared to follow the parliamen- tary mandate and drop the pending trials. Under the constitution, a resolution of amnesty does not require passage by the upper chamber and is not subject to a presidential veto. In his speech Yeltsin comi- posed a picture of a nation beset by disorder and lawlessness, by in- creasing economic disparities and by cultural disintegration. He re- peatedly turned to old-style solu- tions from the days of communist control without fully veering off the course toward a free market. “Let us at long last recognize that so far we have a weak state and that there is no elementary order in the country,” he said. “A strong state is needed above all in order to curb crime. This is the key problem of the year.’ He asked the parliament to quickly pass a set of unspecified “emergency measures to sup- press crime” but told the deputies not to violate civil rights. \f"

        "ocr_text": " Yeltsin loses as revolt leaders go free Will ex-officials held for 4 months stir trouble again? By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel \"STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Deposed Russian Vice President Alexander Ruts- koi and fellow leaders of last Oc- tober’s insurrection rode trium- phantly away from the Lefortovo litical prison Saturday as resident Boris Yeltsin failed in furious efforts to block their re- lease under an amnesty granted by parliament. “T have been together with you to the end,” said Rutskoi, who wore his Hero of the Soviet Union medal on his general’s uniform. Among dozens of other Yelt- sin foes suddenly freed and re-' launched into Russia’s fast- changing political atmosphere were Communist faction leader Victor Anpilov and Gen. Albert Makashov, the pair who led the Oct. 3 rocket-grenade assault on the Ostankino television center, where dozens were killed. For- ther parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, looking pale, was the first freed after their four months in Lefortovo. Yeltsin’s embarrassingly Ready Associated Press for a toast to his freedom, former Vice President Alexander Rutskoi relaxes Saturday back home in Moscow. public failure to block their dis- charge from a prison he nominal- ly controls will be taken as a sign that his grip on Kremlin power may be failing. Four hours before Leforto- vo’s tall metal gate swung open, Russia’s prosecutor general, Alexei Kazannik, told reporters that he had just submitted his resignation rather than carry out a Yeltsin order to hold up the am- nesty resolution overwhelmingly passed Wednesday by the Duma, parliament’s lower house. Kazannik, a legal scholar, said he fully shared Yeltsin’s dis- like of the Duma’s amnesty of “people guilty of murders, po- groms and pillage.” But he said the constitution makes clear that the Duma has the power to grant amnesty unilaterally. A deputy prosecutor general then delivered to Lefortovo the final documents ordering the re- lease. Two months after he suppos- edly won sweeping presidential powers in a new constitution, Yeltsin is suffering daily difficul- ties in enforcing his will within his government, a predicament similar to that of former Presi- dent Mikhail Gorbachev during his declining months. Ina sign of foreboding among the weakened reformist bloc, former Economics Minister Ye- gor Gaidar told a German news- paper the freed insurrection leaders “will regroup and stage a new, better-organized coup against the legal government.” The release of dozens of an- gry, politically ambitious prison- ers will not only weaken the ground under Yeltsin’s feet; it also will confront ultranationalist opposition leader Vladimir Zhir- inovsky with a covey of ambitious rivals, most prominently Rutskoi. “Rutskoi and some of our oth- er jailed heroes will come out and cause serious problems for Zhirinovsky among his own elec- torate,” Alexander Prokhanov, editor of the ultranationalist newspaper Tomorrow, said out- side the prison. The Duma’s resolution par- doned more than 1,000 people jailed after the October uprising, and also terminated the drawn- out trials of a dozen top Commu- nists who tried to overthrow Gor- bachev in August 1991.
