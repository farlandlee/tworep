Mr. Albright, who has been with Newsday since 1961, said in an interview that he would be active in “writing and finan- cial projects.” He will be replaced by Russell Sackett, a former senior editor at Life. Sources at the news- paper said that Newsday’s Washington staff would remain at four. Mr. Albright, 33 years old, is a nephew of the late Mrs. Alicia Patterson Guggenheim, founder and publisher of News- day. He worked as a reporter for The Denver Post and The Chicago Sun-Times before joining Newsday in 1961. Most employes at Newsday helieved that Mr. Albright was.a prime candidate to run the newspaper eventually. In 1963, Mr. Albright became assistant to Harry F.. Guggen- heim, who assumed direction of Newsday after his wife’s death. Mr. Albright was one of four. brothers and sisters who held 49 per cent of Newsday’s stock under a trust. When Mr. Guggenheim sold 51 per cent to The Los Angeles Times a year ago, the trust said it would retain its shares. But later the four changed their minds and last October The Los Angeles Times negotiated successfully for the 49 per cent the trust held. : March 10, 1971 STARTING OVER After 10 years at Newsday, I was invited to a lavish lunch by Bill Attwood, who had just been installed as Publisher by the paper's new owner, the Times-Mirror Corp. Over coffee, he informed me that the time had come for me to resign from Newsday. I did, with no idea of what to do next. I floundered around for some months, trying to figure out whether I had any gift for business or politics or anything else besides newspapering.

One of Cahill’s remaining pubts is whether wastes from nicken farms upriver in New pork would cause excessive owth of algae and subsequent ss of oxygen in the Tocks Is- nd Reservoir. He is also demanding federal assurances that Washington will assume 90 per cent of the cost of building a network of roads to the Tocks Island Recreation Area, Cahill has estimated that the road network alone may cost $600 million. The hearing disclosed that the Tocks Island Dam was in trou- ble in Washington as well as Trenton. President Nixon’s Council on Environmental Quality has still not approved the environmental impact statement submitted by the Corps of Engineers in Octo- ber 1971. CEQ announced in February 1972 that its approval would not be granted until the gevernors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware sent formal letters of assurance that the states would pay their share of a water pollution con- trol facility for the reservoir. A © official said last week that none of the four governors had submitted the assurances. Finally, a number of key sena- tors on the Appropriations Com- mittee are getting restive about the rising cost estimates of Tocks Island. When originally authorized by the Congress in 1962, the total cost was estimated by the Corps of Engineers at $192.4 million. Now, because of inflation and in- creased environmental concern, the cost estimate has grown to $370 million, Sen, Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., declared that the costs were ris- ing between 10 and 15 per cent @ year and urged the Corps of En- Zineers to try to get New Jersey to assume the extra costs im- posed by recent delays. Montoya told a DRBC official: ‘*‘We’ve heard where governors have objected to projects, and the Corps of Engineers has pro- ceeded to deauthorize them, and that might happen unless you get a quick agreement.’’ Despite the pall of pessimism about the project, it could still be resuscitated by a major flood on the Delaware, such as the one in 1955 which gave rise to the Tocks Island project, or a severe drought as in 1965. Grow- ing national attention on the ‘fenergy crisis’’ and on water shortages in the New York met- ropolitan area could also con- tribute to its longevity. At the Appropriations sub- committee hearing, Gen. Groves assured senators that ‘‘I don’t believe it is dead.’’ Later, James F'. Wright, DRBC execu- tive director, asked the sub- committee to continue funding the dam because ‘‘we feel it is absolutely vital to the welfare of all the states ...’’ Column 5S Continued on 1 Page 2, Allentown Morning Call, March 13, 1973 \f"

Rooney, -Pa,, has managed to hold up a $21-million heavy-truck con- tract which the government had awarded to a competitor of Mack Trucks, Inc, of Allentown. Rooney disclosed that the Pentagon emp loye walked into his office two months ago and turned over to one of his aides a half-inch thick sheaf of internal but unclassified documents from the files of the Defense Supply Agency, Rooney declined to identify his tipster. Mack’s 20-ton truck lost out in bidding. The documents suggested that the first test model of an International Harvester-produced dump truck was not as sturdy as it was supposed to be under a 1972 contract with the Pentagon. According to a Roo- ney aide, the Pentagon employe feared that his branch of service would be stuck with some trucks that wouldn’t meet its all-weather requirements. So the employe turned over the test results to Rooney, knowing that Mack Trucks — one of the un- successful bidders of the original contract — was in Rooney’s district. Rooney promptly sent off copies of the deficient test results to the General Accounting Office and De- fense Secretary James Schlesinger, requesting an in- vestigation of whether the International Harvester trucks would meet the contract specifications. “T want it understood that my action in calling for an investigation of this procurement is not based on any communication of any kind with representatives of Mack,” said Rooney. He said his sole concern “‘is to see that the government gets what was specified in the contract.” Rooney disclosed Thursday that he had gotten a reply from the Defense Supply Agency which con- firmed that some features of the International Har- vester test model truck “may be unacceptable.” The Pentagon procurement agency’s reply co tinued: “If uncorrected these deficiencies could bee basis for termination of the contract.

P j Mack Trucks was one of four unsuccessful bid- ders on the 20-ton dump truck when the contract was awarded in June 1972 to International Harvester on a low-bid basis. If the Pentagon cancels the existing contract with International Harvester, it would pre- sumably reopen the bidding among the various truck Allentown manufacturers, including Mack. The contract calls for the production of 140 trucks a year for five years, at a cost of about $30,000 a | truck. The government has an option to increase each year’s portion of the contract by 50 per cent, meaning the total value of the contract may vary between $21 | million and $30 million. A spokesman for International Harvester con- firmed that the Defense Supply Agency has so far refused to accept the test model because of differing interpretations of the contract language. The first 140 trucks have already been assembled and are await ing acceptance by the Pentagon. : Told that an unidentified Pentagon employe had provided internal documents on the test results to Rooney’s office, one International Harvester spokes- man said, “I guess somebody's really after us — somebody who wants Mack to get the contract.” Contacted at his home, Zenon C.R. Hansen, board chairman of Mack Trucks, stated: “We lost the con- tract on bidding . . . we forgot about it, We have no quarrel with International Harvester, and we’re not out to get International Harvester.

While television cameras rolled, Shapp charged that the bill ‘would leave Pennsylvania unprotected and cOuld result in a_ tre- mendous economic calamity for the state. **\"You take an area like the anthracite region,’ said Shapp. “In all probability if this bill passes they are going to consoli- date the existing railroads in the area. That might be good for the Reading Railroad, but the econ- omy of this area could be very seriously hurt.” Shapp’s action came four days after the House Commerce Com- mittee finished drafting the 130- page Northeast rail bill and af- er seven months of committee work on rail legislation. When Shapp was asked why he had not appeared before the ommerce Committee during he drafting of the bill, the gov- ernor replied, ‘‘I have to admit o you that I cannot stay in ouch with everything that is go- | ing on in Harrisburg as well as everything in Washington .. .

The corporation would run a scaled- down rail network free of un- profitable branch lines and com- peting main lines. During the interim planning period, the Penn Central and the five other bankrupt lines would be kept running with the aid of $85 million in federal funds. Workers whose jobs are lost in the shakeup would be protected by a $250-million labor compen- sation package, and commu- nities threatened with a loss of service would be eligible for a share of $50 million a year in federal operating subsidies.

As the month wore on, the weather system wound itself up clock- wise and began dragging oven-dry air off the Kazakh desert and blowing it across the Caspian Sea, into the Volga basin. There, in the latitude of Minnesota, the mean temperatures were like Texas. And while farm Managers in the Volga region ordinarily get an inch and a half of rain in June, this time only half an inch of rain fell all month long. Toward the end of June, some of the wheat in the Volga basin was already beginning to shrivel, afflicted by ‘“ex- treme stress.” Perhaps as much as 5 per cent of all the grain lands in Russia were now in danger of being ruined. O it was that on the Fourth of July, 1972, a slender, graying Russian named Nikolai Belousov received a courtly, aris- tocratic American businessman named Michel Fri- bourg in his suite at the Regency Hotel in New York City. The two were not strangers; Belousov, who is chairman of Exportkhleb, the Soviet grain trading corporation, and Fribourg, who is president of the Continental Grain Company, had met 15 years earlier and had renewed their acquaintance about the time of the first Soviet purchases of grain from the United States in 1962. In that encounter with Exportkhleb, Fribourg had figured out a legal way of using the United States Government's agri- cultural-export subsidy program to give the Rus- sians a bargain on ocean shipping rates for the grain they wanted to buy. And in the intervening years, they had kept in touch; when the Russians had had their own grain to export, Continental Grain had bought it for resale to others, and as recently as 1971, Fribourg had again devised the most attractive package deal when the Russians had wanted to buy American corn, barley and oats. But now the capitalist trader and the Com- munist bureaucrat were up to bigger things. For several days, their subordinates had been testing each other’s reflexes in preliminary talks about a possible new transaction. When the Continental side grasped what the Russians had in mind, the company’s communications center contacted Fri- bourg in Europe, and he caught the first jet to meet Belousov in New York. Beginning early July 4, they bargained on and off for 36 hours, at the Regency and then downtown at Continental’s office at 2 Broadway. At the end they sealed, with a hand- shake and a toast in vodka, an agreement by Con- tinental to sell the Russians about $460-million worth of grain. Fribourg believes the deal was the largest single transaction a private businessman had ever negotiated up to that time. That was just the beginning. Over the next five weeks, Belousov kept buying, buying, buying— from Fribourg and five other American grain ex- port companies. Suddenly in August, the Japanese, the Europeans and other traditional American grain customers found themselves in a clammy panic at the thought that there might not be enough American grain to go around. Total United States export transactions rose to such a magnitude that foreign grain sales would later be blamed for food shortages in America and for the dramatic inflation the following year. The dealings between Belousov and the American grain traders occurred in a context of astonishing nonchaiance on the part of United States Govern- ment officials, particularly those in the Department of Agriculture. Although at least one key official was getting an unofficial play-by-play account of the Russian purchases, this information did not go beyond his office, as far as anyone can tell. For reasons of shortsightedness verging on incom- petence, the Government failed to take steps to offset the economic dislocations of the Russia grain deal. And to compound the injury, American tax- New York Times Magazine, November 25, 1973 \\fpayers had to pay $300-million in unnecessary export subsidies for the privilege of having sold too much grain to Russia and other countries, As Treasury Secretary George Shultz would say later on about the grain deal, the United States got “burned.” The private deal That is not how the grain deal looked in advance, particularly at the White House, The President had Jong been aware of the political consequences of low farm prices. He got one early lesson on that subject back in 1960 when Gov. William Stratton of Illinois told him late one night in a hotel room at the Republican convention: “You can say all you want about foreign affairs, but what’s really im- portant is the price of hogs in Chicago and St. Louis.” As it turned out that year, the price of hogs in Chicago and St. Louis was low on election day, and perhaps by coincidence, John Kennedy carried Illinois and Missouri by a total of only 19,000 votes and went to the White House. It was an experience Nixon did not forget. Now, in the summer of 1972, the prospect of sell- ing surplus grain to Russia must have seemed delicious to Nixon. Everyone from the Grain Sorghum Producers Association to the Brookings Institution to George McGovern was in favor of jacking up the level of American farm exports. A successful grain sale would give Nixon a chance— all in one play—to score points with the farmers, to fix up the balance of payments, and to solidify the détente that had become a fixture of recent U.S.-Soviet diplomacy. Twelve months before the 1972 election, Nixon had brought in Earl L. Butz, Indiana’s War- rior from Wawaka, to be the new Secretary of Agriculture, and had given him a mandate to do whatever necessary to raise farm prices and reduce surpluses. As important, he had set in motion a series of high-level diplomatic contacts designed to encourage the sale of American grain to the So- viet Union, the most recent round of negotiations occurring during his visit to Moscow in May, 1972, when he had discussed credit terms with Brezhnev. Against this backdrop, Belousov and his team of Russian grain traders could count on a decent reception when they stepped off a Moscow-to- New York jet on June 28, 1972. And yet they had every reason to expect a troublesome negotiation, because their bargaining position was transparently weak, The American Government, as well as the private grain traders, was well aware that Brezhnev had locked himself into a grain-gobbling plan to grow more livestock for the consumers. The Ameri- cans also had reason to believe that the Russian granaries were almost empty, and it was no secret here that bad weather had already put the new Russian wheat crop in question. Given their position, Soviet buyers had to act quickly, before the market caught on to the im- mensity of the orders they were prepared to place, At the same time, they had to charter hundreds of cargo ships to transport their treasure back to Russia’s Black Sea ports, And the actual purchases had to be synchronized with the credit agreement that the higher-ups in the Foreign Trade Ministry were still working out with the United States Government. Furthermore, the Russians could not count on a simple deal worked out through Government chan- nels, The other big grain-exporting nations, Canada and Australia, had Government  grain-trading monopolies that bought from the farmers and sold directly to foreign buyers. And indeed, Soviet Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Viadimir Alkhimov, visiting Washington that spring, had asked United States Agriculture Department negotia- tors if they could see a way to arrange a direct swap of Russian natural gas for American grain, or perhaps the direct purchase by Russia of grain from American Government surpluses, But in America, the Russians had been told, international grain trading would continue to be left to Govern- ment-subsidized capitalists, who were free to sell all the grain they could because there was always a surplus. That is the way the system had worked under Democratic Administrations, and that is how Henry Kissinger had told the Agriculture Depart- ment in January, 1972, to handle any grain sales to Russia: The U. S, Government would offer the financing, but the actual sales would be left to pri- vate exporters. Belousov and his party installed themselves in a suite at the Madison Hotel in Washington on June 29 and began to operate. His two principal assist- ants were Leonid Kalitchenko, the young head of the grain department of Exportkhleb, who spoke English much better than Belousov, and Paul Sakun of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, who was appar- ently to serve as a watchdog, even though he looked like a portly Santa Claus, That afternoon calls went out from Belousov’s suite to Continental in New York, to Cargill, Inc., outside Minneapolis, to Cook Industries in Memphis and to Bunge Corporation in New York, But it did not take Belousov long to decide to put his problem in the hands of Continental Grain and Fribourg, its 60-year-old president. It would be hard to conceive of a less likely ally for the Communist trader. Michel Fribourg, for starters, was among the several hundred richest American capitalists, and he lived in the international grand style. In the autumn, he moved into his New York town house, with its Louis XV furniture and Modiglianis, On winter weekends, he drove to a private ski club north of the Catskills. For the spring, he had a country place in Connecticut and in June he was usually off to his apartment in Paris. He spent the hot months in the Alps or on the Riviera. An aristocrat he was, but a playboy he was not. A man with a knack for carrying his business with him, Michel Fribourg had been personally running (Continued on Page 84) Joseph Albright is a Washington-based investi- gative reporler.

Belousov and _ Fribourg could not make a deal, how- ever, without directly involv- ing a third party; his name was Carroll G. Brunthaver, and he was a 41-year-old Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. It is one of the organizational mysteries of Washington's huge Government agencies that major decisions often wind up being made by minor figures. So it was that Presi- dent Nixon and his chief ad- visers had labored mightily over a period of months to persuade Russia to buy a few hundred million dollars a year of American grain on credit, succeeding finally in the sum- mer of 1972, but it fell to As- sistant Secretary Brunthaver to decide that it would be all right for Exportkhleb to pur- chase a vastly bigger quantity of grain than anyone had anticipated, and most of it at an artificially low price. This decision ‘was at the core of the Soviet grain deal as it eventually became a wrench- ing problem for the American economy. New York Times Magazine, November 25, Carroll Brunthaver did not get his job through any repu- tation for bold decisiveness. He was known instead for bookish competence and Boy- Scoutish decency. His résumé was faultless. Raised on his family’s grain and livestock farm in Ohio, he joined the 4-H Club, became an Air Force fighter pilot and later wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the Ohio lamb-marketing structure. Brunthaver had worked as research director for the Na- tional Grain and Feed Asso- ciation, and then as an asso- ciate research director for Cook Industries. Shortly after the Nixon Administration took over in 1969, he was re- cruited to be associate ad- ministrator of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conserva- tion Service, -which adminis- ters domestic crop Subsidies. At Agriculture, Brunthave earned a reputation for ad ministering his subsidies anc keeping his mouth shut. wEnies the job of Assistant Secreta of Agriculture for Interna tional Affairs was vacated i June, 1972, it was natura that Secretary Butz shoulc elevate Carroll Brunthave The Senate confirmed hi unanimously, without eve holding a hearing on his qual ifications. Brunthaver had been in his new, larger office a wee when Butz told him o about June 28 that Sovie First Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Mikhail R. Kuzmi had arrived in Washington tc negotiate a credit agreemen that would facilitate another grain sale to Russia. Out of the 100,000 employes of the Agriculture Department, Butz says he deliberately restricted that secret to three people: himself, Brunthaver, and Deputy General Counsel Claude Coffman. In the midst of the Govern- ment-to-Government negotia- tions, Carroll Brunthaver go his first inkling that some thing was already going 0 besides credit talks. July 3, 1972, was a Monda Brunthaver began the morn Kuzmin at the Commerce De partment. Brunthaver’s cal endar showed a luncheon date with Butz and the Ambas sador from Pakistan. But be fore the lunch, he had agreed to fit in a meeting with three executives of the Continenta Grain Company. The meeting, according tc the Continental executives, be gan in Brunthaver’s office i the Agriculture Administra tion Building shortly afte 11:30.A.M. Since Brunthave seemed hurried, Bernarc Steinweg, a senior vice pres ident of Continental, came right to the point: A Rus sian grain - buying tea now in New York, had made a stunning proposition. B Steinweg’s sworn account, he gave Brunthaver the specific: of it: On wheat, the Russians wanted firm bids on four mil lion tons—as much wheat as 210 million Americans use for bread-baking and other food in 100 days. On corn and other feed grains, Steinweg . said the Russians wanted firm bids on something like the same quantity they had bought from Continental in 1971—which was 2- 9 million tons. Anyone in the grain busi- ness whq heard such figures could take a paper and-pencil and ‘calculate that the Rus- sians were talking in terms of at least a $350-miilion order from Continental alone, vast- ly bigger than anything in the history of- grain exporting. Just getting it to ports would take more than 100,000 box cars. Brunthaver remembers not only meeting Steinweg but hearing of the Russian in- quiry and translating the prospective sale into dollars. However, the dollar sales fig- ure that sticks in his mind is $200-milion, which would represent the approximate value of the wheat alone. Yet Brunthaver says he was un- _der the impression that $200- million represented both wheat and corn. There is also uncertainty in Brunthaver’s mind about the date of the meeting, although he does not flatly comtradict Steinweeg’s testimony that it was July 3. The tnree Continental executives had visited the Agriculture Department that day because they needed to know, before quoting any wheat prices to the Russians, whether the United States Government would continue using export subsidies to keep the world price of wheat frozen at approximately $60 a ton.* Steinweg remembers Brun- thaver making some rough calculations om a piece of scrap paper and then giving him some tentative figures on the “target price” of each class of wheat. C'Target Price’? was the terminology for the world price level that the United States Government would use its subsidies to maintain.) For hard winter wheat, according to Steinweg, Brunthaver’s proposed target price actually ranged between $59.50 and $60.60 a ton. At the end of their conversation, Steinweg recalis Brunthaver saying he would have to think about the target prices before making a commitment, and that he would call back later in the day. Within the Agriculture De- partment, export subsidies had been under Carroll Brun- (Continued on Page 91) *the Russian grain deal acted in metric tons, not bushels.

The idea was to bring about a mild squeeze in other wheat-growing countries b setting a price low enough to persuade their farmers not to expand their own wheat crops. Since no other coun tries could consistently expo wheat any cheaper, the Agri culture Department had in ef. fect fixed the world price of wheat. The mechanism for price freezing in wheat was the ex. port subsidy, which had bee paid since 1949 in the Agricut ture Department at a cumula tive cost to the Treasury of $4-billion. The idea, as de signed by Congress, was to allow American farmers to Bet a “fair return” through higher domestic prices, while at the same time selling thei crops abroad at a price tha met the international competi tion. Under the program, the Government paid exporters the difference between the domestic price and the frozen worid price. Evidently Brunthaver mot see any reason to inquire deeply into whether and how! long the world wheat price should be kept at $60 a ton. He could have raised the ques tion when he saw Secreta Butz that day for lunch, but he says he didn’t. Nor did he bring it up at his early after noon meeting with the agri cultural subsidies expert at the Office of Management an Budget. Instead, he made the decision intuitively, by him self, without knowing all thi facts. He did not know, instance, that his own sub ordinates in the Agriculture Department had just receivec a cable from the United States agricultural attaché in Mos cow that accurately foresa that the Russian wheat crof would be drastically belov earlier forecasts.

It- was an _open commitment, | with no maximum and no cut- off date. When Fribourg got ‘ eff the plane from Paris later that evening, he learned. of Brunthaver’s commitment and got ready to meet Belousov at the Regency the next day. From Belousov’s viewpoint, the deal he proceeded to make with Fribourg must have seem- ed surprisingly alluring, partic- ularly on wheat. On the huge order of 4 million tons, he got a secure price per ton that would not change, even if Fribourg had to bid up the domestic price when he went into the American market to buy the tonnage. Fribourg says that neither he nor any other exporter could have af- forded to quote a fixed price on such a vast order without Brunthaver’s prior commit- ment on export subsidies. In addition, Fribourg was able to offer the wheat at a tremendous discount off the world price of $60 a ton. His actual selling price, says one Government source, was $58.90 a ton—well below the lower end of Brunthaver’s “target price” range. Fribourg, looking back now, will acknowledge that he “took a slight countermargin” in the deal, which brought the selling price below the target price, but he won’t say how much. Though he won’t say how he accomplished this, he apparently did so by play- ing the game of subsidy trad- ing. An exporter with strong nerves could take advantage of leeway in the Government’s then existing subsidy regula- tions to maximize his profit on a sale; for example, he could collect subsidy for wheat he planned to sell in the future, betting that the amount of the subsidy would go down, or he could delay~ taking a subsidy for a sale, betting that it would increase. On corn, which made up the other half of Continental’s sale to Belousov, Fribourg could not quote the Russians a price below the world mar- ket rate, since the Govern- ment didn’t have a corn ex- port subsidy. While Fribourg declines to give any specifics of his pricing system, it is understood from outside sources that he told Belousov that the domestic price of corn would inevitably rise as Continental tried to buy up 4.5 million tons for Export- khleb. So Fribourg is said to have offered the Russians a price of $50 a ton, which was at or slightly above the mar- ket. ““We took precautions to minimize our risks,’ says Fribourg. There was another part of the deal that, to the Russians, may have been the most im- portant: Fribourg agreed that his own ocean chartering company, Stellar Chartering & Brokerage, would serve as the Russian Government’s agent in obtaining whatever foreign-flag cargo ships it needed in getting its Ameri- can grain purchases back to Russia. But of the various clauses of the negotiation, the shipping agreement is the one Fribourg is least willing to discuss. 3 On the morning of July 6, Steinweg says, he spoke with Brunthaver on the _ tele- phone to notify him that Con- tinental’s sale was “con- summated.”” (However, Brun- thaver has testified he doesn’t remember a confirmation call, but “I am  =not_ neces- sarily calling Mr. Steinweg a liar.” He added: “It is con- ceivable that Mr. called, and I misinterpreted what he said... . I don’t know.”’) The public picture While Brunthaver was hearing reports of the private grain-buying negotiations in ‘New York, he was actually sitting in on the Government- to-Government discussions on credits going on simultaneous- _ ly in Washington. The Soviet Government had sent word directly to the » White House toward the end of June that it was now will- ing to accept the credit ar- rangement that Nixon had spelled out for Brezhnev at the summit on May 28. But despite the agreement in prin- ciple, it took eight full days of negotiating to get the de- tails of the two-page agree- ment settled. Deputy Minister Kuzmin first insisted that the United States should absorb any bank charges in obtaining letters of credit; Commerce Secretary Peter Peterson said no. Then Kuzmin wanted the 6144 per cent interest to be fixed for the life of the agree- ment, but Butz resisted. If the Russians thought they were getting a good deal, they didn’t show it. . The credit agreement was signed and announced on July 8 with full fanfare at two White Houses. In the morning Henry Kissinger briefed the White House press corps at . San Clemente on the outlines of the credit agreement. In Steinweg __. the afternoon, Butz and Peter- son held a more detailed brief- ing at the Washington White House, with the sound piped to reporters at San Clemente. “This is,” said Butz, “the largest grain deal so far as we know in the history of the world.” The, Secretary volun- - teered that his aides had tried that morning to figure out the size of the Biblical grain deaf between Josias and _ the Pharoah, and had come up with an estimate of 500,000 bushels. This deal “far sur- passed” it, Butz.said. But he gave no indication that some of the grain had already been sold. Under terms of the agree- ment, the Russians contracted to purchase a total of at least $750-million worth of United States-grown grains from American private exporting companies over the next three years, including at least $200- million in the first year. The Russians could pick their-own assortment of corn, wheat, sorghum, rye, barley and oats. There was nothing in the agreement setting maximum tonnages -of any commodity, because it did not occur to the American delegation that the Russians could ever buy too much. In exchange, the Americans agreed to allow Exportkhleb to buy grain on credit, using grain-purchasing na- tions. Under its terms, Russia would be able to pay for each ‘installments, ning one year after delivery. Russia could buy on credit as much grain as it .wanted, so long as the cumulative debt stayed within a $500-million credit ceiling. For all grain shipments made in the first nine months, the Russians agreed to pay a fixed 61% per cent interest. After Agriculture Department. At the White House press conference, Butz said the bulk of the Russian purchases would be in wheat and corn, which turned out to be true. But he conveyed three other impressions at the briefing that turned out to be mislead- ing. First, he underestimated the size of the Russian appetite. While offering his own opin- ion that the Russians would ~ buy more than the $750-mil- lion over three years, he said he was “sure” they would not exceed it in the first year. Second, Butz underestimated 1973 (continued) \\fthe impact on American food prices, saying the Russian purchases “won’t have any’ impact” on the price of bread, and would have “an imperceptible result, if any result at all’? on the price of livestock. Third, he gave a faise impression of the cost of the grain sales te the United States by assuring reporters it “does not invoive subsidy to the Russians.” To Brunthaver, who was standing behind Butz at the briefing, these remarks must have seemed somewhat sur- real. In the recent days ~fal- lowing his first meeting with the Continental executives, he had received some indications from other sources that the Russians were already in the process of purchasing much more wheat than the Agricul- ture Secretary’s staterments would indicate, and that they intended to purchase a great deal more, and soon. If Fribourg and the Rus- sians could keep their .meet- ings secret, they could not carry out the transaction in hiding. Indications that it had taken place were already being picked up by other grain exporters, who were growing nervous. For example, Cook’s executive vice president, Wil- lard R. Sparks, says that on July 3 he telephoned Brun- thaver to inquire about an unsettling development. Why, he asked his one-time em- ploye, was Continental Grain suddenly buying so much wheat and corn on the futures markets? Did this mean the Russians had made a deal with Continental, and if so, how much? Sparks says Brun- thaver gave him no informa- tion. & few davs later, Cargill picked up another disquieting clue: Continental had sudden- ly begun to charter a lot of ships. Whether Cargill brought this to Brunthaver’s attention or not is unknown, but evi- dently the company had the opportunity to do so. There were two telephone calls total- ing 12 minutes on July 5 be- tween Brunthaver and _ the headquarters of Cargill in Minnesota, but neither Brun- thaver nor Cargill cam recdn- struct the conversations, or recall if they spoke of the Rus- sian grain sate. And that very morning, be- fore the Secretary's press conference, Brunthaver had met in his office with an of- ficial of Louis Dreyfus Cor- poration, another large grain- export house with headquar- ters in New York and Paris. Patrick J. Gardner Jr., a vice president of Dreyfus, says he met Brunthaver alone and told him the Russians were interested in buying “a large quantity” of wheat. As Gardner recailed it later, *“] asked him whether he could state that the United States would continue its as the domestic market price increased or decreasing them if such price went down. Dr. Brunthaver replied that it had been the Government’s policy to seli wheat abroad at prices competitive with world prices and that the Government in- tended to follow the same policy in an effort to push United States wheat sales; accordingly, there was no in- tention to depart from the policy of the last two years of maintaining the world price.”” Brunthaver recalis meet- ing Gardner that day and giv- ing him that assurance. Two days later, Dreyfus completed a sale to Exportkhleb of 750,- 000 tons of hard winter wheat. The next party heard from was Melvin H. Middents, a vice president of Cargill. Al- though Cargill rivals Con- tinental in total grain ex- ports, it was left with the tag ends of the Russian orders, both in 1963 and 1971. For the first nine days of July, the top men at Cargill were nervously wondering whether Exportkhleb might leave them out of the bidding entirely this time. Finally, on the morning of July 10, the Rus- sian buyers asked for a meet- ing with Cargill at their hotel suite—by now on the 42d floor of the New York Hilton —that same afternoon. Be- fore the night was out, they made ae verbal agreement with W. B. (Barney) Saunders, a vice president of Cargill, to buy 1 million tons of hard winter wheat at $59.50 a ton. Cargill, like Dreyfus and Continental, couldn’t quote a price on wheat without hav- ing talked to Carroll Brun- thaver. As with the others, Brunthaver assured Cargill that the Government had no plams to change its policy on maintaining the world price of wheat. Cargill’s contact man, Middents, has sworn that he consulted with Brun- thaver “while these sales were being negotiated and in a period of time following.”’ Middents says he told Brun- thaver that the sales were “large,” but did not give the exact. quantities. wheat. He snapped up 1.5 mil. lion tons from Continental New York Times Magazine, November 25, 1973 (continued) \\fplus 600,000 tons from Cook Industries and 200,000 tons from aéesmaller exporter, Garnac. The Exportkhleb team left for Moscow, via Amsterdam, on July 21. With- in three weeks they had bought, $705-million worth otf - ‘American grains —nearly as much as they were obligated to buy over the next three years. While no one in the Agriculture Department knew the precise figures, the fact was that CarroH Brunthaver had been consulted before - the about  $600-million of sales.. But Brunthaver says now that actually he wasn't sure, as the summer went along, whether the Russians . were buying wheat or simply getting bids. . : From the way Belousov spoke to the executives at _ Continental and Cook, he ap- parently thought his job was - done when he teft for Mos- cow. But four days after he got home, he was to head back to New York. No doubt Soviet officials remained nervous over the fact that the Volga basin hadn’t had a mil- limeter of rain in the whole month of July, and that weather reports showed. the region to be still in the grip of the same high-pressure system. They also must have been . delighted at the news that Belousov could buy ap- parently unlimited supplies of wheat at a rate even below the world price of $60 a ton. In any case, on either July 31 or Aug. 1,. both Melvin Middents of Cargill and Daniel R. Finn of Dreyfus called Brunthaver with a fa- miliar refrain: The Russians “There was nothing in the agreement setting maximum tonmages of any commodity. because it did net occur to “ the Americans that the Russians could ever buy teo much.” wanted more wheat, and in light of everything, would the Agriculture Department still stand behind the world price of $60 a ton through export subsidies? © Yes, replied Brunthaver, the policy of the United States Government on export sub- Sidies was still the same. Brunthaver later testified that he had every intention _ of keeping the world price of * wheat at $60 a ton all through -1972, “to move as much as possible.” It _ wheat ... never occurred ta him, he said, that the Russians would buy more than this country could spare. His reasoning went like this: He knew that every one of the grain export- ers had a top limit on the capacity. of its grain elevators to load ~ grain ‘on ships. He was sure, from his back- ground at Cook and in the Agriculture Department, “that the exporters would be smart enough to avoid selling more grain than they had the capac- ity to export. Unfortunately, the exporters had the capacity to export more grain than the United States had to spare. In the first days of August, from Continental, Dreyfus, Garnac, Bunge, Cargill and Cook, the team from Export- khleb bought about $435-mil- lion- more — about half in wheat and the rest in soy-. beans, corn, barley and sor- ghums. In the two buying trips, they had bought 12 mii- lion tons of wheat plus 7 mil- lion tons of other grains for $1.14-billion. On Aug. 8, 1972, the Rus- sians found themselves guests of Cook Industries, surveying the Atlantic Ocean at Miami Beach. Business was nearly. over; they sat down and Stayed very quiet for several minutes. . “It’s an old Russian cus- tom,” Belousov told his hosts. “We do this when we leave a place where there has been much happiness. We. think about coming back.”  Then the Russians walked to the surf, took some kopeks ‘out of their pockets, and tossed them over their shoul- ders into the Atlantic. The impact . For the past 25 years, the problem for aH Secretaries of Agriculture had been that American farmers had the capacity’ to ‘grow’ much more food than they could sell profitably. To keep up farm- ers’ incomes, the Government paid several billion dollars a year in subsidies to idle 30 million to 50 million acres of . productive land. Even so the crops were usually so abundant that the Govern- ment had to store thousands of tons of surpluses. Secretary Butz had been appointed by ‘President Nixon to do some- thing about the huge grain surpluses, and in 1972 he car- ried this perception of his role to what turned out to be ab-\" surd lengths. : Immediately after his Sen- ate confirmation, Butz acted to take an extra five million acres of wheat land out of production for 1972. County agents were told to explain to winter-wheat growers, whose seeds. were already in the ground, that the Government would pay them for the wheat they would have harvested. if they would now plow up a portion of their seéded fields. Spring-wheat growers were given special incentives to re- duce their planned acreage. In all, 60 million acres of grain lands were held out of production last year. ‘ Even so, at the time Belou- sov was making his purchases, stocks of grain were near rec- ord highs—23 million tons of wheat and 50 million tons of feed grains. So concerned was Butz about surpluses that a week after his July 8 announcement | of the largest grain deal “in the history of the world,” he informed farmers that still another five million acres of. wheat land would be subsi- dized out of production in 1973. The Cost of Living Council staff, and later its chairman, George Shultz, tried in Sep- tember to get Butz to open ‘up the 1973 wheat acreage be- cause of the Russian grain deal. Butz, still confident the supplies would last, refused Saga of the grain drain: It opens last year, with meetings between eager Russian buyers and eager American exporters. The sale is agreed to; much of America’s grain becomes Soviet property. Keep an eye on the eagie-eyed eagle. 7 and made it stick. With the. ‘election two months away, politics was part of the rea- son. As-one of Butz’s aides put it, “The Secretary did not want to be known as a cheap- food man.” It war not until a few months after the 1972 ’ election, when it was too kate for farmers to plant more win- ter wheat, that Shultz finally ‘won the argument and got some acreage freed for farm- ing. But by that time, the economic consequences of the previous summer’s transac- tions were well apparent. | When the credit arrange- ment with Russia was an- _nounced on July 8, 1972, traders at the Kansas City Board of Trade took a look at the estimated American grain surpluses and decided that another few hundred mil- lion dollars in exports would not create a strain on sup- plies. But on Aug. 2, a trade publication finally learned of the magnitude of the first batch of Russian purchases. The following day, the Reu- ters commodity wire carried a bullish item: “Russian trade delegates, currently in New York, are placing orders for further substantial quantities . of U.S. wheat and feed grains, - according to informed sources here. The unexpected return visit of the Soviet officials earlier this week remains Shrouded in secrecy. . . .” The domestic price of wheat in Kansas City, which had held almost steady for a month, now jumped the equiv- alent of $2.90 a ton on Aug. 3, $2.50 a ton on Aug. 4 and another $3.70 a ton on Aug. 10. It was the beginning of a year-long spiral in all grain prices that would see wheat soaring from less than $60 up to $180 a ton. The Russian sale, in itself, was not big enough to create a food shortage. But it had a shock effect in every other grain-purchasing nation, par- ticularly since both Canada and Australia were very short of exportable wheat. Orders began flowing in from Eu- rope and Japan, as these tra- ditional grain buyers pressed to get in their orders while the United States Agriculture Department was still holding the world price at the low level of $60 a ton. Then, later in the year, they kept buying to get in their orders while there was any wheat, corn or soybeans left at all. Natural forces accentuated the demand for American raw commodities. In the Pacific Ocean, a change in the Hum- boldt Current destroyed the Peruvian anchovy catch, and that increased the demand for an alternative protein source, New York Times Magazine, November 25, 1973 (continued) \fsoybeans. In India, early fall monsoon rains were too light for good rice and sorghum crops, and there were disap- pointing crops in - Burma, Thailand and parts of Africa. Then early in 1973, when the American stockpiles were nearly exhausted, the dollar - was once again ‘devalued. Suddenly the price of wheat, in terms of Japanese yen, was 14 per cent lower, and Japa- nese wheat orders surged. Dur- ing the 12 months beginning with the $1.1-billion Russian ' sale, America’s total agricul- tural exports increased by $4.8-billion, or 60 per cent, over the previous year. Initially, it was the farmers . who complained loudest about the deal, particularly those in the Southwest who had sold their crops early on assur- ances from the Agriculture Department that the price of wheat was unlikely to go up. Today, the farmers are gen- erally better off than before, even though many are angry that they did not get a healthier share of the profits. Many wheat farmers who were complaining last year are now thinking about in- come-tax shelters, Miami va- cations and accelerated de- preciation on their new com- bines and _ tractors. — True, cattle or poultry farmers have been squeezed between Gov- ernment price controls and unbelievable feed bills. But there is no question that the grain deal has brought wide- spread prosperity in the farm belt. In the year following the arrival of Belousov, the aver- age American farmer’s net income rose 14 per cent faster than inflation. . . . The Russians buy more grain than they have ships to carry. Who helps provide sufficient ships? U.S. exporters. The American grain-export- ing companies also came out ahead, but not by as much as they had expected. Although Brunthaver had given them a commitment that the $60-a- ton target price on wheat would be maintained indefi- nitely, that commitment was revoked Aug. 25, 1972, on or- ders from Budget Director Caspar Weinberger. Under Weinherger’s directive, the Agriculture Department gave the exporters one week to: sign up for all the subsidies they needed to complete their current deals, includirg sales tothe Russians. Then, over the next three. weeks, the wheat- export subsidy was phased down to zero. As it turned out, the wheat-export subsidy paid during the period of the Russian sales totaled about $300-million, of which half was for wheat destined for Russia and half for other pur- chasing countries. The sudden phase-out of export subsidies caught. the exporters before they had ac- cumulated enough wheat to cover their sales to Export- khleb. Any notions of cushy profits on the Russian deal per se were wiped out, as they scrambled to buy the ‘needed tonnage as quickly as: they could. Cargill’s account- ants later reported that the company actually lost about $661,000 on the Soviet sale. Outsiders cannot know ex- actly what the Russian grain deal did for the Continental Grain Company; it says that its pretax profit on the $320- million of wheat it eventually sold to Russia was only about $1.8-million. But that does not count its sale of corn or the shipping contracts, or the profits Continental derived from the higher price of grain in other export sales. There is one clue suggesting that the Fribourgs had a very fat year over-all: Just before the Rus- sian grain deal, Continental Grain took out a $15-million line of bank credit when it wanted to finance a corporate acquisition of about that size. One year later, when it wanted to finance an §$11- million acquisition, the com- pany said it could do so out of “working capital.” The. biggest winners were the Russians. They began the summer of 1972 in a tepid bargaining position, with empty granaries and bad growing weather. Neverthe- less, they walked away with contracts for enough grain to offset their own crop short- fall, with enough left over to continue Russian grain ex- ports to Eastern Europe and build a grain stockpile for 1973. Most of their purchase was of wheat, which the United States Agriculture De- partment promoted for them at a discount below the going world price. - Their credit terms—a $500- million credit at 644 per cent interest—turned out to be a second bargain. By the time the Russians began repaying the credit, interest rates in the United States had climbed to the point where the United States Treasury itself was paying better than 6% per cent interest when it borrowed money. And, because of the doubling of the price of gold in London and Zurich, it has turned out that the Russians are paying for their $1.1-bil- lion of American grain with what are, for them, half-price dollars. / The clear losers in the grain deal were the supermarket- shopping,. tax-paying Ameri- can bystanders, On one hand, their combined grocery bills rose perhaps $5-billion be- cause of it. On the other hand, the Agriculture Department spent $300-million in export subsidies to hold the price of wheat abroad to a needlessly low price. Over the last year, supermarket food prices have jumped about 20 per cent. Just how much of that rise can be pinned on crop exports is de- batable. Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, estimates that fully 15 points of the 20 per- centage-point rise in food prices would not have hap- pened if it had not been for the increase in agricultural exports. At the low extreme, ‘the Agriculture Department has calculated that only 3 per- centage points of the 20 per cent domestic food price. in- crease were attributable to increased exports. Gary L. Seevers, the agricultural ex- pert on the President’s Coun- cil of Economic Advisers, falls in between. “My feeling,” said Seevers, “is that perhaps half of the acceleration in food prices could be attrib- uted to factors associated with the worldwide boom in export demand.” Despite the furor over the Russian grain deal in Con- gress, none of the investiga- tions succeeded in pinning down how much economic impact it actually had. It would be easy to trace the direct results—higher wheat But not to worry. The exporters are collecting Federal sub- sidies on their sales. Cast to the eagle: $300-million. . . . means higher flour means an extra nickel for a loaf of bread. But how to measure all the side effects—for ex- ample, the psychological im- pact of higher corn prices on the farmers who raise corn and hogs? In the early months of 1973, the Agriculture De- partment expected farmers to breed many more hogs to take advantage of the fabulously - high pork prices. But it turned out that many growers simply decided they could make enough money by selling their corn, instead of worrying about breeding more hogs. So pork prices went even higher. Milk and cheese prices are just recently getting a delayed jolt from higher grain prices. Dairy herds that had been barely profitable with low feed prices were in some cases priced into the slaugh- terhouse by high feed prices. Beef prices have so far been ~ little touched by the Russian grain sale, but the effects of higher feed costs may show up next year. The shame is that, if handled‘ differently, the Russian grain deal could have been a net plus all around. The assessment Ideally, the United States Government should have de- cided during the spring of 1972 that there was a point beyond which grain export sales should be discouraged. The question should have been put to the Council of Economic Advisers, the Cost of Living Council and the Of- fice -of Management and Budget instead of being casually left to a new Assist- ant Secretary of Agriculture after the Russian traders ar- rived. Ideally, the Agriculture De- partment should have had a formal reporting system to tell its .own working-level experts, as well as the farm- ers and the rest of the Gov- ernment, how much grain was being sold for export. Instead, the department relied on un- official calls from the ex- porters to Assistant Secretary Brunthaver, and he kept the information to himself. ° Ideally, Brunthaver and Butz should have recognized that the United States was the only large source of ex- portable wheat in the world. Therefore, Brunthaver should have avoided promising the exporters that the world wheat price would be kept at $60 a ton indefinitely. Cer- tainly for the August round of Russian purchases and per- haps from the beginning, \fBrunthaver should have un- frozen the world wheat price and let it find a new level through supply and demand. Quite, possibly, this alone motives. So.far, no dollar cor- ruption has been sighted or even hinted, not even by Sena- ‘2 would have cut down the ton- - ci enough so that American ana stocks would not have been oversold. Ideally, the rest of the i In fact, there turns out “to have been an inverse ratio nm campaign contribu- United States . Government - should have reacted faster to\" the first hints in mid-July, 1972, that the Agriculture De- partment might be pushing too much grain abroad. Even as late as Labor Day, the Agriculture Department could . have been forced to cail a conference of grain-importing _ countries to work out a yol-\" ordered to open up the fol- | lowing year’s wheat acreage before the election instead of afterward. In fact, not one Congressman made such sug- gestions at the time, and the few worriers on the staff of the Cost of Living Council were quickly overruled. How to explain the gap be- tween what everyone: should have done and what they did? it is because someone was reached with a suitcase full dered about the possibility of uncovering evidence of venal gave $139,137 to the Nixon campaign, did not sell a bushel to Belousov. Some trading partners without clearing them at the White House. 7 Conspiracy theories are al- ‘ways popular. Could the Rus- sian grain deal be the product Of an ignoble chumminess between the grain traders and the top officials of the De-. partment -of Agriculture? There is no question that some key officials in the Agriculture Department came The most salient case is Assistant Secretary of Agri- culture Clarence Palmby. Passed over by Nixon as a possible Secretary of Agri- culture, Palmby decided in the spring of.1972 to leave his job in the Agriculture Department to work .for Michel Fribourg as a vice president of Conti- nental Grain. Using Fribourg as a financial reference, he bought a $108,000 cooperative apartment on Sutton Place South in March, 1972, One ~ month later, Palmby flew to Moscow as a United States ment in May and joined Con- tinental Grain on June 8, a few weeks before the Russian delegation arrived to buy grain. In his new role as a Continental executive, he sat in during some of Fribourg’s bargaining sessions with Bel- ousov but maintains he con- tributed nothing. Meanwhile, his job at the De- partment was filled by his old friend and protégé, Carroll Brunthaver, a one-time em- ploye of another grain export- ing company, Cook Industries. All of this has provoked suspicions that Palmby car- ried valuable inside informa- tion on Russian intentions from the private recesses of Palmby may have brought to Fribourg, they were appar- ently not specific enough to make Continental Grain get ready for a big sale by buying up wheat futures contracts in - kept Palmby else in the Agriculture De- - advance. In fact, the Russians and everyone partment from learning about their real desires to buy wheat until after Palmby had joined Continental Grain. The best explanation of the mishandling of the grain deal is more prosaic than nefari- ous. Carroll Brunthaver per- ceived his responsibility as Simply to facilitate the sale of every ton of grain that the exporters could physically move through the elevators. ‘When he saw indications that the Russians were buying much more wheat than the Government had anticipated, ’ he chose to keep the informa- tion to himself. While. it is conceivable ‘that he was act- ing out of some residual loy- alty to the grain trade, it -seems much more likely that Brunthaver simply failed to grasp the economic conse- quences of what he was being told in confidence by the grain traders. Secretary Butz maintains he did not learn of the huge proportions of the grain deal until mid-September, 1972. If he didn’t, clearly he should have doné more to find out. ‘But, like every Secretary of Agriculture, Butz had his sights set on pushing up farm prices during an election year. The trouble with Butz was that he had tunnel vision: He did not worry about the grain deal beyond its impact on the farm vote in November. Someone in the White House should have worried. If, in mid-July, John Ehriich- man, the President’s chief domestic adviser, had pressed . .. And so, hardly noticed in the U.S., the grain—19 million ‘ tons of it, $1.14-billion worth of it—starts sailing off to Russia. New York Times Magazine, November 25, 1973 (continued) A year or so later, the eagle-eyed eagle takes a long, hard look. Can it possibly be that he’s let himself be taken? a few questions about the grain deal upon the Agricul- ture Department, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget, perhaps some limits would have been placed on Brunthaver’s commitments: to the grain traders. Unhappily, the White House had a iarger preoccupation in the summer of 1972—it was known as Watergate. N defense of the grain deal, Butz testified: “It is easy to say now that we might have done it differently. The Fed- eral Government might have stepped in and said no,. the Soviets cannot buy here in a free market. . . . We might have said, as some are say- ing now, with benefit of hindsight, that the Russians were in such trouble that they would have to buy from the United States and we should, therefore, in the vernacular of the day, ‘sock it to ’em.’ We might have fol- lowed such a policy of ‘big stick” economics, but what would it have accomplished? On the one hand, there might have been some saving in ex- port subsidy funds, which likely would have been can- celed out by farm program costs and the continuation of storage charges. It is well to consider that the Russians might not have had to buy have survived 1972 and 1973 ‘with a good deai less imported grain than they bought fn the United States. And we may ask ourselves the ques- tion: What would this have done to the advancement of peace and cooperation in a time when the world desper- ately needs to get itself to- gether?” But it still is evident that lessons had been learned. Wheat export subsidies have been aban- doned. There now is a report-- ing system on crop exports. And the Agriculture Depart- ment has been induced by the Cost of Living Council to put all 60 million acres of set- aside cropland back into pro- duction for the 1974 growing season. _Had the wheat deal ex- perience left any deeper leg- acy? Had it taught the need for consultation, for perspec- tive, for foresight, even in the face of awkward political facts? That, in a Government of human beings, was a far less certain prospect."

        "ocr_text": "'Washington-USA. THE FORD MODEL BY JOSEPH ALBRIGHT WASHINGTON VER SINCE Richard Nixon began to look like a goner, this city has been playing “Hail to the (next) Chief.”? Cor- respondents are signing up to fly with Gerald Ford to all of his out- of-town speeches, in hopes of get- ting a “deep background” inter- view. You can find anti-Ford graffiti in the phone booth outside the House Judiciary Committee hearing room. People at dinner parties are speculating about whom Presi- dent Ford would nominate as his Vice President—Laird? Rockefeller? Richardson? It is foolish, of course, to count Nixon out until he has actually packed his bags and departed. But the combination of the unfolding evidence and the unhinged elec- torate makes his impeachment by the House of Representatives seem virtually unavoidable, notwithstand- ing last month’s acquittal of John Mitchell and Maurice Stans. The Judiciary Committee staff is believed ready to recommend a charge of obstruction of justice against the President on the basis of the mater- ials in special Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski’s “‘bulging briefcase” on the payment of $75,000 in hush money to E. Howard Hunt. And, as Majority Leader Tip O’Neill is reported to have informed his Sen- ate counterpart, Mike Mansfield, a few weeks ago, there are enough votes in the House to impeach. Until recently, the common as- sumption was that Nixon could eas- ily command the 34 votes (one- third of the Senate plus one) he needs for acquittal in the upper chamber because he has a solid core of loyalist conservatives behind him. If you examine the voting records of his potential jurors closely, how- ever, you simply cannot find that many unswerving supporters. Prob- ably the best litmus of Nixonian loyalty, up to now, is whether a Senator has been willing to go down the line with the President in sus- taining all his vetoes. Last year, there were six such roll calls and, unhappily for Nixon, the number of Senators who never voted against a veto can be counted on the fingers of two hands: Paul J. Fannin (R.- Ariz.), Barry Goldwater (R.-Ariz.), Carl T. Curtis (R.-Neb.), Roman L. Hruska (R.-Neb.), Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.), Strom Thurmond (R.- S.C.), Wallace F. Bennett (R.- Utah), Norris Cotton (R.-N.H.), and Clifford P. Hansen (R.-Wyo.). To escape conviction, the President will have to convince at least 25 other Senators who are not pas- sionate backers that he is innocent. With history thus seeming to point inexorably toward the day when President Ford will stand be- fore a joint session of Congress and take the oath of office, it is perhaps time to ask: What then? First, with the nation breathing a _ collective sigh of relief, we can reasonably ex- pect that all the ex-Congressman will have to do to get the people behind him is repeat the four-point credo he affirmed last fall at his Vice Presidential confirmation hear- ings: (1) “I hope I never get to the point where I cannot admit I have been wrong’; (2) “I do not believe in replaying last Saturday’s game but in training hard for next Saturday’s’”; (3) “I think people ought to tell the truth, especially politicians”; and (4) “Compromise is the oil that makes government zo.” Within a month. Ford will be perceived as a marvelous symbol of our system at work—the Michigan football jock who worked his way through Yale Law School and then Tose to the top of the because New Leader, May 13, 1974 \fhe was friendly, trustworthy and sensible. As Leonard Woodcock of the UAW reportedly told an FBI agent during Ford’s background check for Vice President, “He has the capacity to bring a torn country together.’’ He also happens to be a person- ally honest man. The worst flaw turned up in last fall’s confirmation hearings was his membership on the board of directors of Rospatch, Inc., a small Jabel-manufacturing company that had over the years sold a few thousand dollars of mer- chandise to the Federal government. When the IRS performed a special audit on his 1967-72 tax returns, all it disallowed was $871.44 in business-expense deductions. In short, Ford does not appear to be a man with Agnewian vulnerabilities. Nor will he come across as an obtuse or unintelligent man (despite the remark attributed to Lyndon Johnson that Ford was too dumb to walk and chew gum at the same time). At his press conferences, which will be held about every other week, he may stumble over his syn- tax a little. Yet he is capable of handling aggressive reporters with a plain-spoken directness that is hard to dislike. Before long, televiewers will be saying his voice sounds like Burl Ives and his face resembles, well, an older Robert Redford. There is little doubt, in other words, that President Ford will project that aura of leadership the country needs to pull itself out of the spiritual nosedive brought on by the Water- gate coverup. . As for where Ford’s leadership will actually take us, the best place to get a preview is not in one more “deep background” interview 1n the fuselage of Air Force Two, but in his Congressional voting record over the last 25 years. The most objec- tive analysis, a 50-page report Pre- pared by the Library of Congress and printed as an appendix to Ford’s House confirmation hearings for the Vice Presidency, can be purchased for $4.85 from the Gov- ernment Printing Office. And it shows that on nearly every domestic issue liberal Democrats have con- sidered important, Gerald Ford has been a problem-limiter rather than a problem-solver. Liberals like Joe Rauh of ADA have slammed Ford the hardest on civil rights, noting a long string of moves to gut and weaken pending civil rights bills before he voted for them on final passage. Most egregi- ous, in their view, is the fact that Ford, who comes from Grand Rap- ids, a city that not long ago clected a black mayor, voted to recom- mit the fair housing bill in 1966 to delete its open-housing provisions. Nonetheless, if you look over Ford’s entire civil rights record in an op- timistic frame of mind, you might find it mixed enough to hope that, as President, he will be an improve- ment over the Nixon-Mitchell era. T 1s Ford’s seemingly consistent approach to nearly all other domestic matters that some Democrats will find scary. To cite a few examples of things he has voted against: the establishment of the Office of Economic Opportunity and the creation of the Food Stamp Program in 1964; Medicare in 1965; Model Cities appropriations in 1967; opening the Highway Trust Fund to mass transit in 1973. Here are some of the things Ford has actively supported: compulsory ar- bitration in national emergency la- bor disputes in 1970; a constitu- tional amendment permitting prayer in public schools, continuation of the Supersonic Transport program, and the Lockheed loan guarantee in 1971; and a “youth differential” in the mifimum wage law in 1973. Ford is not, so far as anyone knows, a civil libertarian. As_ re- cently as March 1973, he told his colleagues, “The Congress should launch the nation into a new get- tough era in dealing with crime.” In line with that belief, he has support- ed the expansion of wiretapping, preventive detention, no-knock en- tries by police, capital punishment, and the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. In the field of energy and envi- ronment, Ford’s House record is a shade better, from a liberal’s view- point, than that of the Nixon Ad- ministration. He has supported ev- ery air pollution bill, and in 1972 he even voted to override the Pres- ident’s veto of the water pollution amendments. Since becoming Vice President, though, he seems to have gotten back on the team: He has spoken out for selective relaxation of auto emission standards “in view of the energy crisis,” for expediting nuclear power plant applications and deregulating natural gas. Little can be deduced about how Ford will handle foreign policy, ex- cept that he has said he would retain Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to run that show. Still, it is worth noting that Ford likes to refer to himself as a ‘“‘dyed-in-the- wool internationalist.” He has al- ways approved of an activist role in the world for the American Pres- ident, and it is fair to say that he is not appalled by the use of the military. During the Korean War, for instance, he called for the bombing of Communist China’s supply bases and a blockade of the Chinese coast. He supported Ken- nedy, Johnson and Nixon on Viet- nam. As late as last November, he remarked that “the number one pri- ority in the very controversial world we live in today is inadequate fund- ing of our national security.” At the same time, Ford has consistently voted money for the United Na- tions and various forms of foreign aid, bilateral and multilateral. Possibly the most comforting at- tribute of Gerald Ford as President, Particularly in the year 1974, is his inner quality as a human being. Not long ago, after critiquing his civil rights record, Clarence Mitchell of the NAACP remarked, “He is the kind of person I would be glad to go on a hunting trip with: I know I would not get shot in the back.” New Leader, May 13, 1974 (continued) \f"

A House Subcommittee said the Bovernment had spent $17 million on San Clemente and Key Biscayne, It was also the day Nixon sum- moned conservative columnist John J.

New Leader, June 10, 1974 \fe The National Zoo in Washing- ton prepared to erect a new lion and tiger house, at a cost of $2.5 million. After 32 pages of small type, the Commerce Business Daily reach- ed its final item: a Defense Depart- ment offer to sell an old submarine that is submerged in 35 feet of water off Imperial Beach, Cali- fornia. One day’s listing is enough to show that the Federal clockwork is not about to stop ticking just be- cause the President forgets to wind it. Agencies generate their own momentum; about 99 per cent of what they do on any given day con- Sists of following up on_ earlier decisions, which were themselves follow-ups on still earlier decisions. Moreover, most of the govern- ment’s actions on May 14 do not seem to reflect the philosophical im- print of any particular Chief Ex- ecutive. In fact, I could not identify a single bureaucratic undertaking on that date—at least as recorded by the Commerce Business Daily, the Federal Register or even the UPI’s Washington teletype—that might not have occurred under a McGov- ern Administration. On the domestic side, Presidents make their mark not as caretakers of the existing machinery of gov- ernment but as designers and Promoters of new mechanisms. One attribute Nixon has lost of late is his determination to take the gears apart and make them do something different. On May 14, for example. his most visible act of business was signing an alcoholism treatment bill into law. While this was not the Most egregious case of “impeach- Ment politics” yet to surface, it was nonetheless an abandonment of his ©wn convictions in order to create Some favorable news. Six months ago, Nixon announc- ed plans to replace all Federal Projects involving alcoholism treat- ment and prevention with formula grants to the states, so that the Problem could be handled on a local level. Rejecting his approach, Congress rammed through an ex- tension of the existing Federal pro- gram on alcoholism, with some for- mula grants tacked on for good measure. When the bill reached the White House, some policy-minded officials urged a Presidential veto, pointing out that HEW witnesses had testified flatly against continu- ing the old system. Confronted with an opposition Congress, Nixon frequently receiv- es dozens of bills that are not ex- actly to his liking. In the past, he has either vetoed them or, when there was no chance of having the veto sustained, affixed his signature without celebrating the occasion in public. This time, on a bill he might have vetoed a year ago, he not only signed his name but made a point of gathering the Congres- sional sponsors around him in a formal ceremony that was open to photographers. Regardless of the merits of the alcoholism bill, Nixon was in ef- fect giving up his view of how the government should be changed. In- deed, according to HEW Secretary Caspar Weinberger, he personally recommended the ceremony to the President as a means of conveying to the public “fa better understand- ing of the way this Administration has contributed in the field of al- coholism.” HE DECISION to puff the alcoholism program rath- er than veto it is akin to several other cases in which Nixon has been accused of “impeachment politics”: the withdrawal of op- position to the chicken-farmer in- demnity bill introduced by Senator James Eastland (D.-Miss.); the continuation of the sugar subsidy, over Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz’ objections; and the switches in position on land use and no-fault insurance. What these all have in common is the President’s post- Watergate incapacity to take the heat in the defense of his beliefs. For those who never liked his beliefs in the first place, this is a welcome development. Yet there are times when the country needs a leader who isn’t looking over his shoulder at the electronic vote board in the House of Representa- tives. One of those times is when the economy goes crazy, as indicat- ed by the following symptoms: dou- ble-digit inflation far outrunning wage increases; the greatest rise in commodity prices in memory; 16 jumps in the prime interest rate within a year; the sharpest quarter- ly decline in the gross national product in 16 years; a depression in the automotive and housing in- dustries; and a worldwide monetary crisis. From what can be learned, Nixon did spend a good deal of time May 14 working on_ the economy. The problem was _ that his budget director, Roy Ash, and his new Treasury Secretary, Wil- liam Simon, were warring over who would emerge as the Administra- tion’s big enchilada in economic policy. One possible solution, float- ed for outside reaction that day, was to appoint John Dunlop, direc- tor of the expiring Cost of Living Council, as a sort of referee be- tween the competing factions. In the next 10 days, however, Dun- lop’s name inexplicably dropped cut of contention, and the President selected his one-time law professor, Kenneth Rush, to be the White House’s new economic coordinator. Then, in a radio address that enun- ciated no new economic. policy whatever, Nixon told his nation- wide audience he had found “en- couraging signs that the worst is behind us.” Thus we are left with the fecling that the Federal bureaucracy is be- ing flown by a marvelously efficient automatic pilot, and the record in- dicates that this is true. But where the programmed circuitry encoun- ters new problems requiring high- level decisions, leadership is clearly lacking. New Leader, June 10, 1974 (continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Opening Arguments in D. . Trial Prosecution, Defense Views of Reinecke By Joseph Albright. Chronicle Correspondent Washington The defense portrayed California Lieutenant Gover- nor Ed Reinecke yesterday as an overly cooperative, gentle human being with a lousy staff and a reputation for putting his foot in his mouth, The prosecuting attorney, though, described Reinecke as a man who had issued a false press release at the be- hest of a Justice Depart ment official and had “‘delib- erately lied” before the Sen- ate Judiciary Committee in April, 1972. But the defense and prose- would not be in trouble today if he had not turned over a packet of files on the ITT matter to the Watergate special prosecu- tor’s office last summer in an effort to clear his name. As assistant special pro- secutor Richard J. Davis put it, “Mr. Reinecke will turn out to bethe most important witness against himself.” Defense lawyer James E. Cox of Martinez in the Kast Bay did not dispute the point. “They conned him,” Cox told the jury in his opening statement. . Cox quoted one prosecu- tor, Joseph Connolly, as tell- ing Reinecke “if you go along, cooperate, there won’t be any problems.” Noting that Reinecke’s profession is that of a me chanical engineer, Cox said his client is not a “word- smith.” “He understands things he can put his hands on—radi- os, televisions or mechanical things. That's the bent of his mind.” The Reinecke perjury case grew out of his allegedly false statements during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. He testified then that Attorney General John Mitchell first learned in Sep- tember, 1971, of a $400,000 pledge by the International Telephone and Telegraph Co, to underwrite the San Diego Republican conven- tion. The convention later was moved to Miami Beach. Senator John V. Tunney (Dem.-Calif.), testifying as one of the first prosecution witnesses, told of telephon- ing Reinecke during a break in the committee’s ITT hear: ings and getting a different account of Mitchell’s in- volvement. According to Tunney, Re- inecke told him he remem bered “very clearly” telling of the ITT financial pledge in May, 1971. Tunney said einecke repeated count, even when informec that Mitchell had denied re ceiving any such informa tion until the following Sep tember. Under cross examination, Tunny said he immediately dictated a memorandum for his files on Reinecke’s re- marks because they were “dynamite to me, as far as Mr. Mitchell was ¢on- cerned,” “It proved that Mr. Mitch- ell was a liar,” Tunney said. The timing was important, Tunney said, because the committee was trying to es- tablish whether Mitehe!l knew of the ITT financial pledge in June 1971, when the Justice Department agreed to an out-of-court settlement in an antitrust case involving ITT, Defense lawyer Cox also asked Tunney whether Re- mecke “has a reputatiyy for putting his foot in his mouth and having lousy gaff work,” Tunney said he knew the lieutenant governor pad a some staff problems, “tut I don’t know that he psqa reputation for putting his foot in his mouth any yaore than the rest of us,” According to the prosect tors, within an hour after the Tunney-Reinecke con- versation, Reinecke received another telephone call from Robert Mardian, then an aide to Mitchell. As a result of Mardian’s call, the prosecutors main- tain, Reinecke changed his story and issued a false press release denying he had informed Mitchell about the ITT pledge before Sep- tember, 1971, Janet Petersen, who was then Reinecke’s personal secretary, substantiated part of the prosecution’s ac- count.

In earlier campaigns, Cummings says, he has given as much or more. This year, however, the politicians will not get much help f, rom Cummings. At his apartment in New York’s Waldorf Towers, he has a_basket full of begging letters for needy Republican causes. But he rarely takes out his checkbook anymore- “Iam disappointed in what I see happening in Washington,” he told a caller two months before President Nixon’s resignation. “I am going to stay On the sidelines until I can see what is going on with more clarity.” When he later concluded that Nixon was about to depart, he relented—slightly- My policy this year will be to give a few small contributions, only peanuts really,” he explained.

This year, Wilson cut the goal for large gifts even further, and as late as this summer he was saying: ‘I doubt if we make it.” ‘ As yet, no one knows the net impact of Nixon’s resignation on old-line Republican contributors. Republican fund-raisers have high hopes of drawing many of them back into the arena with appeals aimed at preventing a ‘‘veto-proof’ Congress. But some Republican officials are apprehensive about a backlash from Nixon bitter-enders who may feel Republicans in Congress let him down. With some exceptions such as Mrs. Joan Palevsky in Los Angeles and conglomerate executive Meshu- lam Riklis in New York, Democratic superbene- factors are also cutting back this year or even dropping out of politics. “The perennial liberal givers are just not giving this year in anywhere near the proportions as before,” notes Sandy Weiner, a California political consultant. ‘“Com- pared to our expectations based on past perform- ances, We are getting about-30 cents on the dollar.” Even with talk of a Democratic sweep in November, the annual $500-a-plate Democratic Congressional Dinner in Washington grossed: only $609,000 this spring, nearly 15 per cent below its. budget, New York investment banker Herbert Allen, the dinner chairman, explains: “Wall Street is a disaster area. The political people can’t understand this, but this is a year when a really genero i i eens us person might give ' y the 1976 elections, it. will probably be too late for the fat cats to regain their prominence in, American politics. Their heyday ended in 1972, the year Maurice Stans bagged 142 contributions of $50,000 or more for President Nixon, and even Henry Kimmelman, chief tambourine-shaker for the McGovern campaign, managed to attract 45 people willing to part with at least $50,000 in gifts or loans. No-limit giving by the rich is still legal this year, but by 1976 it will very likely be legislated out of existence.

Back in 1757, when Wash- ington was running for the Virginia House of Burgesses, he is said to have softened the hearts of his constituents on election day with 28 gallons of rum, 50 gallons of rum punch, 34 gallons of wine, 46 gallons of beer and 2 gallons of cider royal. Someone has figured out that this amounted to a quart and a half of spirits for each eligible voter. In the decade before Watergate, scandals involv- ing political money made Bobby Baker a celebrity and drove Democratic Senators Thomas Dodd of Connecticut and Daniel Brewster of Maryland out of office. During the lulls between these explosions, lesser campaign scandals popped like a string of ladyfinger firecrackers.. The most disturbing was the disclosure that the Seafarers International Union’s political fund had poured $100,000 into the Humphrey Presidential campaign a few days after the Johnson Administraticn denied a request by the Canadian Government for the extradition of a former Seafarers official to face a Canadian perjury charge. There were also lesser disturbances when the Western Meat Packers Association started a fund for Congressmen who were considering a bill to tighten packing plant inspection; when a St. Louis local of the Pipefitters Union was caught making illegal contributions from the union trea- sury; and when the truckers’ lobby passed out $29,000 to Congressmen who were marking up a bill to allow heavier trucks on the highways. Then, in 1970, a wave of apprehension swept over Congress concerning rich candidates with telegenic faces trying to buy their way to power with inherited money. That was the year Representative Richard L. Ottinger and his relatives spent $3,920,089 on his unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in New York, and Norton Simon of California spent $1,350,- 000 of his own money also trying for the Senate. Congress responded by passing a bundle of reforms which had been killed in previous sessions. The first was a rider tacked onto a Nixon Ad- ministration tax bill to finance Presidential elec- tions by allowing a $1 voluntary income-tax check- off for each taxpayer (or $2 for a couple filing jointly). To avoid a Presidential veto, the House- Senate conferees agreed to delay the start of the dollar checkoff fund—America’s first venture into direct political subsidies—until after the 1972 elec- tion. As an incentive for widespread giving, the rider also allowed income tax write-offs for small political contributions (up to a $12.50 tax credit or a $50 tax deduction for every individual). Within a few months, Congress followed by en- acting the Federal Election Act of 1971, the first full rewrite of campaign laws since 1925. The new law, which went into effect on April 7, 1972, put forth the revolutionary premise that the names, addresses and occupations of all contributors of more than $100 toward (Continued on Page 32) Fund-raisers: At top, this' year’s $500-a-plate Demo- cratic Congressional Dinner brings out the likes of Carl Albert and Senator and Mrs. Muskie (but it grossed 15 per cent below budget).

No longer were primary elections immune from Federal report- ing requirements. n theory, every dime given to a Federal poli- tician is now supposed to be reported by his campaign treasurer. This does not always happen, however, because all language seems to be open to hair-splitting in- terpretations. Several Con- gressmen, including Repre- sentative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, have not reported money raised this year from special-interest committees to defray office expenses and newsletter mail- ing costs. Also, a milk pro- ducers’ lobbyist and other triends of retiring Republican Senator Norris ~Cotton of New Hampshire contributed to another unreported fund this spring to pay for a por- trait of Cotton in the New Hampshire State Capitol. Even Senator Edward M. Kennedy, one of the most pas- sionate backers of the 1971 law, was unaware until this summer that the law required the disclosure of a $1,000-a- head dinner party which he quietly held at his McLean, Va., heme this past February. Evidently Kennedy was not trying to conceal the donors entirely, since his campaign treasurer reported their names in Boston to the Common- wealth of Massachusetts. How- ever, no report of fund-raising activities on Kennedy’s part was filed with the proper au- thorities in Washington this year until one month after an inquiry on behalf of The New York Times Magazine about the dinner. Richard Drayne, Kennedy’s press secretary, Produced copies of reports filed in Massachusetts show- ing that the Committee to Re- Elect Senator Edward M. Ken- nNedy United States Senator had collected $45,101.23 in the first six and a half months of 1974. Nearly all of the gifts Were in $1,000 denominations from Massachusetts citizens, ton for dinner with the Ken- nedys, according to Drayne. When asked why the dinner party had not been reported to the Secretary of the Senate in Washington, Drayne replied that all the money was col- lected to pay off a campaign debt from the 1970 election. Drayne said Clifford Shaw, a Boston C.P.A. who was Ken- nedy’s 1970 campaign treas- urer, had read the 1971 law and cancluded that it did not require disclosure of fund- raising to meet pre-1971 debts. After consulting with of- ficials in the Secretary of the Senate’s office, who gave the opposite interpretation, Ken- nedy’s office decided subse- quently that his committee should file reports in Wash- ington after all. “Under the Narrow meaning of the lan- guage in the law, our people up in Boston were probably right, but we decided to comply with the © spirit,” Drayne explained. : The Federal report, filed by Shaw on the day Richard Nix- on resigned as President, was marked late and incomplete by an auditor in the .office of the Secretary of the Senate. By return mail, Shaw was notified that the Kennedy re- port ‘omitted disposition of debts” during the previous year and did not specify which contributions were obtained through the fund-raising din- ner. Along with ali other re- ports filed after the quarterly reporting deadlines, the Ken- nedy report will be trans- mitted to the Department of Justice for possible prosecu- tion. he 1971 act, besides requiring disclasure, also introduced limits on any one candi- date’s ability to overwhelm another with money. While the law contained no top ceil- ings for campaign budgets, it did set limits on the readily measurable forms of cam- paign advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards and automatic telephoning equip- ment. Finally, the law put the kibosh on millionaires by de- claring that no candidate could give or lend more than $50,000 of his family’s money to his own Presidential cam- paign, or $35,000 if a candi- New York Times Personal touch: The Democrats’ 1972 fund- date for the Senate, or $25,000 if running for the House of Representatives. Nearly all the easy reforms had been enacted in the 1971 law—before Watergate, which seemed to make new leg- lation a necessity. But some of the 1971 reforms were turning out to be a bother. Because of the new disclosure requirements, old contributors were refusing to give because they did not want their names in the papers. Government auditors were asking questions, then demanding revised reports even from such untouchables as Representative Wayne L. Hays, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Committee on House Administration. Naderites, Common Causers and newspapermen were track- ing down every reported do- nation and trying to link it to some private bill or other special favor. As a result of the Watergate excesses, the one quick fix which nearly everyone in Con- gress could accept this year was that no individual should be allowed to contribute more than a few thousand dollars to any Federal candidate. The Senate, acting early this year, voted a simple $3,000 ceiling on any individual’s contribu- tions to a Federal - election campaign. Then, last month, the House voted to set the limits lower ($1,000 toward a primary and $1,000 toward a general election), but alsa wrote in four loopholes which would allow a determined con- tributor to spend well beyond the specified limits, The House-Senate conference com- mittee, however, should have little difficulty in devising a compromise limit when it meets later this month. While it may not be air-tight it wilt be restrictive enough to keep anyone from buying a con- trolling interest in a Federal candidate. There is an addi- tional limit in both the House and Senate bills which pro- hibits an individual from giv- ing more than $25,000 an- nually toward all candidaies put together. If the bill is Signed into law, those limits would Probably not become effective until next year. The limits will have a better chance of being enforced if the House-Senate conferees can agree on an independent elections commission similar to the one contained in the Senate version. But Hays, chairman of the House con- ferees, has Promised to insist on the weaker enforcement machinery contained in ihe House version, Another proposal which was palatable to most Con- gressmen this year was an over-all ceiling on every Fed- eral candidate’s total expendi- tures. Conceptually, this ac- complished only a small jump beyond the 1971 law, which has already put a complicated set of limits on all big-ticket campaign advertising ex- penses, excluding those in- curred in direct-mail requests. But bitter arguments ensued in both houses on how high the over-all limit should be. Outside reformers led by Com- ion Cause, along with some Republicans, Pressed to keep the limits as high as possible, Pointing out that the few chal- lengers who managed to de- feat the House incumbents in 1972 had to spend an average of $125,000 on their generat- election campaigns. At the other end of the scale, many rural Congressmen and Demo- raising telethon—starring Hubert H. Humphrey. crats, led by Representative Dawson Mathis of Georgia, wanted to keep the campaign- expenditure limits as low as possible, arguing that it was immoral to spend $125,- 900 on an election. The final House-Senate compromise fig- ures were expected to be high enough to give House and. Senate challengers at least some chance to defeat an en- trenched incumbent, but prob- ably less chance than under the current law. : fter Watergate, after the milk fund ‘and Spiro Agnew, a num- ber of reformers in Congress saw the chance to push through a more radical idea. From their perspective, limits and disclosure are nct enough. The only way to erad- icate _the corrupting influence OF ‘Drivaite Campaign contribu- tions is to finance all cam- Ppalgns with public money. For the middle-of-the-road Congressman, however, public financing introduces a more complex set of questions than either limits or disclosure. 15 ‘t Proper, philosophically, t0 tax citizens to support the Propagation viewpoints they cannot abide?

On the other hand, if the Gavernment were to give money to primary cat didates, what would stoP every drunk and dropout in the country from entering (= (Continued on Page 3 Magazine, September 1, 1974 (continued) \f Continued from Page 32 New a Sts Presidential primary? Moreover, there is also the selfish question of how: public. _ financing would affect one’s own incumbency. For many House and Senate incumbents with safe seats, the prospect of a welli-financed opponent is simply too threatening to consider. Few have acknowl- edged this fear in public, but Representative Al Uliman, Democrat of Oregon, was probably speaking for a ma- jority of his calleagues iast year when he described public financing of Congressional elections as a device that “could destroy every member oF the House.” -What he meant, he said later, was that the work of Congress wouid Cease every election year be- ‘Cause members would have to return to their districts to con- tend — with Government-fi- anced opponents.

After the party nominat- ing ‘conventions, the matching requirements would disappear, and the Presidential candi- dates of the two major parties could draw as much as $20- million apiece from the doNar- check-off fund, with lesser allocations for minor parties. The more radicai step—pub- lic financing for Congressional elections—did pass the Senate this year, but was defeated, 228-187, on the House floor last month. Of the 75 most senior Congressmen, who com- mand all the committee chair- manships and most of the leadership positions, only 12 voted for public financing on the Congressional tevel. Since even the Senate proponents are not sure they have the idea perfected for House and Senate races, the consensus throughout Congress apparent- ly ‘is to await the _ results of public financing in the 1975 Presidential elections. Even without Congressional public financing, the 1974 election-reform amendments may never go into effect. Judging from early signals sent out from Gerald Ford’s White House, there is a strong likelihood that the whole bill will be vetoed. Ford and his advisers are understood to. oppose the Presidential pub- lic financing provisions as well as the actual limits on Congressional campaign budg- ets, which are seen as means of perpetuating incumbents in office. However, Ford is not oppaqsed to limits on indi- vidual contributions. This part of the bill, at least, seems likely to be enacted later this year or early in the mext ses- sion. INo matter what happens with the 1974 election bill, can- didates for the House, the Sen- ate and the Presidency will still be under enormous pres- sure to raise money at some stage in their campaigns. ““‘We have come to the place in campaigns where we have to spend ali our time raising money or accounting for the damn stuff,’ drawled politi- cal consultant Matt Reese at .a recent convention of fellow consultants. very imaginable tech- nique of. raising money, particularly in small amounts, is being tried: auctions, yard sales, hot-dog dinners, tennis exhibitions, door-to-door so- licitations, chain letters and even a money-back guarantee to contributors if they are dis- satisfied with a candidate's. performance in office. But for many candidates, the one way to raise large amounts of small money is to rely solely on the sophisticated techniques of professional fund-raisers. Both the Republicans and Democrats use direct mail month in and month out ta finance the ongoing activities of their national party organi- zations. Since 1968, the Re- publican National Committee has built its active mailing list to 800,000 names, and iast year the party mailings brought in $3,963,000 in gifts ef $100 or tess. The Demo- cratic National Com@mittee now supplements its own \f direct-mail efforts with an annual telethon, which this summer cleared $4-million after paying for network time and production costs. Direct mail already looms in the fund-raising plans of most Presidential candidates for 1976. One of Senator Henry M. Jackson’s fund- raisers says: “I would hope we can test 500 to 1,000 dif- ferent lists to see which ones work best.’”” Another Demo- crat, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, has sought the services of a direct-mail firm which was organized by some of George McGovern’s sup- porters in 1972. On the Re- publican side, | Senator Charles Percy of Hlinois spent $65,000 last fall by sending out 8,700 letters to his past supporters under the signature of his most prominent backer, Mil- ton Eisenhower. Probably the most sophisti- cated—and most successful— direct-mail activity now in motion is run for Gov. George Wallace by the Richard A. Viguerie Co, a direct-mail house in Falls Church, Va. Viguerie’s business revolves around his own computerized list of 2,500,000 conservative givers, many of whose names were Jovingly copied in long- hand by Viguerie’s employes from a Goldwater list filed at the House Clerk’s office in 1964. Using his own list and presumably others he has rented, Viguerie has churned out about four million fund- raising letters for Wallace in the last year. Each one is per- sonally addressed and typed by high-speed letter printers in Viguerie’s computer room. To extract the maximum gift from each potential donor, Viguerie programers instruct the computer to ask every ad- dressee for a specific amount of money, pegged to his larg- est contribution to any pre- vious political cause. Viguerie’s messages are di- rect, folksy and sometimes de- liberately ungrammatical. Also, there is little to distin; guish them from any other letter, since the envelopes are hand-typed and often mailed with an eye-catching com memorative stamp. In the last year, Viguerie’s letters have grossed $1,410,033, of which 53 per cent went to fund- raising expenses and the rest went to Wallace. Viguerte says he is just getting started. “As time goes on,” he prom- ises, “it should be even more successful.” : Candidates for statewide or Congressional offices are find- ing there are pitfalls in trying to borrow the techniques New York Times Magazine, Septemb THE ©; E Chicopee, Lee special-interest committees (below, BreadP AC red 2 N ae S, Charles Snider, Director ac.

The equal-time pro- visions of the Communica- tions Act of 1934 effectively prevent any declared candi- date from using a telethon. In the field of direct mail, it is hard for a candidate to cover even his mailing costs unless he is already well-known or” identified with a strong emo-- tional issue. Moreover, the lists that are available for rent through list brokers are often overmilked by previous users. As a result, many campaign organizations prefer to rely on noncommercial lists ob- tained by barter or donation. et questions can spring even from the soil of good inten- tions, as Democratic Senator Alan Cranston of Cal- ifornia, to pick one example, has discovered. When it comes to campaign financing, Crans- ton is a dedicated reformer, supporting even the heretical suggestion of allowing chal- lengers to outspend the in- cumbents. Last year, with Watergate in everyone’s living room, Cranston decided to infuse some extra spirit of reform into his own campaign for re- election this year. In hopes of avoiding the stigma of the fat cat, he settled ona plan to raise a large chunk of his campaign budget through di- rect-mail appeals for small contributions. However, even a program to attract small Campaign-financing tactics: Direct-mail appeals (here, a computerized form letter on behalf of 'Gov. George C. Wallace) and the letterhead of the fund-raising and lobbying arm of the Americar Bakers ‘Association) ~ Bread Politi i ; Suite 650 e 1700 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.e Wwastungion ‘Bre. 20008 , D.C. contributors through the mails may not be as laudable as it appears at first. For the Cranston program depended indirectly on the use of a Senate-owned computer and a Senator’s franking privilege (ree mailing) to cull the lists which were later used to raise money. Every step of Cran- ston’s program is within to- day’s Congressional standards of propriety, and there are other Senate campaign re- formers who raise funds by using the Senate computer’s lists. But while it is all legal and approved, it gives the in- cumbent ‘one more advantage over a challenger. en Cranston contem- plated using computerized direct-mail services last year, he was advised to test a va- riety of lists until he found those which would bring the highest dollars-and-cents re- turn for every dollar of mail- ing expense. Accordingly, Cranston’s campaign staff proceeded to rent samples from about a dozen com- puterized lists — everything from the California contribu- tors toward the 1972 McGov- ern campaign to the subscrip- tion lists of Outdoorsman magazine. For comparison, the Senator’s administrative as- sistant in Washington, Roy Greenaway, arranged to test a few thousand names of con- stituents on Cranston’s of- ficial newsletter mailing list. It turned out, however, that the list which yielded the best (202) 296-5800 in test mailings was Cran- ston’s own list, which was stored in the memory banks of the Senate’s computer. Cran- ston immediately arranged for the computer to reproduce on Magnetic tapes all 285,000 names on his newsletter mail- ing list. The total cost to his campaign: nothing. Money couldn’t buy the list of 285,000 people who were attuned to Alan Cranston. Using the franking privilege accorded to all members of Congress, Cranston had been culling and building the list for newsletter purposes ever since'he joined the Sen- ate in 1969. At first, his Senate newsletters went to those on his Christmas card list, to his past contributors and active California liberals. To that permanent roster he gradually added names of California lawyers, environmentalists, farmers and so on. Then, two years ago, he began sending sample copies of his newsletter to an extra 200,000 new families every time he mailed a new issue to his permanent mailing list. He obtained their names quite properly by paying about one- tenth of a cent per name to the California State Assembly for computer tapes of voter registration lists. Attached to each sample newsletter was a postcard inviting the new re- cipients to reply if they wished to receive future copies. Those who did not were dropped; those with a _ big money ———$$_.— sufficient interest in Cranston to put a stamp on the post- card were kept for the per manent mailing list. In short order, then, the permanent newsletter list grew from less than 50,000 to 285,000 names. From a single mailing of fund-raising letters in Maren (costing the campaign only $30,000), Cranston real $185,000 in pledges, most of which have already been paid. The Senator seemed hurt that anyone might criticize the fairness of the procedure- It looks as if we can get in trouble no matter what We do,” he complained. “If I get criticized for this, I am being criticized for trying to set away from the dependence 0? in campaigns- When I come out for public Lnancitig of elections, I set etters about wasting the tax- payers’. money.

Far more nox- ious is the odar of the money of organized special interests, who. may attain even greater influence after individual con- tributions are limited.

Clement Stone: From g2-m Money is still the flypaper of political campaigns price of purity ¢ cs ton forthe Now eempalginin 1972 to tokens for Republicans this year By Joseph P. Albright WASHINGTON. Nathan Cummings, 77, made 2 fortune in the grocery business and became 4 patron of the arts, giving copiously to museums in Chicago, New York, Montreal and Minneapolis. With equal fervor, he also became a patron of the Republican party. Two years ago, according to the list which Rose Mary Woods kept in her drawer, his patronage of the Finance Committee to Re-elect the President amounted to $44,356.28. In earlier campaigns, Cummings says, he has given as much or more. This year, however, the politicians will not get much help f, rom Cummings. At his apartment in New York’s Waldorf Towers, he has a_basket full of begging letters for needy Republican causes. But he rarely takes out his checkbook anymore- “Iam disappointed in what I see happening in Washington,” he told a caller two months before President Nixon’s resignation. “I am going to stay On the sidelines until I can see what is going on with more clarity.” When he later concluded that Nixon was about to depart, he relented—slightly- My policy this year will be to give a few small contributions, only peanuts really,” he explained.

This year, Wilson cut the goal for large gifts even further, and as late as this summer he was saying: ‘I doubt if we make it.” ‘ As yet, no one knows the net impact of Nixon’s resignation on old-line Republican contributors. Republican fund-raisers have high hopes of drawing many of them back into the arena with appeals aimed at preventing a ‘‘veto-proof’ Congress. But some Republican officials are apprehensive about a backlash from Nixon bitter-enders who may feel Republicans in Congress let him down. With some exceptions such as Mrs. Joan Palevsky in Los Angeles and conglomerate executive Meshu- lam Riklis in New York, Democratic superbene- factors are also cutting back this year or even dropping out of politics. “The perennial liberal givers are just not giving this year in anywhere near the proportions as before,” notes Sandy Weiner, a California political consultant. ‘“Com- pared to our expectations based on past perform- ances, We are getting about-30 cents on the dollar.” Even with talk of a Democratic sweep in November, the annual $500-a-plate Democratic Congressional Dinner in Washington grossed: only $609,000 this spring, nearly 15 per cent below its. budget, New York investment banker Herbert Allen, the dinner chairman, explains: “Wall Street is a disaster area. The political people can’t understand this, but this is a year when a really genero i i eens us person might give ' y the 1976 elections, it. will probably be too late for the fat cats to regain their prominence in, American politics. Their heyday ended in 1972, the year Maurice Stans bagged 142 contributions of $50,000 or more for President Nixon, and even Henry Kimmelman, chief tambourine-shaker for the McGovern campaign, managed to attract 45 people willing to part with at least $50,000 in gifts or loans. No-limit giving by the rich is still legal this year, but by 1976 it will very likely be legislated out of existence. Fading away, along with the fat cats, are many of the best-known loopholes and abuses of the recent past: the black suitcases, the $100 bills, the corporate contributions, the sale of ambassador- oe ee ay: of committees to evade the gift tax, the laundering of lobbyist money through intermediaries, aS well as the company bonuses sig a — saniaed for political giving. dunce eens » tens of thousands of candi- a the feet ee or Public office this November abcd rian pears elections since Watergate un- aan n issue in every race, it sometimes seems, is which candidate can raise and spend his et Bae while wearing the biggest badge aan Pano of many candidates’ zea! to do filed in Janu: aw requires was a 1,722-page report publican of ea by Senator Richard Schweiker, Re- tiflgations of ennsylvania, listing the complete iden- faeaaums ane his smallest contributors, includ- student who iaiiiee ie Occupation of one college i im a penny.

Back in 1757, when Wash- ington was running for the Virginia House of Burgesses, he is said to have softened the hearts of his constituents on election day with 28 gallons of rum, 50 gallons of rum punch, 34 gallons of wine, 46 gallons of beer and 2 gallons of cider royal. Someone has figured out that this amounted to a quart and a half of spirits for each eligible voter. In the decade before Watergate, scandals involv- ing political money made Bobby Baker a celebrity and drove Democratic Senators Thomas Dodd of Connecticut and Daniel Brewster of Maryland out of office. During the lulls between these explosions, lesser campaign scandals popped like a string of ladyfinger firecrackers.. The most disturbing was the disclosure that the Seafarers International Union’s political fund had poured $100,000 into the Humphrey Presidential campaign a few days after the Johnson Administraticn denied a request by the Canadian Government for the extradition of a former Seafarers official to face a Canadian perjury charge. There were also lesser disturbances when the Western Meat Packers Association started a fund for Congressmen who were considering a bill to tighten packing plant inspection; when a St. Louis local of the Pipefitters Union was caught making illegal contributions from the union trea- sury; and when the truckers’ lobby passed out $29,000 to Congressmen who were marking up a bill to allow heavier trucks on the highways. Then, in 1970, a wave of apprehension swept over Congress concerning rich candidates with telegenic faces trying to buy their way to power with inherited money. That was the year Representative Richard L. Ottinger and his relatives spent $3,920,089 on his unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in New York, and Norton Simon of California spent $1,350,- 000 of his own money also trying for the Senate. Congress responded by passing a bundle of reforms which had been killed in previous sessions. The first was a rider tacked onto a Nixon Ad- ministration tax bill to finance Presidential elec- tions by allowing a $1 voluntary income-tax check- off for each taxpayer (or $2 for a couple filing jointly). To avoid a Presidential veto, the House- Senate conferees agreed to delay the start of the dollar checkoff fund—America’s first venture into direct political subsidies—until after the 1972 elec- tion. As an incentive for widespread giving, the rider also allowed income tax write-offs for small political contributions (up to a $12.50 tax credit or a $50 tax deduction for every individual). Within a few months, Congress followed by en- acting the Federal Election Act of 1971, the first full rewrite of campaign laws since 1925.

No longer were primary elections immune from Federal report- ing requirements. n theory, every dime given to a Federal poli- tician is now supposed to be reported by his campaign treasurer. This does not always happen, however, because all language seems to be open to hair-splitting in- terpretations. Several Con- gressmen, including Repre- sentative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, have not reported money raised this year from special-interest committees to defray office expenses and newsletter mail- ing costs. Also, a milk pro- ducers’ lobbyist and other triends of retiring Republican Senator Norris ~Cotton of New Hampshire contributed to another unreported fund this spring to pay for a por- trait of Cotton in the New Hampshire State Capitol. Even Senator Edward M. Kennedy, one of the most pas- sionate backers of the 1971 law, was unaware until this summer that the law required the disclosure of a $1,000-a- head dinner party which he quietly held at his McLean, Va., heme this past February. Evidently Kennedy was not trying to conceal the donors entirely, since his campaign treasurer reported their names in Boston to the Common- wealth of Massachusetts. How- ever, no report of fund-raising activities on Kennedy’s part was filed with the proper au- thorities in Washington this year until one month after an inquiry on behalf of The New York Times Magazine about the dinner. Richard Drayne, Kennedy’s press secretary, Produced copies of reports filed in Massachusetts show- ing that the Committee to Re- Elect Senator Edward M. Ken- nNedy United States Senator had collected $45,101.23 in the first six and a half months of 1974. Nearly all of the gifts Were in $1,000 denominations from Massachusetts citizens, ton for dinner with the Ken- nedys, according to Drayne. When asked why the dinner party had not been reported to the Secretary of the Senate in Washington, Drayne replied that all the money was col- lected to pay off a campaign debt from the 1970 election. Drayne said Clifford Shaw, a Boston C.P.A. who was Ken- nedy’s 1970 campaign treas- urer, had read the 1971 law and cancluded that it did not require disclosure of fund- raising to meet pre-1971 debts. After consulting with of- ficials in the Secretary of the Senate’s office, who gave the opposite interpretation, Ken- nedy’s office decided subse- quently that his committee should file reports in Wash- ington after all. “Under the Narrow meaning of the lan- guage in the law, our people up in Boston were probably right, but we decided to comply with the © spirit,” Drayne explained. : The Federal report, filed by Shaw on the day Richard Nix- on resigned as President, was marked late and incomplete by an auditor in the .office of the Secretary of the Senate. By return mail, Shaw was notified that the Kennedy re- port ‘omitted disposition of debts” during the previous year and did not specify which contributions were obtained through the fund-raising din- ner. Along with ali other re- ports filed after the quarterly reporting deadlines, the Ken- nedy report will be trans- mitted to the Department of Justice for possible prosecu- tion. he 1971 act, besides requiring disclasure, also introduced limits on any one candi- date’s ability to overwhelm another with money. While the law contained no top ceil- ings for campaign budgets, it did set limits on the readily measurable forms of cam- paign advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards and automatic telephoning equip- ment. Finally, the law put the kibosh on millionaires by de- claring that no candidate could give or lend more than $50,000 of his family’s money to his own Presidential cam- paign, or $35,000 if a candi- New York Times Personal touch: The Democrats’ 1972 fund- date for the Senate, or $25,000 if running for the House of Representatives. Nearly all the easy reforms had been enacted in the 1971 law—before Watergate, which seemed to make new leg- lation a necessity. But some of the 1971 reforms were turning out to be a bother. Because of the new disclosure requirements, old contributors were refusing to give because they did not want their names in the papers. Government auditors were asking questions, then demanding revised reports even from such untouchables as Representative Wayne L. Hays, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Committee on House Administration. Naderites, Common Causers and newspapermen were track- ing down every reported do- nation and trying to link it to some private bill or other special favor. As a result of the Watergate excesses, the one quick fix which nearly everyone in Con- gress could accept this year was that no individual should be allowed to contribute more than a few thousand dollars to any Federal candidate. The Senate, acting early this year, voted a simple $3,000 ceiling on any individual’s contribu- tions to a Federal - election campaign. Then, last month, the House voted to set the limits lower ($1,000 toward a primary and $1,000 toward a general election), but alsa wrote in four loopholes which would allow a determined con- tributor to spend well beyond the specified limits, The House-Senate conference com- mittee, however, should have little difficulty in devising a compromise limit when it meets later this month. While it may not be air-tight it wilt be restrictive enough to keep anyone from buying a con- trolling interest in a Federal candidate. There is an addi- tional limit in both the House and Senate bills which pro- hibits an individual from giv- ing more than $25,000 an- nually toward all candidaies put together. If the bill is Signed into law, those limits would Probably not become effective until next year. The limits will have a better chance of being enforced if the House-Senate conferees can agree on an independent elections commission similar to the one contained in the Senate version. But Hays, chairman of the House con- ferees, has Promised to insist on the weaker enforcement machinery contained in ihe House version, Another proposal which was palatable to most Con- gressmen this year was an over-all ceiling on every Fed- eral candidate’s total expendi- tures. Conceptually, this ac- complished only a small jump beyond the 1971 law, which has already put a complicated set of limits on all big-ticket campaign advertising ex- penses, excluding those in- curred in direct-mail requests. But bitter arguments ensued in both houses on how high the over-all limit should be. Outside reformers led by Com- ion Cause, along with some Republicans, Pressed to keep the limits as high as possible, Pointing out that the few chal- lengers who managed to de- feat the House incumbents in 1972 had to spend an average of $125,000 on their generat- election campaigns. At the other end of the scale, many rural Congressmen and Demo- raising telethon—starring Hubert H. Humphrey. crats, led by Representative Dawson Mathis of Georgia, wanted to keep the campaign- expenditure limits as low as possible, arguing that it was immoral to spend $125,- 900 on an election. The final House-Senate compromise fig- ures were expected to be high enough to give House and. Senate challengers at least some chance to defeat an en- trenched incumbent, but prob- ably less chance than under the current law. : fter Watergate, after the milk fund ‘and Spiro Agnew, a num- ber of reformers in Congress saw the chance to push through a more radical idea. From their perspective, limits and disclosure are nct enough. The only way to erad- icate _the corrupting influence OF ‘Drivaite Campaign contribu- tions is to finance all cam- Ppalgns with public money. For the middle-of-the-road Congressman, however, public financing introduces a more complex set of questions than either limits or disclosure. 15 ‘t Proper, philosophically, t0 tax citizens to support the Propagation viewpoints they cannot abide?

On the other hand, if the Gavernment were to give money to primary cat didates, what would stoP every drunk and dropout in the country from entering (= (Continued on Page 3 Magazine, September 1, 1974 (continued) \f Continued from Page 32 New a Sts Presidential primary? Moreover, there is also the selfish question of how: public. _ financing would affect one’s own incumbency. For many House and Senate incumbents with safe seats, the prospect of a welli-financed opponent is simply too threatening to consider. Few have acknowl- edged this fear in public, but Representative Al Uliman, Democrat of Oregon, was probably speaking for a ma- jority of his calleagues iast year when he described public financing of Congressional elections as a device that “could destroy every member oF the House.” -What he meant, he said later, was that the work of Congress wouid Cease every election year be- ‘Cause members would have to return to their districts to con- tend — with Government-fi- anced opponents.

After the party nominat- ing ‘conventions, the matching requirements would disappear, and the Presidential candi- dates of the two major parties could draw as much as $20- million apiece from the doNar- check-off fund, with lesser allocations for minor parties. The more radicai step—pub- lic financing for Congressional elections—did pass the Senate this year, but was defeated, 228-187, on the House floor last month. Of the 75 most senior Congressmen, who com- mand all the committee chair- manships and most of the leadership positions, only 12 voted for public financing on the Congressional tevel. Since even the Senate proponents are not sure they have the idea perfected for House and Senate races, the consensus throughout Congress apparent- ly ‘is to await the _ results of public financing in the 1975 Presidential elections. Even without Congressional public financing, the 1974 election-reform amendments may never go into effect. Judging from early signals sent out from Gerald Ford’s White House, there is a strong likelihood that the whole bill will be vetoed. Ford and his advisers are understood to. oppose the Presidential pub- lic financing provisions as well as the actual limits on Congressional campaign budg- ets, which are seen as means of perpetuating incumbents in office. However, Ford is not oppaqsed to limits on indi- vidual contributions. This part of the bill, at least, seems likely to be enacted later this year or early in the mext ses- sion. INo matter what happens with the 1974 election bill, can- didates for the House, the Sen- ate and the Presidency will still be under enormous pres- sure to raise money at some stage in their campaigns. ““‘We have come to the place in campaigns where we have to spend ali our time raising money or accounting for the damn stuff,’ drawled politi- cal consultant Matt Reese at .a recent convention of fellow consultants. very imaginable tech- nique of. raising money, particularly in small amounts, is being tried: auctions, yard sales, hot-dog dinners, tennis exhibitions, door-to-door so- licitations, chain letters and even a money-back guarantee to contributors if they are dis- satisfied with a candidate's. performance in office. But for many candidates, the one way to raise large amounts of small money is to rely solely on the sophisticated techniques of professional fund-raisers. Both the Republicans and Democrats use direct mail month in and month out ta finance the ongoing activities of their national party organi- zations. Since 1968, the Re- publican National Committee has built its active mailing list to 800,000 names, and iast year the party mailings brought in $3,963,000 in gifts ef $100 or tess. The Demo- cratic National Com@mittee now supplements its own \f direct-mail efforts with an annual telethon, which this summer cleared $4-million after paying for network time and production costs. Direct mail already looms in the fund-raising plans of most Presidential candidates for 1976. One of Senator Henry M. Jackson’s fund- raisers says: “I would hope we can test 500 to 1,000 dif- ferent lists to see which ones work best.’”” Another Demo- crat, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, has sought the services of a direct-mail firm which was organized by some of George McGovern’s sup- porters in 1972. On the Re- publican side, | Senator Charles Percy of Hlinois spent $65,000 last fall by sending out 8,700 letters to his past supporters under the signature of his most prominent backer, Mil- ton Eisenhower. Probably the most sophisti- cated—and most successful— direct-mail activity now in motion is run for Gov. George Wallace by the Richard A. Viguerie Co, a direct-mail house in Falls Church, Va. Viguerie’s business revolves around his own computerized list of 2,500,000 conservative givers, many of whose names were Jovingly copied in long- hand by Viguerie’s employes from a Goldwater list filed at the House Clerk’s office in 1964. Using his own list and presumably others he has rented, Viguerie has churned out about four million fund- raising letters for Wallace in the last year. Each one is per- sonally addressed and typed by high-speed letter printers in Viguerie’s computer room. To extract the maximum gift from each potential donor, Viguerie programers instruct the computer to ask every ad- dressee for a specific amount of money, pegged to his larg- est contribution to any pre- vious political cause. Viguerie’s messages are di- rect, folksy and sometimes de- liberately ungrammatical. Also, there is little to distin; guish them from any other letter, since the envelopes are hand-typed and often mailed with an eye-catching com memorative stamp. In the last year, Viguerie’s letters have grossed $1,410,033, of which 53 per cent went to fund- raising expenses and the rest went to Wallace. Viguerte says he is just getting started. “As time goes on,” he prom- ises, “it should be even more successful.” : Candidates for statewide or Congressional offices are find- ing there are pitfalls in trying to borrow the techniques New York Times Magazine, Septemb THE ©; E Chicopee, Lee special-interest committees (below, BreadP AC red 2 N ae S, Charles Snider, Director ac.

The equal-time pro- visions of the Communica- tions Act of 1934 effectively prevent any declared candi- date from using a telethon. In the field of direct mail, it is hard for a candidate to cover even his mailing costs unless he is already well-known or” identified with a strong emo-- tional issue. Moreover, the lists that are available for rent through list brokers are often overmilked by previous users. As a result, many campaign organizations prefer to rely on noncommercial lists ob- tained by barter or donation. et questions can spring even from the soil of good inten- tions, as Democratic Senator Alan Cranston of Cal- ifornia, to pick one example, has discovered. When it comes to campaign financing, Crans- ton is a dedicated reformer, supporting even the heretical suggestion of allowing chal- lengers to outspend the in- cumbents. Last year, with Watergate in everyone’s living room, Cranston decided to infuse some extra spirit of reform into his own campaign for re- election this year. In hopes of avoiding the stigma of the fat cat, he settled ona plan to raise a large chunk of his campaign budget through di- rect-mail appeals for small contributions. However, even a program to attract small Campaign-financing tactics: Direct-mail appeals (here, a computerized form letter on behalf of 'Gov. George C. Wallace) and the letterhead of the fund-raising and lobbying arm of the Americar Bakers ‘Association) ~ Bread Politi i ; Suite 650 e 1700 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.e Wwastungion ‘Bre. 20008 , D.C. contributors through the mails may not be as laudable as it appears at first. For the Cranston program depended indirectly on the use of a Senate-owned computer and a Senator’s franking privilege (ree mailing) to cull the lists which were later used to raise money. Every step of Cran- ston’s program is within to- day’s Congressional standards of propriety, and there are other Senate campaign re- formers who raise funds by using the Senate computer’s lists. But while it is all legal and approved, it gives the in- cumbent ‘one more advantage over a challenger. en Cranston contem- plated using computerized direct-mail services last year, he was advised to test a va- riety of lists until he found those which would bring the highest dollars-and-cents re- turn for every dollar of mail- ing expense. Accordingly, Cranston’s campaign staff proceeded to rent samples from about a dozen com- puterized lists — everything from the California contribu- tors toward the 1972 McGov- ern campaign to the subscrip- tion lists of Outdoorsman magazine. For comparison, the Senator’s administrative as- sistant in Washington, Roy Greenaway, arranged to test a few thousand names of con- stituents on Cranston’s of- ficial newsletter mailing list. It turned out, however, that the list which yielded the best (202) 296-5800 in test mailings was Cran- ston’s own list, which was stored in the memory banks of the Senate’s computer. Cran- ston immediately arranged for the computer to reproduce on Magnetic tapes all 285,000 names on his newsletter mail- ing list. The total cost to his campaign: nothing. Money couldn’t buy the list of 285,000 people who were attuned to Alan Cranston. Using the franking privilege accorded to all members of Congress, Cranston had been culling and building the list for newsletter purposes ever since'he joined the Sen- ate in 1969. At first, his Senate newsletters went to those on his Christmas card list, to his past contributors and active California liberals. To that permanent roster he gradually added names of California lawyers, environmentalists, farmers and so on. Then, two years ago, he began sending sample copies of his newsletter to an extra 200,000 new families every time he mailed a new issue to his permanent mailing list. He obtained their names quite properly by paying about one- tenth of a cent per name to the California State Assembly for computer tapes of voter registration lists. Attached to each sample newsletter was a postcard inviting the new re- cipients to reply if they wished to receive future copies. Those who did not were dropped; those with a _ big money ———$$_.— sufficient interest in Cranston to put a stamp on the post- card were kept for the per manent mailing list. In short order, then, the permanent newsletter list grew from less than 50,000 to 285,000 names. From a single mailing of fund-raising letters in Maren (costing the campaign only $30,000), Cranston real $185,000 in pledges, most of which have already been paid. The Senator seemed hurt that anyone might criticize the fairness of the procedure- It looks as if we can get in trouble no matter what We do,” he complained. “If I get criticized for this, I am being criticized for trying to set away from the dependence 0? in campaigns- When I come out for public Lnancitig of elections, I set etters about wasting the tax- payers’. money.

Far more nox- ious is the odar of the money of organized special interests, who. may attain even greater influence after individual con- tributions are limited.

Clement Stone: From g2-m Money is still the flypaper of political campaigns price of purity ¢ cs ton forthe Now eempalginin 1972 to tokens for Republicans this year By Joseph P. Albright WASHINGTON. Nathan Cummings, 77, made 2 fortune in the grocery business and became 4 patron of the arts, giving copiously to museums in Chicago, New York, Montreal and Minneapolis. With equal fervor, he also became a patron of the Republican party. Two years ago, according to the list which Rose Mary Woods kept in her drawer, his patronage of the Finance Committee to Re-elect the President amounted to $44,356.28. In earlier campaigns, Cummings says, he has given as much or more. This year, however, the politicians will not get much help f, rom Cummings. At his apartment in New York’s Waldorf Towers, he has a_basket full of begging letters for needy Republican causes. But he rarely takes out his checkbook anymore- “Iam disappointed in what I see happening in Washington,” he told a caller two months before President Nixon’s resignation. “I am going to stay On the sidelines until I can see what is going on with more clarity.” When he later concluded that Nixon was about to depart, he relented—slightly- My policy this year will be to give a few small contributions, only peanuts really,” he explained.

This year, Wilson cut the goal for large gifts even further, and as late as this summer he was saying: ‘I doubt if we make it.” ‘ As yet, no one knows the net impact of Nixon’s resignation on old-line Republican contributors. Republican fund-raisers have high hopes of drawing many of them back into the arena with appeals aimed at preventing a ‘‘veto-proof’ Congress. But some Republican officials are apprehensive about a backlash from Nixon bitter-enders who may feel Republicans in Congress let him down. With some exceptions such as Mrs. Joan Palevsky in Los Angeles and conglomerate executive Meshu- lam Riklis in New York, Democratic superbene- factors are also cutting back this year or even dropping out of politics. “The perennial liberal givers are just not giving this year in anywhere near the proportions as before,” notes Sandy Weiner, a California political consultant. ‘“Com- pared to our expectations based on past perform- ances, We are getting about-30 cents on the dollar.” Even with talk of a Democratic sweep in November, the annual $500-a-plate Democratic Congressional Dinner in Washington grossed: only $609,000 this spring, nearly 15 per cent below its. budget, New York investment banker Herbert Allen, the dinner chairman, explains: “Wall Street is a disaster area. The political people can’t understand this, but this is a year when a really genero i i eens us person might give ' y the 1976 elections, it. will probably be too late for the fat cats to regain their prominence in, American politics. Their heyday ended in 1972, the year Maurice Stans bagged 142 contributions of $50,000 or more for President Nixon, and even Henry Kimmelman, chief tambourine-shaker for the McGovern campaign, managed to attract 45 people willing to part with at least $50,000 in gifts or loans. No-limit giving by the rich is still legal this year, but by 1976 it will very likely be legislated out of existence. Fading away, along with the fat cats, are many of the best-known loopholes and abuses of the recent past: the black suitcases, the $100 bills, the corporate contributions, the sale of ambassador- oe ee ay: of committees to evade the gift tax, the laundering of lobbyist money through intermediaries, aS well as the company bonuses sig a — saniaed for political giving. dunce eens » tens of thousands of candi- a the feet ee or Public office this November abcd rian pears elections since Watergate un- aan n issue in every race, it sometimes seems, is which candidate can raise and spend his et Bae while wearing the biggest badge aan Pano of many candidates’ zea! to do filed in Janu: aw requires was a 1,722-page report publican of ea by Senator Richard Schweiker, Re- tiflgations of ennsylvania, listing the complete iden- faeaaums ane his smallest contributors, includ- student who iaiiiee ie Occupation of one college i im a penny.

Back in 1757, when Wash- ington was running for the Virginia House of Burgesses, he is said to have softened the hearts of his constituents on election day with 28 gallons of rum, 50 gallons of rum punch, 34 gallons of wine, 46 gallons of beer and 2 gallons of cider royal. Someone has figured out that this amounted to a quart and a half of spirits for each eligible voter. In the decade before Watergate, scandals involv- ing political money made Bobby Baker a celebrity and drove Democratic Senators Thomas Dodd of Connecticut and Daniel Brewster of Maryland out of office. During the lulls between these explosions, lesser campaign scandals popped like a string of ladyfinger firecrackers.. The most disturbing was the disclosure that the Seafarers International Union’s political fund had poured $100,000 into the Humphrey Presidential campaign a few days after the Johnson Administraticn denied a request by the Canadian Government for the extradition of a former Seafarers official to face a Canadian perjury charge. There were also lesser disturbances when the Western Meat Packers Association started a fund for Congressmen who were considering a bill to tighten packing plant inspection; when a St. Louis local of the Pipefitters Union was caught making illegal contributions from the union trea- sury; and when the truckers’ lobby passed out $29,000 to Congressmen who were marking up a bill to allow heavier trucks on the highways. Then, in 1970, a wave of apprehension swept over Congress concerning rich candidates with telegenic faces trying to buy their way to power with inherited money. That was the year Representative Richard L. Ottinger and his relatives spent $3,920,089 on his unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in New York, and Norton Simon of California spent $1,350,- 000 of his own money also trying for the Senate. Congress responded by passing a bundle of reforms which had been killed in previous sessions. The first was a rider tacked onto a Nixon Ad- ministration tax bill to finance Presidential elec- tions by allowing a $1 voluntary income-tax check- off for each taxpayer (or $2 for a couple filing jointly). To avoid a Presidential veto, the House- Senate conferees agreed to delay the start of the dollar checkoff fund—America’s first venture into direct political subsidies—until after the 1972 elec- tion. As an incentive for widespread giving, the rider also allowed income tax write-offs for small political contributions (up to a $12.50 tax credit or a $50 tax deduction for every individual). Within a few months, Congress followed by en- acting the Federal Election Act of 1971, the first full rewrite of campaign laws since 1925. The new law, which went into effect on April 7, 1972, put forth the revolutionary premise that the names, addresses and occupations of all contributors of more than $100 toward (Continued on Page 32) Fund-raisers: At top, this' year’s $500-a-plate Demo- cratic Congressional Dinner brings out the likes of Carl Albert and Senator and Mrs. Muskie (but it grossed 15 per cent below budget).

No longer were primary elections immune from Federal report- ing requirements. n theory, every dime given to a Federal poli- tician is now supposed to be reported by his campaign treasurer. This does not always happen, however, because all language seems to be open to hair-splitting in- terpretations. Several Con- gressmen, including Repre- sentative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, have not reported money raised this year from special-interest committees to defray office expenses and newsletter mail- ing costs. Also, a milk pro- ducers’ lobbyist and other triends of retiring Republican Senator Norris ~Cotton of New Hampshire contributed to another unreported fund this spring to pay for a por- trait of Cotton in the New Hampshire State Capitol. Even Senator Edward M. Kennedy, one of the most pas- sionate backers of the 1971 law, was unaware until this summer that the law required the disclosure of a $1,000-a- head dinner party which he quietly held at his McLean, Va., heme this past February. Evidently Kennedy was not trying to conceal the donors entirely, since his campaign treasurer reported their names in Boston to the Common- wealth of Massachusetts. How- ever, no report of fund-raising activities on Kennedy’s part was filed with the proper au- thorities in Washington this year until one month after an inquiry on behalf of The New York Times Magazine about the dinner. Richard Drayne, Kennedy’s press secretary, Produced copies of reports filed in Massachusetts show- ing that the Committee to Re- Elect Senator Edward M. Ken- nNedy United States Senator had collected $45,101.23 in the first six and a half months of 1974. Nearly all of the gifts Were in $1,000 denominations from Massachusetts citizens, ton for dinner with the Ken- nedys, according to Drayne. When asked why the dinner party had not been reported to the Secretary of the Senate in Washington, Drayne replied that all the money was col- lected to pay off a campaign debt from the 1970 election. Drayne said Clifford Shaw, a Boston C.P.A. who was Ken- nedy’s 1970 campaign treas- urer, had read the 1971 law and cancluded that it did not require disclosure of fund- raising to meet pre-1971 debts. After consulting with of- ficials in the Secretary of the Senate’s office, who gave the opposite interpretation, Ken- nedy’s office decided subse- quently that his committee should file reports in Wash- ington after all. “Under the Narrow meaning of the lan- guage in the law, our people up in Boston were probably right, but we decided to comply with the © spirit,” Drayne explained. : The Federal report, filed by Shaw on the day Richard Nix- on resigned as President, was marked late and incomplete by an auditor in the .office of the Secretary of the Senate. By return mail, Shaw was notified that the Kennedy re- port ‘omitted disposition of debts” during the previous year and did not specify which contributions were obtained through the fund-raising din- ner. Along with ali other re- ports filed after the quarterly reporting deadlines, the Ken- nedy report will be trans- mitted to the Department of Justice for possible prosecu- tion. he 1971 act, besides requiring disclasure, also introduced limits on any one candi- date’s ability to overwhelm another with money. While the law contained no top ceil- ings for campaign budgets, it did set limits on the readily measurable forms of cam- paign advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards and automatic telephoning equip- ment. Finally, the law put the kibosh on millionaires by de- claring that no candidate could give or lend more than $50,000 of his family’s money to his own Presidential cam- paign, or $35,000 if a candi- New York Times Personal touch: The Democrats’ 1972 fund- date for the Senate, or $25,000 if running for the House of Representatives. Nearly all the easy reforms had been enacted in the 1971 law—before Watergate, which seemed to make new leg- lation a necessity. But some of the 1971 reforms were turning out to be a bother. Because of the new disclosure requirements, old contributors were refusing to give because they did not want their names in the papers. Government auditors were asking questions, then demanding revised reports even from such untouchables as Representative Wayne L. Hays, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Committee on House Administration. Naderites, Common Causers and newspapermen were track- ing down every reported do- nation and trying to link it to some private bill or other special favor. As a result of the Watergate excesses, the one quick fix which nearly everyone in Con- gress could accept this year was that no individual should be allowed to contribute more than a few thousand dollars to any Federal candidate. The Senate, acting early this year, voted a simple $3,000 ceiling on any individual’s contribu- tions to a Federal - election campaign. Then, last month, the House voted to set the limits lower ($1,000 toward a primary and $1,000 toward a general election), but alsa wrote in four loopholes which would allow a determined con- tributor to spend well beyond the specified limits, The House-Senate conference com- mittee, however, should have little difficulty in devising a compromise limit when it meets later this month. While it may not be air-tight it wilt be restrictive enough to keep anyone from buying a con- trolling interest in a Federal candidate. There is an addi- tional limit in both the House and Senate bills which pro- hibits an individual from giv- ing more than $25,000 an- nually toward all candidaies put together. If the bill is Signed into law, those limits would Probably not become effective until next year. The limits will have a better chance of being enforced if the House-Senate conferees can agree on an independent elections commission similar to the one contained in the Senate version. But Hays, chairman of the House con- ferees, has Promised to insist on the weaker enforcement machinery contained in ihe House version, Another proposal which was palatable to most Con- gressmen this year was an over-all ceiling on every Fed- eral candidate’s total expendi- tures. Conceptually, this ac- complished only a small jump beyond the 1971 law, which has already put a complicated set of limits on all big-ticket campaign advertising ex- penses, excluding those in- curred in direct-mail requests. But bitter arguments ensued in both houses on how high the over-all limit should be. Outside reformers led by Com- ion Cause, along with some Republicans, Pressed to keep the limits as high as possible, Pointing out that the few chal- lengers who managed to de- feat the House incumbents in 1972 had to spend an average of $125,000 on their generat- election campaigns. At the other end of the scale, many rural Congressmen and Demo- raising telethon—starring Hubert H. Humphrey. crats, led by Representative Dawson Mathis of Georgia, wanted to keep the campaign- expenditure limits as low as possible, arguing that it was immoral to spend $125,- 900 on an election. The final House-Senate compromise fig- ures were expected to be high enough to give House and. Senate challengers at least some chance to defeat an en- trenched incumbent, but prob- ably less chance than under the current law. : fter Watergate, after the milk fund ‘and Spiro Agnew, a num- ber of reformers in Congress saw the chance to push through a more radical idea. From their perspective, limits and disclosure are nct enough. The only way to erad- icate _the corrupting influence OF ‘Drivaite Campaign contribu- tions is to finance all cam- Ppalgns with public money. For the middle-of-the-road Congressman, however, public financing introduces a more complex set of questions than either limits or disclosure. 15 ‘t Proper, philosophically, t0 tax citizens to support the Propagation viewpoints they cannot abide?

Moreover, there is also the selfish question of how: public. _ financing would affect one’s own incumbency. For many House and Senate incumbents with safe seats, the prospect of a welli-financed opponent is simply too threatening to consider. Few have acknowl- edged this fear in public, but Representative Al Uliman, Democrat of Oregon, was probably speaking for a ma- jority of his calleagues iast year when he described public financing of Congressional elections as a device that “could destroy every member oF the House.” -What he meant, he said later, was that the work of Congress wouid Cease every election year be- ‘Cause members would have to return to their districts to con- tend — with Government-fi- anced opponents.

After the party nominat- ing ‘conventions, the matching requirements would disappear, and the Presidential candi- dates of the two major parties could draw as much as $20- million apiece from the doNar- check-off fund, with lesser allocations for minor parties. The more radicai step—pub- lic financing for Congressional elections—did pass the Senate this year, but was defeated, 228-187, on the House floor last month. Of the 75 most senior Congressmen, who com- mand all the committee chair- manships and most of the leadership positions, only 12 voted for public financing on the Congressional tevel. Since even the Senate proponents are not sure they have the idea perfected for House and Senate races, the consensus throughout Congress apparent- ly ‘is to await the _ results of public financing in the 1975 Presidential elections. Even without Congressional public financing, the 1974 election-reform amendments may never go into effect. Judging from early signals sent out from Gerald Ford’s White House, there is a strong likelihood that the whole bill will be vetoed. Ford and his advisers are understood to. oppose the Presidential pub- lic financing provisions as well as the actual limits on Congressional campaign budg- ets, which are seen as means of perpetuating incumbents in office. However, Ford is not oppaqsed to limits on indi- vidual contributions. This part of the bill, at least, seems likely to be enacted later this year or early in the mext ses- sion. INo matter what happens with the 1974 election bill, can- didates for the House, the Sen- ate and the Presidency will still be under enormous pres- sure to raise money at some stage in their campaigns. ““‘We have come to the place in campaigns where we have to spend ali our time raising money or accounting for the damn stuff,’ drawled politi- cal consultant Matt Reese at .a recent convention of fellow consultants. very imaginable tech- nique of. raising money, particularly in small amounts, is being tried: auctions, yard sales, hot-dog dinners, tennis exhibitions, door-to-door so- licitations, chain letters and even a money-back guarantee to contributors if they are dis- satisfied with a candidate's. performance in office. But for many candidates, the one way to raise large amounts of small money is to rely solely on the sophisticated techniques of professional fund-raisers. Both the Republicans and Democrats use direct mail month in and month out ta finance the ongoing activities of their national party organi- zations. Since 1968, the Re- publican National Committee has built its active mailing list to 800,000 names, and iast year the party mailings brought in $3,963,000 in gifts ef $100 or tess. The Demo- cratic National Com@mittee now supplements its own \f direct-mail efforts with an annual telethon, which this summer cleared $4-million after paying for network time and production costs. Direct mail already looms in the fund-raising plans of most Presidential candidates for 1976. One of Senator Henry M. Jackson’s fund- raisers says: “I would hope we can test 500 to 1,000 dif- ferent lists to see which ones work best.’”” Another Demo- crat, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, has sought the services of a direct-mail firm which was organized by some of George McGovern’s sup- porters in 1972. On the Re- publican side, | Senator Charles Percy of Hlinois spent $65,000 last fall by sending out 8,700 letters to his past supporters under the signature of his most prominent backer, Mil- ton Eisenhower. Probably the most sophisti- cated—and most successful— direct-mail activity now in motion is run for Gov. George Wallace by the Richard A. Viguerie Co, a direct-mail house in Falls Church, Va. Viguerie’s business revolves around his own computerized list of 2,500,000 conservative givers, many of whose names were Jovingly copied in long- hand by Viguerie’s employes from a Goldwater list filed at the House Clerk’s office in 1964. Using his own list and presumably others he has rented, Viguerie has churned out about four million fund- raising letters for Wallace in the last year. Each one is per- sonally addressed and typed by high-speed letter printers in Viguerie’s computer room. To extract the maximum gift from each potential donor, Viguerie programers instruct the computer to ask every ad- dressee for a specific amount of money, pegged to his larg- est contribution to any pre- vious political cause. Viguerie’s messages are di- rect, folksy and sometimes de- liberately ungrammatical. Also, there is little to distin; guish them from any other letter, since the envelopes are hand-typed and often mailed with an eye-catching com memorative stamp. In the last year, Viguerie’s letters have grossed $1,410,033, of which 53 per cent went to fund- raising expenses and the rest went to Wallace. Viguerte says he is just getting started. “As time goes on,” he prom- ises, “it should be even more successful.” : Candidates for statewide or Congressional offices are find- ing there are pitfalls in trying to borrow the techniques New York Times Magazine, Septemb THE ©; E Chicopee, Lee special-interest committees (below, BreadP AC red 2 N ae S, Charles Snider, Director ac.

The equal-time pro- visions of the Communica- tions Act of 1934 effectively prevent any declared candi- date from using a telethon. In the field of direct mail, it is hard for a candidate to cover even his mailing costs unless he is already well-known or” identified with a strong emo-- tional issue. Moreover, the lists that are available for rent through list brokers are often overmilked by previous users. As a result, many campaign organizations prefer to rely on noncommercial lists ob- tained by barter or donation. et questions can spring even from the soil of good inten- tions, as Democratic Senator Alan Cranston of Cal- ifornia, to pick one example, has discovered. When it comes to campaign financing, Crans- ton is a dedicated reformer, supporting even the heretical suggestion of allowing chal- lengers to outspend the in- cumbents. Last year, with Watergate in everyone’s living room, Cranston decided to infuse some extra spirit of reform into his own campaign for re- election this year. In hopes of avoiding the stigma of the fat cat, he settled ona plan to raise a large chunk of his campaign budget through di- rect-mail appeals for small contributions. However, even a program to attract small Campaign-financing tactics: Direct-mail appeals (here, a computerized form letter on behalf of 'Gov. George C. Wallace) and the letterhead of the fund-raising and lobbying arm of the Americar Bakers ‘Association) ~ Bread Politi i ; Suite 650 e 1700 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.e Wwastungion ‘Bre. 20008 , D.C. contributors through the mails may not be as laudable as it appears at first. For the Cranston program depended indirectly on the use of a Senate-owned computer and a Senator’s franking privilege (ree mailing) to cull the lists which were later used to raise money. Every step of Cran- ston’s program is within to- day’s Congressional standards of propriety, and there are other Senate campaign re- formers who raise funds by using the Senate computer’s lists. But while it is all legal and approved, it gives the in- cumbent ‘one more advantage over a challenger. en Cranston contem- plated using computerized direct-mail services last year, he was advised to test a va- riety of lists until he found those which would bring the highest dollars-and-cents re- turn for every dollar of mail- ing expense. Accordingly, Cranston’s campaign staff proceeded to rent samples from about a dozen com- puterized lists — everything from the California contribu- tors toward the 1972 McGov- ern campaign to the subscrip- tion lists of Outdoorsman magazine. For comparison, the Senator’s administrative as- sistant in Washington, Roy Greenaway, arranged to test a few thousand names of con- stituents on Cranston’s of- ficial newsletter mailing list. It turned out, however, that the list which yielded the best (202) 296-5800 in test mailings was Cran- ston’s own list, which was stored in the memory banks of the Senate’s computer. Cran- ston immediately arranged for the computer to reproduce on Magnetic tapes all 285,000 names on his newsletter mail- ing list. The total cost to his campaign: nothing. Money couldn’t buy the list of 285,000 people who were attuned to Alan Cranston. Using the franking privilege accorded to all members of Congress, Cranston had been culling and building the list for newsletter purposes ever since'he joined the Sen- ate in 1969. At first, his Senate newsletters went to those on his Christmas card list, to his past contributors and active California liberals. To that permanent roster he gradually added names of California lawyers, environmentalists, farmers and so on. Then, two years ago, he began sending sample copies of his newsletter to an extra 200,000 new families every time he mailed a new issue to his permanent mailing list. He obtained their names quite properly by paying about one- tenth of a cent per name to the California State Assembly for computer tapes of voter registration lists. Attached to each sample newsletter was a postcard inviting the new re- cipients to reply if they wished to receive future copies. Those who did not were dropped; those with a _ big money ———$$_.— sufficient interest in Cranston to put a stamp on the post- card were kept for the per manent mailing list. In short order, then, the permanent newsletter list grew from less than 50,000 to 285,000 names. From a single mailing of fund-raising letters in Maren (costing the campaign only $30,000), Cranston real $185,000 in pledges, most of which have already been paid. The Senator seemed hurt that anyone might criticize the fairness of the procedure- It looks as if we can get in trouble no matter what We do,” he complained. “If I get criticized for this, I am being criticized for trying to set away from the dependence 0? in campaigns- When I come out for public Lnancitig of elections, I set etters about wasting the tax- payers’. money. Whatever We do to finance a campaign, W@ seem to be trapped.” - he abuse of the franking privilege iS. by no means e smelliest sewer left uncovered by the post-Water- gate reforms. Far more nox- ious is the odar of the money of organized special interests, who. may attain even greater influence after individual con- tributions are limited.

The result of Wager’s | Urgings was the creation of a New York Times Magazine, September 1, 1974 (continued) new committee Known as BreadPAc, which became number 1744 on the Senate’s list oF committees set up to influence elections. BreadPAC, with Wager designated as treasurer, set a goal of raising $100,000 this year from bak- ing-industry executives. The $100,000 will be spread among House and Senate candidates adjudged sympathetic to low- er sugar prices, export con- trols on grain and other ob- jectives of the baking indus- try. What the money will buy, in Wager’s estimation, is ac- cess to a legislator who might otherwise remain “‘in conference’? or ‘‘on the other line’”’ or ‘‘on the floor.’’ BreadPAC is small by com- _Parison with special-interest committees of the maritinre unions, the doctors or the bankers. But Wager is confi- dent that the bakers’ money will be well spent. His confi- dence derives from the 1¢C years he spent on the staff of a Senate Government Opera- tions subcommittee before be- coming president of the bakers. Measured by what they re- port, special-interest commit- tees are spending more and more money every election year. A recent compilation of their quarterly reports by Common Cause showed that business, labor and other registered interest groups have amassed about $14.7-million, which is available to be spent in the 1974 elections. This is in addition to $2-7-million which they had already passed out to candidates by May 21. It is reasonable to assume, then, that expenditures by special - interest committees will be at least $17.4-million for the year, and could well exceed $20-miliion. The best available expendi- ture totals by business, labor and misceHaneous organiza- tions for prior elections come fram Herbert E. Alexander of the Citizens Research Foun- dation. Alexander’s figures trace what amounts to a bull market in political giving by special-interest organizations: SS.7-million in 1964; $6.8-mil- lion in 1966; $11.4-million in 1968; $11.4-million in 1970; $12.4-million in 1972. The big jump in 1974 is partly due to tighter reporting requirements in the 1971 law. But even allowing for statistical incom- patibilities, there can be no question that lobbyists still believe that money does make a difference. “It’s the American way,” as Ed Waiker, former president of the American Nursing Home Association, once said in explaining political contribu- tions. “‘There are a lot of right things that go down the drain on Capitol Hill, and we have learned through.the years that you not only have to be right but you have to have the po- litical strength to enforce rightness.’’ The money that goes into political campaigns is no doubt cleaner today: than when Walker made that re- mark six years ago. The Fed- eral Election Campaign Act of 1971 was 2a kind of secondary sewage-treatment plant which had the capacity to aerate, filter and chlorinate the worst of the filth in the old system. The 1974 reform amendments, if signed by President Ford, would remove a little more of the sediment. But no one should pretend that the ef- fluent has been rendered safe and wholesame. hat this democ- racy could use is an entirely new mechanism for financing elections — a mechanism that would tead henorable politicians out of temptation without creating mew opportunities for the boodling few. The ultimate answer may lie in some form of public financing, but the reformers would be well-advised to apply some rigorous thought to devising a graft-proof for- mula before they came back to Congress next year. This year’s public financing dis- cussions were good in theory but weak on such details as the problems associated with primaries, minor parties and frivolous candidates. The 1974 elections are upon us. Immediately after election day in November, the money men, the special-interest groups and the candidates will regroup for 1976. If the next Congress does not pass a new system of campaign financing in the first half of next year, then we will probably have to await the trials of another superscandal to make re- form politically possible once again."

Gathered in Banquet Room B-339 of the Rayburn House Office Building one day last February were 220 of the most grateful lobbyists in town. “Quite a turnout,” whispered a sleekly- tweeded railroad lawyer to the Washington vice president of a paper products manufacturer. The paper-products man said he was not a bit surprised. It was well aiter the ice cream when Paul J. Tierney, president of the Transportation Associa- tion of America, which sponsored the luncheon, stood up and put into words the reason for this convocation of railroad representatives, shippers, barge and truck lobbyists, investment bankers, lawyers and public-relations men. “The time has come,” said Tierney, “to offer a simple, forthright expression of the heart to those members of the selves to grab a legislative tiger by the tail and tame it.” All 220 guests rose applauding as Democratic Representative Brock Adams of Seattle, Wash., Ibright is Washington correspondent for i eranietace Chronicle and a frequent con- Caivor to this Magazine.

Modestly, Adams al- lowed that he may have “worked in the vineyards” to get the Northeast railroad bill passed, but the real credit for a “legislative miracle” belongs to the transportation industry itself. The next ovation was for Republican Representative Dick Shoup, the former Mayor of Missoula, Mont., whom Tierney called “a tower of strength.” Shoup responded, “God and the voters willing, I look forward to working with you for many years in the future.” A Congressional appreciation lunch laid on by lobbyists is not always the purest source of knowl- edge about what gets done in Washington and why. Nevertheless, a whiff of truth rose up this time from the garland of clichés. It was, in fact, some- thing of a legislative miracle that a $2.17-billion bill to “save” the Penn Central and several other bank- rupt railroads was signed into law early this year. For if all goes according to plan, the bill will in the next couple of years thrust the Government deep into the railroad business in a way that amounts to temporary nationalization, yet it tiptoed into the statute books with almost no public appre- ciation of what was happening.

But asa freight mover, Penn Central is easily the biggest railroad in the country. Every day it carries 228,0C0 tons of coal, 65,000 tons of iron and other ores, 55,000 tons of food, 44,000 tons of pulp and paper and 24,000 tons of grain. In fact, in terms of freight-car miles, the Penn Central last year did the same amount of work that it would take to move a 35-car freight train to the sun. F _— Penn Central was until recent years the nation’s largest passenger railroad, but by now it has moved out of the passenger business almost entirely, complaining that passenger trains don’t make money. Its long-haul passenger business has been turned over to Amtrak, a Government-backed corporation, which opérates its own trains over the tracks of Penn Central and other railroads and pays them for the use of their tracks and terminals. Penn Central still carries 225,000 commuters every day under full or partial subsidy arrangements with local government agencies, principally in Boston, Philadelphia and New York. Despite horrendous losses, the Penn Central Transportation Company remains a huge corpora- tion, with $4-billion in assets, 78,000 employes and a multiplicity of interests. Last year, for instance, it laid 1,814,827 crossties. It also paid $2,128,000 to 24 law firms. . The Penn Central was acclaimed as the salvation of the Northeastern railroad system six years ago when it was formed in the merger of the cash- starved Pennsylvania, New York Central and New Haven railroads. The stock of the new Penn Cen- tral Transportation Company shot up to $86.50 a share within the first year, and soon Penn Central chairman Stuart Saunders, the main architect of the merger, was given a scroll as Businessman of the Year for 1968. Two years later. Penn Central crash » during the recession of 1970, dropped to $2 a ed into bankruptcy and the stock share. The postmortems, which have gone on almost continually ever since, have tended to point in one of two directions. One school of thought explains the fiasco by pointing to the alleged misdeeds or misjudgements of the top executives, who hastily departed after the bank- ruptcy. One of the most (Continued on Page 94 New York Times Magazine, November 3, 1974 (continued) \f Penn Central Continued from Page 17 ng accusations, which emanated from a House subcommittee investigation, was that some Penn Central executives had siphoned off railroad revenues for an ex- ecutive jet aviation subsidiary that provided call girls for customers, Lately, the Securi- ties and Exchange Commission has charged Saunders and David C, Bevan, former Penn Central financial officer, with fraudulently scheming to in- flate the company’s reported earnings. The other school of thought, more widely accepted in the railroad industry, but less publicized, is that Penn Cen- tral was the victim of broad economic trends in the North- east. Factories that justified a rail spur 75 years ago have moved South, only to be re- placed by service businesses and tight industry. Coal, in- stead of being hauled to every factory, was now often being transformed into electricity near the mine head or not be- ing mined at all. The interstate highway system and the St. Lawrence Seaway allowed trucks and barges to skim off the growth in freight tonnage. All this occurred in an indus- try historically burdened by hopelessly inefficient work rules won by unions over the years, and in an overde- veloped railroad environment. Intertwined with the Penn Central tracks, often dupli- cating them line for line, are those of eight other railroads, and since the Penn Central filed for bankruptcy, six of them have followed suit. In retrospect, it is quite Possible that both schools of a OP = 2 = Penn Certral freight yard in Newark. Last year, Penn Central engines did the same amount of work that it would take to move a 35-car freight train to the sun. ; OUR! are right about the Penn Central collapse. A more talented crew in the execu- tive suites probably could have squeaked past bank- ruptcy court in 1970. On the other hand, the general rail- road situation in the North- east was out of phase with the economy of the nineteen- sixties, and it is valid to argue that the Penn Central would have lost money under any management. Indeed, since the court-appointed trustees took over from the Bevan- Saunders team, Penn Central, instead of prospering, has lost another $700-million. To keep from running out of cash to meet its payroll, the com- Pany’s trustees have accepted $116-million in Government loans and loan guarantees and have postponed every possible debt or repair. Reliance on such temporiz- ing measures did nothing to prevent the roadbed and equipment from deteriorating, and before long the bank- ruptcy creditors were pressing. in court for the liquidation of Penn Central and the cessa- tion of its operations. It was to prevent this that Congress finally settled for the Shoup- Adams Act nearly a year ago. Under it, the freight-carrying system now belonging to Penn Centra} and four other smaller bankrupt railroads in the Northeast are supposed to be merged into a new federally assisted railroad corporation to be known as Consolidated Rail Corporation, or Conraii for short. In exchange for their tracks, terminals, locomotives and other rail properties, the creditors will get all the com- mon stock in Conrail, plus something like $1-billion in Government-backed bonds. Unless blocked by the Su- Ppreme Court, Conrail should begin operating the merged system—S4 percent of which is now Penn Central-—in 1976. Strictly speaking, the Govern- ment will not “own” its new creation, Conrail. But the new railroad will be Government- controlled at least until the midnineteen-eighties, and per- haps forever, because of a stipulation in the Shoup- Adams Act that the Conrail board of directors must be controlled by Government ap- pointees as long as at least half of Conrail’s outstanding loans are Government-assist- ed. Conrail hopes to make a go of the Northeast rail system by spending Federal money on fixing up worn-out tracks and cars and, more important, by pruning to efficient size the “spaghetti” of duplicating and obsolete rail lines that helped drag not only the Penn Cen- tral but also the Erie Lacka- wanna, Boston & Maine, Le- high Valley, Ann Arbor, Read- ing, and Central of New Jersey into bankruptcy. The Shoup-Adams Act pro- vided three sets of Govern- ment rail planners to draw the maps for the consolida- tion into Conrai} with the “preliminary system plan” scheduled to be published only last week. The plan- ning process is a few months behind schedule, however. and there has been a war over every mile of track. The poli- tica] backlash from communi- ties and factories threatened with losing their spurs and stations has been hitting Con- gressmen all year, and it will no doubt increase through the months of public hearings leading toward next year's vote in Congress on whether to approve the “final system plan.” Meanwhile, two of the seven bankrupt railroads for which the law was written— Erie Lackawanna and Boston & Maine—have opted out of Conrail on grounds that the new law would not sufficiently compensate their creditors. And two still-solvent Eastern railroads—the Chessie Sys- tem and the Norfolk & West- ern—are pressuring the Gov- ernment planners to break Conrail into several compet- ing Government-funded rail systems, fearing that one big Conrail would drive them out of business. If the Conrall system sur- vives such challenges and works as planned, the North- east will have a trimmed- down rail network and the - years, country will have a precedent for temporary nationalization that could apply just as well to Pan American, Boeing, or United States Steel. If it fails, the Northeast will have the same deteriorating rail system it now has, and full rail na- tionalization could well seem inevitable. n the great old days of railroading, matters of comsequence were han- dled by peopte with names like Vanderbilt, Depew and Harriman at_ suitable meeting places like J. P. Morgan’s yacht, Corsair. To- day, railroads~ are run by lawyers. And their quiet, im- portant little meetings happen in less conspicuous settings. The most powerful of the new railroad captains is Frank E. Barnett, who began in the Depression as a tax lawyer and rose through the Union Pacific Railroad legal depart- ment to become chief executive of the Union Pacific Corpora- tion. From the 31st floor of a conventional-modern tower at 345 Park Avenue, Barnett pre- sides over a $3-billion enter- prise west of the Mississippi that combines the most profit- able railroad in the country with a coal company, an oil company and a reaim of real estate. It was in Barnett’s office at 2:30 P.M. on Jan. 17, 1973, that the solution to the Penn Central bankruptcy began to congeal. Barnett had not done much cogitating about the best way to rescue the un- profitable Eastern railroads. But the other two men at the meeting had. One was Jervis Langdon, his friend of 25 years in the railroad business who was by then senior trustee of the Penn Central. For nearly three Langdon had _ been chopping away at Penn Cen- tral’s losses, trying to pull it out of insolvency through a traditional income-based reorganization. Langdon and the man he has since replaced as the railroad’s president, William H. Moore, had man- aged to improve Penn Cen- tral’s service to shippers and even cut the losses somewhat by management techniques, but by this time Langdon had concluded that his preferred alternative, an “operating solution,” was impossible. In- stead, the railroad would have to get court permission to stop running unless there was a “legislative solution” in which the Federal Govern- ment would provide $600-mii- lion to $800-million in sub- sidies. The other man at the meet- ing was Union Pacific’s gen- eral counsel, William J. Mc- Donald, who, at 46, was a Beneration younger than the other two. One week earlier, at an Association of American Railroads iegal-affairs com- mittee meeting, McDonald heard one A.A.R. official wishing out loud for a ‘‘Moses to come down from the moun- tain’’ with a way out of the Northeast rail problem. After getting clearance from Barnett, he had already started putting his mind to devising one. The meeting fn Barnett’s of- fice, requested by Langdon, took about two hours. “Jervis started by lamenting the fact that nobody in the industry had come forward with a plan for the Penn Central. prob- lem,\"\" recalls Barnett. They spent much of the time run- ning through the woes of all Northeast railroads: In addi- tion to the onerous labor set- tlements left behind by past merger agreements, the under- used trackage because of duplication with other rail- roads and the competition from barges and trucks, tne three could identify other troubles; terminals were ob- solete, freight runs were often too short to be profitable, box- cars stood idle too much of the time and speeds had to be cut because of unsafe track. All three accepted as a given that the solution lay in getting Washington to do something. However, if cur- rent memories are accurate, they did not talk in terms of a concerted course of action for provoking action. The one specific result was that Langdon agreed to supply McDonald some detailed in- formation from Penn Central files in Philadelphia about labor costs. Langdon remem- bers McDonatd wanting it for some Northeast rail legisla- tion he was thinking about drafting. After that meeting, two streams of events were set in motion. One was largely pub- lic and brought about by Langdon, the other was mainly behind-the-scenes and brought about by the two Union Pacific executives. The two streams seemed to run in the same direction down to the enactment of the North- east rail bill a year later. Langdon and his two co- trustees, George P. Baker and Richard C. Bond, actually be- gan their moves back in 1972 by commissioning one of the more sophisticated studies ever written on how best to squeeze a transportation sub- sidy out of the Federal Gov- ernment. The author, the late Dr. Paul Cherington, knew the New York Times Magazine, November 3, 1974 (continued) \fpolitics of subsidies inside out, having helped guide the Amtrak passenger rail bill through Congress in 1969 when he was an Assistant Secretary of Transportation. Now, serving as a consultant to the trustees, Cherington analyzed 17 separate ways in which the Government might be induced to subsidize Penn Central's cash flow, Chering- ton postulated that it was probably not feasible to get an overt “‘need subsidy” suf- ficient to cover Penn Central's annual deficit. A much better bet, he suggested, was a form of subsidy he called “untoad- ing.” The creation of Amtrak, he said, was originally viewed by the Department of Trans- portation as a means of adding $2-billion in needed income to the railroad indus- try by letting it “unload” its unprofitable passenger service onte a Government corpora- tion, As for Penn Central, it might consider “unloading” several big-ticket items onto the Government—for instance, the cost of “labor protective” agreements under which man- agement promised to reduce excess employes only through attrition. Another of Cherington’s propositions seems to have come through to the trustees as loud as a steam whistle: “Relief from the Government in massive form,” he wrote, “probably will not come un- less a real crisis is imminent.” As it happened, Penn Cen- tral was indeed approaching a financial crisis because $116-millian in prior Govern- ment-provided loans was run- ning out. The trouble was that people in Washington were jaded about Penn Central fi- nancial crises. Howard Beasley, then a young Treas- ury Department hotshot who was assigned to monitor sick carporations, remembers: “The Penn Central trustees have an amazing ability to get over their cash crises by drawing on some unbeknownst asset. [Treasury Secretary] George Schultz once told me they used to come to him every six months, saying they would run out of money, and yet somehow they managed at the last moment to get by.” This time, Beasley and the others who talked to the trustees were less skeptical than before. But there was no mass movement to pass a subsidy cither. In early February, 1973—a fortnight after the Langdon- Barnett meeting—the trustees took two steps that brought their money problems into the legislative arena. First, they filed a gloomy report with Federal Judge John P. Fullam calling on the Government to provide up to $800-million in subsidies un- less the railroad was immedi- ately allowed to shed the “public burden\" of operating 9,000 miles of unprofitable routes. Failure by Washing- ton to. make such a commit- ment “can only result in a closing of Penn Central’s rail- road,” the trustees concluded. A few days later, trustee George Baker gave a candid speech deploring the difficul- ties of getting Federal help. “without 2a crisis,” com- plained Baker, “it may take Congress damn near forever.” Baker went on to suggest that an opinion from Judge Fullam stating that the railroad ought to shut down could serve as a useful prod to Congress. And sure enough, Fullam de- clared in March that it was “highly doubtful’ that he could allow Penn Central to keep running beyond Oct. I-—— thus, in effect, giving Con- gress a seven-month deadline. The trustees’ second move was to take a Strike. Digging in their heels after months of futile negotiations with the United Transportation Union (U.T.U.), the trustees in early February ordered notices Posted cutting the size of freight train crews from four men to three. At 32:01 A.M. on Feb. 8, the U.T.U. struck Penn Central, as the trustees knew it would, stopping all traffic on its lines. By noon thousands of telegrams were delivered in Washington, in- cluding one from chairman Richard C. Gerstenberg of General Motors, who wired President Nixon: “If it is not resolved immediately,  vir- tually ail G.M. manufacturing and assembly operations will be closed down by Monday.” Nothing makes Congress jump like a rail strike. Within 16 hours the strikers were or- dered back to work by an emergency resolution of bath houses—-as Langdon rather expected. But to his surprise the antistrike resolution con- tained a requirement that within 45 days the Nixon Administration must come up with a fuli-blown plan for preserving rail service in the Northeast. As the demands to cut off the strike were still flowing in, President Nixon is said to have given then-Treasury Secretary Schultz an oral di- rective: “George, 1 want a Private, free-enterprise so- lution to come out of this.” As Shultz intce*preted it, this ‘meant no Government money to bail out the Penn Central, and certainly not the $600-mil- lion to $800-milion the trustees were talking about. In @ hurried round of task-force meetings throughout the Government, there arose the idea of creating a new for- profit railroad that would ac- quire from the bankrupt pri- vately owned railroads a “core” of heavily used, lucra- tive trackage. The key as- sumption was that the new railroad, nicknamed “De Novo” by Treasury's working group, would look so profita- ble in advance that private investors would finance and own it without Government subsidies. The Administration's  re- quired 45-day report to Con- gress brought matters to 2a crucial point that seemed dramatically reminiscent of a scene out of a nickelodeon. The Nixon Administration was trying to lash the poor Penn Central trustees ta tracks labeled “Private Enterprise Solution.” In the background, cries of pain could be heard from the rail unions and Penn Central creditors, who realized that the Administration envi- sioned paying off their claims by giving them stock in the “De Novo\" railroad, which they feared would be worth- less. But just in time, big Frank Barnett of the Union Pacific was highballing to the rescue. ’ Barnett says now that his meeting with Langdon on Jan. 17 “certainly convinced me that someone aught to do something” to help Penn Cen- tral. The logical vehicle for delivering the railroad indus- try’s writ to Capitol Hill was not Union Pacific but the Washington-based Association of American Railroads, which was set up to lobby for the industry. But, as Barnett knew, the A.A.R. board had a rule of unanimity on lobby- ing activities, and the two profitable Eastern railroads— the Chessie System. and the Norfolk & Western — were dead set against strengthen- ing Penn Central to the point where they might suffer. From Union Pacific's view- point, there were two practi- cal considerations on the side of doing something for Penn Central, according to Barnett. First, Union Pacific inter- changed one-fourth of its freight traffic with the North- east, and se the withering or liquidation of Penn Central would cut Union Pacifie’s ac- cess to its own markets on the Atlantic seaboard. And second, if the insurance com- panies and other big creditors of Penn Central were too badly burned in the bank- ruptcy settlement, they would make it tougher for even the profitable railroads to borrow money later on. The directors of Union Pacific, meeting on Jan, 27, heard Barnett recount the gloomy Penn Central situation and then conclude: “Unless someone restrains me, I am going to open my big mouth about it prett soon.” There being no objec tion from the board, Barnett set McDonald te work writing a legislative recipe. The most awesome impedi ment was the Nixon Admin. istration’s imsistance that i would try to impound or veto > any expenditures beyond the new $268.9-billion budget ceil ing. To McDonald’s credit as a resuit-getter, he sensed tha the trick was to tap a little known substratum of Govern ment financial activity know as “‘off-budget financing.’ Congress would have to be induced to create a new semi governmental organization to) make loans to financially ail Ing Eastern railroads. new entity, to be patterned on the existing Federal National Mortgage Association (‘‘Fan- nie Mae”), would have the much-coveted ability to issue Government-backed loans without having them show up in the U.S. budget totals. Al- though these “off-budget” loans would add to the na- tional debt, they would not be subject to the recurring debt- ceiling bills, nor to the grip of the Office of Management and Budget. The other half of Mc- Donald’s plan evolved later and was similar to the Nixon Administration's proposal: He wanted Congress to create a new for-profit railroad that would acquire and operate an efficient network of routes from the bankrupts, However, unlike the Administration's plan, McDonald's called for the Government to pick up the ‘Sabor protective’ costs in forming a merged Eastern railroad system, and to issue Government-guaranteed bonds that could be used as pay- ments to creditors for their assets. Before he went to Congress. Barnett set out to presell the nion Pacific plan as a method to prevent full nationalization of railroads. Between Feb- ruary and June, the calendars of Barnett and McDonald show 29 private meetings in New York and Washington with other railroad execu- tives, investment bankers, Penn Central creditors, and Government officials. In addi- tion, Barnett made public an early version of the plan at an industry-sponsored forum in Washington. By June, the Union Pacific plan had been reduced to legislative lan- 1d printed in the exact -ssiccapactiiael form of a 52- page bill. It was headed; “Mr. ] introduced the ‘oHowing bill, which was read referred to the on f[ }].” ow, all that remained was o find the right Congressman o fill in the first blank. Probably the most helpful convert would have been Con- New York Times Magazine, November 3, 1974 er ee \fequipment to fathom the com plexities of a Penn Centra reorganization. Adams lis tened to Bamett’s presenta tion in his office and liked the idea of an “off-budget” lending agency. But he had also listened to _ literally dozens of other interested parties — trustees, truckers, bankers, unions. His objective was to write a bill of his own that would, in his phrase, “plagiarize the best elements of everyone else's bill.” In separate personal meet- ings, Barnett asked five of the nine members of the House Transportation and Aeronautics Subcommittee if they would introduce the Un- ion Pacific plan under their names. The first four, includ- ing Adams, said no. Just when it seemed that McDonald's handiwork might go to waste, the junior-most Republican on the subcommittee, Dick Shoup, agreed to be the spon- sor. Shoup, a second-termer whose Montana district is served by Union Pacific, has been asked more than once why he agreed to put his name to the bill. His answer is, ‘TI don't give a damn who wrote the bill if it will work.” Getting a bill through Con- gress is like trying to move a freightcar to Akron. It spends most of its time in switching terminals or mean- dering slowly over a creaky roadbed. If the cargo does not get fost or damaged along the way, it can still look quite different when it gets to the other end, From this perspec- tive, the Union Pacific bill appears to have chugged to- ward President Nixon’s desk at extraordinary speed. Along the route, the language was rewritten and some important baubles were affixed. But the central fixture in all versions of the bill was still McDon- ald’s idea of an off-budget fi- nancing vehicle (finally called the United States Rail Asso- ciation) that would nurture a new, unified Northeast rail- road (Conrail). The bill was moved by pres- sure and by accident. Shoup’s bill slipped out of the House Transportation and Aeronau- tics Subcommittee only by a fluke, Of the nine members, four were behind a bill draft- ed by Brock Adams, and four were backing a version prc- pared by the Nixon Adminis- tration. That left Shoup, the lowest-ranking member, with power to break the 4-4 tie. Fearing a deadlock, Adams decided on the spot that the Union Pacific bill was a pretty good vehicle for mark- up after all, and he promptly steered his four votes behind it. Henceforth, the Shoup bill came to be known as the Shoup-Adams bill. Adams, who is more of a pragmatist than many of his fellow tiberals in the House, had no qualms about getting behind a bill devised by the Union Pacific’s general coun- sel, since it was fairly close to his own bill and could be amended. Adams says his only justification for getting 1in- volved in the first place was his conviction that Penn Central provided ‘‘a vital pub- lic service,” which Judge Ful- lam might have shut down had his subcommittee not acted, The next difficulty was Senator Vance Hartke (Dem., Indiana), chairman of the Senate’s Surface Transporta- tion Subcommittee. Worried about the consequences in In- diana of massive abandon- ments of Penn Central tracks, Hartke had already pushed a bill of his own through the Senate Commerce Committee that would defer a Penn Cen- tral showdown for 12 months by providing interim subsi- dies. If the permanent solution was to be attempted in 1973, then the Hartke bill would have to be waylaid. | The task of killing a Sen- ate subcommittee chairman's bill after it has the endorse- ment of the full committee is to the lobbyist as a 500 pound clean-and-jerk is to a weight lifter. The deed was done, nevertheless, with a lobbyist named Charls Walker lifting most of the weight. Walker, who left the Nixon Administration six months earlier to start a lobbying firm a block from the White House, had been hired by Bethlehem Steel, Genera! Motors and eight other heavy shippers to work for a bill that would keep Penn Central running. Once the Shoup- Adams bill got moving in the House subcommittee, Walker decided to throw in behind it, thus becoming Union Pacific's ally. Over the August recess last year, Walker traced down at least 10 key Senators and pressed them by telephone to put a hold on the Hartke bill. Then, early in September, Walker paid a visit to Com- merce Committee Chairman Warren G. Magnuson (Dem., Washington) with the same request, making clear that a major corporation in his home state, Weyerhaeuser, was one of his clients on the matter. The next day Magnuson told Walker he would delay a Senate vote. on the Hartke bill until after the House had acted. Now that the initiative was on the House side of the Hill, the critical unknown was which way Representative Harley O. Staggers, the white- maned Commerce Committee chairman, would jump. That, in turn, depended on which way labor would jump. The unionists who run the big rail brotherhoods do not have the highest respect for the political sagacity of most railroad presidents. As Al Chesser, president of the To pass the bill, all the special in- terest groups leaned together. Nobody fought for the taxpayer. United Transportation Union, told some railroad execu- tives in 1972, ‘Your soft spot is Washington, D. C., be- cause that’s where you’ve got to go to get heip, and you don’t have the know-how to do it.” But when Chesser and Cc. L. Dennis, chief of the Brotherhood of Airline and Railway Clerks (BRAC), heard Barnett outline the de- tails of the Union Pacific plan, they sighted a break- through on the issue of labor protection. Traditionally, this cost of featherbedding- through-attrition has been absorbed by the = surviving partner in a railroad merger, but in 1973 the problem was new: Who would pay for the labor protective costs of merging seven railroads that had no profits? Barnett’s an- swer was simply that the U.S. Treasury would pay. t did not take leng for a team of railroad and un- ion presidents to negoti- ate the details of a labor protection agreement they could live with, so long as the Government would write the checks. Essentially, it provided that the Government would pay each unneeded worker a monthly allowance equal to his base pay, plus his average overtime, until he was given another railroad job of equal classification elsewhere in the Conrail system. Chesser and Dennis liked the details of the labor protective clause so much that they induced their long-time ally, Chairman Stag- gers, to offer them in toto as an amendment to the Shoup- Adams bill during a commit- tee markup session. Once im- bedded into the bill, the labor language was regarded by the brotherhoods as sacrosanct, and the whole Shoup-Adams bill was regarded as a labor must. The bill cleared the House 306-82, although then- Congressman Gerald Ford of Michigan voted against it. With labor, the railroad in- dustry and the shippers on board, the last big question was what the Northeast rail bill was going to cost. For Congress, that turned out to be a baffling exercise, more akin to Wall Street venture capitalism than to the ordi- nary Congressional funding process. The problem was to judge how much Government financing it would take so that the new, untried Conrail could avoid going bankrupt a few years later. At such times of complex- ity, Congressional committees tend to rely on technicians in the Administration for the answer. This time, when they called downtown there was vagueness and reticence on the other end of the phone. “I don't know how many times I asked the Department of Transportation for a pro forma statement of earnings of the new corporation,” complained Representative Adams. As a result, the only feasibility study the drafters could get their hands on was a slick document sent to them by the First National City Bank. The thrust of the Citi- bank analysis was that the House version of the Dill, which had a_ $1.4-billion price tag, was underfunded. For the new corporation to succeed, the study suggested, the new rail corporation needed an infusion of $500- million in “equity type capi- tal” and an extra $560-mil- Jion of ‘‘up front’ interim subsidy money.” John W. Ingraham, the Citibank vice president who prepared the study, made at least six trips to Washington as the bill was evolving. “I told a number of Congressmen,” he recalls, “that you have got to slide some bottom-line money into that new corporation, or it won't fly.” As the Congressional com- mittees well knew, Citibank was scarcely a disinterested party, since Ingraham heads the task force within the bank that is trying to recover $300- million in loans that various New York banks extended to Penn Central before the bank- ruptcy. However, Senator Hartke and others who had a hand in writing the bill called Citibank’s effort a “fair anal- ysis.” When the House and Senate conferees finished working over the bill in De- cember, 1973, it was no co- incidence that the add-ons te the House version bore a close resemblance to the changes suggested by Citibank. The Northeast rail bill was New York Times Magazine, November 3, 1974 (continued) \fnot what President Nixon wanted when he told his Treasury Secretary 10 months earlier, “George, I want a private, free-enterprise solu- tion to come out of this.’’ Dut he signed it on Jan. 2, 1974. Even at this distance, it is hard to know where the Shoup-Adams Act will lead. There seem at the moment to be four main possibilities: «8 Conrail could itself go bankrupt in a few years, lead- ing toward full nationaliza- tion of the Northeast rail- roads, (2) Conrail could make such a profit from its pared- down rail system that the railroad would revert to pri- vate control, amid compiaints that the taxpayers had heen bamboozled, (3) Conrail could somehow be killed before getting started by litigation or further Congressional ac- tion, (4) Conrail could be re- quired by political exigencies to operate a larger-than-neces- sary rail system, or to form itself into several smaller and less efficient Conrails, with the result that the Eastern sys- tem would make only enough money to Hmp along perma- nently in its present state of seminationalization. The final possibility seems likeliest, par- ticularly now that the Gov- ern.ent planners at the United States Railway Asso- ciation have formally decided to study the option of split- ting Conrail into several pieces. (One serious pian, it now develops, is to unravel the 1968 Penn Central merger so there could be one Conrail made up of the old New York Central Hines competing? with another Conrail consisting of the old Pennsylvania Railroad trackage.) Although the eventual out- come is unpredictable, a few conclusions stand aut even now. This was, to state the most obvious point, a hell of a way to run a Government. Any- thing as important as partial railroad nationalization should not slip into the law books simply because some special- interest lobbyists promoted it. Any such proposal should have been vetted in full pub- lic hearings by experts be- holden to the public. In fact, although some _ generalized hearings were held, there was no impartial review in Con- gress to determine if the Penn Central really was about to run out of money. or if the Administration’s proposed “De Novo” railroad could be financed withcut Government ibsidies. or if the Penn Cen- Continued from Page I tral estate was indeed being eroded, as the creditors were complaining. Some of the re- sponsibility for all this must fall on the Nixon Administra- tion. Throughout the markup of the Shoup-Adams bill, Con- gress would have relied less on the expertise of special- interest lobbyists if the Ad- ministration had encouraged its experts in the Department of Transportation to partici- pate openly and fully in the Eill’s drafting process. Unfor- tunately, Congress is not yet equipped to analyze complex technical and economic issues on its’own. Confronted by a new problem, most Congress- men are pretty good at weigh- ing the competing arguments thrown up by the special-i terest lobbyists, the public terest groups, and the Admin- istration. What happened on the Shoup-Adams bill was that all the special-interest groups leaned in the same direction, and very little counterpres- sure was exerted on behalf of the taxpaying public, Another plain conciusion is that the Northeast rail bill is foing to cost a lot of money. As finatly enacted, it contains $2.17-bittion——$665-million in authorizations for direct Treasury spending plus an- other $1,.5-billion in ‘“off- budget” loans and loan guar- antces. If the creditors have anything to say about it, this will not be the end. Already, three groups of Penn Central creditors have filed suits charging that the pro- cedure inserted by the House- Senate conferees to transfer their assets to Conrail is an unconstitutional seizure of their property. Their arpu- ments have prevailed over Government objections in the lower courts, and the Supreme Court ig expected to rule. on the case in January, Mean- white, however, a special three-judge Federal court headed by Judge Henry Jf. Friendly has held the Shoup- Adams Act constitutional in a separate proceding, inasmuch- as it tacitly allows credilors to sue the Government in the Court of Claims if the Conrail securities they receive for their rail assets should turn out to be worth too Hittie. Since estimates of the value of Penn Central rail assets range from $2-billion to $14- billion, and since Conrail’s suc- cess is chancy, it could be 10 or 20 years before all the Penn Central bankruptcy claims are fully litigated. Thus, if the Court of Claims should ulti- mately rule that the creditors are entitled to an extra billian or two from the Treasury, Congressmen will have to face a tough vote on whether to approve the appropriation —perhaps in fiscal year 1987 or so. The last conclusion cuts against the grain of the other two: While the Shoup-Adams Act may not have been the best and cheapest answer, it was at least an answer. If nothing had happened in Con- gress last year, Judge Fullam might weil have signed an order by now allowing the Penn Central trustees to shut down all or parts of the rail- road. If so, Congress would have certainly agreed to some form “of emergency loan to keep Penn Central running temporarily. The Penn Cen- tral is too big to be junked. And even if there were enough trucks to replace every freight train, it would be irresponsible to encourage a substitution. In an era of energy shortages, it is worth Tremembcring that it takes four times as much fuel to move a ton of freight by truck as it does by railroad. But while we need some railroads, we don’t need our whole decaying network of duplicating, obsolete tracks. much of it lightly used. There is something obviously  in- efficient when there are 3,000 ways to route a freight ship- ment between Washington, D. C., and St. Louis. Incred- ibly, an average freight car in the Northeast travels but 41 miles a day, By all legic, the cure should Jie in stitching together and upgrading the more heavily used lines of the seven bankrupts into one unified transportation system. The Shoup-Adams Act aims in this direction. So this is what we see at the end of the last tunnel: We have gone in the right gen- eral direction for the wrong reasons behind a locomotive labeled Special Interest So- cialism. It was a high price for progress. New York Times Magazine, November 3, 1974 (continued)"

        "ocr_text": "The pact of two Henrys How the deal to buy Jews from Russia grew from a moral impulse into the unwanted policy of two superpowers By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON. The exchange of letters was not particularly eloquent, nor was it especially cordial. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger closed his letter with a curt “Best regards.”” The response from Senator Henry M. Jackson was signed with an even less amiable ‘‘Sincerely yours.” The letters were made public with about as much White House fanfare as the reopening of a Navy base in Seattle. Yet this exchange, completed in the Oval Office last Oct. 18, amounted to a historic diplomatic bargain, one with extraordinary implications for détente between Washington and Moscow, fer the American economy, for Presidential politics and, far from least important, for the lives of Soviet Jews. As a result of the two letters, Congress has approved a new Administration-backed trade bill that, among other things, will allow the Adminis- tration to confer nondiscriminatory tariff treatment —most-favored-nation status—on the Soviet Union. The Jackson-Kissinger letters also opened the way for the Administration to extend $300-million in new credits, a lower level than the Soviets had wished, to finance U.S. exports to Russia. In ex- change, Congress received a set of detailed assur- ances from Kissinger, based on his talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, that Soviet citi- zens who apply to leave their country will get increasing numbers of exit visas without harass- ment. The Pact of Two Henrys, as it may one day be called, does not contain a formal government-to- government guarantee that any specific number of Russians will be allowed to emigrate. Rather, it is an agreement to extend the trade benefits to Moscow for an 18-month trial period, with the understanding between Senator Jackson and Presi- dent Ford that the concessions will be cut off by Congress in mid-1976 if fewer than 60,000 Russians a year have been allowed to leave. Congress will have further chances to terminate the Russian trade benefits in 1977, 1978 and every year there- after. Eight days after the letters were signed, Gromyko made a point of vehemently denying in a secret note to Kissinger that he had given any “assurances” whatsover—only “elucidations’” of Joseph Albright is Washington correspondent for The San Francisco Chronicle and a frequent con- tributor to this Magazine. we existing Soviet laws, as he put it. Gromyko also denied that his Government anticipated any in- crease in emigration, insisting that he had told Kissinger ail along that the number of visa-seek- ers was declining. This protest now appears to have been a flank- covering operation by Gromyko, for Soviet party Chairman Leonid Brezhnev is understood to have reconfirmed the original understandings in the Kissinger letter during his Vladivostok. summit meeting with President Ford in late November. Consequently, when Kissinger returned from Vladivostok to appear before a Senate committee, he stood behind the original wording of his letter to Jackson, not even mentioning the Gromyko protest. For nearly three weeks, the Soviets said nothing. Then, following a meeting of the Com- munist party Central Committee in mid-December, the mews agency Tass startled Washington by publishing the secret Gromyko protest in its original form, along with a statement that “‘lead- ing circles’? in the Soviet Union “flatly reject as unacceptable” any attempts to attach conditions on reductions in tariffs. After hurriedly reading the text, Jackson took the optimistic view that this was a face-saving device. Figuring that the original assurances would hold regardless of what the Russians said for domestic consumption, or to stay on the good side of the Arabs, Jackson and his allies in Congress decided to let the trade bill pass despite the Tass statement. In any case, the Soviet Union’s true understand- ing of the deal will be revealed in emigration figures in coming months, and the Soviet statement had done little to alter its basic meaning: For the rest of this decade at least, the state of U.S.-Sovier relations will be linked to the Russian Politburo’s willingness to risk an open-door policy on emigra- tion, particularly toward the dissident Soviet Jewish minority. That is a linkage that Kissinger, the two U.S. Presidents he has served, and the entire ruling hierarchy of the Soviet Union had hoped mightily to avoid. The story of how they were all muscled and maneuvered into accepting such an agreement against their wishes has to stand as a classic Washington power puzzle, An unusual alliance—the conviction of Senator Jackson that the Russians would back down, the harsh ideology of George Meany, the guilt of American Jewish leaders over escaping the holo- caust and living now in freedom—played a part in the two years of negotiations that led to the final agreement. Yet at the last moment, a side deal may have been necessary in order to get final action on the bill. It was reported that Senator Russell Long, floor manager for the trade bill, agreed to bring it to a vote only after obtaining a commitment from President Ford that he would not actively oppose Congressional passage of a cargo-preference bill favoring the U.S. shipping in- dustry. And so in the end the story of the trade bill conveys a sense that some things happen simply because a variety of minor pressures, bizarre tactics _and personal ambitions chance to move together at the same time, without any concerted design. ver since the Moscow summit meeting be- tween Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in May, 1972, it has been American foreign policy to encourage more trade with the U.S.S.R.—not so much for economic reasons as to promote political and military détente. Nixon announced at the summit that the U.S. would soon begin negotiations with Moscow on a reciprocal trade agreement, which was to include most-favored-nation treatment. Obtaining most- favored-nation treatment was a matter of some symbolic pride for Brezhnev, but there was more than pride at stake. Ever since the cold-war era. the United States had maintained two sets of tariffs. For goods imported from the Soviet Union and 11 other Communist countries, there were punitively high tariffs. But all the other 130-odd countries in the world, even South Africa and Syria, automatically enjoyed the benefits of most- favored-nation status. This meant the tariffs on their goods were and still are much lower. For instance, caviar from Russia Carries a tariff of 30 per cent while the tariff on Turkish caviar is 15 per cent. Since the U.S. had already granted most-favored-nation status ito two Communist countries, Poland and Yugoslavia, the U.S.S.R. felt snubbed by not having it too. Beyond the symbolism, however, the Soviets wanted to offset Russian purchases from American manufacturers by selling~ their vodka, watches, machine tools, cameras, bicycles and perhaps even cars and airplanes. When the Soviet Union does obtain most-favored-nation status, the duty on its airplanes will drop from 30 per cent to 5 per cent, and suddenly its Yak-40 jets may become competitive with American-built executive jets. Two months after the Moscow summit meetin the Soviet Union chose to institut ibitiee ! € a prohibitive tax on emigrants, supposedly to repay the state for the education they had received before de- parture. The obvious targets were the Jews who had been leaving Russia for Israel in growing num- New York Times Magazine, January 5, 1975 \f At Lod Airport, an Israeli greets his sister, just arrived from the Soviet Union. Despite last-minute uncertainties, the new trade bill means that U.S- Soviet relations have been linked to the Politburo’s attitude towards emigration. bers since 1970, with the unofficial help of Israeli authorities. Jewish communities in America and elsewhere saw the education tax as a particularly obnoxious form of intimidation. For many, the notion ‘of Jews having to pay from $5,000 to $25,000 to escape a land of persecution obviously summoned up visions of their parents’ generation. It is not surprising that the Soviet policy shouid have led to moral outrage among American Jews, and to calls for U.S. retaliation. What is extraor- dinary is that the moral position of an ethnic minority representing 3 per cent of the American population could eventually force another country to reverse its internal police policies — especially when the other country is the Soviet Union. The instrument that forced the connection be tween trade and emigration was an amendment to the trade bill pressed for the last two years by Jackson, along with Senators Jacob Javits, Republi- can of New York, and Abraham Ribicoff, Demo- crat of Connecticut, and Representative Charles A. Vanik, Democrat of Ohio. Of the dozens of pressure groups that helped influence the United States Government toward adopting the Jackson amendment, the one that probably mattered most was a small, informal steering committee that has never been publicized. This steering committee, identified as ‘‘the Washington group” in a privately circulated memo written by one of its members last year, was unusual among Washington lobby groups: It included both Congressional aides and lobbyists for an outside pressure group, in this case, a committee dedicated to assisting Jews in Russia. The principal members of the Washington group, it is understood from several of them, were Rich- ard Perle, Dorothy Fosdick and Tina Silber of Senator Jackson’s Senate Permanent Subcommit- tee on Investigations staff; Morris J. Amitay, legisla- tive assistant to Senator Ribicoff, Mark Talisman, administrative assistant to Congressman Vanik, June Silver Rogul, who ran the Washingion office of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, and Elihu Bergman, who served as a consultant to it. Amitay, a former Foreign Service officer and one-time student of -Kissinger’s at Harvard, was recently quoted in Stephen D. Isaacs’ book “Jews in American Politics’ as saying of the Jackson amendment and of iegislation to rearm Israel: “There are now a lot of guys at the working levei up here who happen to be Jewish, who are willing to make a little bit of extra effort and to look at certain issues in terms of their Jewishness, and this is what has made this thing go very effectively in the last couple of years. These are ali guys who are in a position to make (Continued on Page 20) The New York Times Magazine/January 5, 1975 I7 \fContinued from Page 17 the decisions in these areas for these Senators, You don't need that many to get some- thing done in the Senate. All you need is a certain com- mitment; ... you can get an awful Jot done just at the staff level.” However, others in the Washington group reject the notion that they participated to fulfill personal ethnic goals. The amendment that carries Jackson’s name did not spring full-blown from his broad brow on Oct. 4, 1972, the day he introduced it. Senator Jay- its had publicly spoken of linking trade to emigration, and Senator Ribicoff had done the same on the Senate floor in a speech written by his aide Amitay. But it was Jackson, through Perle, who put the idea into the form of an amendment and ran with it. Jackson traces his personal feeling about Jewish persecu- tion back to 1945, when as a young Congressman he tray- eled to Germany and visited Buchenwald shortly after it was liberated. And, he points out to visitors, if Norway had had an emigration tax similar to Russia’s a generation ago, his own parents would not have been able to emigrate from Norway to the’ United States. Yet these elements were only part of Jackson’s chemistry. There were at least half a dozen other Senators whose sentiments about the Soviet emigration tax were just as.deep. The difference wes that the others, mostly liberal Democrats, were in- clined to shun all approaches toward the Kremlin that seemed cold - warish and hard-line. To all of them but Jackson, Kissinger-style dé- tente seemed to be worth a longer trial. The National Con- ference on Soviet Jewry—an umbrella organization that included B’nai B'rith, the American Jewish Commit- tee, 32 other national Jewish organizations and at least 200 local Jewish agencies—gave Jackson a forum for announc- ing his amendment. At a Washington meeting of 120 Jewish leaders called by the National Conference on Sept. 26, 1972, Jackson waxed emo- tional. “The time has come to place our highest human ‘values ahead of the trade dol- lar,” he told the gathering. “You know what you can do? I'll give you some marching orders. Get behind my amend- ment. And let's stand firm!” Both Javits and Senator Hubert Humphrey had sent representatives to the meet- ing to advocate less drastic tactics, but their demurrers were brushed aside. That day the plenum of the National Conference endorsed the Jackson amendment, and a camgaign began to elicit pro- Jackson amendment calls and letters to every Senator from Jews in their home states. This did not sit well with Javits, Senator Stuart Sy- mington and the six or eight other Senators whose names had regularly appeared on ev- ery pro-Israel letter and reso- lution in the nineteen-sixties, before Jackson had moved out in front on such issues. The result was that Javits interposed a series of objec- tions when Jackson and Ribi- coff began seeking backers for their amendment. Javits agonized about what the amendment would do to East- ‘West trade prospects, and his stature on Jewish issues was sufficient to discourage a number of liberal Senators in both parties from joining as co-sponsors. “It took me a little while to persuade myself it was necessary,” he said re- cently. However, when Jack- son’s list of co-sponsors reached 51, he telephoned Javits to say he was about to take the amendment to the Senate floor. Shortly there- after, on the strength of hav- ing achieved some slight changes in the Jackson draft, Javits agreed to join Jackson and Ribicoff as a principal co-sponsor. Javits brought along a batch of other Sena- tors including the absent liberals. Meanwhile, according to Jackson aides, Jackson had secretly seen Nixon at the White House and persuaded him that the way to keep the Jewish emigration issue out of the 1972 election campaign was to permit certain con- servative Republicans, like Senator Strom Thurmond, to join as co-sponsors. By the time the amendment was formally introduced on Oct. 4, 76 Senators had signed en. Under its wording, no Communist country that denied its citizens the oppor- tunity to emigrate, through an emigration tax or other means, would be eligible to receive most-favored-nation _ status. To make it even stronger, Jackson had added another provision prohibiting U.S. credits to finance exports to Communist countries that de- nied their citizens the oppor- tunity to emigrate. Bloodier engagements over the Jackson amendment were to occur in the House of Representatives, starting after Congress reconvened in Jan- uary. Nixon, then at the height of his power, was about to send up an omnibus trade bill that would grant him the authority to negotiate changes in American tariff barriers with Europe and Ja- pan, something the Adminis- tration regarded as a “must.” Having agreed the previous year at the summit that Rus- sia should be added to the list of countries enjoying most- favored-nation treatment, Nixon now had to persuade ~ Congress to permit it. Fortu- nately for Jackson, White House assistant Peter Flani- gan decided to put most-fa- vored-nation status for Russia into one neat package with the rest of the trade provi- sions. This would be the legis- lative vehicle to which Jack- son would attempt to add his emigration rider. Jackson's chief ally in the House was to be Congressman Vanik. Because Vanik was a member of the Ways and Means Committee and had a record of supporting East- West trade, he was a logical partner. But Vanik needed no persuading from Jackson on the emigration-tax issue. His own grandparents had emi- grated from Czechoslovakia, and his Cuyahoga County con- stituency was laced with a mixture of ethnics, including many of Russian or Eastern European background. In the previous Congress, Vanik had reacted to the emi- gration tax by introducing a bill identical to the Jackson amendment, but with fewer co-sponsors, Now, in January, before the White House real- ized what was happening, Vanik’s administrative assist- ant, Mark Talisman, began a morning -to-night round of telephone calls to all 435 Congressional offices, invit- ing each member to be listed as co-sponsoring the same language in the new session. He called some offices as many as 15 times. A simul- taneous grass-roots campaign organized by the National Conference on Soviet Jewry began producing a steady har- vest of constituent mail, even to Congressmen who had few ewish constituents, The mail increased following a Jan. L& letter to about 1,000 Jewish leaders across the country from a close associate of the ashington group, I. L. Ken- en, executive vice-chairman of he American Israel Public Af- airs Committee, which is reg- stered to lobby for Israel. Others agreed to co-sponsor he Jackson-Vanik provisions ecause they wanted to pre- ent most - favored - nation atus for the Soviet Union on ideological grounds, or to kill the Nixon Administra- tion’s trade bill, which was designed to bring about a worldwide negotiated reduc- tion of tariff barriers. No one wanted to kill the trade bill more than George Meany of the A.F.L.-C.LO, The labor movement had general- ly been for free trade from the days of Cordell Hull. But the policy at Meany’s headquar. ters became more and more protectionist in the late nine- teen-sixties as textile, gar- ment, steel and other member unions began hurting from jobs lost to low-wage foreign competition. Even if there had not been an over-all trade bill under consideration, Meany said, he would — stili have fought against allowing - most-fa- vored-nation treatment and credits to the Soviet Union. “I trace my anti- Communism back to the nineteen-twenties, when the Communists made a determined effort to take over our labor movement,” he ex- plained. For him, détente was not only “funny business,” but “appeasement to dicta- tors.” At the other end of the polit- ical scale, there were conser- vative Republicans like Con- gressmen Ben B. Blackburn of Georgia and Barry Goldwater Jr. of California, who were at- tracted to the Jackson-Vanik amendment because they shared Meany’s suspicion of ~Russian motives and_per- ceived that the best way of preventing United — States trade concessions altogether was to tie them to the issue of Jewish emigration. At the same time, some Christian leaders and such non-Jewish ethnic groups as the Lithua- nians and Latvians were drawn into the coalition be- cause the amendment had been written to encourage free emigration for all appli- cants, without mentioning the Jews. It was only after Vanik in- troduced the House version of the Jackson amendment on Feb. 7, with 259 co-sponsors {the number later rose to 289) that the White House—and Moscow—began to take coun- termeasures. The most wor- risome signal was that Wilbur Mills, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which would handle the trade bill, had agreed to add his name to the list of co-sponsors as soon as he saw Vanik had a majori- ty of the House on his side. The main channel of nego- tiation was between Kissin- ger and Anatoly Doobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador to Washington. But this was not the only channel. Charles W. Colson, still rid- ing high as a White House lawyer, was dispatched to Russia in late February, os- tensibly to negotiate about of- fice space for American com- panies in Moscow. One of his missions, it turns out, was to tell Vasily V. Kuznetsov, Dep- uty Foreign Minister, that the Soviet emigration tax really was imperiling most- favored-nation status. Shortly thereafter, Vladimir S. Alkhimov, Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, paid a visit to Congressman Mills during a Soviet trade mission to Washington. Mills told the Russian that if the emigration tax remained in force; at least 350 Congress- men would vote to block most-favored-nation status. But if the emigration tax were dropped, said Mills, he would personally use his best efforts to see that the Administra- tion’s trade bill was passed . as a “clean bill” —that is with- out the Jackson-Vanik rider. Nixon, taking a respite from three weeks of troubles caused by James McCord's celebrated letter to Judge John Sirica, invited Jackson to the White House on April 18. With some elation ihe Pres- * ident said he had received two communications from “Soviet leaders,” on March 16 and April 10, suggesting that the emigration tax had been sus- pended. Nixon’s message to the Senator was that since Russia had made a great step forward, there was no longer any reason to block the trade bill. Jackson was now confront- ed with a much tougher calcu- lation, Pro-trade bill lobbyists, led by Flanigan, were trying every angle to make him soften his position. Word reached him through the staff of another Senator that the Russians might be willing to sign a hefty contract to buy Boeing wide-bodied aircraft, thus creating much-needed jobs in Seattle, if Jackson would- drop his amendment. There were even indirect hints that the Soviets might in- crease the size of their pavil- ion at Spokane’s Expo ’74 exposition if Jackson would see the light. Other ap- proaches came from business- men interested in the trade bill who had contributed to past Democratic campaigns, for it was already assumed— correctly—that Jackson had aspirations for 1976. Yet if he had wanted to drop his amendment, there would have been a cost—not only among Jews who were passionately committed to it, but at A-F.L.- C.1.0. headquarters, where the amendment served a separate purpose. As for the merits of the issue, the six months that had passed since the introduction of his amendment had given Jackson even more reason to be skeptical of the benefits of expanded trade with Rus- sia. Already his Senate Per- manent Subcommittee on Investigations was zeroing in on the 1972 Russian grain deal and getting leads on other United States-Soviet trade ventures that sounded dubi- ous to Jackson, such as a multibillion-dollar natural gas project in Siberia, Whatever went through his mind, Jackson made his deci- sion on the spot when Nixon suggested the amendment was no longer necessary because of his personal diplomacy. Jackson's reply to Nixon, ac- cording to one Jackson aide, was: “Mr. President, if you believe that, you're being hoodwinked.” Later that day, Jackson announced he was “standing firm’ behind his amendment. The question was whether the co-sponsors would stand with him. Wilbur Mills, for one, broke rank, but under pressure from other co-spon- sors, and after a visit from an old New York friend, retired shoe executive David Her- mann, who had been primed by members of the Washing- ton group, he fell back in line. bout this time, the White House tried a new tactic: attempt- ing to split the Jew- ish community away from Jackson. The President invited 15 prominent Jews to discuss Soviet emigration policies with him on April 19. Max Fisher, a Jewish civic leader from De- troit who contributed heav- ily to Nixon’s re-election, herded the list of invitees, along with Jacob Stein, chair- man of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and Charlotte Jacobson,  vice- chairman of the National Con- ference on Soviet Jewry. No member of the Washington group was present. Nixon. who had his own credentials on the Soviet Jew- ry issue going back to 1959, did not disagree with any of the objectives of the amend- ment. but he told his visitors that Jackson was a “hawk” and that Brezhnev would never bow to public pressure. He also assured them ‘con- fidentially that because the emigration tax had been sus- New York Times Magazine, January 5, 1975 (continued) \f pended, the rate of emigration would continue at 32,000 to 35,000 a year, a dramatic in- crease over the past. Returning to Fisher’s Wash- ington office, spokesmen for the group got out a statement lauding the President’s suc- cess in obtaining the suspen- sion of the emigration tax. But the text said nothing about the Jackson amend- ment—an omission the press and various Congressional co- sponsors were quick to note. Overnight, the unity of Jewish leadership around the amendment seemed to be in question. Over the next 10 days, the Jewish leaders whe had gone to the White House sought to delay a new state- ment on the Jackson amend- ment, but they quickly began to lose their followers. The Greater New York Conference on Soviet Jewry, after an ur- Nixon said his diplomacy had made the amend- ment unnecessary. ‘If you believe that,’ said Jack- son, you're being hoodwinked.’ gent telephone-call from Perle, moved out in front of its national parent body and re- affirmed its endorsement of the Jackson-Vanik language. Then, when the Conference of Presidents met on April 30 to hear a report on the Nixon meeting, Stein was met with a minor insurrection when he moved to adjourn before a public declaration on the amendment could be consid- ered. In the end, to the dis- tress of the White House, a new statement of support for the amendment appeared un- der the signatures of Richard Maass, chairman of the Na- tional Conference, as well as Stein and Fisher. That meant the House Ways and Means Committee would have no choice but to take on the emigration issue when it began its mark-up sessions on - the trade bill in September. Tactically, this was the time for businessmen backing the whole trade bill, as well as those wanting expanded trade with Russia, to use their max- imum leverage to kill the amendment in committee. Don- New York Times Magazine, January 5, 1975 (continued) ald M. Kendall, chairman of PepsiCo, Inc. — who had signed an agreement to sell Pepsi-Cola in Russia in exchange for Russian vodka that it would market here— took charge of the lobbying. In mid-September Kendall dis- patched a telegram to 65 chief executives of big multination- al corporations and banks who had served with him as members of the Emergency Ccmmittee on American Trade, a free-trade lobby group set up during the John- son Administration. The tele- gram urged them to lean on the Ways and Means Com- mittee to bury the Jackson- Vanik language in committee. What Kendall and his asso- ciates did not know was that they had a sort of double agent in some of their plan- ning sessions—a person get- ‘ting paid to lobby for the trade bill who was also, as an individual, sympathetic to the Jackson amendment. Before the Kendall telegram was even sent, this person went home with a copy of the text in his pocket and straighta- way telephoned Amitav in Ri- bicoffs office. Amitay, a member of the Washington group, auickly leaked it to The Washington Post, which ran the story on page one un- der the headline: \"Big Firms - to Press Hill On Soviet Trade Benefit.” Kendall's telegram in fact, did draw some mail to Ways and Means Committee members, but the effect had been sandbagged by publicity. Even so, a lot of House members privately agreed with a remark of Kendall's: “I think Jackson is running for President in 1976, and his amendment is simply de- signed to help Meany kill the trede bill.” For those whe wanted the trade bill to pass despite Meany’s opposition, the obvious solution was ¢ “ccmpromise” amendment drafted by a Ways and Means Committee staff aide, under which trade concessions to Russia would be made contin- gent on “reasonable progress” concerning human rights and emigration. But it would have an escape clause, in that the President was to judge whe- ther the Russians had indeed made “reasonable progress.” Jackson and Vanik wanted no such language without more concessions from the Rus- sians, Thus when Congress- men James Corman, Democrat of California, and Jerry L. Pet- tis, Republican of California, laid the “compromise” on the table at a mid-September meeting of the Ways and Means Committee, a member of the Washington p learned of it and immediately telephoned the troops in the Soviet Jewry movement in Southern California for help. “That very night, until 2 A.M. I was getting phone calls at home from good friends of mine who very irately wanted to know why I was selling out the Jewish cause,” recalls Corman with distaste. He dropped the proposed amend- ment the next day. At least half of the Ways and Means Committee would have preferred to slap down the pesky Jackson-Vanik amendment before the trade bill reached the floor, but they did not dare. Opponents did succeed in weakening the orig- inal wording by eliminating all restrictions on the Admin- istration’s power to grant credits to the U.S.S.R. But by veice vote, the other half of the original amendment, linking most-favored-nation status to emigration policies in Communist countries was attached to the Administra- tion trade bill shortly before the committee reported it out in early October. It then seemed unstoppable in the House. Che Arabs’ Yom Kippur in- vasion on Oct, 6 nearly sank the Jackson amendment as well as Israel. For a time, it appeared that American Jew- ish organizations would have to choose between Soviet Jewish emigration and Israel's survival. With the fighting going on, the highest priority in Washington for most of them was getting the Nixon Administration to send Phan- tom jets and M-60 tanks to resupply the Israeli Army. Some American Jewish leaders sought guidance dur- ing those weeks from Israel’s Ambassador to Washington Simcha Dinitz and came away with the impression that the Israeli Government did not wish to see anything, in- cluding the amendment, stand in the way of more weapons. However, other American Jewish leaders who had direct contact with Israeli Premier Golda Meir’s office, could detect no lessening of interest in measures to help Soviet Jewry. Up to then, Peter Flanigan had been in charge of the . White House lobbying against the Jackson amendment, but now Kissinger began to take over. He saw the amendment as an impediment to his abili- ty to negotiate a Middle East peace. On Oct. 23, White House aide Leonard Garment, Nixon’s staff liaison with the Jewish community, invited Jacob Stein, Max  Fish- er_and Richard Maass for a meeting two days later with Gen. Alexander Haig to dis- cuss the cease-fire, which was then breaking down. Kissin- ger, having flown back from seeing Brezhnev in Moscow, replaced Haig at the last moment on the 25th and gave Stein, Fisher and Maass a very troubling report on what was happening. Although Kissin- ger didn’t go into details, it is now known that on the previ- ous evening, Brezhnev had sent Nixon a bellicose warn- ing, implying he might send Soviet troops to the Middle East to stop Israeli truce viola- tions. Kissinger told the Jew- ish leaders, according to the diary of one participant, that the restraint of Soviet leaders was important in the Middle East, “No matter how much the United States and Israel desire it, if the Russians were actively opposed, there would be no peace,” Kissinger said. * Therefore, he added, this was no time to put restrictive pro- visions in the trade bill. Kis- singer then inquired, accord- ing to another source, whe- ther the Jewish leaders would condemn Jackson and Vanik if they dropped their amend- ment on the House floor but kept it active in the Senate for later consideration, Kissinger also is reported to have led them to believe that the Ad- ministration would extend no new loans or credits to Mos- cow until the Senate took up the trade bill the following year, if the House would only Pass the trade bill unamended. For Fisher, and for the oth- ers to a lesser extent, the Kis- singer approach made sense, and tentative plans were made to suggest to Jackson that a showdown in the House. be avoided. However, when Maass sought guidance from the executive committee of the National Conference, the result was an emergency meeting of its officers at which he was instructed to Bive Jackson a neutral ac- count of Kissinger’s remarks and under no circumstances to ask that the amendment be delayed. The meeting in Jackson's office on Nov. 5, 1973, was the turning point in the long road to the Pact of the Two Henrys 11 months later. There have been numerous false ru- mors about this meeting, among them the widespread belief in the executive branch that Jackson angrily denounced the Jewish leaders and threw them out of his of- fice. It is true that Jack- son, tipped off that at least some Jewish leaders were leaning toward the Fish- er approach, had expanded the invitation list for the meeting to include some known sup- porters of his amendment, including Senator  Ribicoff, David Blumberg, president of B'nai B'rith, and all the members of the Washington group. According to a set of de- tailed notes taken at the time, Maass began by recounting what Kissinger said on Oct. 25. Stein added that “it is im- portant to the Jewish leader- ship if Kissinger tells us his negotiating position would be strengthened” by a delay on the amendment. At another point in the meeting, the notes show Stein remarking that Jewish leaders had to be con- cerned whether passage of the amendment would hurt Jews still in Russia, adding that ‘it is a gamble” whether the amendment would reduce Kis- singer's leverage with the Russians regarding the Middle East. Jackson replied that he couldn’t give Steir a written guarantee that there were no risks in sticking with his Jackson learned that the Russians might put in an order for Boeing jets, creating jobs in Seattle, if he would drop his amendment. amendment, but it was “naive” to think that dropping it would bring about a secure Israel. “If we back down now,” said Jackson, ‘‘the So- viets will take advantage of it.” Speaking to the Jewish leaders as a group, Jackson said: “The Administration is always using you. The only way to get Soviet Jews out of the Soviet Union is to stand firm on the Jackson-Vanik amendment.” The meeting . ended with Jackson, Ribicoff and Talisman (speaking for Vanik, who was out of town) | telling the Jewish leaders un- equivocally that they would press to have the amendment passed in both the House and Senate. Stein and Maass left the meeting saying they had to catch a plane back to New York. But on their way to the airport they stopped at the White House to see Peter Flanigan and Helmut Sonnen- feldt, a Kissinger aide, who were waiting to hear what \fhad happened. What they re- ported was that the Jewish leadership was sticking  be- hind the Jackson amendment not only in the Senate but in the House. And from then on, the leadership support did not waiver again. On Dec. 11, the House of Representatives got around to passing the trade bill by a heavy majority. The full House strengthened the lan- guage by restoring the pro- hibition on extending credits to the U.S.S.R. that had been in Jackson’s original version. Vanik’s motion to restore this provision passed the House 319-80. The fight now had to be fought in the Senate, which was Jackson's home territory. Everything seemed to be going for him: His amendment had passed the House, he now had 79 co-sponsors in the Sen- ate, and Nixon faced impeach- ment. But below the surface, things were not so simple. Un- til now, he had served his friend George Meany as well as Soviet Jewry by refusing to compromise. But now, just as he was about to start his pre- Presidential campaign, their interests were diverging. Aside from this long-range worry, Jackson could see im- mediate signs that his careful- ly gathered coalition of liberal and conservative Senators was in danger of unraveling. As one Senate aide put it, “We didn’t want to see Jackson get a lovely campaign issue by killing the trade bill, and then not one Jew would get out of Russia.” There are two versions of how Jackson and Kissinger began talking about a com- promise in the spring of 1974. Among some sources, who have less than total admira- tion for Jackson, it is said that last winter Javits held a private meeting with Kis- singer at the State Depart- ment and told him he could never defeat Jackson in a head-on battle. But, suggested Javits, if Kissinger would really work on the emigration issue with the Russians, he (Javits) would guarantee that the Senate would respond favorably. Javits is de- scribed as having passed the word from his staff through the staffs of liberal Demo- crats to Jackson’s staff that if Jackson did not bargain in good faith with Kissinger, then Javits might lead a breakaway group in intro- ducing a substitute emigra- tion amendment, Not so, according to Jack- son’s people, who maintain they never even heard of a possible Javits substitute. Their version, which is backed up memos, intended to trade negotiator Eberle last Jan. 29, and put out a feeler: If the Soviet Union would give specific as- surance to the Nixon Admin- istration that it would grant about 100,000 visas a year and end harassment, then Congress might be willing to allow the President to extend the trade benefits without insisting on prior Soviet per- formance. or whatever combi- nation of reasons, it is known that direct negotiations between Jackson and Kissinger began with a meeting last March 6 at the State Department. About a week later they met again, this time to consider five “principles” that Jack- son insisted the Russians would have to accept, includ- ing an end to harassment, the issuance of visas in the order in which applications were received and emigration at the rate of 100,000 visas per year. To the surprise of nearly all United States experts on the Soviet Union, and accordIng to some reports, to the sur- prise of Kissinger himself, the Russian leadership was indeed willing to make an indirect deal with Congress about its emigration practices, The talks began to progress when Kissinger and Gromyko met late last spring on Cyprus dur- ing one of Kissinger’s Middle East missions. When Kissin- ger returned to Washington, he had hot news for Jackson, Ribicoff and Javits: The Soviet Government was now willing to have him indicate that the U.S.S.R. would permit 45,000 Jews a year to emi- BZrate. That was up about a third from the 1973 level and about double the rate in 1974. As for the problem of harass- ment, Soviet representatives were prepared to state such practices were “inconsistent -with Soviet laws.” Javits tended to see this news aS more progress than Jackson, who kept looking for the loopholes. Perle, Jackson’s aide, wanted airtight assur- ances that more emigrants would come from major Soviet cities such as Moscow, Lenin- grad and Kiev, instead of peripheral regions. Against Javits’s judgment, Jackson was for pressing Russia to in- crease the number of emi- grants well above 45,000. In mid-June, Perle Iet on to his friend Malcolm Hoenlein, head of the Greater New York Conference on Soviet Jewry, that he was worried about what Javits might do. Hoen- lein, an all-out supporter of Jackson’s position, then tele- phoned Javits’s office to ar- range an appointment for a delegation of New York Con- ference leaders. The meeting turned out to be crowded and confusing, and at least some of Javits’s 25 listeners came away with the impression that under certain circum- stances he would have to part ways with Jackson, As a re- sult, an editorial criticizing Javits ran in The Jewish Press. Later in the summer, Javits met a smaller group from the New York Confer- ence and categorically denied that he would break with Jackson. Whether he meant to or not, Perle probably had heiped to stiffen Javits’s posi- tion. In any case, talks be-. tween Jackson and Kissinger, and between their representa- tives, continued through the summer. Even before Nixon’s resignation on Aug. 8, their successive proposals and counterproposals kept coming closer together. One impor- tant remaining .problem was how directly to describe the assurances that Kissinger said he had from Gromyko. Two days before Nixon’s resigna- tion, Jackson was asked to consider five possible ways for Kissinger to indicate that the Russians had made a deal: “We have been advised that .. .\"; “We are informed that “We are satisfied that . . 3 “We are confident that ...”, or “I have reason to believe that... .” Jackson thought they were all too vague and so did Stan- ley H. Lowell, the tough new chairman of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. Jackson and Lowell agreed that the operative phrase in Kissinger’s letter would have to be, “We have received assurances that. .. .” The breakthrough on this and several other points came when President Ford. in office one week, had breakfast on Aug. 15 with Jackson, Javits, Ribicoff and Kissinger to talk ever the remaining differenc- es. Lowell was informed af- ter the breakfast that Kissin- ger had agreed to write “we have received assurances . .” in his letter to Jackson. It took two more months to drive in all the other loose pegs, longer than the Senators expected. What everyone oped would be the diplo- Something to sell: When tariffs are lowered under the ne trade agreement, this Soviet Yak-40 could become competiti with U.S. executive jets. matic finale was arranged for Sept. 20; on that day Ford scheduled successive meet- ings with Jackson and the visiting Andrei Gromyko. With Jackson and Ford, the issue was how to devise a leg- islative formula that would allow the President to grant most-favored-nation status and credits to Russia on the basis of the Kissinger-Gro- myko understanding, while al- lowing Congress a way to re- view the understanding and void it in the event of viola- tions. Later on that day, Gro- myko and _ Kissinger had a long talk about the pro- posed exchange of letters whose outlines had by now been approved by Jackson. First, there was to be a Kissin- ger-to-Jackson letter enumer- ating what Kissinger had been © assured. As later published, the key assurances were (1) punitive actions, including fir- ings and demotions, against in- dividuals seeking to emigrate “would be violations of Soviet laws and regulations and therefore will not be permit- ted’; (2) no unreasonable im- pediments would be placed in the way of visa applicants, such as interference with travel or communications nec- essary to complete an appli- cation; (3) applications would be processed in order of re- ceipt, including those  pre- viously filed, and on a nondis- criminatory basis as regards race, religion, national origin, profession and place of origin; (4) hardship cases, including some prisoners who had pre- viously applied to emigrate, would get prompt considera- tion; (5) the emigration tax would remain suspended; (6) “it will be our assumption that ... the rate of emigra- tion from the U.S.S.R. would begin to rise promptly from the 1973 level and would con- tinue to rise to correspond to the number of applicants.” The first letter was to be followed by a Jackson-to-Kis- singer reply, in which Jackson would agree that Kissinger’s _ assurances were indeed a sui able basis for allowing Russ: to have moast-favored-natio: status and crecits. Jackso was to make his agreeme Subject to further “unde standings and interpreta tions” to pin down what Kis singer's first letter deliberate ly left unsaid. As later pub lished, the Jackson reply co tained five main points, undiplomatically specific: no punitive conscription criminal prosecution agains! those seeking to emigrate, o their families; (2) no more requirement that adult visa applicants must receive the permission of their parents o other relatives to emigrate (3) no denial of exit visas to those who had access to sen- sitive secret information for more than three years beyond their last exposure to suc’ secrets; (4) no interference with communication by tele phone, cable or letter so com pliance with the understand: ings could be verified and (5) the “minimum standard of initial compliance’’ to be the issuance of visas at the rate of 60,000 a year. Finally, there was to be a third letter from Kissinge back to Jackson, accepting Jackson’s five understandings on behalf of Ford, and neat! tying up the agreement. Only a_ nitpicking reade would be able to tell that the first letter was the only one that directly committed the Russians to anything; the oth er two were simply under. standings between Ford and Jackson about standards un der which certain trade bene fits should Ee granted or with held. Evidently this  nicety was enough of a face-saver for the Soviet leadership, for Jackson learned in a few days that the letters were now ac- ceptable all around. Before the rejoicing could begin, however, came the sev- en darkest days of the whole two-year battle. On the night of Monday, Sept. 30, Gen. Brent Scowcroft, Kissinger’s New York Times Magazine, January 5, 1975 (continued) \fdeputy, telephoned Jackson aide Dorothy Fosdick at home to say that Kissinger had just decided the third letter would have to be scrapped. Jackson was in a fury when he heard about it; he could only imag- ine that Kissinger had misled him or was trying to trick him. The worst part was that at least initially, no one on Jack- son’s side could piece together turned out that the cause of the objections to the third letter was, of all people, De- mocratic Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. Back on Sept. 26, shortly after the proposed exchange of letters had been cleared for re- lease, Mansfield, who had never liked the Jackson amendment from the begin- ning, had asked Kissinger if he really had _ Russia’s agreement to allow 60,000 persons a year to emigrate. When Kissinger made clear that he did not, Mansfield pointed out to Ford that the proposed third letter would be taken on the Hill as a guaran- tee nonetheless, and the Ad- ministration would be i trouble later if any fewer tha 60,000 were given exit visas. In addition, “I expressed my great concern that foreig policy was being made in tha manner,” the Majority Leade recalled in an interview, “I is the responsibility of the executive branch to make agreements with foreig countries and any exchange of letters should be received New York Times Magazine, January 5, 1975 (continued) by the President or Secretary of State. I was disturbed about this because of the precedent it created.” With the Congressional re- cess near, there was alarming- ly little time to renegotiate af- ter the Scowcroft message. And for several days, the egos of both Kissinger and Jackson made face-to-face communica- tion impossible. In despera- tion, the few Jewish leaders for a show of strength. Lowell ‘of the National Conference sent word to about 25 top of- ficers of the major Jewish organizations, asking them to send telegrdms expressing outrage in the strongest pos- sible terms to President Ford, with a copy of each to Kissin- ger. The object, according to cne member of the Washing- ton group, was to make sure Ford knew he would be held directly responsible if the deal fell apart. Equally important, Lowell conveyed a message to Jackscn’s office that it was no time to be stubborn about see- ing Kissinger. As far as is known, this was the hardest Jackson’s office had ever been leaned on by the National Conference, which had for two years gone along faithful- ly with Jackson’s tactical judgments. At last a meeting was set up for the following Tuesday. = It was Javits, the master of legal wordsmanship, who then figured out a way to please both the Ford Administration and Jackson on the problem of the third letter. His answer was simply to eliminate the third letter, as the President had demanded, but preserve its operative paragraph by grafting it onto the end of the first letter. The effect, as he told Jackson and Ribicoff and their respective aides the night before they were all to see Kissinger, was to express the same thirg in two letters instead of three. After some more prelimi- nary probing at the meeting on Oct. 8, the Senators handed Kissinger the two-letter pro- posal drafted by Javits. Kis- singer read it several times, Jackson Continued from Page 31 conferred with his aide Son- nenfeldt, and then said the language sounded all right to him, although he would have to check it with the President. He wanted. to emphasize, he said, that the Administra- tion would not regard the letter as legally binding. but only as a threat of Congressional action in case the U.S.S.R. did not act in a certain way. Jackson, in summing up at the end, didn’t reject this interpreta- tion, but insisted that Ford was committing himself to cut off most-favored-nation sta- tus and credits after a set per- iod if the conditions in the Jackson letter were not ob- served. The next day, Jackson, Ja- vits and Ribicoff learned to their relief that the President had bought the Javits com- promise. The very last hang-up was settled nine days later. Until then, Ford had insisted that the whole agreement would last for two years, that the President would have the right to renew most-favored- nation status for Russia, sub- ject to a veto by Congress if it felt the emigration agreement had not been observed. Jack- son had always insisted that the agreement should last for cne year, or at most for 18 months, and that it could only be renewed if Congress acted positively to renew it. Ford and Jackson talked this over privately after a White House bill - signing ceremony on Oct. 11, and Jackson later maintained the President gave him his word of horor that any time he saw the Russians failing to live up to the emigration assurances, he would immediately cut off the trade benefits, without waiting for ‘Congress to act. (White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen later sought to cast doubt on the existence of such a commitment, but he did not squarely deny it.) Late in the afternoon of Oct. 17, Perle and Amitay sat down with Alan Wolff, deputy general counsel of the White House Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations, and worked out a way to split the difference: After 18 months, Congress would have 60 days in which to act affirmatively on a Presidential request to renew the agreement; if noth- ing had happened by then, the President’s request would au- omatically be approved un- less one house vetoed it with- in 90 more days. This was all right with Jackson and all tight with Ford. But when Kissinger read it late that night, the 90 days seemed too long to him; he telephoned Jackson at home and woke him up to tell him hé was not satisfied. The truce was signed at the White House as scheduled the following morning; Kissinger won the final concession when Jackson agreed to cut the 90 days to 45. On the oth- er hand, it was unmistakable when the documents were re- leased that Jackson and his allies were the victors. For one thing, this was probably the first diplomatic agreement in American history to be mimeographed for distribu- icn on a Senator’s mimeo- graph machine. It was passed out in the White House press room by Perle and Amitay, two members of the Washing- ton group. here is a cost to everything, including victory, and Jackson had already found this out. In his case, the cost was paid on Sept. 12, when he had to inform George Meany, the man he probably needs most for 1976, that he was about to reach a compromise agreement on Soviet emigra- tion. Jackson did not have to tell Meany that an agreement on emigration would probably guarantee passage of the trade bill that Meany was dedicated to defeating for protectionist reasons. What would happen, won- dered Meany, if the Rus- sians cheat? Jackson replied that trade benefits could be cut off by Congress. Bu: Meany was unpersuaded about the deal and told Jackson so. “We couldn’t buy it,”” Meany told an interviewer the fol- lowing week. “I think he’s be- ing had.” . Only time will tell whether Meany was right. Certainly there are skeptics, not only among the Jewish dissidents in Russia but also in the Unit- ed States Congress, who be- lieve the Kremlin will find some nasty new way to sup- press, harass and intimidate. Yet it is obvious the agree- ment would never have come about unless Brezhnev and his colleagues were willing to be utterly pragmatic about the importance of American trade concessions. In the interests of world order, as well as So- viet Jewry, one can only hope that Moscow’s pragmatists can withstand the internal consequences of the Pact of the Two Henrys."

Sixty times a minute, a rotating metal arm reaches into a tray of letters and deposits one onto the chain conveyor 16 inches in front of your eyes. You have six-tenths of a second to read the zip code on the letter before you hear the click. Then, within the next four-tenths of a second, you must press the right three keys, like staccato notes on a piano. When a full second is over, a rubber finger snaps the letter out of your line of vision and onward toward its intended destination. Simultaneously, the metal arm deposits another letter 16 inches in front of your eyes, and you have six-tenths of a second before you hear an- other click, ... Your job as operaior of a Ziptronic Mail Trans- lator machine goes on like that, 45 minutes out of every hour, eight hours a day, all year long. You can neither speed up nor slow down the rate of clicks, even if you press no keys at all. Should your fingers accidentally hit 7-0-6 instead of 0-7-6, you cannot erase your mistake. Although the let- ter was addressed to Hackensack, N.J., you have sent the computer a signa! to drop it into the bin for Lake Charies, La. That letter will make the three-day detour through the deep South unless another clerk happens to retrieve it when manu- ally riffling through the Louisiana stack. By the end of the year, your fingers will have pressed the Ziptronic’s keys enough times to sort—or mis- sort—five million letters into 277 geographically divided bins on the back of the letter-sorting machine. Assuming you have average seniority, your labor costs the U.S, Postal Service $6 an hour in straight-time wages, plus another $2 an hour for fringe benefits, vacations and sick pay. That, for better or for worse, is what is hap- pening to the U.S. mails now that the industrial revolution is finaily catching up to the nation’s downtown post offices. As late as 1969, post office clerks sorted 9 out of 10 letters manually, using the same technique that Benjamin Franklin popularized in the seventeen-hundreds when he was Deputy Postmaster General for Britain's North Ameri- can colonies. But in the last five years a suc- cession of new managers have attacked the postal “mechanization gap” with zealous indignation and a multibillion-dollar investment budget. Today, more than half of all first-class letters are being sorted at least partly by machines, and in 10 years the proportion may be up to 85 per cent. Joseph Albright is Washington correspondent or The San Francisco Chronicle and a frequent contributor to this Magazine. as change helped the post office? Postal officials say it has—or will—as machines increasingly take over, but critics claim to see little improvement over the horse-and-wagon services of the eighteen-nineties, Three and a half years ago, Congress voted to terminate the old Post Office Department and replace it with the current U.S. Postal Service, an independent Government corporation patterned on the Tennessee Valley Authority. At the time, mechanical devices like the Ziptronic, along with independence from political pressures, were widely accepted as the best treatment for a postal system suffering from painful deficits, chronically irritating inefficiency and the need to increase the price of the 6-cent stamp. Somehow the treatment has not effected a cure. Despite a reduction of 28,000 postal employes through expensive labor-saving devices, the fraction of the $12-billion postal budget attributed to labor costs has increased from 82 per cent—much higher a3 LS than for most efficient corporations—to 85 per cent today, These figures mean that it is futile to hope that postal rates have stopped rising, Though Congress- men and journalists enjoy linking increased postal rates to the charge that cutgoing Postmaster Gen- eral Elmer T. Klassen “soaked the taxpayers” for fancy office furniture ($3,671 walnut doors; a pair of $14 water pitchers) and favored his friends with Postal Service contracts, the real reason is more basic: Wages paid to the 701,000 postal em- ployes have escalated much faster than any productivity improvements induced by automa- tion. Twenty-five years ago, when stamps cost 3 ents, postal emploves were underpaid—they earned $2,600 a year, or 20 per cent less than an averape New York Times Magazine, February 2, 1975 \f factory worker. Ten years ago, when stamps cost 6 cents, an average postal worker and factory worker both earned about $6,000 a year. But today, with stamps costing 10 cents, the pay of an average postal worker has jumped to $12,521 a year, which is 32 per cent higher than the average earnings of a factory worker. At these rates, the postal workers’ lot is. still not exactly affluent, On the other hand, under labor ‘contracts between the postal unions and the Postal Service, they can never be laid off. And they typically get four weeks of paid vacation, nine paid holidays and 13 days of paid sick leave. Because of climbing labor costs, and to a lesser extent because of rising gasoline prices, the Postal Service is planning to phase out the 10-cent stamp Parcel-post sorting in New York in 1913, and package Sorting today, performed by a computerized system at the bulk-mail center for the metropolitan urea located in Jersey City, later this year. “I would say the first-class stamp will have to go up to at least 12 cents, and possibly to 13 cents,” said Postmaster General Designate Benjamin Franklin Bailar, who replaces Klassen on Feb, 15. Rates for second-, third-, and fourth-class mail will have to rise by “roughly comparable” per. centages, Bailar added in an interview. Over-all, mail has become more erratic and, on the average, slower in the last five years. Postal Service statistics show that in the first six months of the Nixon Administration, the national average delivery time for a first-class letter was 1.3 days, not counting Sundays and holidays. However, over the next two years prior to creation of the Postal Service, the average delivery time lengthened to 1.6 days—a drop-off in service of about 20 per cent, Since 1971, the average delivery time has zig- zagged between 1.5 and 1.8 days, before hitting 1.63 days in the most recently tabulated quarter in the fall of 1974. Generally, most cities now have faster local service than in 1971, but service beyond 600 miles is slower. Letter-sorting machinery like the Ziptronic is part of the reason the mail has slowed dcwn. The machines have brought about a 2 per cent annual increase in an average postal-worker’s productivity. But unhappily, a letter that goes through a Ziptronic is 10 times as likely to go astray as one sorted in the same post office by manual methods. This whole combination—skyrocketing labor costs, small increases in productivity and con- tinued lackluster service—might be called “the Postmaster General's Paradox,” and a powerful paradox it is. The present trends in postal labor and uther expenses, if extrapolated over the next 10 years, will make a 12-cent first-class postage stamp leok ridiculously cheap. In fact, the General Accounting Office recently made a_ confidential study of what it might cost to mail a first-class letter in 1984. Assuming the “worst case”——con- tinued high inflation, low productivity increases and the currently enacted phaseout of Congressional subsidies—G.A.O. estimated that a single stamp would have to cost 35 to 40 cents. MJ ow did the Postmaster General's Paradox come to pass? On the postal-wages side, it was the result of a little-noticed pro- : @ vision in the 1971 postal legislation that ahanard the old Post Office Department into the new Postal Service. The sleeper was a provision that allowed the strong postal unions to bargain with the Post- master General for their workers’ wages, something President Johnson’s postal commission first pro- posed in 1968. When the Nixon Administration took office in 1969, the wages of a level 5 postal clerk were identical with those of a level 5 clerk in the Labor Department, Justice or almost anywhere else in the Federal establishment. In the last five years, however, the salary of a postal clerk has increased 67.6 per cent, compared with a 39 per cent increase in the Consumer Price Index and a 38 per cent increase in the salary of a level 5 clerk in the Justice Department. If postal workers were still paid at the pay scales of the rest of the Federal Government, the Postal Service would cost $1.2-billion less to operate this year, making the Postmaster General’s Paradox one of the most expensive conundrums in bureaucratic history. As a result of collective bargaining, postal work- ers now have a mix of benefits not enjoyed by other Government workers, the most expensive being an automatic 1i-cent an hour pay increase for each 0.4 per cent increase in the Consumer Price Index, and that is on top of a 12 per cent pay increase over two years negotiated in 1973. Earlier this year, Klassen was quoted in Dun’s Review as saying of the 1973 contract settlement: “We had no choice but to give the unions what they wanted... . Otherwise they would have gone on strike.” Kias- sen now insists he never said this, Whether he said it or not, the 1971 legislation leaves any Postmaster General uncomfortably vulnerable to union demands. With Congress no longer required to vote on postal wage and rate increases, a Post- master General can expect nothing but abuse on Capitol Hill if he is tight-fisted enough to provoke a postal strike—even though postal strikes are illegal. Such a strike could occur as early as next month. Postal Service management, in an effort to get more work cut of some of its people who deliver mail, is testing out a system of measuring and equalizing the delivery routes.

In theory. Ziptronic opera- tors around the country are supposed to make errors on mo more than 2 per cent of the letters they sort, and the machine itself is expected to missort another 2 per cent through mechanical errors. In theory, that means 96 per cent of all letters should wind up in the correct bins, while the other 4 per cent should be detected before they teave the Post Office by the ‘‘sweeper”’ clerks, who are instructed to riffle through each pile manu- ally, verifying the zip codes. One night this fall, during a tour of the main Manhattan post office at 33d Street ana Eighth Avenue, Tour Super- intendent Horace Faulk readily Zave me permission to check some of the bins of sorted mail for errors. The first pile, supposedly reserved for liet- ters to banks in the Wal Street area using the unique zip code 10015, contained 10 letters, of which four were sorted correctly and .six had zip codes other than 10015. Next, I reached for a fatter stack in the bin marked “zip code 10018, an area in mid- town Manhattan. It contained 50 letters—31 right, 19 wrong. The third bin, the one for Wonkers, was more comfort- ing—63 right, 4 wrong. The fourth, with mail bound for Kingston, N. Y., contained 54 right and 5 wrong. The total error rate for that short period, according to my un- scientific sampling method, was 18 per cent. . During a visit to the post office in Newark, N. J.. a week later, I repeated the experiment on ane identical Ziptronic machine, with rather different results. In the bin for downtown Newark I found 73 #tletters sorted right and 2 wrong. In the Paramus bin, 50 right and zero wrong. In the Glen Ridge bin, 44 right and tit wrong. Over-ail, ac- cording to my unscientific technique, this Newark postal crew had an error rate of less than 2 per cent. In all likelihood, the opera- tors in Newark are not con- Sistently that good, nor are the operators in Manhattan consistently that bad. On a recent test, Ziptronic opera- tors in the same Manhattan post office averaged 3.1 per cent “trrors, compared with 2.2 per cent for operators in Newark. Those figures com- Pare favorably wit sults of a General Accounting Office survey, which found ast year that an average Zip- ronic operator in DaHas erred on 11.3 per cent of letters, one in Houston erred n 5.0 per cent, and one in New Orleans erred on 9.2 per cent. The problems with the Zip- tronic may arise from the fact that the machine, invented in the nineteen-fifties, but intro- duced in large numbers only in the last five years, is simply not that compatibie with hu- man beings. During my tour of the Manhattan post office, I expressed amazement that roomful of 100 Ziptronic and keep their sanity. > a 24-year post-office veteran, replied: ‘I still maintain it is the toughest job in the post office. For one thing, it is a strain on your eyes. Some people simply can’t do it, be- cause after a coupie of hun- dred letters, their tears start to flow.’’ CAs an experiment, I ar- ranged to take some of the examinations that are given to would-be Ziptronic opera- tors during their 40-hour training course. After an hour of learning the keyboard, I took the initial qualifying exam: With letters going by at a slowed rate of 40 per minute, ati ¥ had to do was recognize one number on each sample letter and then hit the proper key, preceded by the zero key. To pass, I needed 98 right out of 100 Ifetters. I scored 84 right and 16 wrong. That threw me off so badly that when I tried the test again, my score dropped to 67 right, 33 wrong. Not so good, tI thought, for a person who had once been first in his Army typing-school class. Without taking the rest of the course, i attempted the final exam— punching three numbers for each of 250 letters, going by at GO per minute. My score was 4 right, 246 wrong, two sore thumbs and a headache.) Senior Assistant Postmaster 3. T. Ellington, a former ad- vertising vice president, sym- pathizes with the Ziptronic operators, saying, “‘It’s a ter- rible job.’? Postal clerks by the thousands evidently agree, for the pattern in most cities is for a new clerk to get hired as an operator and then to “‘bid’’ off the Ziptronic into a less demanding job, like win- dow clerk, as soon as he or she has enough seniority. In New Work City, Postmaster John Strachan wants 200 more Ziptronic operators on top of the 980 he has already, but  virtuall none of New York Times Magazine, February 2, 1975 (continued) his \fee.

Throughout the coun- try, the Postal Service will train 45,000 new Ziptronic operators in the coming yeaf, most of them hired off the street. With all the difficulties in letter sorting by machine, the Postal Service is in even worse trouble trying to intro- duce a $950-million system to distribute packages and other bulk mail in mechanized fashion. The Postal Service, under 192-year-old itaws, has a legal monopoly on distributing first-class mail, but the Gov- ernment’s monopoly does not extend to packages. As a re- sult, the Postal Service has to compete for package busi- ness with private entrepre- neurs like United Parcel Serv- ice, REA Express and Grey- hound. Because some of the private firms offered cheaper rates, faster service and gentler handting, the post of- fice lost an astounding 40 per cent of its parcel-post volume between 1963 and 1973. This happened largely because re- tail merchants and other sophisticated, high-volume shippers deserted the post office for private parcel com- panies. Increasingly, the post offices were left with the un- lucrative share of package business United Parcel and other private companies did not really want—like sending a beehive from Cousin George in Hillsboro, Va., to Aunt Hilda in Dubois, Wyo. The way to conquer the competition, then Postmaste General Winton M. Bloun decided in 1971, was to con struct a network of 21 hug warehouselike bulk-mail ce ters on the outskirts of majo cities that would sort parce post as well as advertising cir culars, books and_ records Historically, packages have been sorted in the same downtown post offices tha process all other classes o mail. One reason packages were damaged so often e route is that as soon as the arrived on trucks at loading docks of many post offices they were dropped about five feet down “dump holes’ onto a conveyor belt, ofte hitting other packages alread on the moving belt. Anothe reason is that the sorting clerks did not have time to walk over and place them lovingly in the right canvas sack. Instead, they picked! packages off a conveyor belt and tossed them into sacks up to 14 feet away. In Novem- ber, 1971, the Postal Service had ani outside contractor send a large number of iden- tical packages, each contain- ing a dozen fragile drinking glasses. some by ordinary inail and some by United Parcel, Greyhound and REA Express. ‘Fhis never-released study showed that glasses were broken in fully 50 per cent of the packages sent through the U.S. mails, compared with 10 per cent of the packages sent vy the three private) ccorm- panies. By introducing huge mecha- nized parcel-sorting factories, Blount, and then Klassen, ex- pected to save the Postal Service $300-million a year in labor and other operating costs and to improve service enough to win back customers from United Parcel. Klassen stressed that in the bulk-mail system packages would never be allowed to drop more than nine inches. In fact, he went so far as to inform Congress- man Tim Lee Carter in 1972 that the new system would be ‘‘damage free.” The first cf the 21 bulk-mail centers, serving a 150-mile radius around Manhattan, has been operating for one year now. Although it has en- countered mechanical break- downs, cost overruns, a brief unauthorized strike, high absenteeism and disappoint- ing productivity, the perform- ance has been improving in the last three months. While still tinkering with the first bulk mail center, the Postal Service is going ahead with plans to open the other 20 centers around the country at the extraordinary rate of nearly three a month for the next year. Klassen acknow!l- edged that it would have been smarter to get one center operating smoothly before going forward to complete the nationwide system. “It is something we will never do again, and perhaps we should never have done it in the first place,” he said in an inter- view. * A visit to the New York bulk-mail center, a gigantic! blue warehouse down the highway from Eddie’s Toe Main Patace restaurant in Jer- sey City, N. J., quickly dis- closes the reasons for second thoughts. At first, the huge plant seems the apotheosis of automated efficiency. Pack- ages arrive from 100 New York area post offices in sacks, which are delivered by conveyors to an automatic sack-shaking machine. Once freed from the sacks, the par- cels are allowed to slide or tumble down a smooth metal incline toward one of many sorting consoles. There, a postal clerk reads the zip code and punches three numbers onto his keyboard, which re- sembles a _ touch-tone  tele- phone. Simultaneously, the numbers go into a computer and the package flips onto a moving tray. If the clerk has punched a zip code in Chicago, the package will be ejected from the moving tray just as it passes a down chute exclu- sively for Chicago. All this automation is pretty overwhelming at first, but it isn’t long before a visitor notices”some deficien- cies. In my case, the first clue was half a dozen red and green pincushions bouncing down a metal slide and onto the floor. “They must have heen from a softly wrapped package,” explained Frank E. Schmidt, the manager of the center, who used to work for an aerospace company. “Un- fortunately,” said Schmidt, (Continued on Page 32) New York Times Magazine, February 2, 1975 (continued) \f Continued jrom Page 290 “we are hard on that kind of package.” Elsewhere in the building, I Saw an enclosure the size of a tennis court, near which were waiting 1§ large laundry hampers of torn or damaged packages. This enclosure, ex- plained Schmidt, was the re- wrap section. In his plant, which processes upward of five million packages every month, it takes 26 clerks just to rewrap the torn boxes that still have addresses attached, and to send the unidentifiable residue to the claims and in- quiries department at the Manhattan post office. On an average day, that residue amounts to one 75-cubic-foot rolling container of books, plus about 50 cubic feet of cosmetics, tapes, records, drugs, toys and other items. When the New York bulk-mail center opened in January, 1974, the rate of packages with external damage was running as high as 5 per cent, evidently because heavy pack- ages crushed lighter packages below them on the steeply inclined chutes. Engineering changes have subsequently slowed down some of the chutes. Even so, Schmidt said, about 1.5 per cent of pack ages going through the cen ter are still suffering external damage—so it is not exactl “damage free.” One of Schmidt's other con- stant worries at the New York bulk-mail center is sabotage by his employes, many of whom still resent having had to transfer there last winter from less mechanized assign- ments closer to their homes. “We have had at least one major incident of what ap- pears to be sabotage each month, as well as continuing minor incidents,” said Schmidt. “In some cases, our parcel-sorting capacity has been cut by as much as 50 per cent for a day.” One of the most popular forms of sabotage, it seems, is putting a mailbag in front of one of the several thousand photo- cells in the building, or else kicking the photocell out of alignment, thus causing par- cels to be sent to the wrong ity. Another trick, according o Schmidt, is dropping 2-inch metal bolts into the tracks of a conveyor, thereby mashing he gears. In one case, some- one kicked or pounded a it Couldn't send signals to the computer. “So far, we haven’! been able to identify any specific individuals, althoug we have some suspicions who is doing it,” said Schimdt. As if that were not enoug. trouble, Schmidt's keyboard operators have not been at taining the 97 per cent ac- curacy in their package sort- ing on which the national bulk-mail center system was predicated, Their over-all ac- curacy hit 95 per cent in mid- summer, but it fell to 90 per cent in the fall, no doubt as a result of a shuffling of nearly all the work force to new as- signments in August, the re- sult of a seniority “bidding” provision in the union con- tract. Moreover, the New York bulk-raail center is taking 18 per cent more paid man-hours to operate than its designers had expected one year ago. But even during the recent United Parcel Service strike in the New York area, it was able to handle only 42 per cent of its 15-million-parcels- a-month design capacity.

Second, the Postal Service should spend a lot more money on a tong-term re- search department, in hopes of devising a radically more efficient matl-sorting system. The Defense Department is devoting 10 per cent of its budget to research and engi- neering. but the Postal Serv- ice, with a much smaller budget, spends less than one- half of 1 per cent of it on ad- vanced projects. This is prob- ably why Klassen was forced to say in an interview, “I wish we could tell you we had some great mechanical breakthroughs on the horizon, but we don’t have any.’ Bail- ar, an impressive 40-year-old Harvard Business School type, who served as Klassen’s dep- uty at the American Can Company and then the Post- al Service, agrees. Currently, the closest thing to a breakthrough is an ad- vanced sorting system now undergoing tests in Cincinnati. In its latest configuration, op- tical scanning devices autvo- matically ‘tread’? tremendous volumes of typewritten or printed mail by comparing the addresses to a citywide di- rectory that has heen im- planted in a computer’s memory. When the _ optical scanners have recognized the address, they instantly cause a code to be printed on each letter in ink visible under infrared light, thus = allow- ing all subsequent = sorting operations to be performed by computers. In theory, the Cincinnati system should in- crease the productivity of mail-sorting clerks by a fac- tor of 10 and at the same time cut down on missorted mail. Unfortunatety, the equip- ment is susceptible to mail jams, and this problem prob- ably cannot be soived unless the mailing public can be com- pelled to use envelopes with standardized shape, thickness and flap stickum. Futhermore, it would cost about $50-million to deploy the Cincinnati equipment in one medium-sized city, and that is too expensive to justi- fy unless it could eliminate at least 300 jobs. Given the no- lay-off provisions in the post- al contracts and the current state of the American economy, the Postal Service will not install the Cincinnati system on a nationwide basis any time soon. Nevertheless. technology must be encour- aged. What the Postal Service should do is worry less about the quick answer to fend off some Congressional commit- tee and to worry more about finding a really new postal technology by i980. The re- searchers should not just con- sider sorting machinery, but the full path of a letter from mail box to mail slot. Perhaps the answer in the long run is some form of electronic mail transmission. Third, the Postal Service has to pay more attention to making humans and machines compatible. Jobs that cannot be automated could be made less monotonous, or at least less error-prone. It would help if clerks could make temporary switches from one job to an- other more easily. It would help if there were more than two human-factor experts in the Postal! Service to work on improving what is called the “man-machine interface.\"\" [It would help if the postal unions would be more recep- tive to incentive pay for fast, accurate employes. It would help if ambitious employes could listen to tapes of for- eign-language courses or talking books to help pass the monctonous hours of sorting the mail. Finally, the Postal Service should throw out air mail and special delivery, which usual- ly are not worth the extra money and may even cause delays. Instead, there should be two classes of first-class mail—the next-day class, for people who want to pay an extra few pennies for guaran- teed next-day delivery, and the any-day class, for people who don’t care if delivery takes up to one week. T) make the next-day stamp worth buying, it should carry @ money-back guarantee if de- livery takes longer-—a guar- antee that the Postal Service now offers on a Hmited cate- gory of preferential mail, mostly used by high-volume business mailers. In the fifth century B.C., Xerxes used swift couriers to send back to Persia the tid- ings of his invasion of Greece. Herodotus, duly impressed with these earHest of postal workers, recorded: ‘Nothing morta! travels so fast as these Persian messengers ... and these men will not be _ nin- dered from accomplishing . . - the distance which they have to go, either by snow, or rain, or heat, or by the darkness of night.”” Now that we Ameri- cans have carved that idea into a stone motto, we should demand that our Government live up to it. @ New York Times Magazine, February 2, 1975 (continued) \f"

It is also the result of some Curious dealings in Washington, D.C a TAIWAN ee By Joseph P. Albright PALMDALE, Calif. Here, under the pristine desert sun, Northrop Corporation's latest fighter planes roll off the final assembly line and are flown away by the customers. On a typical day, re- cently, you could see seven of them in a row along the runway, some with desert camouflage and others painted brown and green to blend with the jungle. ‘The first two up there are for Malaysia,” said Stan Weeks, manager of North- rop’s Paimdale plant. “The third and fifth have been configured for the Iranian Air Force. The fourth and sixth are for Brazil. We have two Brazilian Air Force pilots up here now, goimeg to fly them .out of here at 8 o’clock tomorrow morning. That last one down there is going to Jordan.’” The plane is known as the F-5E International Fighter, so named because it is the only warplane in the world that was designed as an export ommodity rather than for its own nation’s air torce. It is a match for a MIG-21 in a dopfight, and yet, with a fly-away cost of $2 million, it costs less than any other modem supersonic Fighter in the world. Because it is so uniquely tailored to a growing world market, the International Fighter has be- come Northrop’s better mousetrap, and perhaps deserves to stand as a symbol of modern free en- terprise at its most successful on an awesome global scale. Since the International Fighter went into production four years ago, Northrop’s eamings have doubled, mostly on the strength of $1.3 billion in International Fighter sales. Today, according to one highly informed U.S. official with no particular sympathy for Northrop, the International Fighter is considered such a bargain abroad that it should enjoy a near-monopoly on the world’s light-fighter market until about 1980. Northrop’s own projec- tions in its current annual report indicate that rev- enues from sales of the aircraft could reach $4 billion by 1985. But this is not the whole story of Northrop’s \"Joseph P. Albright is Washington correspondent of The San Francisco Chronicle and a frequent contributor to this Magazine. ., aS well as in foreign palaces. success. A fresh look at the documents gathered in various Government investigations, including some previously undisclosed Northrop memos sub- Ppoenaed by the Senate Multinational Corporations Subcommittee, reveals a considerably more cynical tale of corporate achievement in the high-stakes arms-procurement game. Technical prowess and business insight are important parts of this game, but so is funny money—slush funds and bribes circulating among the agents of arms manufac- turers and government officials. Stories of such chicanery abroad are common by now and have tainted the reputations of such prestigious Amer- ican corporations as Exxon, Lockheed, Gulf and United Brands. But in the Northrop case, the trail of funny money also leads back to Washington, where it successfully infiltrated the domestic arms- procurement process. Both at home and abroad, Northrop played the game very well indeed, slipping up only to the extent that the corrupt, if not felonious side of its contracting and marketing have been exposed. For that it has suffered a wave of bad publicity, but not much else. Nobody has been indicted because of the International Fighter, no one has been reduced to financial embarrassment; the plane continues to sell, and Northrop recently won a nice piece of a new $7.7 billion contract to build the next generation of fighters for the Navy. rom 50 yards away, you would have a hard time understanding why nations would line up to purchase International Fighters. They are so small that you could parx two of them on a tennis court. And so cute, with their needle noses and stubby wings, that they might be made of balsa wood. The reasons begin to dawn on you when you sit in the cockpit and run you fingers across those little plastic buttons that can pour out 25 rounds of cannon fire per second o: release a 2,000 pound bomb, or drop napalm or send a Sidewinder heat-seeking missile swoosh: ing off in the direction of another plane’s tailpipe. The U.S. Government considers it an ideal weapo for the U.S. military-aid and military-sales pro grams in many parts of the world. (Because of its short range, the U.S. Air Force does not con sider the International Fighter useful for its o ombat purposes.) It is cheap, easy to fly and un complicated to maintain. Because it was not de- signed to carry either the fuel reserves or the electronic black boxes necessary to penetrate another country’s modem air defenses, it is, to quote a Defense Department study, a “non- Provocative” weapons system. As a consequence, the International Fighter has quite literaily become an instrument of American foreign policy. For example, the United States gave South Korea 51 International Fighters to facilitate the withdrawal of 15,000 U.S. troops in 1970. And, when. South Korea needed bolstering after the collapse ef Saigon last year, the U.S. arranged, among other things, for an easy-credit sale of 60 more Inter- national Fighters. Today, the market for the International Fighter is no longer limited to America’s military-aid clients. Saudi Arabia and Iran have purchased scores of them, using their own money as well as credits under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales Program. Switzerland has tentatively decided to pay Northrop $486 million in a straight commercial transaction to re-equip the whole Swiss Air Forve with International Fighters. And there are reports that Egypt will be next in line. It is likely that the real story of the International Fighter could never have been told if it had not been for the discovery of an unrelated political contribution. On May 1, 1974, Thomas V. Jones, then President and Chairman of Northrop, walked into Federal District Court in Washington and pleaded guilty to giving $150,000 in corporate funds to Nixon fund raiser Herbert Kalmbach. Judge George Hart could have sentenced Jones to five years in Allenwood, since he was pleading guilty toa felony. Instead, he imposed a $5,000 fine and a similar $5,000 fine on the company, which also pleaded guilty. Simultaneously, the directors of Northrop issued a compassionate press release declaring that be- cause of Northrop’s “significant achievements” under Jones's leadership, he would stay on as president and chairman. But partly to satisfy Government lawyers, the board also announced JORDAN | that it had directed the company’s independent auditors, Ermst & Emst, to conduct a ‘special audit “to assure that all funds and expenses have been properly reimbursed to the company.” hat is how, over the next (Continued on Page 26) New York Times Magazine, February 8, 1976 \f onttraued from Page 13 months the directors their first inklings that company’s significant achievements had a sleazy The story begins back in 956, when Thomas V.

But there wus mew project on the drafting tables: a tiny fighter plane ith an extremely high thrust-to-weizfht ratio. This basic shape first became the Air Force T-38 trainer, and then the Freedom Fighter for verseas allies. A decade liat- ec, Northrop designers turned ait into the International Fighter. Im 1959, at the age of 39, Jones was named president of Northrop. It did not take him long@= to reach the mordant conclusion that good technol- opy can be defeated by poli- tics. Im 1959, Northrop tost out to Lockheed for a huge NATO fighter contract, and Jones came to suspect bribery. Then in i962, for reasons of changing strategic policy, the Pentagon canceled the Sky- bolt missile, which included a Northrop guidance system that represented 25 percent of the company’s potential sales. Jones’s overt response has been to diversify, and for the most part he has dome it successfully. Today. Northrop is mot only a fighter house, but also seils gBuidance sys- tems for nuclear submarines, airport tandingz systems, alu- minum storefronts, walkie- talkies and airborne compu- ters. But while talking public- Ivy about diversification, Tom Jones was privately moving deeper and deeper into the woridwide sewer of procure- ment politics. Like every industrial break- through. the International Fighter needed seed money to get off the drawing board. One man who was in a posi- tion to get some for Northrop, if he chose to try. was the late L. Mendel Rivers, chair- man ofthe House Armed Serv- ices Committee. It just so happened that one of Mendei Rivers‘’s very closest fricnds, Frank J. DeFrancis, was a Northrop consultant. DeFrancis. now 49, is a New York Times Magazine, February 8, 1976 (continued) man of many talents: Wash- ington lawyer, founder of a charter airline service, some- time currency speculator and a fine judge of horscfiecsh—in politics and in his own thor- eughbred stables. DeFrancis is also a man of some prominence around the House Armed Services Com- mittee, or at least he was un- til chairman Rivers died on December 28, 1270, following heart surgery. “They were very close friends,\" remem- bers J. Russell Blandford, the one-time Marine Corps gfen- eral who faithfuliy served as Rivers’s chief counsel on the committee. Of his relationship with Rivers, DeFrancis now says, **I knew Mendel for over 1S years. ...I1 would say that he was a very dear friend of mine, and I trust he would have considered me the same.” In the summer of 1967 Northrop president Jones re- tained Frank PeFrancis as a Northrop consultant for $50,000 a year. Jones has ac- hnowledged that over the next eigzht years, he spoke to De- Francis “‘vwery frequentiy. I suppose once a week, many times once a day.’ Jones has totd all investigators that the reason he retained DeFrancis was to improve Northrop’s sales prospects in Germany. and up to now, this explana- tion has never been doubted. Now, however, a document has turned up that indicates that in Tom Jones's opinion, DeFrancis was instrumental in winning the all-important U.S. Air Force contract that provided sced moncy to build the Intermational Fighter. The document is a memo on company stationery writ- ten by George Gore, the now- retired Northrop gZencral counsel. Ie summarizes for files a conversation with someone named “Tom’”’ on August 5, 1971. Gore has sub- sequently identified ‘““‘Trom” as Northrop President Tom Jones. The Gore memo says, in its entirety: ‘“‘Tom §tele- Phoned me today and asked if i had sent the $50,000 check to DeFrancis. { said that it had been sent last week. the \f same day he spoke to me, which was July 29. Tom then told me that he wanted me to understand that the servi- <ces of DeFrancis in connec- tion with our securing the E-S-2I comtract were invalu- able and that we would not Ihave gotten the contract with- out DeFrancis’s contribution. Hie then said that he wanted st thoroughly understood that ig anything should ever hap- pen to him, he wanted all aur agpreements with DeFran- <is honored.” How was DeFrancis “‘inv2t- wable’” in obtaining the con- tract for the F-5-21 {then the mame of the International Fighter)? Jones didm’t say. but there is at least one clue. Russ Biandford crecalis that one day in 1968 or 1369, Frank DeFrancis and Tom Jones called at Rivers’s of- fice to present arguments for a Pentagon-financed retooling of the Northrop assembiyv line. From Northrop’s viewpoinr, that was a time when heip was wital. Its contract to pro- duce T-38S trainers for the Air Force, which nad tIasted 10 years. was about to run out. The Freedom Fighter was becoming harder and harder to market overseas because Of its limited range and speed. Worst of all. Tom Jones had already made a pitch through ordinary Pentagon channels for money to update the Free- dom Frgehkhter to recapture overseas markets. but the Air Force had turmed aside the Pproposak. | Rivers must have found Worthrop’s arguments persua- sive, for on March 11, 1969. Ihe surprised the other mem- bers of the House Armed Services Committee by calling an unexpected meeting to pro- pose a supplemental authori- zation of $14 millien for the E-S5-21._. Eventually. he added. the program would cost ar- other 348 mitlion. That was the year of the big Safefzuard ABM struggle, and Congress was bearing daown on all military spending. But in a stunning display of personal power, Rivers—with Blandford’s assistance — man- aged over the next eight months to force $28 million for the rew International Fighter into the military budz- et. It wasn’t easy. Defemse Sec- Laird opposed - fequest, and that was enough for the Senate to bury the House-passed supplemen- tal bilt containing $14 million for Northrop. But when it came tirme for Rivers’s corm- mittee to mark up the annual procurement bill, the Defense Northrop's President Jones: “Errors of judgment”? Or “excel- lent performance” in the face of economic adversity? Department’s position on the Enternational Fighter switched in am extraordinary way. In the midst of the mark-up sessions om the ABM and oth- er weapons systems, Rivers had a private talk on Sept. 24, 2969. with Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard. Be- fore the Gay was over, Pack- ard sent Rivers a letter ta **comnfirm our request’” for the EFfouse Armed Services Corm- mittee to provide the Air Force funds to develop 325 fighters for Korea, —Taiwan. South Vietnam and elsewhere. RPackard’”s sudden comrmiit- ment om Sept. 24. 1969. ran counter to the most current written decisions on the pro- earam by the Secretary of Defense amd the Secretary of the Air Force. Pentagon files show that a month earlier, on Aug. 22, Laird rejected 2 De- welopment Concept Paper pre.

However, Packard maintains he backed the In- ternational Fighter program on the merits, independent of Congressional pressure. Aithough a few liberals protested e@ EFfouse Ffioor. Rivers prevailed without a recorded vote im the House. But im the Senate, not a penny was woted for the Internation- al Fighnter, which meant the issue had to be resolved the Hiouse-Senate Conference Committee. Finally. after nine sreetings. the Senate con- ferees gave in to Rivers and International ment- bill that was signed by President Nixon. On the Semate floor, Senator John Cc. Stennis provided a revealing explanation: “The conferees were not favorable to this project, in the beginning. --..- I wish to say that I have mever seen anyone work hard- er in a comference than the usually weil im this field, very active and highly capablie.”* y far the most in- teresting character im the Ermst & Ermst report om Northrop was a Parisian lawyer. William Savy. He was re-— tainea by Northrop im i961. ostensibly as a source of behind-the-scene information about the European aircraft market. But William Savy was more than a source of information. He was alIso Northrop’s iaun- dryrman. Several times a year, Savy woul@dt go to 2 bank im Paris and withdraw money in the form of Ameri- can $100 bilis, sometimes up New York Times Magazine, February 8, 1976 (continued) \fhat would Northrop do about the desire of the Saudi Air Force commander to be ‘compensated’ for the initial contracts? The company ‘meets its obligations,’ said President Jones. A Saudi learns to use his In- ternational Fighter. The plane “has quite literally become an instrument of American foreign policy.”\" packets and placing each in ja separate pocket of his coat, avy would catch a plane to New York. There, he would put the four packets in a large manila envelope and de- liver it to Northrop’s now im consulting fees. one knows how much of that money was laundered back into the United States’ in the form of cash. The reason ne one knows is that Savy and Allen deliberately kept no records. When the Ernst & Ernst auditors were al- lowed to interview Savy in Paris, he produced a typed sheet indicating that the amount he had returned to Northrop over the years was $376,000. Although he did not produce a ledger, he assured the auditors he had check stubs and a good memory for figures. A few months later, the auditors wrote to Savy to confirm their calculations. Savy’s lawyers replicd that he was on an expedition to un- explored parts of Africa. Since then, not even Northrop’s board of directors has been able to interview William Savy. Jones and Allen, the only Northrop officials aware of the Savy money. agree that the whole thing started be- cause the company kept being hit by demands for Americar political contributions. Feeling the auditor’s hot breath on his neck, AHen produced a break- down of how $338,710, which was all Allen remembered getting from Savy, had been ended. Most of the moncy for political contribu- if Allen really did remember all Northrop’s contributions, then the list was not an ad- vertisement for the company’s political astuteness. After all the risks in having Savy bring back an iltegai slush fund, it was strange that there were no contributions to any cur- rent member of the Armed Services or Appropriations Committees, save for North- rop’s local Congressman in Los Angetes. And wasn’t it curious that half of the Wash- ington figures Northrop ac- knowledged supporting were dead or no longer in power? From a careful examination of the subpoenaed Northrop financial records, it appears there was another remarkable coincidence involving the Savy money. Up through 1968. Northrop paid him a fee that averaged about $1.- 800 a month, which usually rose in American’ electior years and dropped in the off years. But in 1969, when there were no major U.S, elections, Tom Jones authorized two sharp increases in Savy‘’s con- sulting fee, although he had mot asked for a raise. The troubling coincidence is this: Savy’s first big jump—from $1.400 a month to $5,000 a month—came exactly a week after the House of Represen- tatives first passed the pro- curement bill that included the money Jones wanted to retool the Northrop factory for the International Fighter. . Savy’s second big jump—from $5,000 a month to $15,000 a month—came seven months later, on the very day the House and Senate conferces reached agreement on adding the $28 million to the military budget that has made the International Fighter program possible. When asked about this, Northrop officials acknowl- edge only that Jones wanted to build up some money for expected contributions in the 1970 Congressional elections. But the Northrop officials. who declined to be identified by name, insist that the tim- ing of Savy’s raises was en- tirely unrelated to the Con- gressional action on the Inter- national Fighter. Northrop de- nies that any contributions went to Mendel Rivers, and there is no evidence to prove otherwise. There can be no denying. however, that Frank DeFran- cis had reason to feei a lot richer on the day the Penta- gon caved in to Mendel Rivers and stopped opposing funds for the International Fighter. This had nothing to do with the Savy money. but rather with a remarkably well timed deal. On September 22, 1969, he signed a contract with Northrop president Tom Joncs under which DeFrancis was to be paid between 14 and 1144 percent on ali Internation al Fighters sold directly to any foreign government. But at that point, any bene- fits were hypothetical, since Northrop had no money to start the assembly line. Then, just two days tater, Mende! Rivers met with David Packard, and the result was a Pentagon commitment to buy 325 International Fighters for the military ald program. Although DeFrancis would get no commissions on those, he stood to makc_ mil- lions on other foreign sales. For a consultant already earning $50,000 a year from orthrop, this was an extraor- dinary kicker. Northrop handled it in an even more extraordinary way. The saies contract was not prepared by Northrop’s legal department, but by Frank DeFrancis. Jones, who is not a lawyer. signed it without showing it to anyone else. Then, follow- ing the Pentagon’s turnabout, Jones and DeFrancis agreed to treat the contract as a “gentlemen's agreement,”’ and Jones told no one at Northrop about it for the mext 13 months, even though that meant Northrop salesmen were quoting some prices on the International Fighter that did not include the potential DeFrancis sales commissions. The “gentlemen’s agree- ment” was replaced in 1971 by another contract between Northrop and a Swiss corpora- tion, Economic and Develop- ment Corporation, which De- Francis created to serve as Northrop’s “sales representa- tive’? in place of him. After the E.D.C. contract was signed, Jones ordered his general counsel, George Gore, to destroy the 1969 sales agreement with DeFrancis and to “substitute” the 1973 E.D.C_ contract, which carried almost identical language, On its face, the E.D.C. contract was bizarre. Northrop had dozens of crack salesmen on iis own payroll, plus a net- work of sales agents covering virtually all potential foreign markets, Yet under the E.D.C. apreement, Jones was obligat- ing Northrop to pay a second New York Times Magazine, February 8, 1976 (continued) \fD.C. had anything to do with arranging the transaction. The most peculiar part of all is that no evidence has ever turned up indicating that E.D.C. actually did any- thing to sell i “commissions” on sales million in such commissions. The list of ultimate recipients ing except a $50,000 fee from Northrop for setting up E.D.c. Even after the E.D.C. con- tract, Northrop had not seen the end of Frank DeFrancis. When his regular $50,000-a- year consulting agreement was about to expire in early 1973, he let Jones know he wanted a raise. Jones offered to boost the retainer to $100,- this was clearly not enough, so he caught a plane to Los Angeles and told Jones that he would accept nothing less than a $100,000-a-year con- tract for 15 years. instead of tossing his con- sultant out of the office, Jones reacted by asking his legal department to draw up a 15- year contract. Before the day was out, a 15-year contraci had been drafted, typed and signed. Eventually, Russ Blandford also shared in Northrop’s grat- itude. In mid-1972, Blandford decided to retire from the Armed Services Committee staff because of a lingering iliness that often made him fall asleep at his desk. So he wrote letters to about 12 defense contractors, including Northrop, asking for a long- term contract as a consultant. Blandford says he received an encouraging reply from Tom Jones a few weeks later. If Blandford's memory is correct, Jones’s letter noted that Bland- ford had been “very helpful” on the International Fighter project. (At one 1969 hearing, Blandford told Congressmen that “‘as sure as I’m sitting in this chair,” the International Fighter would be the cheapest way of equipping Asian and European allies.) Even so, Northrop decided it should not retain Blandford, ostensibly because he had just accepted a one-y ar consulting arrange- ment with a Northrop com- petitor. Instead, Northrop did the next best thing: It secretiv ende! Rivers may not have enriched himself from his association with Northrop, but he did make some political capital. Northrop consultant Frank DeFrancis set up a plan to reduce military Charter fares; Rivers took credit for it, and grateful servicemen honored him with a six-star cap arranged for Blandford to get a $1,000-a-month retainer for the next five years from an airline-booking firm owned by Frank DeFrancis. Then North- rop agreed to reimburse De- Francis for $40,000 of Bland- ford’s retainer. Northrop went to a lot of trouble to make its indirect payments to Blandford un- traceable. Instead of simply writing a check, DeFrancis was flown from Washington to New York in a Northrop jet on Dec. 13, 1972. There, he was handed 340,000 in cash by James Allen. In an interview, DeFrancis said he did not persuade Riv- ers to back the International Fighter. He also ridiculed the notion that his payments to Blandford might actually be back pay for services ren- dered. To support his denial, DeFrancis pointed out that he put the $40,000 in his airline-booking firm’s bank account, and then paid Bland- ford $1,000 a month by check. INo one in Washington, De- Francis insisted, would ever think of making a question- able payment in the form of a check. “I am not that stu- pid,’ DeFrancis said. Jones's version of these events is unavailable, since he has declined to be inter- viewed and has turned down an offer to read and comment on a draft of this article. As for Mendel Rivers, the record does not show that! he enriched himself from his association with Northrop, but thanks to DeFrancis, he did make some political capital. With all his heart, and all his political instincts, Mendel Rivers wanted to stand out as the serviceman’s best friend in Washington. One way he hoped to do so was to find a cheaper way for G.¥'s abroad to fly home for furlough. In April of 1969, the news- paper Army Times published a front-page article disclosing that a new nonprofit corpora- tion known as United Service Club had cut the military charter fare between New York and Germany to $69. Rivers and DeFrancis had cooked up the idea at a ‘Washington Redskins game’a few months earlier, and the founder and treasurer of Unit- ed Service Club turns out to have been Frank DeFzancis. But he was not mentioned in the Army Times story. Instead, all the credit wentto chairman Rivers, who was described as having encouraged “a group of businessmen” to incorporate the company to help the G.1.'s. One of Rivers’s proudest moments came in December, 1970, when a planeload of grateful servicemen sent him a hat with six stars, inscribed in gold braid with the words “To the big boss.” t took only one con- vinced partisan — Men- del Rivers —- to sell the International Fighter to the highly developed demo- cratic Government in Wash- ington, D.C. But in a feudal religious monarchy like Saudi Arabia, the politics of fighter Purchases were far more com- plicated. About 10 years age, North- rop concluded that the way to tap into the lush Middle East armaments market was to find a top-drawer interna- ticnal consultant, someone with the prestige to carry Northrop’s message straight to the palace. Kermit (Kim) Roosevelt was an impeccable choice: Grotonian. .. grandson of Theodore Roosevelt. . recently a vice president of Gulf Oil. . . author of the snappy, informative book “Arabs, Oil and History.”’ Best of all, he had known King the newly crowned monarch, since 1946. when Faisal was forsign min- ister. In 1946, at the age of 30, Kim Roosevelt was one of the two or three key Middle East specialists in U.S. intel- ligence, thanks to his wartime service in the O.S.S. Before he retired from Government serv- ice in 1957, Roosevelt was chief of the Near East section within the clandestine branch of the Central Intelligence Agency. After he joined Northrop as a business consultant in 1965, one of his first feats was his part in persuading Faisal to everrule his own defense min- istry’s decision to buy Lock- heed F-104 Starfighters instead of Northrop Freedom Fighters. First, he sent a cable to the King’s chief of protocol assert- ing that the Pentagon was up- set and hinting that improper motives were behind the de- fense ministry’s choice of Lockheed. Then he arranged a two-hour talk with King Faisal in October 1965. By Roosevelt’s account, the King was under the impres- sion that a U.S. Defense De- partment survey team had recommended the Lockheed Starfighter over all other available fighters in the world. Not so, replied Roose- velt: The Defense Department team suggested Lockheed only after the Northrop Free- dom Fighter had been exclud- ed from the competition by Prince Sultan, the Saudi De- fense Minister. In fact, said Roosevelt, the leader of the Defense Department team had warned Sultan that the U.S. “should not be blamed if some years from now the Saudi Arab Air Force finds itself with a highly expensive, ob- solescent plane on its hands which it is unable to maintain or operate.”” That seems to have been enough to kill Lockheed’s chances. But it wasn’t enough to persuade Prince Sultan to buy from Northrop. Instead of either American entry, the Saudis settled for the time be- ing on the British-made Light- ning interceptor. When Northrop made plans to sell its new International Fighter to the Saudis in 1970. the first order of business was to engage a Saudi sales agent who had good connec- tions with the Saudi Defense Ministry. The best choice, Roosevelt reported, would be a Beirut- based company called Triad Financial Establishment, con- trolled by Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi. Roosevelt aS not just guessing: He made his choice after consulting Prince Sultan. In October 1970, Northrop agreed to pay Triad a 4-per- cent commission on its Saudi zircraft sales. The following year, Prince Sultan’ signed contracts under the U.S. For- eign Military Sales Program to purchase 30 —_—sInternational New York Times Magazine, February 8, 1976 (continued) \f Fighters, along with 20 of the earlier Freedom Fighters con- figured as trainers. It was the first tirme the International Fighter had been sold to a Paying customer outside the United States. When Tom Jones flew to commander of the Royal Saudi Air Force, expected to be “**‘com- pensated’”” be paid $200,000 to $250,000 right away- Jomes”s response, he tater testified, was: ‘*‘North- rop meets its obligations.” But the alleged flow of funny money did not end with Hashim. Northrop believed at the time that it had also paid off his successor as com- mander of the Royal Saudi Air Force, General Zuhair, and these one-time payments were dwarfed by Khashoggi’s agzree- ment to assign one-eighth of hrs Northrop sales commis- sions to a company controlled by Prince Khalid bin Abdullah, amember of the Saudi Royal family who works as a com- mercial agent for foreign busi- ness im Saudi Arabia. In the end, there was some- thing for every participant. Saudi Arabia has now  in- creased its Northrop order to 110 fighters, plus a liong- term apreement on mainte- mance, training, construction and other services. Northrop stands to collect as much as $2.9 billion im revenues from this package. Triad has al- ready received $9.6 million in sales commissions from North- rop, amd hopes to coliect an- other $55 million in the future. Of Triad’s fees, Prince Khalid has coillecte@ at tleast S511i,- 337, and probably more than S1 million. tronically, the one who profited the least was Northrop’s Middle East strate- gist, Kim Roosevelt. All Roose- velt got was a raise in his annual comsulting fee. from $60,000 to $75,000. hat is unsettling about this is that it is mot clear that the wt. Ss. Government seriously disap- Proves of what Northrop did to get the orders. There have been ninme official investiga- tions into Northrop’s activi- ties. but no one has been charged with any offense connected with the Interna- tional Fighter. Nor has any Senator or other Govermment official gome on record as sug- gesting that a single contract should be canceled. Nor has the President proposed—or Congress adopted—any new law to prevent the same thing happening again. Although civil authorities have never penalized anyone im connection with the Inter- mationa} Fighter story, time gery.

Ermst & Ernst has been fired as North- rop’s auditor. For his part, Tom Jones is still running Northrop, at a salary of $286,000 a year. Last July, it appeared that the board might be on the verge of firing him, which would have left him with nothing to show for his spectacular career but a $120,000 a year pension and $500,000 in stock options. What seemed to undermine his pasition was 2 report by the Northrop execu- tive committee criticizing him for “*‘personal failures or errors Of judgment’ in his dealings with consultants. In response to the report, the board relieved him of one of his titles — chairman — while retaining him as président and chief executive officer. His tenure seemed shaky. however, because the board had already pledged, in set- tling a stockholders’ suit, to replace Jones as president by June’ 1976. After a while. the publicity diminished and Jones found his situation improving. He stil had the one title that matters: chief executive of- ficer. And the business page of The Los Angeles Times re- ported that because of North- rop’s ‘“‘outstanding financial performance,” there were strong signs that he would continue running the corm- pany, and might even reclaim his old title of chairman. Considering all that had happened, it was only fitting that the Northrop board of directors passed a resolution in November complimenting Jones and his subordimates for their “continued excellent performance, particularly in the face of a challenging and adverse economic environ- ment.” @ New York Times Magazine, February 8, 1976 (continued)"
