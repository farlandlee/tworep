The one-of-a-kind experimen- tal aircraft is a converted Boeing 767 jumbo jet with an 82-foot-long bulge that looks like an inverted bathtub welded atop the fuselage. It is the only military plane big- ger than a helicopter that carries a“‘U.S. Army’”’ insignia. Inside are a 7,000-pound tele- scope, a superfast computer anda crew of civilians who peer at modernistic terminals. The tele- scope’s infrared sensors are so sensitive that they must be cooled with helium and liquid nitrogen. : ““We did seriously consider deploying this aircraft,’’ said Army Lt. Gen. Robert Ham- mond, commander of the Army Strategic Defense Command in Huntsville, Ala. The crew consists of two Army officers and 23 civilian employees of the plane’s build- ers: Boeing, Hughes Aircraft and Honeywell. : Normally based at the Boeing plant in Seattle, the aircraft is at Andrews preparing to take opti- cal measurements during a mis- sile launch planned this month at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration facility at Wallops Island, Va.

Security Council could throw the coun- try into deep isolation and leave thousands of foreigners stranded there. But the boycott isn’t likely to dent vital trade and commerce or seriously impede the flow of Libyan oil, the liquid gold that has fi- nanced Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi’s socialist, dictatorial regime. “There’s no doubt the impact is very strong,” said Jeffrey Laurenti, director of multilateral studies at the United Nations As- sociation. “The cutting of air links is not a drastic economic measure, but it’s an enor: mous blow at [Gadhafi’s] legitimacy.” The Security Council 10-0 vote, with five abstentions, was only one more than the nine needed for passage. That raised questions about the strength of international will either to enforce the sanctions militarily, which the resolution authorizes, or to strengthen them if Libya still refuses to turn over six suspect- ed terrorists. Libya’s refusal to hand over the suspects, wanted in connection with the bombings of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 and of a French airliner over Niger in 1989, prompted Tuesday's binding U.N, action. The sanctions take ef fect April 15 unless Libya complies. The vote came as reports filtered out of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, that officials were hampering foreigners seeking exit vi- gas, raising the specter of foreigners being held hostage as they were in Iraq when broader sanctions were voted against it in 1990, Libya denied that it was blocking de- partures, American officials said they had no re- ports yet of the estimated 500 to 1,000 11.8 citizens in Libya having difficulty leaving. “Of course we would view with concern any moves by Libya to impede the free travel of foreign workers,” said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. “We have talked to the British government and to oth- ers and will be consulting further with other governments regarding the situation.” Mr. Laurenti said the air embargo would affect Libya's crucial oil industry, since the country relies on foreign technical expertise and on tens of thousands of foreign laborers, many of whom may try to leave if Libya does not block visas. And the sting of sanctions will not im- prove Colonel Gadhafi’s domestic political standing, which Mr. Laurenti said is at a low point already. “Given that Libyans have become accus- tomed to easy access to the outside world, its isolation would have not just symbolic im- pact on [Gadhafi’s} political legitimacy, but have repercussions in terms of public disaf- fection,” he said. , Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 1, 1992 \f"

Neither Mr. Bush nor mem- bers of his administration could say at a news conference exactly how much the price tag to U.S. taxpayers would be under the complicated plan to help stabi- lize the former republics’ wobbly economies and keep them from slipping into political chaos. But the president asked for bipartisan congressional back- ing, warning that if the demo- cratic revolution in the former Soviet Union fails, “it could plunge us into a world more dan- gerous in some respects than the dark years of the Cold War.” Initial, partial estimates point to a U.S. share of about $3.5 bil- lion in the $24 billion interna- tional package of aid to Russia, ‘which has undertaken the most sweeping reforms and would get most of the aid. In Moscow, the television evening news led with Mr. Bush’s announcement, a sign of its importance. Moscow broad- casts normally focus first on do- mestic events. The president acknowledged that Americans are not thrilled at the notion of spending dollars badly needed at home on a for- mer long-time enemy. “But I ask them to think of the consequences here at home of peace in the world,” Mr. Bush said. “We've got to act now. And if we turn away, if we do not do what we can to help democracy succeed in the lands of the old Soviet Union, our failure to act will carry a far higher price.” ‘Earlier Wednesday in Bonn, Germany, Chancellor Helmut el announced the same $24 billion aid plan for Russia spon- sored by the Group of Seven ma- jor‘industrial nations: Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the United States. Major elements of the overall program include: “> A $6 billion ruble stabiliza- tioh fund for Russia that would not have to be used as long as etonomic reforms work, but wotld be a reserve to engender confidence. The U.S. share of this G-7 plan would be $1.5 bil- ion, but it would not require a 19 32 ~ new appropriation. > An $18 billion program of aid to Russia, with $4.5 billion coming from international mone- tary institutions, $2.5 billion in the deferral of debt payments owed to Western creditors, and $11 billion split among the G-7 nations. The U.S. share of the lat- ter would be $2 billion. > A total of $1.1 billion in new U.S.. agricultural credit guarantees, which come on top of $3.75 billion made available to the former Soviet republics since January 1991. Of the new credits, $600 million would go to Russia and $500 million to other re- publics. > Elimination of Cold War re- strictions that impede private U.S. businesses trying to begin operations in the republics. > Broadened uses for the $500 million in aid Congress approved last year to include improving nu- clear power plants and defense industry conversion. The money has been limited to humanitarian aid and dismantling of nuclear weapons systems. > An unspecified proposal to continue humanitarian food and medical aid. > Extension of existing credit ‘programs to private businesses in the former Soviet Union to promote a free-market system. > More exchanges of Ameri- cans and citizens of the former Soviet republics, especially in the business world. The plan repackaged many | earlier proposals, including a long-stalled $12 billion request to Congress to replenish loan funds of the International Mone- tary Fund. Several senators quickly is- sued statements welcoming Mr. Bush’s initiative, but the admin- istration and proponents of aid face an uphill battle in an elec- tion year. “This will take a lot of commu- nication, a lot of advocacy, a lot of understanding, and that is going to take [the president's] skills as well as the skills of everybody else who believes this is important,” House Majority Leader Richard Gep- hardt (D-Mo.) said Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 2, 1992 \f"

But the government did not ab- solve Israel of broader allegations made this week in a separate audit, which said a ‘major recipient” of U:S: weapons has transferred U.S. technology for nearly a decade to countries not eligible to receive it. - Regarding the Patriot investi- gation, State Department spokes- woman Margaret Tutwiler praised Israel for cooperating with the 17- member team that returned from an’inspection mission last weekend having found no proof that Israel mishandled the Patriots. ' “As far as we are concerned, based on the results of this mission, the Israeli government has a clean bill of health on the Patriot issue,” she said. ~ ~Tutwiler refused to say whether investigators found that the intelli- — reports that prompted the stigation were false or in error, or whether they simply were un- able to prove them true. »-Technology transfer could be accomplished through photo- graphs, or simply by letting an unauthorized party have access to the missile, and evidence would not be found easily. It is not necessary to transfer the equipment itself. A separate, long-term audit conducted by the department’s in- spector general maintains the de- partment has not been vigilant in preventing technology transfers for years, and specifies one “major recipient” of American arms and technology as a serious offender. The public portion of the report does not name the country, but several news accounts on Thursday said unidentified officials con- firmed that Israel was involved. The report includes a list of countries visited in connection with the audit, and the only “major recipient” on that list is Israel. Israel receives about $1.8 billion in U.S. military aid every year, more than any other country. Asked repeatedly whether 4 el was involved, Tutwiler vette to answer on the basis that the information is classified. Tutwiler said the officials who leaked the allegations about the Patriots owe the U.S. and Israelj governments an apology.

National security advisor Brent Scowcroft had ordered “yarious agencies” to look into providing help, the official said, after former President Jimmy Carter telephoned the White House Situation Room to relay a plea for aid from the PLO. The PLO headquarters in Tu- nisia had asked Mr. Carter to transmit its request for a “‘hu- manitarian” satellite search for the downed jet, a Carter spokes- woman said. The plane crashed in a sandstorm near the border of Libya and Sudan and was miss- ing for 15 hours. The United States broke for- mal contacts with the PLO in 1990, so the group could not make a direct request to Washington. The situation is so diplomati- cally sensitive that PLO adviser Bassam Abu-Sharif’s#jhank you Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 9, 1992 to the Bush administration “for helping us in spotting that plane” drew repeated and vehement de- nials from the State Department that any aid had been given or even considered. Mr. Abu-Sharif expressed the gratitude in two telephone inter- views Wednesday morning with American television networks, after Mr. Arafat had been located with what were described as mi- nor bruises. Three crew mem- bers reportedly were killed. The crash site in Libya was located via a French satellite, ac- cording to news reports, and Pal- estinian soldiers from a nearby desert training camp rescued the survivors in all-terrain vehicles. “We’re willing to accept thanks, but in this case we just hadn’t provided the information yet,” said the administration offi- cial, who seemed to view the prospect of helping Mr. Arafat as a less weighty issue than did State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. “Contrary to various press reports, we were not involved in any effort to help locate the plane,” Ms. Tutwiler said. “No U.S. official had direct contact with the PLO, nor with the Liby- an government.” She did say that Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, an ad- viser to Palestinian peace negoti- ators who is not publicly affiliat- ed with the PLO, called a State Department official Tuesday night to discuss the situation.

Jesse Helms, R-N.C. And Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D- Md., told Baker he could get stronger backing around the na- tion by linking aid to Russia with new domestic programs. Both could be financed from de- fense budget funds and defined as part of the peace dividend, Sarbanes said. That the administration wants Congress to be an equal partner in this enterprise — sharing both kudos for what works and political blame if it backfires — was clear when Baker conceded the administra- tion already has the authority to carry out much of the pro- gram outlined in the legislation.

        "ocr_text": "Jewish lobbyists want anyone but Bush By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Vice President Dan Quayle was greeted by a banquet hall of Jewish political activists last week with an ovation, but his popularity didn’t rub off on his boss. Twice the huge bipartisan crowd booed and hissed when Quayle mentioned George Bush. The message from the three-day conference of the potent American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) was unmistakable: If Bush and Secretary of State James Baker hope to mend fences with America’s strong and politi- cally vibrant Jewish community by the Novem- ber election, it better be ready for some heavy lifting. “I’m a conservative Republican, and I’m deeply offended by Baker and by Bush,” said Richard Stadin, a businessman from New York. “T’'ll vote for Republicans for Congress, but I’m strongly considering voting for Ross Perot for president.” If the Texas billionaire doesn’t run as an independent, Stadin said, he expects to vote Democratic. “For Bush, the problem is the sum of all his parts,” Stadin said. Linking Israel’s request for $10 billion in loan guarantees to a halt in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories was the biggest complaint against the administration voiced by members of AIPAC, one of the strongest and most effective lobbies in Washington. Another grievous offense was the president’s language and his tone Sept. 12 — a date many of the 2,000 AIPAC conferees knew by heart — when he demanded that Congress delay action on the loan guarantees. Bush spoke derisively of a lobbying effort mounted that same day by Jewish organiza- tions, which attracted 1,200 people to the U.S. Capitol to urge passage of the guarantees. He characterized himself as ‘one lone guy down here” against all those lobbyists. Jewish Americans who gathered to plan BusH/BAKER Boos Why members of the American Israel Pub- lic Affairs Committee are angry: @ PRESIDENT BUSH linked Israel's re- quest for $10 billion in loan guarantees to a halt in Jewish settlements in the occu- pied territories. @ BUSH DEMANDED that Congress delay action on the loan guarantees and spoke derisively of a lobbying effort mounted by Jewish organizations to urge passage of the guarantees. He characterized himself as ‘one lone guy down here’ against all those lobbyists. @ JAMES BAKER, Bush's secretary of state, reportedly used an expletive and dismissed them as a group that ‘doesn't vote for us anyway.’ William Rapfogel, executive director of the Institute for Pub- lic Affairs, said Bush actually received about 30 percent of the Jewish vote in 1988 and that Jewish contributions were around 25 percent of the Bush-Quayle campaign coffers. policy and lobby on behalf of Israel-related issues this week said Bush implied they had no right to participate in mainstream political activities. They felt betrayed, they said, and feared the president cracked open a door to anti-Semitism. “T’ve never seen the left and right so unified in anger at an administration,” said William Rapfogel, executive director of the Institute for Public Affairs, which raises foreign and domes- tic policy issues at synagogues nationwide. “T think he (Bush) could have held to the same policies if the tone had been different, and you wouldn’t have had the same sense of betray- al,” he said. Also angering Jews is the report that Bake used an expletive and dismissed them as a group that “doesn’t vote for us anyway.” In fact, Bush received about 30 percent of the Jewish vote in 1988, Rapfogel said. More importantly, he estimated that Jewish contribu- tions came to around 25 percent of the Bush- Quayle campaign war chest. While Jews comprise only about 4 percent of the U.S. population, Rapfogel said they vote and contribute to political campaigns in much high- er numbers than most demographic groups. In a close election Jews could be a swing vote in 13 states with high Jewish populations, Rapfogel said, and those 13 states carry 51.8 percent of the electoral votes. The states are Florida, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Judging by comments from AIPAC confer- ees, and from similarly angry delegates to a meeting last week of the Anti-Defamation League, Rapfogel may be estimating high when he says no more than 12 percent of Jewish voters will side with Bush in November. Perot was an intriguing figure to many in the AIPAC crowd. At the same table where businessman Stadin sat at a luncheon program, at least four of the eight people expressed strong interest in the Texan. At least two considered themselves Republicans. Those who call themselves Republicans or independents aren’t turned off by the GOP in general, but by Bush in particular. Norman Lewin of Silver Spring, Md., said he tends to support Democratic positions but can back Republicans with amenable politics — including disavowing administration policy on Israel. And Quayle clearly was sent to the AIPAC gathering because he remains popular with the Jewish community, perhaps even more than among the general public. Palm Beach Post - April 12, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Air Force to fight security leaks with fax-tappers Monitors will sneak — copies of transmissions By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The Air Force is buying a new weapon to battle leaks: a $30,000 porta- ble fax-tapper. Whenever someone transmits a fax, the fax-tapping device attached to the phone line will sneak an electronic copy and store it in a laptop computer’s memory, Each of the new devices will enable an Air Force intelligence officer to monitor four telephones for “com- munications security” violations. Susan Hansen, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said last week that “there is no plan right at the moment” to install the de- vices in the Pentagon, whose top leaders have been outraged in recent weeks by leaks of classified policy documents to reporters. But she left open the possibility that some of them will be attached to sensitive military fax lines when the tapping devices are deliv- ered to the Air Force six months to a year from now. “There are a lot of things that are under review here,” she said after consulting with the Pentagon’s telecommunications office. Plans to buy 40 of the devices were dis- closed a few weeks ago in a contract notice from a procurement officer at Wright-Pat- terson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. When contacted, a spokesman referred in- quiries to the Air Force Intelligence Com- mand at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, which authorized the purchase. _ The Air Force Intelligence Command in- sisted that the devices will never be used for law enforcement purposes or even “investi- gations.” “The equipment is to be used for monitor- ing purposes only, to evaluate the security of Air Force official telecommunications,” said spokesman Dominick Cardonita. “The Air Force intelligence command does not inves- tigate.” Mr. Cardonita said that, for decades, Air Force personnel in sensitive installations ' have been on notice that their voice traffic on official lines is subject to “communications security” monitoring. The fax-tapper simply “enhances” the Air Force's ability to prevent “operational security” violations, he said. He estimated that the Air Force will pay $1.2 million under the contract, due to be let this June. That averages out to $30,000 for each fax-tapper, but Mr. Cardonita said the price includes maintenance and training. Douglas Lang, president of Washington's High Technology Store and an authority on security devices, said that, so far as he knows, the Air Force is the first government agency to issue an order for fax-tapping machines, Mr. Lang said he has heard from industry sources that 15 contractors have offered to sell such devices to Wright-Patterson. “Tt is one more invasion of privacy by Big Brother,” declared Mr. Lang, who predicted that the Air Force will use the devices mainly to catch anyone trying to leak commercially valuable information to contractors, Judging from the specifications, the Air Force wants a machine that can trace leaks wherever they might occur. Mr. Cardonita said the Air Force Intelli- gence Command will use the devices only when invited onto an Air Force base by a top commander, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 14, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Chaos, high risks await US. firms desiring to do business with ex-Soviets By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Mherican ‘businesses that venture into the former Soviet republics enter an “Alice-in-Wonderland —_ world where laws, taxes, contracts and profits are treated about as ra- tionally as the Queen of Hearts’ S. She used them for croquet mallets. Business executives trying to set up shop in the republics walk through the looking glass into a high-risk arena dominated by confusion and frustration, ac- cording to a report released Tuesday by Secretary of Com- merce Barbara Franklin, Ms. Franklin’s department held round-table discussions for nearly 100 companies in January and February to identify impedi- ments to trade and investment in Russia and the other republics. She said many firms are eager to open operations in the former Soviet Union. “But they are deterred by the chaotic business climate and enormous political and economic risks that are seen as dispropor- tionate to the likely rewards,” her report said. Instability, uncertainty For example, one American company that contracted to make cigarettes there found operations impossible when it suddenly faced a new, 1,000 percent tax. Another U.S. firm mounted a campaign to lobby a Russian offi- cial for a license. Suddenly it re- ceived a telex — at the very mo- ment it was hosting the minister on a visit to America — saying to ignore the official’s national min- istry and deal instead with re- gional enterprises involved. Such instability and uncer- tainty were cited as the No. 1 problem. As a result, American firms have invested only about $400 million in all the republics, com- pared with more than $1.3 billion invested in Hungary, the report said. And only 4 percent of the for- mer Soviet Union’s imports come from the United States. Hurdles to overcome Other problems impeding business include: > Financial troubles such as the inability to convert currency and failure to pay commercial debts already owed to U.S. com- panies from Soviet days. > No place to get up-to-date information on the republics, ei- ther there or in the United States. > Weak infrastructure, in- cluding bad transportation and telephone networks. > Lack of an official trade re- lationship between the U.S. gov- ernment and the new states. The Bush administration is trying to address some of these barriers in its new Freedom Sup- port Act. But so far the initiative remains vague: Ms. Franklin could not even say what specific programs her department would pursue, much less whether any new spending would be au- thorized.

        "ocr_text": "Marietta plant The C-130 is one of dozens of older weapons programs Mr. Bush wants funds cut for Lockheed planes could eg 46% of C-130 orders By Joseph Albright STAFF CORRESPONDENT Washington — As Congress was rushing to recess last week, President Bush tossed members - a new hot potato: a formal re- — quest to cancel $866 million in appropriations to buy Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport planes. If both houses go along, the Lockheed factory in Marietta, Ga., would be hit with a 46 per- cent cut in anticipated orders for the venerable aircraft. But the proposal is likely to meet stiff congressional resistance, spear- headed by partisans of National Guard and Reserve units across the country that expected to get most of the new planes. “Our hope is that the ration- ale that existed last year to ap- propriate the money for the Her- cules is still there,” said Dick Martin, director of communica- tions of Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co, Under the Bush proposal, Congress would reverse its deci- Workers at the Lockheed factory C-130 Hercules t in Marietta assemble a . President Bush asked Congress to cancel a $866 million appropriation to build more of them. sion last year to add funds to the current military budget to buy 29 C-130s for the Reserves, plus two C-230s configured as aerial re- fueling tankers for the U.S. Ma- rines. If Lockheed loses that business, it would be left with solid orders for only 33 more C- 130s — 25 for U.S, Reserve and active forces plus eight for for- eign purchasers} At the company’s current production rate of 36 planes a year, it would take just under one year to clean out the order book. Beyond that, the most de- pendable order on the horizon is a Pentagon-approved Air Force plan to buy eight C-130s a year through the year 2112. Those would gradually replace older C- 130s in the military fleet. Bush wants Congress to restrain in order to live within the mili- tary budget he announced in Jan- uary. Congressional plans to “ac- celerate” the replacement of the older C-130s were “unwarrant- ed,” Mr. Bush said in his mes- sage to Congress last week. Mr. Martin said that if Con- gress approves the Bush propos- al, the “worst-case scenario” is that Lockheed may be forced to slow the C-130 production rate at Marietta. That would mean few- er assembly-line jobs, but there was no estimate of how many. About 5,000 of the 11,000 workers at the Marietta factory owe their jobs to the Hercules, which has been flying soldiers and cargo since 1956. To prevail in Congress, Mr. Bush has to persuade both houses to approve the proposed “recision” of funds within the next 45 days that Congress is in session. If Congress ignores or re- fuses the request, the adminis- tration will have to spend the money or try to devise another delaying tactic and make another attempt to cancel the funding af- ter the Nov. 3 electign.

        "ocr_text": " Moneta fund bac reforms by ex-Soviets By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — International Monetary Fund directors have endorsed economic reforms by all but one of the 15S former Sovi- et republics, which should lead to full IMF membership within weeks and financial aid by July, the IMF said Wednesday. IMF Managing Director Mi- chel Camdessus suggested that his agency and the World Bank stood ready to provide about $45 billion over four years to Russia and the other former Soviet re- publics. ‘ But he warned that the agen- cy may have to cut short its ef- forts to help convert the one-time Communist states to free-market systems. The IMF will run out of money later this year, he said, unless Congress provides the $12 billion President Bush has re- quested to increase the U.S. con- tribution to the IMF. “The vote by the U.S. Con- gress is absolutely essential,’’ Mr. Camdessus said. Mr: Bush included the $12 billion request in his legislation to aid Russia and the other re- publics, even though the funds would not be earmarked solely | for them. Such appropriations for the IMF are not treated as normal budget expenditures and do not affect the U.S. budget deficit. Still, funding for the IMF, which uses funds contributed by mem- ber governments to promote world trade, is not considered a sure bet for passage in an election year when voters rebuke any- thing that smacks of foreign aid. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 16, 1992 All the IMF members have) been assessed the 50 percent quota increase, but many are not likely to authorize payment until the United States acts. Without the increase, Mr. Camdessus predicted that by the end of the year the IMF would have to stop disbursements. Of the 15S republics, Mr. Camdessus said only Azerbaijan has not gotten approval by IMF. directors. And he said that was due to communications problems rather than substantive differ- ences over the republic’s plans. The IMF members have been asked to vote on the 14 republics’ applications by April 27. Once the membership proc- ess is completed, a country must win acceptance of a detailed eco- nomic adjustment program that specifies what aid is needed and how it would be spent. The nation also agrees to maintain certain conditions, such as limiting its money supply and keeping down its budget deficit. Mr. Camdessus said the IMF staff is working with:the repub- lics on these plans, and should be ready to accept Russia’s pro- gram by July. Some other repub- lics, including the Baltic states, should follow soon. That would clear the way for ae first influx of IMF financial aid. iy Mr. Camdessus said that the IMF was considering providing $25 billion to $30 billion to Rus- sia and the other republics through 1995. That would be in addition to $12 billion to $15 bil- lion the World Bank expects to make available over this period, he said. While Mr. Bush and leaders of other industrial nations have outlined a $24 billion plan of aid to Russia, Mr. Camdessus said the other republics would need roughly $20 million in aid among them this year. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Veterans tell pamel of sajuriecs, Cover-up gaa WY WY LET scas study By Joseph Albright Cox News Service oe — A retired rgia sales manager told Wednesday how he has paid doc- tors $150,000 to fight a lifetime of ailments that began weeks after he exposed his skin to poison gas in a top-secret 1945 Navy experiment. “We drew straws to see who was going to wear the protective suits,” Richard Rawls told a scientific panel created by the Department of Veterans Affairs, “I was the one who drew the dungarees.” And with that, Rawls stepped into a gas chamber at the Wash- ington Navy Research Laboratory in March 1945, with only a light gas mask to keep him alive. He stayed inside for an hour. A few days later, the Navy gave the 17-year-old recruit a two-week leave as a “reward.” Before he walked out the gate of the Navy re- search complex, he was ordered to tell a false story if anyone won- dered why his skin looked burned. “T was told to say that I was in a hangar fire in Norfolk, Va.,” Rawls testified. Several weeks later, as Rawls was getting ready to ship out for an overseas tour, he suffered his first medical symptom: His foot swelled to the size of a shoe box. Poison had entered his body through his athlete’s foot lesions, a doctor at ’ another Navy base told him. Now his body is covered with 50 scars where skin cancers have been removed. His lymph glands and liver began bothering him in his early 20s. Rawls, 65, of Stone Mountain, Ga., was one of 20 World War II veterans who recounted decades of physical suffering and bureaucrat- ic pain from their chance encoun- ters with mustard gas or the blister gas Lewisite. More than half said it arose from their decision to volun- teer for the experiment the Navy said was so secret they couldn’t even discuss it with their wives or doctors. David Fallin of San Antonio said: “We were told we'd be shot if we talked. My wife never knew about it” until the Department of Veterans Affairs approved pay- ments for six ailments linked to the tests last year: asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, laryngitis and two types of chronic eye problems. Another veteran, Johnnie Ross, 69, of Robersonville, N.C., was still furious Wednesday that his service records covered up his participation. “In World War II, the Germans put the Jews in the gas tanks,” Ross testified. “The United States put their men in the gas tanks.” He told of a grisly scene in a bar- racks near the Navy gas chamber where sailors recuperated in Janu- ary 1945 after being exposed to pas. Gas-experiment volunteer David Fallin of San Antonio: ‘We were told we'd be shot if we talked.’ “Most of the boys were burned real bad and weren't able to keep their underwear on,” he said. “They were burned between their legs. Their scrotums were cracked open like boiling water had been poured on them.” A third participant, Glenn Jen- f Nokomis, Fia., said the rimenters put him in the gas chamber 11 times, leaving him _ with burns on his lungs and body. He, too, has skin cancer as well as chronic bronchitis and other ailments. The Navy has acknowledged that it did conduct tests involving poison gas during World War II, at a time when the military was try- ing to improve its protective gear in anticipation of gas warfare against Japan. But the subject is still so sensitive that the Navy's press office was unable Wednesday to get clearance to issue a public rationale. Veterans Affairs estimates that 2,000 Navy veterans were exposed to relatively high levels of mustard gas or Lewisite in the Navy Re- search Laboratory experiments. Wednesday’s hearing was part of a lengthy VA procedure to deter- mine which kinds of postwar ail- ments suffered by the test participants should be paid for by the government. The VA believes that nearly 60,000 other veterans were ex- posed to lesser levels of the same gases in World War II, some in parallel Army experiments and some in handling leaking gas canisters. To get an objective measure of the medical consequences of the gas exposures, the VA last year commissioned the National Acad- emy of Science to pull together a panel of outside doctors and biolo- gists to make a 16-month study.

Mr. Williams also said De- fense Department auditors are looking into whether to reopen the overbilling case, which re- volves around whether the tax- payers were charged too much for 534 Apache tank-killing helicopters made by the Mc- Donnell Douglas helicopter di- vision in Mesa, Ariz. At issue is whether the Army Aviation Systems Com- mand in St. Louis gave McDon- nell Douglas a sweetheart deal in December 1990 when it agreed to accept only $2.4 mil- lion to settle alleged over- charges that originally mount- ed up to $50.3 million — about 5 cents on the dollar — after a Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 17, 1992 eged overcharges string of routine audits by the Pentagon’s Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). One focus of the investiga- tion is why the contract files in St. Louis contain two signed versions of a key document that laid out the Army settlement of- fer that McDonnell Douglas ac- cepted. The first version, dated Dec. 20, 1990, is a letter on Army sta- tionery spelling out a tentative basis for settling all the over- charge claims. The second doc- ument, dated one day later, was retyped to omit one critical sen- tence — the one that said the agreement was only tentative. “Did someone press the wrong button on a word proces- sor, or why did the letter get changed — that is the $64,000 question,” said one military of- ficial. \f"

Backcharging is a seldom- performed exercise in which highly radioactive fuel rods are lifted from a storage pool, hauled across the ceiling of the reactor building and threaded into the reactor core. It is a sensitive maneuver be- cause, after being irradiated in a reactor, a fuel rod could generate enough heat to melt in midair if all the plant’s cooling systems were to fail. No such risk will ex- ist Wednesday, however, because the fuel rods involved in the re- hearsal won't be radioactive, The four members of the De- fense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which oversees military reactors, are flying to the South Carolina plant to observe the demonstration.

She confirmed that an inter- nal Air Force study has found that 65 percent of a group of 464 Tactical Air Command pilots said they used amphetamines at least once during the six-month buildup to the air strikes against Iraq. And during the six-week Operation Desert Storm, 57 per- cent of the same pilots said they used amphetamines, according to the study, first reported by Air Force Times. In most cases, the pilots took Dexedrine, the trade name for dextroamphetamine sulfate, the stimulant drug first patented in Britain in 1939. On March 13, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Merrill McPeak is- sued a worldwide order directing that flight surgeons could no longer dispense amphetamine pills, pending a “policy review” of the pros and cons of their us- age to keep fighter pilots alert. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 22, 1992 General McPeak’s order puts the Air Force in line with the Navy, which won’t permit its combat pilots to take amphet-. amines, Civilian airline pilots are also forbidden to take mood-al- tering medicines. Ms. Turner and two other Air Force spokesmen insisted that no crashes have been traced to the use of amphetamines. As for the five Air Force pilots known to have been involved in “friendly fire” accidents during the Gulf War, none had taken amphet- amines, according to Lt. Col. Mike Gannon. _ The pills were used under the supervision of flight surgeons by pilots of single-seat models who had to fly long missions with lit- tle rest, the Air Force said.

        "ocr_text": "Russian reactor avoids meltdown U.S. nuclear experts say power plant sustained fuel damage By Joseph Albright Cox News Service WASHINGTON — A nuclear fuel rod overheated and cracked, spreading radioactive gas inside a reactor during the recent atomic power plant scare in Russia, a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission expert said Wednesday. The Russian Ministry of Nucle- ar Power said at the time of the ac- cident that “the fuel assembly has not been damaged,” but James Taylor, the NRC executive direc- tor for operations, said the NRC learned through “proprietary channels” at a meeting in Finland that fuel damage did occur. It took only five seconds for the blockage of a single cooling water valve to cause the overheating in the Chernobyl-type reactor near St. Petersburg, Taylor said. In that time, the heat caused a ‘breach in a 20-foot-long “pressure tube” — one of 1,661 zirconium and steel cylinders through which boiling water flows to cool the re- actor’s uranium-oxide fuel. “The biggest concern for many Western scientists is that if you have a multiple pressure tube fail- ure and you don’t get the reactor rods in, you have essentially an- other Chernobyl-type situation,” Taylor said at a briefing. Fortunately, he said, in this case a pressure gauge inside the reactor vessel almost immediately tripped and dropped the control rods, shutting down the nuclear reac- tion. The pressure gauge reacted to a mixture of steam and radioactive gases spreading in the reactor from the break in the pressure tube. During the 1986 Chernobyl inci- dent, the safety system failed to detect a similar failure. Tempera- tures continued to rise until the fuel core began to melt, releasing a cloud of radioactivity outside. Russian authorities have tried to minimize the seriousness of the March 24 incident 60 miles from St. Petersburg. Under questions from NRC chairman Ivan Selin, Taylor said this was the first con- firmation that the St. Petersburg reactor suffered “fuel damage.” Taylor’s account was based mainly on a report by Finnish in- vestigators that was obtained by an NRC staffer at a meeting in Finland within the past week. The St. Petersburg reactor is one of 15 Chernobyl-type reactors that were still functioning in Rus- sia, Lithuania and Ukraine. The recent accident reinforced fears about the safety of those reactors. The former Soviet republics are making some progress in improv- ing operations at many of their nu- clear plants, but the latest accident shows that the old reactors will re- main dangerous as long as they are in service, the officials said.

        "ocr_text": "Restart of embattled reactor clears critical legal hurdle By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Top nuclear overseers gave the green light Friday to the restarting of the K reactor at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina after hear- ing testimony that there is only a “low” probability of a “large” leak of tritium. The plant’s leading environ- mentalist critics agreed later that the Defense Nuclear Facili- ties Safety Board’s action lifted the last legal obstacle that could prevent Energy Secretary James Watkins from ordering another attempt at making the dormant military reactor “go critical.” _ “The only thing that could possibly block restart now is public sentiment downstream,” said Tom Clements, a Green- peace activist from Atlanta. Bri- an Costner, director of the South Carolina-based Energy Re- search Foundation, acknowl- edged that the Energy Depart- ment has the power to start the reactor despite his group’s pend- ing lawsuit. | After three hours of public discussion of the “what-ifs” of restarting the reactor, the four members of the safety board vot- ed unanimously against recom- mending that the start-up be postponed for further repairs. Because of their stature with Congress as senior atomic wise men, their recommendation for postponement would have been ‘tantamount to a stop-work order. Andrew Stadnik, a member of the board’s technical staff, said the Energy Department will de- cide “in the next week or so” to switch on the K reactor’s heavy cooling water pumps — the first step in the countdown toward criticality. Energy Department spokes- woman Debbie Smith declined to say how soon Mr. Watkins might decide to ‘start the reactor. She said that as soon as the secretary reaches a decision, he will call a series of public briefings in Au- gusta, Ga., and other communi- ties near the 300-square-mile nu- clear reservation. The cooling water pumps — designed to drive tritium-con- taminated heavy water through the reactor tank to drain off the heat of atoms splitting — won’t be activated until after the public ‘meetings, she said. Key to the safety board’s deci- sion Friday was its conclusion that Westinghouse, the site man- _ager, has drastically improved its techniques for detecting tritium leaks over the last three months.

        "ocr_text": "U.S. plans to spend billions on Russian aid — at no cost By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — The Bush adminis- tration has offered the country a spring miracle: supplying multibillions of dollars in aid to Russia and the other former Soviet republics at relatively low cost to the American taxpayer, Administration officials admit they — want to spend about $1.5 billion in direct aid to the former Soviet republics this fiscal year and next, mostly for emergen- cy food and medicine, technical aid, and for dismantling the nuclear arsenal. But President Bush has dropped on Congress a confusing scheme, packaged as the Freedom Support Act, which calls as well for billions more in loans and credits and expansions of existing programs that show no price tag, Congressional analysts are scratching their heads, trying to figure out what the administration's vague legislation would do and whether much of it in fact would be a miraculous supplement at no charge. “Tt’s not very clear,” one congressional Soviet expert said. “Nothing has been costed out.” Most analysts say the bill’s centerpiece increases the U.S. contribution to the In- ternational Monetary Fund by $12 billion. It is real money that the U.S. Treasury would have to produce on demand once the commitment to the IMF is made, But it is considered an “off-budget” expenditure so it wouldn’t affect the budget or, technical- ly at least, the mammoth budget deficit. That is because whenever the IMF draws on a member’s committed money, it simultaneously issues the member an as- set in an equal amount, on which the member in turn can draw under narrow circumstances of need, The asset also earns interest, so contributions to the IMF are considered an investment akin to pur- chasing a stock or certificate of deposit. “So we have an income-generating as- set. It’s not as though we've actually spent the money,” said Jonathon Sanford, a foreign affairs specialist for the Congres- sional Research Service. “We have a piece of paper that is of equal value. But it’s not very usable, We can’t spend that money.” Although the U.S. Treasury has to bor- row to come up with its contributions, the interest it pays has been less than the interest the IMF pays in return for use of the money, according to a CRS issues paper. It said the United States made a net financial gain of $628 million a year dur- ing the 1980s from its IMF participation. A complicating factor is that the IMF is not obligated to use this $12 billion for loans to Russia and the other former Soviet republics, although much of it un- doubtedly would go to them. Indeed, the $12 billion increase was proposed in 1990 to meet other world needs for IMF financ- ing. That was before the Soviet Union disintegrated and created multiple addi- tional demands for IMF help. Congress turned down the $12 billion increase last year, but may be more dis- posed to accept it in the cloak of aid to the democratizing former republics. Another key section of the Freedom Support Act seeks congressional endorse- ment for using up to $3 billion for the U.S. share of currency stabilization money for the former republics. Proponents say this is vital to help the republics convert their shaky economies to free market systems. As envisioned now, this also would be an IMF project. ; Not only is no new money needed, but the administration doesn't even need coh- gressional approval to tell the IMF to act. So why does it cloud up the Freedom Support Act? This and similar requests for unnecessary congressional endorsements look like an administration effort to draw Congress into full partnership in the aid program — a partner that would accept kudos for success as well as blame if all this money ends up swallowed in a black hole of failure. oye The administration and Congress thus would walk hand-in-hand toward a politi- cal cliff, in this election year that finds voters ill-disposed toward foreign aid. Yet other portions of the Freedom Support Act would give the administration sweeping powers to shuffle money, make loans and otherwise aid the former Soviet republics with little accounting. .

But the F'-22 also appears to enjoy Defense Secre- tary Dick Cheney’s highest priority among the four, as measured by the money he’s allocated in next year’s budget. Last year, the General Accounting Office estimated that in the long run, taxpayers will pay $103.7 billion, including inflation, to buy the fleet of 644 F'-22s the Air Force wants by the year 2015, That estimate is likely to grow at the hearing Aspin has scheduled for Wednesday. ing versions of the F-18. @ The Multi-Role Fighter, sought by the Air Force as an “affordable” replacement for the F-16 to drop bombs as well as win dogfights. It wouldn’t be as long-range or as stealthy as the F-22.

To many budget watchers, the F-22 and the F/A-18 appear to be better positioned than the others to survive the competition for dwindling defense dollars — because they are furthest along in development and al- ready have well-knit networks of military and political supporters. the government. _ The Pentagon normally states the price of weaponry in “current dollars,” thus adopting a bookkeep- ing assumption that _ inflation doesn't count. In contrast, Aspin will stress the prices in ‘‘then-year dollars,” factoring in inflation esti- mates as is done in many non- military spending projects. ‘“Then- year” prices means what Congress will actually have to appropriate in the years when the bills come due. In an illustration of how dra- matically the two sets of price tags can differ, the Air Force told Con- gress last year that $64.6 billion was the “current dollar” cost of the F-22, while the then-year cost was $108.3 billion. “Using then-year dollars for comparison of programs is very misleading,” the Pentagon said.

' A special unmarked Energy ‘Department warhead truck ‘would arrive about once a month ‘at the Savannah River Site carry- ‘ing 60 shipping drums, accord- ting to an in-house safety report ‘on the project by the Savannah ‘River Laboratory, the depart- ‘ment’s Savannah River field ‘office. * Packed inside each drum VATTIFUnE hold 1,190 of the bomb core con- tainers, the laboratory report said. But capacity would have to drop to 996 if aisles are left to al- low inspectors to approach each container. “Unloading a highway trans- port vehicle is expected to take eight hours,” the report said. } “The maximum time allowed for would be a hollow, softball-sized hunk of plutonium that has been machined and coated with beryl- lium metal. These so-called “pits” would come in two sizes, one for a B-61 Air Force tactical nuclear bomb and the other for a W-68 Navy Poseidon nuclear missile warhead. After being weighed and counted, ‘the storage drums would be wheeled into a hurri- cane-proof vault that was built at Savannah River Site in 1986. The vault, originally used to store uranium fuel assemblies for Navy nuclear submarines, has been empty since 1990. The vault could theoretically temporary storage in the corri- dor or [loading] dock is 16 hours after the first container is placed there.” Currently, most of the na- tion’s retired nuclear warheads and plutonium bomb cores are stored at two main sites: in con- crete “igloos” at the Energy De- partment’s Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, and in the Air Force’s underground munitions storage complex, a secret facility big enough to have. 15 separate blast doors at Kirtland Air Force Base near Albuquerque, N.M. Debbie Smith, the Energy Department spokeswoman, said “there is no immediate intention to store [plutonium] pits at Sa- vannah River.” But the Savannah River field office’s 18-page draft environ- mental assessment of the possi- bility of reopening the naval fuel vault for storage of plutonium noted that “other active DOE plutonium storage facilities have reached full capacity. Therefore, a need exists for additional stor- age capacity.” The study said that during “normal operations” the Savan- nah River vault would cause no radioactive dose to the public. Even if the storage building were hit by a tornado or an earth- quake, it concluded, the resulting off-site dosage would be too small to affect the public. The plutonium pits are less hazardous than intact bombs be- cause they lack the high-explo- sive charges that could explode and scatter highly toxic plutoni- um dust, the study said. “We are still reviewing the re- port,” commented Jim Setser, chief of program coordination of Georgia’s environmental protec- tion division, in a telephone inter- view. “A lot of the information we would like to see has not been provided, For instance, we would like to see more about the impacts on the environment if there is a transportation accident.” Rick Ford, a Savannah River spokesman, said comments from the states are due May 1. He said their reactions will then be fold- ed into a report to Energy De- partment headquarters in Wash- ington. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 28, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Israeli, Syrian concessions reopen talks By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON ~— Two promising developments opened the fifth session of Mideast peace talks Monday, when Isra- el proposed “pilot municipal elections” for Palestinians and Syria said it would end travel restrictions on Syrian Jews, The two signs of progress in six months of slow-moving talks accompa: nied a softer, less strident tone in public percent of Palestinians who live in municipal areas. “Once we have a national gov- erning authority in place, we will deal with municipal elections,” Ashrawi said. The framework for Palestinian- Israeli talks calls for a Palestinian autonomy plan to be negotiated Within a year of October’s opening of the peace process. The action taken by the Syrian government in Damascus, appar- ently without warning to Syrian negotiators, was an unexpected unilateral move likely to improve the atmosphere of the talks. About 4,500 Syrian Jews have not been permitted to leave the country unless they leave one fam- ily member behind and post a bond rhetoric from Arabs and Israelis, The proposal for municipal elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip falls far short of the full autonomy plan the Palestinians intro- duced earlier. But the fact that this is termed a “pilot” project indicates the Israelis envision broader elections, “Tt is a proposal we think will set the stage for further development in this area,” said Israeli Deputy Minister Ben- of up to $1,000 each, That effective- ly has kept them from emigrating. “Any Syrian can travel abroad whenever he chooses, whether he is a Jew or non-Jew,” explained Bushra Kanafani, spokeswoman for the Syrian negotiators. “If he chooses to come back, he may.” Syria also recently released two Syrian Jewish brothers who had heen arrested for traveling to Isra- el, which still remains illegal, and it erased other regulations restrict: ing the purchase and sale of prop- erty in Syria by Jews, Kanafani said her delegation was informed of the change in regulations today by telephone, and she denied that it was connected to the peace talks. jamin Netanyahu, He called municipal elections “a beginning to something that will follow.” Although Israel has permitted small- scale elections for positions such as Chamber of Commerce offices and uni- versity boards, it has forbidden elections to political offices in the territories since 1976, Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said her delegation will consid- But Israeli and American offi- cials welcomed the policy changes, State Department spokeswom- an Margaret Tutwiler said the new policies “should improve the gener: al atmosphere and build confidence in the Middle East,” American leaders have pressed Syria to make the changes, which came shortly after Syrian Presi- dent Hafez al-Assad met Syria's rabbi and other Jewish leaders. It was his first meeting with them since 1976, Israeli negotiator Yossi Ben- Aharon said Israelis have asked for such changes throughout the six months of peace talks with Syria, “If this is Syria’s response to our repeated requests of Syria to et Israel's proposal but complained it \"does not address real issues,” She maintained repeatedly that the central issue of the peace talks is trans- ferring authority from Israel to Pales- tinians, To do that, she said, the Palestin- ians need to elect representatives to an entity that represents all their people in the occupied territories, not just the 30 let the Jews go, then of course it isa positive development and we will consider it as such, and we hope that that will be another step which Will move us forward toward un- derstanding,” he said. Syria’s actions had no immedi- ate effect on Monday's negotia- tions, with neither side reporting concrete progress. Israelis also continued talks Monday with nego- tiators from Lebanon and Jordan, which have been somewhat smoother than sessions with the Palestinians and Syrians. The Israelis announced they would meet only until Thursday, then leave so they can be home in time for two national holidays next week. They raised the prospect of convening a sixth round of talks in Rome before the June 23 Israeli elections. Palm Beach Post - April 28, 1992 \f"

The “meter is used by the control room staff to gauge whether the heat from an atomic chain reaction is spreading evenly throughout the reactor core. Mr. Watkins seemed confi- dent that this latest glitch can be surmounted quickly. He es- timated that the reactor will be ready to start “in the next few weeks.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 29, 1992 His deputy in charge of military programs, Richard Claytor, went on to tell House Armed Services Committee members that the latest prob- - lem surfaced within the last few days. Mr. Claytor said the contractor who supplied the device in the 1950s is unsure whether it will function accu- rately while the reactor is run- ning at medium power levels. Mr. Claytor said there is no question the flux monitor will yield accurate readings if the nuclear reactor runs at a 10 percent power level or less. But he said it may have a wid- er margin of error as power rises toward the authorized limit of 30 percent. During its first three dec- ades of operation, the K reac- tor ran at much higher power levels, approaching 100 per- cent power. At higher power, the monitor was accurate. The Energy Department has scheduled this summer’s test run to prove the soundness of the K reactor to make tritium gas, a radioactive component of nuclear weapons that has to be replaced periodically. \f"

Merrill McPeak told the House Armed Services Committee. He said the most likely rea- son the F-22 prototype lurched into its eerie roller-coaster crash landing Saturday was a software glitch in the plane’s flight-control computer. “If it is something [like that], it is a relatively straightforward software fix,” General McPeak said, A contributing factor, he ex- plained, was that the jet “was heavy on fuel” when its pilot re- turned prematurely to land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

If General McPeak’s account is borne out by a high-level Air Force accident investigations team, it would be good news for the Air Force and Lockheed Corp. at a time when some mem- bers of Congress are sharpening their budget axes, looking for the most vulnerable defense projects to slice. Asked whether the Air Force will have to build and fly anoth- er prototype to make sure the F- 22 is stable, General McPeak re- plied: “We were about five weeks from taking it into the hangar and parking it.” The Air Force explanation seemed to satisfy the committee members, even though Chair- man Les Aspin (D-Wis.) and several others warned that tight budgets inevitably will force the Air Force and Navy to scale back their appetite to buy fight- er airplanes over the next two decades. “I am very worried about this affordability issue,” Mr. As- pin told the military witnesses. He estimated that, not including inflation, the four pending Air Force and Navy fighter planes will cost taxpayers $350 billion over the next two decades. The Air Force hopes to buy 648 F-22s starting in the mid- 1990s, which would provide two decades of high-paying industri- al jobs at the Lockheed plant in Marietta, and the Pratt & Whit- ney engine plant in West Palm Beach, Fla. Said Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.): “Any crash is disturbing, and this is the case with the crash of the F-22 prototype. We have to keep in mind, however, that the purpose of the test program is to identify and resolve flaws in the design or performance. All the aircraft that performed well in the Gulf War experienced diffi- culties in their test programs.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - April 30, 1992 \f"

Fred Harris, a member of the 1967 Kerner Commission that studied the chain of urban explo- sions in the mid-1960s. “They have to be much more sensitive to com- munity problems, and emphasize training on the excessive uses of force.” “What we have in America now is a powder keg,” said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who testified before the Kerner Commission as a field representative of the Southern Re- gional Council. “All across Ameri- ca, community leaders including mayors and police officials should be meeting with local groups, but this should be an ongoing dia- logue. And there must be strong moral leadership at the highest level of government.” The commission's report, pro- voked by a chain of racial disorders in 23 American cities in 1967, stunned America with a starkly simple conclusion: “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal.” Commission Chairman Otto Kerner, former governor of Illinois, is dead, but the half-dozen surviv- ing commissioners and their staffs have remained involved. A quarter of a century later, most of them believe the ghetto lines have hardened while whites have grown more indifferent. And they say the underlying conditions that exploded into rioting then have gotten ever more desperate. Their prescriptions for the '90s seemed to fall into two categories: how to dampen the immediate rage, and what to do about an en- demic urban sickness if things qr1i- et down. Their consensus is that every city’s elected leaders in the next few days must reach out to black community leaders. “Virtually every riot that we’ve ever experienced in the United States has been sparked by some incident \"between the local com- munity and the police,” said Wash- ington lawyer David Ginsburg, who was executive director of the commission. He and others agreed the bur- den of leadership also falls on the White House. “This is a time when our nation needs leadership and a time to lis- ten carefully to those who aspire to lead us,” said former New York Re- publican Mayor John V.

But a group of female leaders visiting from the former Soviet republics said the argument won’t get far. ; “We know democratic forces in Ameri- ca are trying to solve the racial problems,” said Marina Sallier, a member of the Rus- sian Parliament from St. Petersburg. “I am sure the Communists will not succeed with this.” Indeed, said Ms. Sallier, a geologist and political reformer, the argument can be turned against Communists trying to ob- struct change. “There is a parallel between the racial situation [in the United States] and our problems of nationalities,” she said. “When the Communists raise this, we will say, ‘Look at yourself. You created the na- tionalities problem in Russia.’ ” Ms. Sallier and 11 other women finish- ing a two-week tour of America, most of them officials elected to parliaments and city halls, may find that ugly images of Los Angeles rioting will be their most salient memories of life in the United States. RICK McKAY/Washington Bureau Twelve female leaders from former Soviet republics discuss their new appreci- ation of the role of American women during a meeting Monday in Washington. But for these ‘political leaders hunting ideas and plans and partners to help raise their own people from an economic and po- litical morass, the violence that burned through America will not be their most im- portant memory. At a summing-up session Monday, the women all spoke of a new appreciation for the roles women play in America and an awe of the services this country’s private and public institutions provide. They may not be able to duplicate it, but they hope to adapt it. The dozen officials and educators were brought here by Peace Links, a non-profit organization founded in 1982 by Betty Bumpers, wife of Sen. Dale Bumpers (D- Ark.), to dilute the threats of nuclear war and Cold War through personal communi- cation. This group spent three days in Wash- ington, then split into teams that visited ei- ther North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arkan- sas, New Mexico, Montana or Minnesota. “We heard that women are confronted with a lot of problems here. Now we have seen these and understand they are much like the ones we have at home,” said Pati- mat Churlanova, a member of the Parlia- ment in Russia’s autonomous republic of Dagestan. She and others saw that these problems can be addressed. They spoke effusively of services they saw for children, whether the Arkansas center for handicapped children — impressive to the Russians for providing a wheelchair to each child who needed it — or Pennsylvania neonatal units that save the tiniest newborns. “I was really knocked out by some of the projects carried out by people’s organi- zations,” said Ms. Sallier, citing a project for abused children that she would like to see emulated in Russia. Galina Negrustueva, an English profes- sor in Moscow and a leader of the Women’s Union of Russia, had never heard of pri- vate day care centers. She is carrying home details of how the state regulates and li- censes child-care operations to keep them safe and healthy. The women also looked at how the dem- ocratic process works, and seemed sur- prised to see so many American women holding elective and appointed positions. Ms. Negrustueva commented on the openness of the system, after finding wom- en’s organizations working closely with the Legislature in Montana and watching a court hearing on misuse of power by public ficials.

        "ocr_text": "Medicare snafu resurfaces to haunt Perot By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — While Ross Perot was presiding over Elec- tronic Data Systems Corp. 12 years ago, the company’s reputa- tion for hard-charging efficiency was tarnished when federal audi- tors concluded that it had im- properly thrown -away many clues to possible Medicare fraud and abuse. Now that Mr. Perot is an un- declared candidate for presi- dent, their report has resurfaced in a government library, raising long-forgotten questions about the company’s stewardship of Medicare records in Illinois. Mr. Perot, who has since sold EDS, was unavailable for com- ment, but a former associate played down the importance of the finding and stressed that the contract was not Mr. Perot’s di- rect responsibility. “It was an error on our part and we fixed it,””, EDS Vice Presi- dent Bill Wright said in a tele- phone interview from Dallas. “But it wasn’t anything that would be so serious as to invite a reading that there was potential fraud and abuse.” He said Mr. Perot, as EDS chairman, gave orders to his sub- ordinates to “fix it’? after he learned of a wave of consumer complaints in Illinois about the company’s handling of back- logged Medicare claims. Mr. Wright said Mr. Perot didn’t get involved i in the details of how the ‘Ross was a bit removed from that as chairman,” Mr. Wright said. “That was one of many, many contracts we had. Certainly he was involved because of the size of the Illinois contract and the difficulty we were having with it. But he didn’t exercise any day-to-day operational responsi- bility for that contract.” The 1980 report by the Gen- eral Accounting Office arose out of a $41.8 million fixed-fee con- tract EDS won to streamline the processing of Medicare claims in Illinois. The company took over the paperwork in April 1979. Five months later, 454,000 Medicare claims had piled up in the company’s Illinois offices. To cut down on the mail back- log, EDS supervisors ordered the destruction of what they viewed. as unneeded duplicate paper- work. But the federal auditors lat- er said important records were lost in those “‘purges” of records. Specifically, the GAO report criticized EDS for discarding “payment explanations” that were returned to the company’s mail room each day by the Postal Ser- vice. They were marked “undeliv- erable” after mail carriers couldn’t locate the doctors and el- derly patients who had filed them. The GAO said it was unable to determine how many undeliver- able forms were tossed out. But it quoted estimates from EDS man- agers that for the first year of their contract, from 800 to sever- al thousand returned documents poured into the EDS mailroom every day. “The GAO said that to comply with federal anti-fraud guide- lines, EDS should have sent out tracer forms and taken several other steps to find out why the “payment explanations” never reached those listed in the EDS computers as having filed claims. In a footnote, the GAO audi- tors explained why such steps were necessary: “Much of the fraud and abuse found in the Medicare program in the past has been identified by beneficia- ries, upon receipt of [a payment explanation] for services paid on their behalf, notifying program officials that no such services had been rendered.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 7, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "US. plans floating tank force in gulf area It would allow quick reaction By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The U.S. Army plans to dispatch a perma- nent floating force of 158 heavy tanks and armored personnel carriers to the Indian Ocean off Saudi Arabia as a long-range preparation for any future war in the Persian Gulf region, officials disclosed Friday. The Army chief of staff, Gen. _ Gordon Sullivan, is considering ‘which Army brigade should be designated to fly and meet the floating tanks in case of another Operation Desert Shield, a senior Army planner said. The exact timetable for de- ploying the floating tank depot remains classified, but the target date apparently is some months off. The object of the plan devised by the Army’s war plans division ‘first heavy armored unit — is to minimize what the Defense Department recognized as a “window of vulnerability” in its recent post-mortem on the con- duct of the Persian Gulf War. For more than a month after the first U.S. lightly armed infan- try troops and Marine units land- ed in Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon report said, they “lacked the combat power to defeat an Iraqi attack.” According to the report, the the 24th Infantry Division (Mecha- nized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. — began loading its equipment in the port of Savannah on Aug. 10, 1990, four days after the military received the order to deploy. But because of a shortage of ships and the long sea transit, this first U.S. heavy armored unit did not move into fighting position until Sept. 23 — six weeks later. Under the new plan, the Ma- rines and an Army light infantry division — presumably the 82d Airborne from Fort Bragg, N.C. — would keep their traditional roles as the first ground troops to land if there were another major “regional contingency.” - Within a week or so, these first light infantry soldiers would be backed up with a limited num- ber of Marine tanks from floating Marine depots, just as happened in Operation Desert Shield. What is different is that the Army is making provisions to / field its own heavy armor much ‘faster. The new plan calls for Navy cargo ships to deliver 100 Army M1A1 Abrams tanks and 58 Bradley fighting vehicles to the scene of a Persian Gulf crisis within about two weeks of the presidential “go” order. As many as 550 more heavy tanks are supposed to arrive by fast sealift ships from American ports two weeks later. This wave would consist either of two heavy armored divisions or one ar- mored division and a helicopter assault division. The plan earmarks three divi- sions as available for this “surge” deployment within 30 days of the first orders. They are the 24th Mech, the ist Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, Texas, and the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky. And by 75 days after the start of a crisis, five combat-ready Army divisions could be in place, either in Saudi Arabia or virtual- ly anywhere else in the world. When there is no crisis, the Army’s floating armor depot probably would remain tied up at the U.S. base on the island of Die- go Garcia in the Indian Ocean, an official said. That also is the nor- mal base for the Marine pre-po- sitioned ships. The Pentagon budgets for this year and next year contains $91 million to buy big, fast, roll- on-roll-off ships, and more mon- ey will be sought in future bud- gets, officials said. The plan calls for 20 more of these fast sealift ships for the Army in this decade — some for the floating tank depot and some for “surge” sealift of Army divi- sions from the United States to a foreign war zone. Though dedi- cated to the Army’s use, they would be part of the Navy’s sea- lift command. Because the Army's total strength will be shrinking, it won’t have to buy more tanks and Brad- leys to fill the floating tank depot. The “heavy force afloat,” as it is designated in Army docu- ments, serves as a partial substi- tute for a U.S. weapons storage depot that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to get from Saudi Arabia in negotiations fol- lowing the defeat of Iraq. The Cheney plan would have allowed the United States to leave behind about 275 heavy tanks and enough other equipment for a full tank division. But Saudi officials rejected the idea, apparently out of fears that a permanent U.S. base would stimulate opposition oe Son ER Islamic el- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 10, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "U.N. peacekeepers kept at bay by fighting in Bosnia Efforts to end strife faltering By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU ~ Washington — U.N. Secre- tary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali vowed Wednesday that no U.N. troops will be sent to the bit- ter battlegrounds of Bosnia-Her- appovine unless warring factions ' what once was Yugoslavia agree to stop fighting. In an appearance at the Na- tional Press Club, Mr. Boutros- Ghali also said he had ordered | peacekeepers for Croatia to move out of their embattled headquarters in the Bosnian cap- ital, Sarajevo. At the same time, in a report to the U.N. Security Council, he raised fears that the peacekeeping contingent will have to be withdrawn entirely. Conditions in Bosnia contin- _ ued to deteriorate, with State De- partment spokeswoman Marga- _ ret Tutwiler describing intensive ‘street-to-street fighting instigat- ed by Serb forces and widening shortages of food and medicine. Serb troops also were increasing attacks in eastern Croatia, Ms. Tutwiler said. Croatia and Bosnia-Herzego- vina were republics of Yugosla- via, but they voted to become in- dependent and have won interna- tional recognition. Serbia, the republic that dominated affairs .in Yugoslavia by controlling the army and the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, has been trying to re- claim pieces of the breakaway _republics by force. Extensive battles between .Serb and Croat troops were _largely quieted earlier this year by a cease-fire, but new fighting has erupted with Serb assaults on Bosnian cities. . The U.S. ambassador to Bel- grade, who has been recalled to _ protest the role of Serb soldiers in the fighting, hung on another .day Wednesday as he tried to ar- . range two emergency convoys of relief supplies for Bosnia, Ms. Tutwiler said. “We understand that in Sara- jevo food supplies are desperate- ly short to non-existent,” she said. The city has no water or elec- tricity, she said, and residents have begun burying the dead in a town park because they cannot get to cemeteries. The peacekeepers that Mr. Boutros-Ghali pulled out of Sara- jevo were not sent to perform du- ties in Bosnia but were the un- armed sentries assigned to main- tain the cease-fire in neighboring Croatia. Their headquarters was placed in Sarajevo before the fighting escalated there, because it was a neutral location between Croatia and Serbia. Mr. Boutros-Ghali said he re- moved “the bulk of” the peace- keepers from Sarajevo but was not taking them out of the region. About 5,000 soldiers have been sent to Yugoslavia under the U.N. flag so far, but at least 15,000 are supposed to be sent for Croatia alone. Croatia might have to be pulled out entirely because of renewed fighting between Croats and eth- nic Serbs who live in Croatia and maintain militias there. The U.N. forces there are supposed to guard enclaves of Serbs living in Croatia, but he said many Serbs live outside the zones and fear for their safety once federal troops of the old Yu- goslav army are withdrawn. Mr. Boutros-Ghali made clear that there is no chance for peacekeeping forces to be placed in Bosnia soon, as some Europe- ans have suggested. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 14, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Gorbachev pleads with Congress » oO aid to Russia By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU WwW — Denied a ma- jor congressional forum while he was Soviet president, private cit- izen Mikhail Gorbachev drew Standing ovations Thursday as he urged Congress to supply vital aid to a Russia clasped in new partnership with the United States. “We still haven't reached the bottom of the crisis,” Mr. Gorba- chev said of his fellow Russians, describing them as courageously bearing burdens of economic and political reform that are bound to worsen. When the vote is called on the administration's package of aid to the former Soviet republics, Mr. Gorbachev said through a translator, the members of both houses should “recall how much is riding on this vote.” Whether his plea would be heeded by a Congress increas- ingly skittish about foreign aid was in question. But there was no mistaking the respect and warm welcome accorded the former Communist Party leader by some 300 members of the House and Senate, gathered on folding metal chairs under the ornate dome and satiny red curtains of historic Statuary Hall. “IT think he wrapped it up when he said that, in effect, if the democrats in Russia can’t solve the problems, the totalitarians will,” said Senate Armed Ser- vices Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who has spearheaded effort for aid to the former Soviet republics. He referred to Mr. Gorba- chev’s warnings that democratic reformers must be supported as they confront ethnic rivalries, Is- lamic fundamentalism and pros- pects of a nuclear arsenal slip- ping out of control. Despite the extensive prob- lems of today, Mr. Gorbachev said, Americans must look to a future in which Russia will pros- per and be a player in the world scene. “Russia tomorrow — and that day will come — will be a large and flourishing state whose im- pact on the world will be on a scale with its mighty potential,” Mr. Gorbachev said. Russia cannot be kept “off- sides in world politics,” he said, and is ready to work with the United States rather than be an enemy or competitor. “Can the United States really get along without a good and rather reliable partner in its highly moral and intelligent for- eign policy?” he asked. “Russia can become such a partner.” ech i Atlanta Journal-Constitution - came near the end of a U.S. tour to raise funds and promote his Gorbachev Foundation, a think tank with offices in Moscow and San Francisco that he says is not the launching pad for a return to political life in Russia. Mr. Gorbachev's visit to Washington, a city bound by tra- dition and protocol, presented a diplomatic challenge. He is not a head of state, and should not get better treatment than Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who vis- its here next month. Yet Congress, which was too wary to formally receive him nearly two years ago when he led the evolving Soviet Union, didn't want to shortchange him this visit. The answer was to host him in the Capitol’s second most pres- tigious room, the former House chamber. His appearance there was one step down from address- ing a joint session of Congress in the larger, present-day chamber. Congressional leaders praised Mr. Gorbachev, with one Majority Leader George Mitchell's heartfelt comments drawing enthusiastic applause. “Events didn’t always take the course you preferred,” he said. “But history's ultimate judgment will be that you opened the gates through which freedom flowed.” The leadership had lunch with Mr. Gorbachev afterward. The Bush administration had attempted to make the visit more low-key, finally relenting to a photo session of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev after initially saying there would be none. Mr, Bush was hosting Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, in a small, private White House dinner Thursday evening.

North’s diaries show approach for financing “By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU | Washington — Months before Presi- ' dent Reagan said he learned about it, Texas ‘businessman Ross Perot became one of a handful who knew that Oliver North, then a ‘Marine lieutenant colonel, was covertly helping to raise private funds for the Nica- ‘aguan contras, according to Mr. North’s }unpublished diaries. | Judging from Mr. North’s daily hand- \\written chronicles, Mr. Perot was in a ‘unique position to warn Mr. Reagan about ‘what was brewing and perhaps spare him ‘from the Iran-contra scandal that exploded ‘two years later. .  A-search by The Atlanta Journal-Con- | stitution of the more than 2,600 pages of di- ‘aries found that Mr. North noted at least 16 ‘telephone conversations over a two-year ‘period with Mr. Perot, now an undeclared presidential candidate. ‘Most conversations revolved around an ‘interest which Mr. Perot and Mr. North ‘shared — finding back-door means to win ‘the release of Americans held prisoner Mr. North’s diaries show that he decid- There is no indication in the North dia- ries that Mr. Perot ever actually made a contribution to the contras. In the past, Mr. ‘Perot has said he demurred when ap- proached for such contributions. At the time Mr. North apparently en- trusted his secret to Mr. Perot, the billion- aire was serving on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a prestigious citizens’ panel chosen by Mr. Reagan to give him personal advice on “the intelli- gence efforts of the United States.” Ross Perot (left) and Oliver North apparently discussed helping the con- tras when covert aid was illegal. Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for Mr. Reagan, said Thursday that as far as he ed to approach Mr. Perot for a contra con- Knows Mr. Perot never contacted Mr. Rea- tribution — thereby disclosing his direct 4M with any misgivings about Mr. North’s ‘involvement in fund-raising activities — activities. But both Mr. Weinberg and ar- ‘two months after Congress voted in Octo- chivist Stephen Branch at the Reagan Pres- ‘ber 1984 to idential Library in California said the ‘ =the couldn’t be certain, because Mr. Reagan’s daily appointment schedules remain closed to the public. Reached at the Perot headquarters in Dallas, spokesman James Squires declined an ir.zmediate comment and asked a report- er to submit a question to Mr. Perot by fax. By Thursday evening there was no response. The North diaries were declassified two years ago after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the National Security Ar- chive, a private research office funded by the Ford Foundation and other private donors. The idea of soliciting Mr. Perot first took shape in Mr. North’s diary in June 1984 in a note to himself to arrange a meet- ing between Mr. Perot and Roy Goodson, a White House consultant who would emerge later in the congressional Iran-contra hear- ings as one of Mr. North’s fund-raisers out- side the government. Perhaps believing that rich men could attract each other, Mr. North wrote in his diary that Mr. Goodson should be accom- panied by British multimillionaire Sir James Goldsmith, who already was a major contributor to contra aid funds. The diary didn’t clarify whether the three actually met. But later entries made clear Mr. North continued to regard Mr. Perot as a hot prospect for the contras. On Dec. 4, 1984, Mr. North jotted down that he had spoken to contra leader Adolfo Calero and found that he “badly needs ammo” and was “losing 3,000 recruits for lack of equipment.” Mr. North described Mr. Calero’s mood as “down.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 15, 1992 > \fDid Perot know ? Mr. North reacted to this emergency by preparing to ask Mr. Perot to contribute to a secret fund controlled by contra military adviser Richard Secord, a former U.S. Air Force general, according to another entry later that day. “Perot — see about funding through Se- cord,” as Mr. North put it one of the 22 fat spiral notebooks that he filled while work- ing as a National Security Council aide from a White House basement office. It took several days for Mr. North make contact with Mr. Perot, the diaries suggest. Then, at 8 p.m. on Dec. 7, Mr. Perot called Mr. North back for what now seems a key discussion. Mr. North’s notes suggest they began by talking about Mr. Perot’s interest in rescu- ing American hostages and, missing sol- diers overseas. But before the conversation ended, the diary says, they also talked at least briefly about the topic that was ab- sorbing Mr. North: how to fund Mr. Ca- lero’s contra army, called the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, or FDN for its Spanish initials. “Call from Ross Perot,” Mr. North wrote. “Re: Hostage/POW/MIA Rescue — Possible investment in FDN.” As with most of the dozen or so potential contra donors mentioned in the diaries, Mr. North didn’t specify whether Mr. Perot made a financial pledge. But there is inter- nal evidence that Mr. North found Mr. Per- ot’s reaction encouraging, His briefing notes ticked off four sources of potential aid. First, he wrote, were the prospect of “loans” of military equipment by two Central American rivals of the Nicaraguan government, Guatemala and Honduras. Then he wrote of two sources which might serve as “donor”: one government, Chile, and one person, Mr. Perot. Within the next several days, Mr. North apparently briefed either National Securi- ty Adviser Robert McFarlane or his depu- ty, John M. Poindexter, or both. “Perot - OK, w/ proviso on Calero no so- liciting,” Mr. North wrote on Dec. 11. Their reaction, as judged from this dia- ry entry, seems to have been encourage- ment, tempered with a measure of caution about how the soliciting would take place. Two years later, Mr. McFarlane would testify that he made clear to Mr. North from the outset that he, as a govern- ment official, should never make direct fund-raising pitch- es while the Boland amendment was in effect. But again in January 1985, Mr. North listed Mr. Perot — along with conservative Colora- do brewing executive Joseph Coors — on a list of potential givers to a contra “bridge” funding package. Mr. Perot served on the President’s Foreign Intelli- gence Advisory Board from January 1982 through March 1985S. At least as late as May 1986, Mr. North continued to view Mr. Perot as a potential source of dollars for the anti-Sandinista forces, according to subsequent congressional testimony by North assistant Robert Earl. Mr. Perot was asked in a 1987 interview about whether he ever acceded to requests for contra funding. He replied that he balked when the subject came up. Mr. Perot said his an- swer was to cite “the lessons of Vietnam: You first commit the nation before you commit the troops.” The first stories disclosing Mr. North’s involvement in helping to solicit contra donors during the Boland aid cutoff came in August and September 1985. Mr. Reagan’s immediate re- sponse was that his national se- curity staff had done nothing il- legal. Later, when questioned by a bipartisan investigating panel headed by the John Tow- er, Mr. Reagan said he “did not know the NSC staff was engaged in helping the contras.” In his autobiography, Mr. Reagan took responsibility for “mistakes” committed by his staff during Iran-contra, ex- plaining that Mr. North and oth- ers had reacted to his own frus- tration with Congress over the issue by choosing “to support the contras secretly” without telling him about it. Mr. Reagan’s autobiography makes no mention of Mr. Perot. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 15, 1992 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": " Perot: White House effort: to fund contras no secret * By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Ross Perot said Friday that he didn’t need to tip off President Ronald Reagan in 1984 about national se- curity aide Oliver North’s covert fund- raising efforts for the contras, because the efforts weren't secret. “Tt was publicly known that the [con- tra] fund-raising efforts were under way,” Mr. Perot said. As evidence that he wasn’t the only one who knew what the White House was do- ing, he told of accidentally meeting “a large number of people” in a White House Office building who were en route “to be briefed on the fund-raising effort” for the contras. With his statement, Mr. Perot took is- sue with a Cox Newspapers article Friday that said he was in a unique position to spare Mr. Reagan the Iran-contra embar- rassment because of his early knowledge of Mr. North’s fund-raising activities. After October 1984, the Boland Amendment shut off covert U.S. intelli- gence spending on behalf of the rebels fighting to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The article said that according to Mr. North’s unpublished diaries, he and Mr. Perot talked of a “possible investment” Mr. Perot might make in a contra military force during a December 1984 telephone call. Mr. Perot said he doesn’t remember whether he talked to Mr. North then but ac- knowledged that at some point, “I was asked by the White House to support their efforts Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 16, 1992 Ross Perot says Z ae meap a ~~ © any group ef rola effort,” in Nicaragua.” He said “several people” called him to ask for money to help the re- bels, but he consistently refused. “T never gave a penny to any group or any individual involved in the Nicaraguan effort,” he said. He offered two reasons: “First, Viet: nam taught us not to get involved in a. war that the American people do not support. Second, it was unrealistic to try to fund a war with private donations.” He said his encounter with contra fund-raisers in the Old Executive Offite Building occurred sometime betwéen 1982 and 1985, when he resigned from the intelligence board. In a separate interview, economist Leo Cherne, who served with Mr. Perot on the intelligence board, said Mr. Perot never brought up any misgivings about Mr. North’s efforts to orchestrate a fund Fale ing campaign for the contras. “Never heard a word” from Mr. Perot, said Mr. Cherne, who was the board’s vice chairman during Mr. Perot's tenure. _ Andin contrast to Mr. Perot’s assertion that Mr. North’s fund-raising activities were public knowledge in 1984, Mr. Cherne said he was personally unaware of them and never met Mr. North until 1987. \f"

Some 12,000 deaths later, it might be time to re-examine that bit of foreign policy. Yes, it’s a tough time to sell foreign entanglements to Americans. And the crazy com- plications of Yugoslavia, a web of ethnic hatreds and jealousies stretching far back in history, make for one onerous market- ing job. But the point is not simply to save the babies of Muslim Slavs in Bosnia, or teenage Serbian militiamen or elderly Croatians crushed under mortar rounds in what used to be peaceful vil- lages. It’s too late to do much for these wounded bodies and souls of Yugoslavia. As fighting in the fractured nation becomes more cruel and the militant battlers more bold, academics and analysts in- creasingly worry about the message the Bush administra- tion is sending to the rest of the world by sitting back and let- ting these ancient enemies duke it out. “I believe that our policy has been unmitigated disaster,”’ said Daniel Nelson, professor at the Russian Area Studies Pro- gram of Georgetown Universi- ty, citing a National Security Marcia Kunstel is a for correspondent based in the Jour- nal-Constitution Washington Bureau. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - May 17, 1992 > Council official who described the Bush policy as “taking a pass”’ on Yugoslavia. Mr. Nelson described ‘an arc of crisis’’ extending from the current battlefields of Yu- goslavia thousands of miles eastward, across battlefronts in Azerbaijan to those in the for- mer Soviet republic of Tajik- istan. “You add all this up and it suggests the United States and our allies have become blind, deaf and dumb to the threats brewing in that region,” Mr. Nelson said. By letting power-hungry ethnic leaders in Yugoslavia gnaw on rival populations and lands, the West is declaring that pieces of the new world order still can be defined by the guy who is willing to bite. No one is there to muzzle him. There are risks here at home should the administration continue its minimalist policy, expanding it from Yugoslavia to other ethnic disputes sure to pepper the lands so fitfully rest- ing between Europe and China. Consider some of these stakes: > American markets abroad, meaning jobs and pay- checks at home. > U.S. tax dollars and even U.S. troops, mobilized to recap- ture stability for our friends in Europe. &» The devastating potential of loose nukes in the hands of rebellious warriors. It’s not a huge stretch from the burning neighborhoods of \fFighting: Yugoslav peace is in America’s interest Sarajevo to job prospects for this June's high school graduates in Florida or Georgia or Ohio. What will link them is the de- cision that the United States and the Western allies ultimately will make. Will they continue to let ethnic rivalries in the east play themselves out on battlefields? If they do, political instabil- ity, economic chaos, millions more refugees and peoples un- able even to approach productive lifé may result. And the potential of spill-over into what otherwise would remain peaceful nations is as dangerous. Already Hungary has asked for peacekeeping troops to pre- vent conflict in Yugoslavia from edging into its territory. Top German generals say their big- gest security fear is new waves of refugees stirring a German pop- ulation already laced with dis- content. Invest in Yugoslavia So why should we care? “A good political leader can make a case for the linkage be- tween America’s prosperity and a safer world on the most crass level,” said Jenonne Walker, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment. “Americans will be able to export to and invest in a Yugosla- via that isn’t torn apart. If Eu- rope is destabilized by refugee flows, that also affects our econo- my,” said Ms. Walker, a special- ist in U.S.-European relations and U.S. security policy. “There’s a link between a world as free as possible from this kind of upheaval and Ameri- can businessmen, American workers,” she said. There is also the matter of principles and ideals, of Ameri- ca’s loudly broadcast commit- ment to democracy over authori- tarianism. Even that translates into sidering that today’s autocrats can get their hands on the most deadly firepower in history. Is a budding Saddam Hussein gath- ering troops in Azerbaijan, or an- other Moammar Gadhafi plotting to break his piece of turf off of Russia? “The United States has a re- sponsibility to its own citizens in part,” said Mr. Nelson, the Georgetown professor. ‘Every effort squelched’ It is past time to marshal seri- ous energy behind the new con- cept of preventive diplomacy, said Susan Woodward, visiting fellow in foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institute. In some cases, that might be “peacemaking” troops rather than “peacekeeping” forces that come in and clean up the car- nage. Or other new, multination- al approaches yet may be con- ceived for defusing tensions. The trouble is that the United States, especially, has resisted new thinking, Ms. Woodward and others charged. “Every effort that I know about so far  has_ been squelched,” she said, citing U.S. resistance to expanding the pow- . ers of the Conference on Securi Understanding ) Yugoslavia | Created in 1918 to unite the Balkans, Yugoslavia has disintegrated into separate nations, with only the republics of Serbia and ei still ening and emped ete ® Serbs: Mostly Orthodox Christians, the Serbs are traditional enemies of the Croats.

Soon after Mr. Nazarbayev’s ar- rival Monday on his search for eco- nomic and security benefits, he and the chairman of Chevron Corp., _ Nursultan — kenneth T. Derr, signed a 40-year Nazarbayev contract that nails down their multi- billion-dollar plan to extract oil from two Kazakh fields and sell it to the West. Mr. Nazarbayev, whose young country is the world’s fourth-largest nuclear power with more than 1,000 warheads, had expressed reluctance to give up all the strategic missiles without strong se- curity guarantees. Since reaching a mutual securi- ty pact with other republics last weekend, he has softened that position.

Mr. Nazarbayev’s sessions today and Wednesday with President Bush and Mr. Baker “are clearly crit- ical to the future of arms control,” said Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association. The START treaty itself, the future of nuclear non-proliferation and the prospects of making fur- ther deep cuts in long-range nuclear arsenals all will be in jeopardy if Mr. Nazarbayev balks, he said. Until last weekend, the Kazakh leader used the nuclear weapons he inherited on the breakup of the Soviet Union to bargain for international security and recognition, refusing to relinquish total control. If he does agree to the START protocol, prog- ress that has been stalled since the dissolution of Atlanta Journal-Constitution - STAFF the Soviet Union could move quickly. The Soviet Union and United States signed START last July after nine years of negotiating, but it was not ratified before the Soviet empire splint- ered. Initially, the United States tried to rely on Russia as the lead player to win formal acceptance of START principles from the other three republics holding nuclear weapons. That failed, so the fallback position became a U.S.-brokered effort to have all five involved na- tions — the United States and the four republics — as signatories to the pact. The senior administration official said all five could sign the protocol, which essentially is an ad- dition to START, when officials are in Lisbon next weekend for an unrelated meeting.

He fi By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright ©1992, Cox News Service * WASHINGTON INE YEARS before Ross Peru: said affirmative action was on balance “a good idea,” his Texas computer company began & protracted legal battle against federal demands to comply with anti-dis- crimination rules. Dallas-based Electronic Data Sys- tems Corp. doggedly fought federal demands to produce an affirmative action plan after four black workers filed race discrimination complaints in 1983. The company chose to spend “thou- sands and thousands of dollars” in legal fees to battle the U.S. Labor De- partment, said Joseph N. Cooper, an appointee of President Ronald Rea- gan’s administration who then was di- rector of the department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Finally in 1988, two years after Perot cut his ties with EDS, the com- pany signed a consent decree with the department and agreed to write affir- mative action plans and abide by oth- er anti-discrimination rules binding on federal contractors. Perot, a billionaire businessman who has captured Americans’ imagi- get his name on Kentucky's primary ballot. = Perot Waged War Against Anti-Bias Rules nation as an undeclared presidential candidate, has recently said he fa- vored affirmative action, but not unequivocally. His own company’s expensive and losing bout with a federal anti-blas program may figure in Perot’s views, However, Perot had not re- sponded by Wednesday evening to written ques- tions on the case that were sent to him through his spokesman. Perot said this month on NBC's “Meet the Press” that affirmative action “is a good idea, but it also produces problems.” “It produces stress in society,” Perot said. “The plus is it cleans up the inequity, and that's good. The minus is all the people who were more qualified and got passed over, who probably didn’t have any negative feelings based on race, ‘tart developing them.” Perot, who has said a person’s race, sex or religion should not affect job opportunities, also has advised questioners that “the best test of how I feel is to look inside my businesses.” A company spokesman sald Wednesday that it was impossible to provide immediately the num- ber of minority employees at EDS during the time in question. Perot has often pointed out individual black and Hispanic employees who hold high positions in his companies.

The company claimed that only a few of its subsidiaries were subject to presidential Execu- tive Order 11246, which was issued in 1965, That order demands that companies holding federal contracts worth more than $10,000 a year pro- vide equal employment opportunity, Present and former federal officials said this was a rare example of stiff resistance in Ameri- ca’s corporate community in recent decades, “Most companies comply after talking with the solicitor’s office and understanding how the government will proceed,” said Cooper, Leonard Biermann, deputy director of the fed- eral compliance office, said, “It’s unusual to receive challenges regarding the jurisdiction of the executive order over a company closely related i one which holds government I, 1988, two years after Perot cut his ties with EDS, the company agreed to adhere to affirmative-action In this case, EDS hadset The complaints did prompt the government to ask EDS to produce its up two subsidiary compa- affirmative action plan and related nies to handle federal con- documents.

        "ocr_text": "BNL banker will admit knowing about Iraqi fund, Democrat says By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — A House Democrat predicted Friday that indicted Atlanta banker Christopher Drogoul will con- fess next week that he knew his Italian-based bank was helping Iraq convert U.S. farm aid into an Iraqi slush fund. “There was a lot of cash left sitting on the table for other things,” Rep. Charles Rose (D- N.C.) told his colleagues from the witness chair. “And I think this will come out next Tuesday | when Mr. Drogoul pleads guilty in federal court in Atlanta.” Mr. Drogoul, former head of the Atlanta branch of Italy’s Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, is due in court to plead guilty to all 347 counts of fraud against him. Both Democrats and Re- publicans are on tenterhooks as they wait to see who else will be implicated in the “lengthy statement” that the jailed banker is expected to offer. Republican members of the House Banking Committee an- grily accused Mr Rose and other Democrats of trying to distort the BNL case to per- suade voters that President Bush shut his eyes to Iraq’s al- leged misuse of U.S. food assis- tance loans. “You guys are just here to beat up on George Bush,” insisted Rep. Toby Roth (R-Wis.). But Mr. Rose, whose staff reportedly has been in touch with several lawyers involved in the case, testified that BNL’s Atlanta office “clearly knew” that the Iraqi government was generating extra cash. He said one way Iraq did this was by demanding that U.S. grain dealers provide “‘ex- tra sales services, i.e., bribes” along with American-financed rice, tobacco and other com- modities. Mr. Rose contended that the Agriculture Department knew Iraq was illegally shak- ing down U.S. exporters by the fall of 1989, but it failed to shut off the multimillion-dollar flow of U.S.-guaranteed loans until the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War in August 1990. He released a sheaf of tel- exes chronicling how Iraq pressured an unnamed U.S. ex- porter to donate heavy vehicles and spare parts to avoid getting dropped. “Our future business with your company will depend mainly on the range of your co- operation with our company by furnishing us with free of charges trucks/trailers,” said one September 1989 telex. At least one U.S. company, Comet Rice of California, ac- quiesced to Iraqi pressure and paid $12,190 to a Jordanian in- termediary so that it wouldn’t be blackballed on future rice orders, the documents indicate.

J, Barker, Arab-Israeli Wars; Encyclopedia Britannica, Book of the Year 1968; Larence Ziring, The Middle East Political Dictionary; World Book 25 year's later: Six-Day War replay unlikely By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Twenty-five years after the Six- Day War, can it happen again? Not likely, say Arabs, Israelis and Americans who study this region. Prospects are low for repeating the state-on-state, full-scale regional war that in 1967 raised fearful visions of broadening hostilities that could spark the Cold War into a hot one. The Middle East remains one of the most volatile parts of the world, still arming itself with billions of dollars in weapons that are increasingly sophisticated and deadly. But the preponderant sentiment is that nothing like the Six-Day War that began on June 5, 1967, can happen again. i “Israelis are probably more secure in their region than they’ve ever been, so that the slippery slope that took us toward the Six-Day War — of miscalculations, of misunderstandings — is not likely to recur,” said historian Kenneth Stein, director of the Middle East Frege ee eee He and others cited changes in the region and the world at large in the past 25 years that convince them: @ The Cold War no longer imposes its tensions on regional conflicts. No Soviet Union exists to arm and to goad radical Arab leaders to act on their frustra- tions and move against Israel, which had much of the West in its corner. @ The Arab states reluctantly have accepted Isra- el. Their abysmal performance in the 1967 war proved they could not destroy the Jewish state, analysts say, Hostilities since then have been of limited nature, and today the Arabs are negotiating peace with Israel. odern weapons have raised the toll of full- Palm Beach Post - June 5,1992 > \fChanges in region, world make war unlikely scale war so high that few leaders can absorb the political damage it would wreak. _ BE Egypt, which provoked the 1967 war — intentionally or not — and spearheaded the more limited 1973 war no longer leads the pan- Arab crusade that included a unit- ed Arab world locked in conflict 1g Israel. - Not only has Egypt signed a peace pact with Israel, but the entire region has no single figure today equal to Gamal Abdul Nas- ser. _ Nasser was the charismatic Egyptian president who enthralled the Arab people. He won broad Arab plaudits for kicking out Unit- ed Nations peacekeepers separat- ing Egyptian and Israeli troops in May 1967, then for blockading the Strait of Tiran so Israeli ships cOuld not reach their port of Eilat. * That was a major spark to war, which began with massive Israeli air strikes on Egypt that June 5 at 8.a.m. Jordan and Syria quickly od their Egyptian ally in battle. But Israel decimated their air forces and trounced their armies in fighting that left the Jewish state holding triple its original territory after only six days of combat. It is that territory, much of which Israel still controls, that is at the center of conflict today. Only a radical fringe still protests the ex- istence of Israel, but the entire Arab world denounces the occupa- tion. “If the peace process runs aground and there is clearly no willingness on the side of Israel to make concessions on the occupied regions, then the situation will sharpen very considerably and some (Arab) governments which have participated in the peace pro- cess may be undermined,” said Robert Neumann, Middle East di- rector at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Wash- ington. Palestine the big issue The 1967 war began a slow shift that moved the fulcrum of conflict away from Arab states vs. Israel to occupied Palestinians vs. Israel. James Zogby, director of the Arab-American Institute, said few can disagree with the goals Presi- dent Bush elucidated after the Gulf War when the United States trig- gered the current peace process, He envisioned cooperative action in the region ranging from econom- ic development to the water crisis. “All of that is contingent ulti- mately on removing the region’s Berlin Wall. And that Berlin Wall is the occupation of Palestine,” Zogby said. “No Arab government can move toward cooperation without that wall coming down.” Refusal to cooperate doesn’t rank with the aggressive hostility of the past, but other dangers indi- rectly connected to the peace pro- cess still lurk. “The threat (to Israel) that ex- ists is a combination of dictator- ships, fundamentalist Islam and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,” said Shimon Shamir, Israel’s former ambassa- dor to Egypt and a visiting fellow at the U.S. Institute for Peace. “This does add to the urgency of success of the peace process,” he said, citing the gains made by fun- damentalist leaders when moder- ate Arab regimes fail in any arena. “If those negotiations do not yield results in the long run, if the more pragmatic approach fails, this undoubtedly will encourage the fundamentalist movements,” Sha- mir said. Threat of war remains If a radical fundamentalist re- gime takes power in a modern, well-armed Arab nation, or if an- other brash autocrat such as Iraq's Saddam Hussein is unleashed, Sha- mir warned that threats seen in the Gulf War could return — threats of missiles, chemical warfare or even nuclear weapons. As Israelis are wont to say, they still live in a dangerous neighbor- hood. But in many ways it is signifi- cantly less dangerous for both Is- raelis and Arabs than 25 years ago, and it harbors the healthiest seeds for peace that have existed since the founding of Israel in 1948. “T would argue that we're at the beginning of the end of the Israel- Arab conflict,” said Stein, “But the end is not necessarily in sight.” Palm Beach Post - June 5, 1992 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "U.S. scrambles to rescue pact for Yeltsin visit By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU ashington — Russian President Boris Yeltsin is heading for a historic White House visit next week that may lack two key ingredients for success: a new arms reduction treaty and a U.S. aid package. ®& Ethnic conflicts continue to rack former Soviet states AI2 In an effort to rescue the arms agreement, the Bush ad- ministration made a last-minute decision Wednesday to cancel a trip by Secretary of State James Baker to the Earth Summit in Brazil so he can continue talks with the Russians. While U.S. officials have ex- pressed optimism that a nuclear weapons agreement still can be signed next week, Mr. Yeltsin himself accused the Bush admin- istration Wednesday of trying to maintain a strategic advantage in the arms talks. In a meeting with his military commanders, the Russian presi- dent said the tough divisions re- maining will have to be bridged during his summit with Presi- dent Bush if a treaty is to be signed, according to the ITAR- Tass news agency. Mr. Yeltsin said the Ameri- cans want Russia to give up its powerful land-based, multiple- warhead missiles, while the United States is not willing to make similarly dramatic cuts in its sea-based nuclear arsenal. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater responded that discussions will continue. ‘“‘We are hopeful that they will make more progress and that we’ll be able to reach agreement when the two leaders come here,”’’ Mr. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 11, 1992 Fitzwater said. Late in the day, Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush to-, gether decided that the secretary should cancel plans to accompany the president to the environ; mental meeting in Rio de Janeiro so that he can try to save the arms agreement. A White House official, who asked not to be. identified, said a Baker trip to Moscow for more talks with the Russians is being discussed.

        "ocr_text": "Peaceful collapse, perilous aftermath Simmering strife threatens stability of ex-Soviet states By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU ashington — Less than six months after W the collapse of central control, ethnic and political conflicts scorch the edges of the former Soviet Union and threaten to shat- ter its core. Hot spots seem to bubble up weekly. Sorting out who is aiming at whom requires diligent tracking, Yet things are going pretty much as expected — maybe better — since the demise of the Soviet Union released the iron bridle that had kept in check 300 million people of diverse ethnic and national origins, religions, languages and politi- cal sentiments. “What's remarkable, now that we're six months into it, given the scale of change, is that the situation is as relatively stable as it has been,” said Blair Ruble, director of the Kennan Institute of Advanced Russian Studies. - Underlining even such optimistic views, how- ever, are the troubling facts that so many areas remain volatile and that some brush fires carry the potential for sweeping escalation. Also cause for concern is that stability and peace are 50 tied to the fortunes of a single man: Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who has re- strained the Moscow hard-liners who still don't accept the end of the Soviet empire, Carving it up further Since the Soviet Union officially dissolved last Christmas Day, most of the 15 independent states that emerged have been threatened by vio- lent conflict. Many have suffered war, These new countries, stretching from Europe through Asia, contain endless border disputes, class animosities and ethnic tensions yet to be re- solved, More new nations may be carved from the existing 15 as ethnic enclaves demand inde- pendence or regions break from a mother state in pursuit of greater political power. Russia, for example, could end up a small fraction of its present massive size if separatists inthe Far East and Siberia have their way, As se- rious a blow would be the loss of oil-rich Tatar- stan, where ethnic Tatars already have voted to remove themselves from the Russian yoke, No mechanism to arbitrate such disputes ex- ists, While the Commonwealth of Independent States technically survives, analysts in Washing- ton say it hasn't worked and won't last, Six months after the breakup, the prospects are about zero that the states will submit to any polit. ical superstructure that might have authority to tackle the problems of ethnic separatism. Daniel Nelson, a professor of Russian studies at Georgetown University, said the trend toward splintering is reaching a dangerous “micro lev- el” that the West and the United States in partic. ular have ignored at their peril ~ “It becomes very, very lethal — genocidal — because of all the arms left there by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact,” Mr. Nelson said, “Unless the fighting in these various areas is brought to a halt or as close to a halt as we can bring it, the danger of escalation becomes great: et’ with each month,” The great Russian bear ~ By far the most perilous conflict is between Christian Armenia and Muslim Azerbaijan, neighboring states where vicious fighting has centered on fragile enclaves of Armenians within Averbaijan and Azeris within Armenia.

A large part of the trouble is the 25 million eth- nic Russians who live in the non-Russian parts of the old Soviet Union. Russian ultra-nationalists, such as Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, talk of defending these countrymen abroad. Often they are regarded as unwelcome rem- nants of the ruthless Communist empire, but there is neither housing nor employment for them in Russia even if they wish to return.

Kim Johnston of CARE told the House Select Commit- tee on Hunger that since the September coup, conditions in Haiti have deteriorated from extreme poverty “to a state of virtual famine in some parts of the country.”’ The military coup that ousted democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was followed by in- ternational trade sanctions against the impoverished Car- ibbean country, and relief workers said the combination has been devastating. Although humanitarian aid is permitted under terms of the embargo, the witnesses said many countries are un- certain exactly what qualifies as acceptable humanitarian aid and have stopped donating Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 12, 1992 Relief Ms. Johnston said CARE was unable to find a single gov- ernment willing to contribute money so the agency could purchase seed for farmers to plant this spring, after their families ate seed supplies rath- er than starve. CARE finally got enough private donations from the United States and Austria to buy seed to distrib- ute to 14,000 poor Haitian farmers, she said. Dr. Leus, whose agency is associated with the World Health Organization, said the political crisis and embargo have disabled some basic health and sanitation systems - through power shortages, the lack of spare parts and bu- reaucratic chaos. He calmly delivered a set of. statistics that add up to a nightmare for Haitians: ®& Drinking water avail- ability has dropped 30 percent to SO percent, leading people to scavenge for water, often taking it from dangerous places. ® Solid waste collection rates in the capital dropped in November to 9 percent of the 1,500 metric tons of waste pro- duced daily. Mountains of gar- bage are burned in the streets, leading to respiratory disease and skin rashes. ® Due to the failure to dis- pose of human waste, 82 per- cent of the springs providing drinking water to Port-au- Prince are severely polluted with feces. He called the situation “extremely critical’”” and warned that cholera is expect- ed to spread from other Latin American nations that have been able at least to partially combat the disease through working health and sanitation networks. “When cholera syikes, the situation will be uncontrollable.” he said. \f"

        "ocr_text": "PUBLIC QUIZZES PEROT Billionaire skirts truth with some of his replies By Joseph Albright WASHINGTON BUREAU and Ben Smith Ill STAFF WRITER Ross Perot said Thursday the balanced budget amendment is pointless, blamed President Bush for the Persian Gulf War and dodged a few questions like a real poli- tician. Mr. Perot made his comments as he fielded calls from viewers during a two- hour stint on NBC’s “Today” show. The ap- pearance gave more than 3 million viewers their longest look yet at Mr. Perot, an unde- clared and largely unknown presidential candidate who leads in national polls. But he still left many questions unan- swered, and three of his statements — on his charitable contributions, his company policy on beards and a controversy involv- ing Iraq and the Bush administration — turned out to be only partial truths. Mr. Perot accused Mr. Bush of spend- ing billions of dollars to “burp, diaper and pamper” Saddam Hussein before being forced to eject the Iraqi leader’s army from Kuwait. The Texas billionaire also ridiculed a proposed balanced budget amendment, which the House defeated Thursday night. “An amendment is an excuse not to do anything,” said Mr. Perot, who said he would raise taxes only as a last resort. “Raising taxes is like taking dope for politicians. ... The more money you give these boys to spend, they'll spend,” he said. But if a war ever broke out, Mr. Perot said, he would impose a surtax on all Americans not serving in the military to help finance the effort. Mr. Perot did not specify what govern- ment services he would cut. But he said he would not accept a salary as president. He also seemed to back down from a proposal to cut Social Security benefits for the wealthy after a Florida retiree asked him about it. Mr. Perot said he would merely ask wealthy Americans to voluntarily forgo ‘ The Associated Press Ross Perot straightens his clothing after two hours of questioning on the “Today” show Thursday morning. Social Security benefits. He sidestepped questions on gun con- trol and affirmative action. Asked about abortion, he replied, ‘‘When the dust set- tles, it’s the woman’s choice. Realize that the saddest thing in the world is to create a little child nobody wants.” Three statements he made either left out information or were incorrect. He said he gave away “half” the money he made in his first big financial success 24 years ago. The way he abbreviated the sto- ry, Mr. Perot seemed to be saying that he donated half the value of the stock he owned after it went public — a charitable spree exceeding $150 million. But that’s not what he meant. After the interview, Perot spokesman James Squires said the Texas businessman was referring to a $2.5 million charitable pledge he signed within a month after the 1968 stock offering. Mr. Squires said the pledge equaled half the first $5 million in actual cash he received from the shares he initially sold to the public. “This is niggling,’ Mr. Squires said when a reporter called for an explanation. The computer company Mr. Perot founded, Electronic Data Systems Corp., held its public stock offering Sept. 12, 1968. By the end of the first day, Mr. Perot had a paper profit of $360 million. By the time EDS stock hit a peak in 1969, Mr. Perot’s personal holdings were worth $1.5 billion. Later in the broadcast, Mr. Perot’s ex- planation of EDS’s policy on employees’ personal appearance was at best a partial truth. When “Today” show host Katie Couric observed that at EDS “you prohibit- ed beards,” Mr. Perot responded: “Well, I didn’t prohibit beards, and you can go into my companies today and you'll see all kinds of interesting people with beards. And as I’ve laughed and said for years, as bright as these characters are, I tolerate all kinds.” Mr. Perot was correct in saying there is no anti-beard policy in the companies he now owns. But EDS, which he ran from 1962 to 1986, had such a policy in at least some of its offices as late as 1980, accord- ing to excerpts from an EDS employee manual obtained by The Associated Press this week. On another question, Mr. Perot was wrong in his claim that Mr. Bush “will not let’ the Senate Foreign Relations Commit- tee see the written instructions given to U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie before her meeting with Saddam in July 1990. A committee spokesman said the Bush administration did in fact turn over the am- bassador’s “written instructions” in the summer of 1991, following months of com- mittee pressure. Mr. Perot “didn’t know about that,” Mr. Squires commented. ‘When the man says something, it is because that is what he be- lieves is true.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 12, 1992 \f"

Mr. Goldberg, who now works for the federal government, declined to be quoted but did not dispute Mr. Badey’s account. Mr. Perot, then in his final year at the helm of Electronic Data Systems Corp., had said publicly in January 1986 that he was willing to “drop everything” if Con- press and the Reagan administration Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 13, called on him to chair a panel to investi- gate lingering reports of American ser: vicemen being held captive in Southeast Asia. But Mr. Armitage advised a congres- sional subcommittee in March 1986 to re- ject Mr. Perot’s leadership, “We might lose more time, and we have lost too much already in bringing members up to speed,” he testified. The proposed resolution by then-Rep. William Hendon (R-N.C.) was aimed at creating what was to be called “the Perot Commission on Americans Missing in Southeast Asia.” Mr. Perot was to have unprecedented authority to issue subpoe- nas and to nominate all 15 commission member's, subject to the approval of con gressional leaders.

It called for the company to “automate” the office of the secretary of defense, in which Mr, Armitage was one of the half- dozen top executives, When an interviewer for the C-SPAN cable television network on May 17 asked about the photograph, Mr. Perot replied, “An undercover policeman from the Washington area knocks on my hotel room door and says, ‘I’m out on the streets ey- ery night and I am seeing something that is an absolute security violation and here is the file,’” Mr. Badey said the photograph had: been seized under a warrant to search the house of Mrs, O'Rourke, who had been ar- rested on charges of running an illegal gambling operation in June 1985, Mr. Badey said he identified the man inthe snapshot some months later, when a photograph of Mr. Armitage appeared in The Washington Post. The Perot-Badey-Goldberg meeting occurred a month or two after Jack An- derson’s column in January 1986 first dis- closed that Mr. Armitage had written a letter on Defense Department stationery urging a Virginia court to “show mercy” to Mrs. O'Rourke. The photograph was known to Mr. Anderson's office but was not mentioned in the column. Mr. Anderson, in a follow-up column distributed in 1987, made a vague refer: ence to Mr. Perot's desire to contact his sources about Mr, Armitage. “Perot read our columns last year and asked to see our files,” said the Anderson column of Jan, 30, 1987, “We put him in touch with several of our confidential sources,” In that column, Mr. Anderson report: ed that Mr. Perot subsequently “ap- proached” Mr. Bush, then the vice presi- dent, and “expressed concern to Mr. Bush about Mr. Armitage’s connection to the Vietnamese woman.” Without citing a specific source, Mr. Anderson asserted that Mr. Perot had exclaimed to Mr, Bush, “What does it take for a U.S, government official to lose his security clearance?” A Bush spokesman confirmed to re- porters in 1987 that Mr. Bush met with Perot on Oct. 16, 1986, Mr. Perot’s spokes- man, Jim Squires, confirmed that Mr, Perot took the photograph with him to the meeting, A check of House subcommittee rec- ords showed that the Perot meeting with Mr, Bush occurred one day after mem: bers voted to reject creation of the Perot commission. 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Playing host to Yeltsm may aid Bush politically By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — In the up- coming summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the Bush administration will make an ag- gressive effort to show U-S. vot- ers the benefits of foreign policy expertise. “They really want some ku- dos out of this,’’ said Stephen Hess, an expert on elections, the media and the presidency at the Brookings Institution. To get such kudos, the admin- istration has worked overtime to assure that something concrete — an arms reduction agreement — comes out of the Tuesday and Wednesday meetings between the Russian and American leaders. The White House also is un- derscoring the lucrative new re- lations awaiting American busi- ness at the U.S.-Russia Business Summit that coincides with the Bush-Yeltsin talks. Several ma- jor new contracts for American companies are expected to be announced. A summit that demonstrates to Americans that they can be safe as well as make money from adroit foreign policy would capi- talize on the single greatest ad- vantage Mr. Bush has over his two probable opponents in the November election: broad expe- rience in international affairs. In past months, Mr. Bush’s preoccupation with foreign policy has drawn darts for distracting him from domestic troubles, but more recently he has ventured back into the world arena as the opposition expanded from expect- ed Democratic nominee Bill Clin- ton to include the likely candidacy of independent Ross Perot. *“*“You now have three candi- dates, only one of whom knows how the world operates,”’’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 14, 1992 Mr. Hess said. ‘‘So they put interna- tional affairs back on the agen- da.” That is the president’s strong suit, and in a three-way race each candidate must build on his base. Mr. Hess said the tactic re- mains ‘‘a double-edged sword’”’ in the present political climate, and some political analysts pre- dict it will cut Mr. Bush, not the opposition. Celinda Lake, a pollster and political consultant with primar- ily Democratic clients, said Mr. Bush has a SO- to 60-point advan- tage over Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot in polling questions related to expertise in foreign policy. ““But what was once an ad- vantage is now a disadvantage. People already think he spends too much time on it. He needs to show he can do something about the domestic economy,”’’ she said. Republican pollster Glen Bolger disagreed, predicting that the administration will realize its aim of generating attention and good publicity through the sum- mit. He said the substance of the meetings matters little, unless Mr. Yeltsin tries to get the presi- dent ‘‘to write a big blank check’”’ for foreign aid. That would cause trouble but it is not likely to hap- pen, he said. Otherwise, Mr. Bolger said, the most important factor in the summit is that Mr. Yeltsin is a striking, likable character who is eee with the American me- a. \f"

I said, ‘What’s your problem?’ ” That Pentagon meeting oc- curred in the fall of 1986, shortly after Mr. Perot says he met with then-Vice President George Bush and turned over a confiden- tial police file containing a photo- graph that included a glimpse of Mr. Armitage and a Vietnamese woman on a beach in Vietnam. Mr. Perot got the file by asking an undercover policeman, the police detective told reporters last week. Mr. Armitage, who was then assistant defense secretary, said he told Mr. Perot that federal in- vestigators had already cleared him of any impropriety after re- viewing the same evidence Mr. _Perot said he found disturbing. * That didn’t satisfy Mr. Pergt, “Mr. Armitage said. “I think you -ought to resign,” he quoted Mr. Perot as saying. Mr. Armitage said he told Mr. Perot that De- fense Secretary Caspar Weinber- ger had rejected his offer to re- sign over the issue about a year earlier. “Secretary Weinberger asked me what happened,” Mr. Armi- tage said. “I said I had written a letter to a Virginia court for a ywoman whom I had known in Vietnam many years earlier. “Weinberger said, ‘That’s ridicu- lous,’ and turned down my offe to resign.” Mr. Armitage said he asked “Mr. Perot to meet him after he -learned that the Texan was in an- _ other office of the Pentagon, look + ing into intelligence reports about -»missing U.S. servicemen in Asia -with Mr. Bush’s permission.

        "ocr_text": "Bush, Yeltsin vow new era of harmony By Marcia Kunstel and Julia Malone WASHINGTON BUREAU ashington — Sticky dif- W ferences on reducing nuclear arms divided the Russian and American presi- dents as they prepared to open a summit today, but both pledged Monday to bury Cold War hostil- ities in close new relations. “We used to be separated by more than a mere ocean of salt water,” Russian President Boris Yeltsin said as he arrived at An- drews Air Force Base outside Washington, “There was a psy- chological gap between our two countries.” Expressing hope that agree- ments the two leaders are to sign this week “will show that gap closing,” the Russian leader said the goals of the summit “are peace and prosperity for our two nations and for the entire world.” “We shall never again be ad- versaries,” Mr. Yeltsin declared. Themes of reconciliation also emerged from an official Rus- sian briefing Monday night, as a spokesman for Mr. Yeltsin said the president believes “it is not impossible” that some American prisoners of war may remain alive in Russia. Mr. Yeltsin said Monday in an interview with NBC News that Communist Party and KGB rec- ords show that Americans were transferred to Soviet labor camps after World War II and the Vietnam War. “We don’t have complete data and can only sur- mise that some of them may still be alive,” Mr. Yeltsin said. Mr. Yeltsin “has taken very much to heart” the problem of those Americans, said his spokesman, Vyacheslav Kosti- kov. The spokesman said a Rus- sian commission was investigat- ing the matter and that Mr. Yelt- sin was open to having Americans work with the panel. Mr. Kostikov also said Mr. Yeltsin telephoned Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who lives in exile in Vermont, and spoke “with a tone of repentance” about how the former Soviet authorities had treated the Russian writer and social critic. In their 30-minute conversa- tion, the two men “touched upon the most urgent and painful problems in the life of our coun- ” Mr. Kostikov said. He said Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Solzhenitsyn that Russia’s doors are open for the Nobel Prize- winning author to return. Mr. Solzhenitsyn, the spokesman said, supported Mr. Yeltsin’s re- form program and urged that steps be taken to allow Russia’s peasants to own land as soon as possible. Earlier Monday, President Bush lavished praise on Mr. Yeltsin and his tough democrat- ic reform policies in an inter- view with Cable News Network less than two hours before Mr. Yeltsin arrived. Mr. Bush said Mr. Yeltsin comes as “a friend, not an ad- versary” and called him “a cou- rageous leader of Russia who stood on the tank to see that a coup [in August 1991] that would have thrust Russia back into the Dark Ages failed.” But friendship makes fewer headlines than tense animosity, and this summit meeting is a relatively low-key affair com- pared with superpower negotia- tions back when the Soviet Un- ion faced enemy America. Even the hammer and sickle of the old Soviet flag, once a menacing symbpl to Americans, has been replated on Washing- ton flagpoles for the visit by the Russian tricolor of white, blue and red alongside the Stars and Stripes. Treaties on trade and invest- ment are ready for the two lead- ers to sign when their White House sessions end Wednesday, but a pact making deep cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two nations remained? elusive. “We have four or five prob- lems,” Secretary of State Jan me fegey phew: least two disagreements “extraordinarily difficuld problems.” Mr. Baker did not detail tha disagreements, but the out, standing divisions have been over which weapon systems to cut back rather than how many, warheads to leave in place. Both sides have agreed to keep 4,700 nuclear warheads, down from the present count of about 10,000 each. But Russia has been : tant to meet U.S. demands that give up the core of its netwo! — multiple-warhead, land- based missiles — unless the Americans agree to reduce fur- ther their lethal sea-based weapons. weg Besides facing trouble over the arms pact, the Bush admin- istration has yet to secure a welg coming gift in the form of aid and credit to Russia and other former Soviet states.

        "ocr_text": "U.S., Russia to slash missiles By Marcia Kunstel and Julia Malone WASHINGTON BUREAU President ashington — Bush and Russian Pres- ident Boris Yeltsin will sign pledges today to make dra- matic reductions in their nations’ nuclear arsenals, vowing to cut back their warheads to one-third of the current number within 11 years. The unexpected cutbacks an- nounced Tuesday will eliminate the weapons the United States has declared the most threatening and destabilizing: land-based multi- ple-warhead nuclear missiles. “With this agreement, the nu- clear nightmare recedes more and more for ourselves, for our children and for our grandchil- dren,” Mr. Bush said Tuesday in an unscheduled joint announce- ment with Mr. Yeltsin in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Yeltsin added, “What we have achieved is an unparalleled and probably an unexpected thing for you and for the whole world.” Besides agreeing to the deep nuclear cuts only four hours into their two-day summit, the two leaders also agreed to begin con- sultations on jointly developing technology to defend against | long-range missiles, a Yeltsin proposal that initially drew a lukewarm response when he made it in February. The two-phased nuclear arms reductions would leave the Unit- ed States with 3,500 warheads and Russia with 3,000, according to administration Officials who detailed the pact later. The United States now has about 10,000 nuclear warheads on submarines, land-based mis- siles and bomber planes, while Russia has around 11,000. ~ The new low numbers are to be achieved by the year 2003 and possibly as early as 2000. Russian officials emphasized later that the pace depends on how much U.S. financial help Rae=™= they get for the costly process of dismantling and destroying the weapons. The low figures and the cate- gories of weapons to be eliminat- | ed were startling, because ad- ministration officials had main- [Bee tained until late Monday that serious differences separated the two sides. No one would say what tough issues, if any, Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin actually negotiated, lead- ing to speculation that the degree of division had been exaggerated. The Russians reluctantly agreed to give up all their land- based multiple-warhead mis- siles: the SS-18s that are the most powerful and dangerous kind of nuclear weapon. But they also extracted agreement from Mr. Bush to reduce by more than half America’s submarine-based multiple-warhead missiles, which he earlier proposed cut- ting by one-third. The United States also will give up its intercontinental bal- listic missiles with multiple war- heads, such as the Peacekeeper, but they are not nearly as central to the American arsenal as they are to Russia’s system. Formal pact to take months The two leaders are expected to sign documents of intent today in closing their summit, and a formal treaty should be ready for submission to the national legis- latures of each country within President Bush looks on as Russian President Boris Yeltsin tosses a horseshoe Tuesday at the White House. Mr. Yeltsin received a ceremonial welcome as he arrived for their summit. months. The Strategic Arms Reduc- tion Treaty (START), which re- duces current nuclear stockpiles by a small fraction of the new agreement, has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Senate and the parlia- ments of the four states of the former Soviet Union that are parties to it. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Yelt- sin emphasized the speed with which the new agreement was reached: about five months, com- pared with more than a decade to negotiate START. Mr. Yeltsin called it an ex- pression of “the fundamental change in the political and eco- nomic relations” between the two countries, as well as proof “of the personal trust and confi- dence that has been establish between the two leaders. Global! protection on agenda Potential joint action toward what Mr. Bush termed “a global protection system” against bal- listic missile attacks will be pur- sued by U.S. and Russian offi- cials who are expected to meet in Moscow within 30 days. Besides looking at technical prospects for working together on what has been called the “Star Wars” defense, the group will study whether existing pacts such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty must be modified. American leaders have been pressing to alter the 1972 treaty because the “Star Wars” systems would violate its prohibition of anti-missile defenses. This is the first indication that the Russians might agree. Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Bush welcomed the Russian president to the White House in a full-dress military ceremony on the South ’ Lawn, with a 21-gun salute and lavish praise — comparing him to Peter the Great — that finally gave Mr. Yeltsin the American tribute he had been denied on previous trips.

        "ocr_text": "Yeltsin stirs Congress to loosen purse strings Russian leader wins cheers, converts to aid to Mono By Marcia Kunstel and Julia Malone WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Russian President Boris Yelt- sin swept the fervor and idealism of a young de- mocracy into the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday with an emotional speech that awed members of Con- gress and set them reassessing the stalled package of aid to his country. The first Russian or Soviet leader to address a joint session of Congress, Mr, Yeltsin had his audi- ence on their feet for ovations a dozen times, then made more points in private meetings and at a leadership luncheon. The most visible convert was Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz,), who said after a face-to-face meeting — requested by Mr. Yeltsin — that he would not block action on the Freedom Support Act, a package of aid to the new states of the former Soviet Union. Mr. McCain had vowed to stall action until get- ting a full account of American POWs and MIAs who, according to new evidence revealed by Mr. Yeltsin on this summit trip, had been interned in Russia, Mr, McCain said he reversed himself after hearing Mr. Yeltsin's commitment “to leave no stone unturned in resolving the fate of any Ameri- cans held captive by the former Soviet Union.” Inhis address, Mr. Yeltsin made an unflinching pledge that brought cheers and a sustained ovation: “As president of Russia, I assure you that even if ‘one American has been detained in/my country, and can still be found, I will find him. I will get him back to his family.” RICK McKAY / Washington Bureau Boris Yeltsin, surrounded by U.S. lawmakers, stops to shake hands with Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn after the Russian president spoke Wednesday to a joint session of Congress. Mr. Yeltsin's willingness to share this informa- tion with Americans, as well as his exuberant com- mitment to democracy and free markets, “helped his case substantially,” said Sen, Sam Nunn (D- Ga,). It may have improved the atmosphere suffi- ciently to permit Senate passage of the aid bill within weeks, he said, Mr. Yeltsin offered his definition of the new partnership he seeks with the American people, and described his dedication to reform and his total break with past Soviet policies. “The idol of communism, which spread every- where social strife, animosity and unparalleled brutality, which instilled fear in humanity, has col- lapsed,” he said, “I am here to assure you, we will not let it rise again in our land.” Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who has been counting votes for the bill, also said after the meetings that Mr. Yeltsin improved the bill's chances. “We think we have good support, and we're hoping that whenever it comes up, we'll be able to produce many more than half the Republicans.” While the Senate likely has enough votes to pass the bill, the House of Representatives is less prom- ising for the Russian. House members “thought it was an incredibly powerful speech,” said a Democratic leadership aide, “The problem is he's going back to Moscow, and the members are going back to their districts” where economic problems will outlast the after- glow of Mr, Yeltsin's message, Another senior leadership aide, who also asked not to be identified, said Mr. Yeltsin's powerful ad- dress “probably caused most people at least to take pause,” The prospects of taking up the bill in the House before the long August recess “are a little better than 50-50” after Mr. Yeltsin's speech, the aide said, a reversal of the odds that existed before his appearance, What will be key, he cautioned, is whether some domestic economic relief legislation also can be ad- dressed without the administration's blocking it. The aid bill carries authorization for credits and loans and offers technical assistance in build- ing democratic and free-market institutions, Most important is the $12 billion pledge to the Interna- tional Monetary Fund, which would not be used just for credits to Russia, but would also enable the IMF to undertake programs for all the newly emerged states. The central achievement of the two-day summit was the agreement Mr. Yeltsin and President Bush signed Wednesday to reduce strategic nuclear arms by two-thirds, to levels unthinkable just months ago. They each agreed to drop to a range of 3,000 to 3,500 warheads, and to eliminate all multi- ple-warhead land-based missiles. The two leaders and their aides also signed 39 other agreements and accords, including accords on space exploration and combined efforts to dis- mantle nuclear weapons in Russia, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 18, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Experts hail landmark nuclear arms pact By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Longtime champions of arms control are basking in the afterglow of a sur- prising, historic agreement to deeply cut strategic nuclear weapons — despite some lurking shadows. The agreement signed Wednesday by the Russian and American presidents “was a ma- jor breakthrough in arms control and a real turning point in U.S.- Russian strategic relations,” said Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association. The speed of action, numbers of cuts and kinds of weapons to be dismantled all encouraged peacemongers. The pact was reached so quickly that it doesn’t have a name yet. It also is the first time the world’s two nuclear kingpins have sped into a new agreement on cuts before the last one they made has been ratified. This new agreement, called simply a “joint understanding,” was struck before the Strategic Arms Reduction ‘Treaty (START) has been ratified by the legislative bodies of the United States and the former Soviet nu- clear powers — Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Senate Armed Services Com- mittee Chairman Sam Nunn (D- Ga.) described his first impres- sion of the new pact as “very much in our security interests,” if somewhat unexpected. He said even his staff had no hint that President Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin would be able to ratchet down the numbers of strategic nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 war- heads each. “Our Pentagon had been re- yg to go down that deep,” he Mr. Yeltsin had proposed a low of 2,000 warheads, while the United States had been holding out for 4,700, Under START, each side could have around 10,000. What finally persuaded the, generals to compromise, Mr. Nunn said, was Mr. Yeltsin's agreement to give up all of Rus- sia’s SS-18 missiles, the land- based missiles carrying 10 war- heads each that the Americans fear as the most dangerous and destabilizing weapons on the scene today. * Lewd compromise, r ave up more mul ple- shee missiles based ; U.S. submarines than they had) wanted to eliminate, Mr. Nunn said, They agreed to drop from 3,840 warheads to 1,750. According to the analysts, both sides win with this agreement. “Tt essentially ‘accepted the best parts of both the U.S. and the Russian positions,” Mf. Keeny said. The shadows on this bright picture include the fact that START must be ratifled — bythe U.S. Senate and the parliaménts of the four former Sovie repub- lics — before this latest agree- ment can proceed, Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 20, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Russia-Moldova tension escalates Moscow admits its soldiers are aiding separatists By T. Elaine Carey and Marcia Kunstel STAFF. CORRESPONDENTS Moscow — Russia and Mol- dova on Monday inched toward being the first former Soviet states to go to battle against each other, raising fears that such an armed confrontation could ignite similar ethnic wars across the former Soviet Union. The tension between the two countries escalated Monday when Moldovans reportedly fired on a Russian army base near the village of Parcani in Moldova’s Trans-Dniester region. The area is populated mostly by ethnic Russians and some Ukrainians who want to rejoin Russia rather than be part of Moldova. Meanwhile, the Russian army admitted Monday that some of its soldiers were fighting alongside ethnic Russians in Moldova. The casualty toll from four days of fighting climbed to 380 dead and more than 500 wound- ed in what Moldovan President Mircea Snegur called ‘‘an unde- clared war” by Russia against its tiny southern neighbor. Speaking to an emergency session of Parliament in the Mol- dovan capital, Kishinev, Mr. Sne- gur said his nation of 4.3 million people “is being exterminated.” Moldova, much of which was part of Romania before World War II, has said that it intends eventually to become part of Ro- mania again. But 600,000 sepa- ratists from Russia and Ukraine living in Moldova fear that they will become second-class citi- zens if such a reunion takes place and have declared autonomy in an economically valuable strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River.

A third skeleton was identified as that of the Roma- nov family doctor, he said. If one of the remaining bodies is firmly identified as that of the czar’s daughter An- astasia, it may finally put to rest a persistent legend that she somehow escaped the rest of the family’s fate.

Czar’s remains identified FILE said Mr. Blokhin, a Ekaterin- burg regional official who is leading the investigation. Czar Nicholas abdicated the throne in March 1917 after a constitutional republic was established in Russia, ending the nearly 300-year reign of the Romanovs. The imperial family was banished three months later to Siberia, where they lived for their last year. On July 17, 1918, the czar and his family were executed by firing squad in the base- ment of a house in Ekaterin- burg on the orders of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, amid the civil war that followed the Bolshevik Revolution. The slain relatives could soon be canonized as martyrs by the Russian Orthodox Church. The czarina’s sister, a murdered nun, has already been canonized.

        "ocr_text": "» Good news for Bush: A quick overture to Israel could recapture the U.S. Jewish vote. By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — The Labor Party’s lead in Israeli elections — if it holds up and produces a new prime minister — can be ex- pected to prompt quick Ameri- can action to repair tattered U.S.- Israeli relations. The flexible stands that La- bor’s Yitzhak Rabin has taken on Jewish settlements and on Mid- dle East peace concessions would make it possible for the Bush ad- ministration to hold out a warm hand of friendship, replacing the cool, sometimes angry distance President Bush has kept from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the rightist Likud coalition. Analysts expect Mr. Bush quickly to resuscitate some form of loan guarantees to help Israel resettle surely would be smaller than the $10 billion originally requested. Conditions on Jewish settle- ments in the occupied Arab lands are certain to be attached, but the conditions may be acceptable to a new Israeli government. Henry Siegman, executive di- rector of the American Jewish Congress, expressed that senti- ment Tuesday night. “TI trust that in the wake of these election results, the tradi- tionally warm relations between the United States and Israel will be quickly resumed, and that the administration will act promptly on the loan guarantees that Israel so desperately needs,”’ Mr. Sieg- man said. It was Mr. Shamir’s refusal to halt settlements that led Mr. Bush to kill the guarantees earli- er this year, culminating a dis- pute that has been politically ag- onizing for both sides. These sour relations Mr. Sha- mir let develop with the United States, which has been Israel’s strongest and most financially forthcoming supporter for almost two decades, were high on the minds of Israeli voters Tuesday. And the brutish manner in which Mr. Bush handled Israel and its American proponents cost him support among Jewish Soviet Jewish immi-. grants, although the package ANALYSIS Labor victory could thaw U.S. ties mate ate ria hampagne Tuesday at a bar in Tel Aviv as election results indicated Labor the left-wing Meretz Party, would break the right-wing Likud’s hold on power. Rabin: A dove in hawik’s feathers Jerusalem — A former prime minister and war hero, Yitz- hak Rabin is seen by many as a dove in hawk’s feathers. Mr. Rabin, 70, was born in Jerusalem, the son of Russian parents. He led Israel’s lightning vic- tory in the 1967 Middle East War as military chief of staff. He became La ibor prime minister in 1974 but was forced to step down in 1977 amid a scandal over an illegal foreign bank account held by his wife. Considered a loner, Mr. Rabin has said he has virtually no very close friends. He speaks in a slow, deliberate voice, a contrast to some Is- raeli politicians’ fiery rhetoric. As defense minister from 1984 to 1990, Mr. Rabin led the failed effort to quell the Palestinian uprising. His orders to ‘“‘break the bones” of rioters damaged Israel’s image when foreign TV footage showed soldiers beating Palestinians. Mr. Rabin doesn’t share Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir’s belief that the occupied territories are Israel’s God-given birth- right. He is willing to trade some land for peace. He opposes Jewish settlements in densely populated Arab areas and has said he would give the Palestinians self-government within nine months of becoming prime minister. voters in this increasingly vola- tile U.S. election year.

Congress would be a side beneficiary, since a new package of loan guarantees would let House and Senate members cast votes that appeal to their constit- uents who back Israel, and that includes fundamentalist Chris- tians and traditional liberals as well as Jewish voters. The politi- cal liability probably would not be great, since guarantees are not outright aid and are not cost- ly, assuming the loans are repaid to commercial lenders. The administration also will welcome the policies Labor would be expected to carry to the negotiating table, replacing Li- kud’s refusal to compromise on any major issues in talks with Arab neighbors and with Pales- tinians under occupation. Mr. Rabin would not be a pope but he already has an- nounced willingness to trade land for peace, both in talks with Pales- tinians and with Syria. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - June 24, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "U.S. might back force to halt Serbs By Marcia Kunstel COX NEWS SERVICE WASHINGTON — The United States is edging toward advocat- ing military force to crack the wall of Serbian firepower keeping hu- manitarian aid from reaching Bos- nia, Secretary of State James A. Baker III indicated Tuesday. “It is an outrage. It is barbaric and it is inhuman,’’ Baker said of the Serb attacks on Bosnia-Herze- govina. He outlined a series of unilateral moves that essentially would ter- minate diplomatic relations be- tween the United States and the Serbian-run government in Bel- grade, Yugoslavia. “We will consult and coordinate with others on additional steps to be taken, including steps that would ensure that the relief opera- tion is no longer blocked in Saraje- vo,’’ Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Serbian mortar and artillery at- tacks on Sarajevo have frustrated most international attempts to re- plenish exhausted supplies of food and medicine for the estimated 400,000 residents suffering daily bombardment in the capital. While Baker did not identify what additional steps the adminis- tration is considering, he acknowl- edged that he is leaning toward the use of military force. In unilateral action, the secre- tary said he is recommending that President Bush ‘‘no longer accept’’ Belgrade’s ambassador in Wash- ington, and that he shut down the Yugoslav consulate in Chicago, the last in the United States. He also said the United States will intensify efforts to have Serbia and Montenegro — the only two republics left in fractured Yugosla- via — suspended from member- ship .in international organiza- GB SARAJEVO POUNDED/3A BB ATTROCITIES REPORTED/3A tions. Rather than be awarded the mantle of statehood, Baker said this remnant of Yugoslavia must apply for membership and thus be forced to comply with internation- al criteria such as respecting hu- man rights. “It’s hard to believe, really, in this day and age, that armed forces will fire artillery and mortars indis- criminately into the heart of a city, flushing defenseless men, women and children out into the streets and then shooting them,’ Baker said. “Serbian militias inspired by Belgrade cannot be allowed to continue to perpetuate this hu- manitarian nightmare,”’ he said.

If the at- tacks have not halted in 48 hours, U.N. Sec- retary General S Boutros Bou- Boutros- Ghali tros-Ghali said in a message to the Security Council, it will then be up to the council ‘‘to determine what other means would be required to bring relief to the suffering people of Sarajevo.” Any effort to get aid into Bosnia is not likely to rely upon combat troops on the ground. U.S. war- planes could provide cover for air- craft dropping food in an airlift, The council will meet Monday to assess events of the weekend and discuss further steps, according to a spokesman for Ambassador Paul Noterdaeme of Belgium, the coun- cil president. Diplomats said no options have been ruled out for getting food and medicine to an estimated 400,000 people in Sarajevo. The secretary general’s ultima- tum came hours after President Bush called a White House meeting of his top security and military advisors to discuss the deteriorat- ing situation in Sarajevo. Bush’s national security ueibtn- er, Brent Scowcroft, said after the 90-minute meeting that options for getting emergency food and medi- cine into Sarajevo were discussed, but that Washington would take no action without a U.N. mandate.. However, even before Boutros- Ghali set the wheels in motion for such a mandate, rumblings of U.S. military preparations were picked up around the country. Members of the Navy Reserve said they had been called by their superiors late Thursday gee | if they would be willing to ‘“volu teer” for unspecified duty involv- ing Yugoslavia. At the same time, some Navy Reserve units on Thurs- day conducted a ‘recall drill’? — a test of their ability to mobilize reservists.

        "ocr_text": " THE TAILHOOK AFFAIR quits over scandal He accepts blame for failed leadership after 26 women reported they were sexually assaulted and harassed by naval aviators. By ANDREW MOLLISON and MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox NEWS SERVICE Washington, D.C. — Taking blame for “the leadership failure” that led to the Tailhook sex harass- ment scandal, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Gar- rett Ill resigned Friday. “IT hereby tender my resig- § nation as secre- fy tary of the Navy, F effective immedi- ately,”’ the en Navy's top civil- Garrett a letter to a sur- ——————_-—_- prised President Bush. A White House press statement, rather than the usual public letter from Bush, said accepted arre It said: ‘The president seeks a full, thorough, and expedited investiga- tion that will result in actions to en- sure the highest standards of equali- ty and conduct among all members of the Navy. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated.” After the Tailhook convention of active and retired Navy and Marine Corps pilots in Las Vegas last fall, 26 women reported that they were sex- ually assaulted and harassed when they got caught in a gantlet of drunk- en naval aviators partying in a hotel hallway. Garrett was on a nearby terrace, and at one point used an out- side door to enter and stay briefly in aroom off the hallway. He emphasized that “contrary to what has been so maliciously sug- gested in the media . . . | neither saw nor engaged in any offensive con- duct” at the convention, which had similar gantlets in the same hallway But, in his letter from one former naval aviator to another, Garrett told Bush he accepted responsibility “for the leadership failure, which al- lowed the egregious conduct at Tail- hook to occur in the first instance” and for “the post-Tailhook manage- ment of my department.” Once the incidents were reported, it is charged, some officers refused to launch an inquiry. Others later re- fused to cooperate with Navv inves- tigators, whose official report failed to mention that Garrett was near the hallway where the gantlet was formed. . “It’s unfortunate that it had to take this long for the Navy to re- spond in an appropriate fashion,” commented Ruth Jones, a staff attor- ney at the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York. We hope that his resignation won't end the investigation, but will begin a stronger investigation which will result in the individuals in- volved being identified and disci- plined,” she said, Early this weck, Garrett asked the Defense Department's inspector gen- eral to investigate the incident and _ the Navy's own probe. “I am committed to ensuring a thorough and independent investiga- tion and to whatever corrective action is necessary,” Defense Secre- tary Dick Cheney said Friday even- ing in a statement praising Garrett's “courage and loyalty.” Garrett was under pressure from the women, half of them Navy offi- cers, who had complained about being assaulted, as well as from women’s groups and from the Senate Armed Services Committee. Hours before Garrett resigned, the Senate Armed Services Committee declined to approve any of the 4,500 promotions pending for Navy and Marine Corps officers until Pentagon officials cleared more nominees of Involvement in the scandal. Senate approval is required by the Constitution for promotions of offi- cers, but enlisted personnel are not affected by the dispute. _ The Tailhook Association, named after the device that stops planes landing on aircraft carriers, has both military and civilian members and every year sponsors a convention highlighting developments in naval aviation. Another convention cus- tom is wild partying. Palm Beach Post - June 27, 1992 \f"

ABOLFATH MAHVI — A friend of Iran’s then- reigning shah since boyhood, he made millions in the 1960s as an Iranian agent for Amoco. By the mid-1970s he had new clients GE, Litton and Honeywell. Contacted by Bucha in late 1974, he agrees to joint Iran ventures with EDS. BILL GAYDEN — Bucha’s boss in Dallas. Re- ported to Perot. Completed EDS background check on Mahvi.

Palm Beach Post - June 28, CHRONOLOGY Fall 1974 — Ross Perot names Vietnam hero Paul Bucha head of his new overseas operation. Bu- cha's friend, Charlies Hofflund, head of Litton Aero Products, recommends businessman Abolfath Mahvi represent EDS in Iran. November 1974 — Bucha meets Mahvi's deputy, Moosa Haghani, for an initial talk in New York. December 1974 — Perot sends his chief asso- ciate, Mort Meyerson, and others to check out Mahvi. They find he has a ‘close connection’ with the shah that could be ‘very important’ to EDS. May 15, 1975 — Bucha meets Mahvi deputy Ali Tadjedin in the United States. About May 27, 1975 — Mahvi meets Perot in Dallas. Mahvi and Perot confirm their organizations will have a joint venture in Iran.

A few ompanies went further and got idance from the U.S. Embassy in ehran, headed until late 1976 by ormer CIA chief Richard Helms. EDS said in 1980 it had never nd reason to start an internal quiry involving Mahvi. Now, elms and four other diplomats ho served in the 1970s in Tehran, Perot and other EDS execu- es never asked about Mahvi. Even after Mahvi was jailed for month in Tehran and interrogat- i by the shah’s investigators in 77, Perot didn’t have Bucha, his >»puty in Iran, insist on knowing subjects of the Iranian investi- tions, Bucha says. Instead of ausuatigniting: Perot’s mpany got in deeper and deeper th Mahvi as the Iranian and his sociates helped arrange four DS contracts between 1975 and 78. Profit margins ran as high as percent, Bucha recalls. “If there hadn’t been a revolu- 2 $20 million EDS finally earned on ar agama . 5 ubecameel rat: of Files of Iran’s secret 1977 in vestigation of Mahvi contained sug gestions — never verified — tha’ he may have acted as a “bag mar for various members of the roya! family ... and as the shah’s owr pimp,” according to a 1979 US. diplomatic cable. Perot campaign spokesman Jim Squires says: “Mr. Perot had absolutely no idea of what Mr. Mahvi’s role might have been in the shah’s personal life.””’ Bucha con- curs, saying he never informed Perot of rumors to that effect cir- culating in Tehran. Mahvi, now nearly 80, lives near Geneva, Switzerland. He de- clined to answer questions. Instead, he referred a reporter’s inquiries to Bucha, who has remained his trust- ed friend. In a series of interviews, Bucha — one of Perot’s cadre of ex- Vietnam warriors — provided an unprecedented look inside Perot’s overseas subsidiary. In 1974, Perot sent Bucha to Iran as senior vice president of EDS World, a subsidiary Bucha started. Perot’s style was to find someone he trusted and then dele- gate the details, says Bucha, now manager of a real estate company in Jersey City, N.J. “He trusted me not to pay bribes, and I didn’t,” Bucha says. Prospecting in Iran Late in 1974, Perot decided EDS should pursue profits overseas to help him bounce back from the $60 million losses he had just sus- tained in failed investments in two Wall Street brokerages. EDS stock, the basis of his fortune, had fallen from $160 to $13 in five years. When Bucha said he had found a reputable, well-connected Iranian to help launch EDS in Iran, Perot in December 1974 sent a team of executives to Tehran to look into business prospects. The executives reported back that Mahvi had a “close connec- tion” with the shah and “could be In May 1975, after a Mahvi associate had obtained the first Iranian contract for EDS, Perot and Mahvi met in Dallas for two hours to trade visions of how EDS could enter the oil-rich Iranian market in a joint venture with Mahvi. Thereafter, Perot left it to sub- ordinates to deal with Mahvi. During a 1980 civil suit between EDS and Iran’s new Islamic revolu- tionary government, Iranian law- yers tried to convince a U.S. feder- al judge in Dallas that Mahvi obtained EDS Iranian contracts through bribes. Not so, insisted EDS. And Judge Robert Porter ruled he had heard “no evidence” of bribery or corrup- tion. He allowed EDS to seize $16 million from an Iranian bank ac- count in New York for breach of contract. Yet the Dallas trial records — coupled with interviews with Bu- cha — show Perot had some rea- sons to look deeply into EDS deal- ings in Iran: @ One month after Perot met Mahvi in 1975, Bucha filed an EDS affidavit that failed to tell the whole story about its dealings with the Iranian. The Bucha affidavit states EDS never had “incurred liability for any fees, commissions, bonuses, gratuities or other payments or considerations to brokers, h sas, finders, or other persons . . wheth- er in or out of Iran.” But two weeks before the Perot-Mahvi meeting, Bucha had promised Mahvi a 33-percent cut of profits from an anticipated con- tract with the Iranian navy, ac- ing to an EDS memo that sur- faced in the Dallas trial. Bucha stands by the affidavit — then required by Iran as part of an anti-corruption drive — wasn’t meant to cover the kind of joint venture EDS and Mahvi had formed. @ EDS agreed to share profits with a Mahvi-controlled founda- tion, calling this a boost to Iranian education. But the foundation, chaired by the shah, also envisioned ing Mahvi's relatives. For months EDS avoided com- mitment to the foundation. Then — faced with a demand by Mabhvi to share in the of a big Iranian security contract — EDS backed down. EDS already had issued a press release saying it had won the con- tract, but Iran’s health minister refused to put it into effect until Mahvi lifted his objections. Perot’s lawyer, Tom Luce — now his campaign chairman — was sent by Perot to Tehran to find a legal way to satisfy Mahvi. The solution: EDS would hire hundreds of Iranian staffers exclu- sively through an Iranian company, which was half-owned by “an edu- cational foundation founded by Mr. Mahvi.” Bucha says the foundation by- laws were broad enough to allow Mahvi to donate proceeds to his relatives. Because the shah’s gov- ernment collapsed, EDS did not make payments to the foundation. | Reporting from Dallas, Cox Newspapers correspondent Scott Shepard contributed to this arti- cle.

They will join a smaller force of about 60 troops that formed an advance contin- gent attempting to negotiate a cease-fire that would clear the way for mercy convoys.

Ruling out the use of U'S. ground combat troops, Mr. Che- ney said air support from the Navy and Air Force would be made available to an internation- al relief operation if United Na- tions peacekeepers are unable to maintain a cease-fire in Bosnia- Herzegovina. “That would involve provid- ing humanitarian assistance in an environment in which there might be some military resis- tance or some ongoing combat between the parties that are cur- rently engaged around Saraje- vo,” Mr. Cheney told a group of reporters Tuesday. At a later briefing, Defense Department spokesman Pete Two Canadian soldiers, part of the U.N Williams announced that a six- ship naval convoy, including four amphibious ships, a destroyer and a cruiser, arrived Monday with 2,200 Marines in the Adriat- ic Sea off the coast of what used to be Yugoslavia.

Fighter jets from land and sea also are available, in- cluding those from the aircraft carrier Saratoga, which is on port call in France.

Weeks ago U.N. officials, in- cluding Marrack Goulding, the head of peacekeeping opera- tions, began quietly insisting that the airport would be insufficient as a receiving point for a major humanitarian effort.

He said his staff had ruled out a Bush trip to Paris by studying logs of the Secret Service details that protected Mr. Bush as a vice presidential candidate. Mr. Bush turned the logs over to the Ham-. ilton committee on Monday. _. Mr. Hamilton would not de- tail where Mr. Bush and his wife, Barbara, spent that four-day pe- riod. But he said his staff investi- rs have verified the informa- in the Secret Service logs by conducting unsworn interviews with “less than 10” agents then assigned to guard the Bushes. While clearing Mr. Bush, Democrats and Republicans on the 13-member House panel de- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 2, 1992 cided unanimously that it would be “prema *” to close down their inquiry while questions re- main open on whether other Re- publicans may have met the Ira- nians to sabotage President Jim- my Carter’s 1980 re-election campaign. The chief remaining tenet of the “‘October Surprise” theory is the contention that the late Wil- liam Casey, later President Ron- ald Reagan’s CIA chief, cooked up an “arms-for-no-hostages”’ deal in a midsummer 1980 meet- ing with the Iranians in Madrid. So far, the strongest evidence is the testimony of a former Ira- nian arms dealer and double agent, who says he saw Mr. Casey in Spain. Since 1988, Mr. Bush has been dogged by rumors that he flew to Paris aboard a 2,000- mile-an-hour Air Force SR-71 re- connaissance jet in the midst of the 1980 campaign to promise arms deliveries to the Iranian revolutionaries. The charge originated with Richard Brenneke, a_ self-de- scribed former Mossad and CIA agent, who claimed in 1988 that he had been told Mr. Bush met the Iranians in Paris. Mr. Bush, by then the Repub- lican presidential candidate, is- sued absolute denials, but the story had refused to die. \f"

American planes to carry aid to Sarajevo By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — Two Ameri- can C-130 transport planes will help ferry humanitarian aid to Sa- rajevo, Secretary of State James Baker said Wednesday, but details of when they will be dispatched and where they will land remained un- certain. Baker said the administration will comply with a U.N. appeal to supply the planes to fly food and medicine to the embattled Bosnian capital. But the Pentagon still had not received a request by the end of the day that would detail whether American pilots are expected to fly the planes and if they would land at the Sarajevo airport still under sporadic fire. “There are people there facing — many hundreds of thousands of people facing — the prospect of starvation,” Baker said. While the administration agreed to help get supplies to the Palm area where some 400,000 people have been under siege nearly four months, it made no further move Wednesday toward sending mili- tary air support to defend the hu- manitarian effort. In fact, a Pentagon spokesman said six Navy ships had dispersed from positions in the Adriatic Sea off Yugoslavia and headed for lib- erty ports for the July 4 holiday.

        "ocr_text": "Too many hands on the ruble spigot a big problem for Russia By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU _ Washington — Next week's eco- nomic summit will focus on one of the most intractable problems Russian: President Boris Yeltsin is trying to wrestle into submission: controlling Russia's ruble when 11 other indepen- dent states are spending it. _ That is what the International Mone- tary Fund has been asking the Russians to accomplish before agreeing to release a of dollars in badly needed ts. Leaders of the Group of Seven major industrial nations already have dropped broad hints that their summit in Mu- nich, Germany, will encourage the IMF to relent and hand over at least a piece of the aid package without a full agree- ment on economic reforms. The G-7 nations previously proposed granting $24 billion in aid, but only after Russia and the IMF strike such an agreement. One sign of softening came this week, for example, when U, S. Secretary of State James Baker said he expects to see “discussions about the speed with which that [$24 billion] can begin to be disbursed.” Asked whether he thinks dollars will accompany verbal support for the Yelt- sin regime next week, Mr. Baker was af- firmative. A senior German official in Wash- ington also indicated interest in loosen- ing some bilateral aid from the package before a reform plan is finalized. Re- ports from Moscow indicate that the IMF is considering a “release of $1 billion. And this is even before Mr. Yeltsin is sure to give the G-7 leaders an earful of explanations — if not outright com- plaints — about why demands for a “ru- ble zone” and some other IMF condi- tions are impossible to meet quickly. Joel Hellman, a political scientist at Columbia University, said in an inter- view that the new states of the former Soviet Union have found ways to cir- cumvent the fact that Russia controls the ruble printing presses. States such as Ukraine issue credit, or “non-cash rubles,” to wobbly state enterprises with insufficient funds to keep operating. Back in the days of the Soviet Union, this used to be a strictly regulated non-cash circuit, he ex- plained, but now new commercial banks will exchange these “non-cash rubles” for hard cash rubles. Ukraine alone has issued some 500 billion rubles’ worth of credits, dramati- cally increasing the demand on Russia to come up with more rubles. And that's what just one country is doing.

A com- puter-generated label didn't have room to fit our whole name, so someone wrote “ion” after ‘‘Alicia Pat- terson Foundat.” Inside was a form letter, ending “very truly yours” and signed by no one, containing the stun- ning news that four months earlier, without notification, C & P had turned over the telephone records of our jour- nalism foundation to the federal gov- ernment. | This cowardly letter contained no telephone number or name from any- one at C & P — just a reference that we could call an Internal Revenue Service number in Washington. No one helped there, but records faxed by a C&P lawyer confirmed that this sub- poena is part of the Justice Depart- ment's efforts to find the sources that one of our fellows, Greg Millman, a fi- nancial journalist in Plainfield, N.J., used when he wrote an article on the IRS last September in Corporate Fi- nance magazine, His story showed that the IRS is fail- ing to collect millions of dollars in taxes owed by corporations that at- tempted to lock in profits through cur- rency and interest-rate hedging. After the magazine article was pub- lished, the IRS quickly enlisted the help of the Justice and Treasury de- partments. Treasury agents showed [ he letter from C & P Telephone Margaret ENGEL AND Joseph P. ALBRIGHT —_~——- IRS story spurs snooping on phones up at Millman’s home in November — and later at the campus office of a Nobel Prize-winning economist Mill- man quoted in an effort to prove that someone leaked confidential tax infor- mation. Five months after Millman wrote that article for the New York financial Magazine, he became part of the 27th class of Alicia Patterson fellows — print journalists who are awarded a year’s stipend to research and write vital news stories. The foundation is housed rent-free in Newsday's Wash- ington office. Phone Never Used In a benefit that is appreciated by its director, the mother of two small chil- dren, the foundation also has a busi- ness telephone line to her home in Be- thesda, Md. The Internal Revenue Service now has records of every call made through this line for 13 months, although this telephone was never used by Millman or his sources. Millman was not working for the foundation during any of these months, but he may well have called us for an application and instructions after he became a finalist. What citizens may not know is that your telephone records are not pri- vate. The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press sued AT & T on this issue and lost in 1978, According to the courts, the tele- ‘phone company — not you — owns your telephone records. In our case, we were kept in the dark about the investigation of our tele- phone records. The IRS asked that we not be told “because premature disclo- sure of this request may impede the in- vestigation.” We finally found out when the IRS let its request for secrecy expire, Millman said he was told by an em- ployee of his phone company that se- crecy requests could be renewed throughout someone's lifetime. Mill- man’s home office telephone records already have been seized in a subpoe- na approved by William Barr, the U.S. attorney general. The home telephone records of a for- mer classmate who lives in Washing- ton also have been taken. Additional- ly, the Justice Department has notified Corporate Finance's lawyer that it intends to see more of Millman’s tele- phone records. The subpoena we belatedly received showed that the records of two other Maryland telephones were taken with ours. One is a home-building firm in Rockville, the other a Bethesda finan- cial association. Millman interviewed people at these offices for two unre- lated stories. Treasury agents declined to explain their actions over the telephone and asked to see us in person. This fishing expedition appears to be an attempt to intimidate sources and stifle embarrassing stories. Al- though there is a legitimate concern with privacy of tax records, people and telephones unrelated to the issue have been swept into the Justice De- partment’s electronic snooping. Misued Privacy Laws Over the years, the IRS has misused privacy laws to suppress stories about the agency's policies. The subpoena tells us these telephone records were headed for the folks sitting in room No. 2 of the U.S. District Court’s Grand Jury 91-3 in Washington. They're try- ing to identify and indict a whistle- blower. We feel as if the Treasury agents have opened the door to our office with no advance notice and stolen our telephone records. It’s certainly a grim anniversary reminder that Richard Nixon's plumbers unit was created to plug news leaks.

The willingness of the U.S. military to comment on some spector was not injured.

The team’s 17 days of round-the-clock surveillance there ended with the Wednesday attack. » The U.S.-led coalition that carried specific deployments — a depar- ture from normal patterns of se- crecy — indicated that officials are hoping that threats will be enough to make Saddam back down. For example, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Bryan Whitman said shore leave for the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga, planned for the island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean Sea from Mon- day through Aug. 3, had been canceled. “The U.S... military commanders felt it necessary and prudent to keep the USS Sar- atoga and her battle group at sea, should they receive further task- ing,’’ Major Whitman explained. out last year’s Persian Gulf War against Iraq once again resorts to military force to convince Iraqi President Saddam Hus- sein that he must cooperate. “We are not ruling out any option, in- cluding the use of military force,” said White House spokesman Marlin Fitz- water.

Upon returning Sunday evening from his Camp David retreat, Mr. Bush warned that the interna- tional community will not accept Baghdad's contin- ued defiance of U.N. resolutions adopted to rein in Traq after the Persian Gulf War. “Behavior along the lines we have just wit: nessed will not be tolerated,” said the president. “There's too much at stake for the region, the Unit: ed Nations and the world.” Mr. Bush had canceled a weekend retreat at his Maine seaside house in order to meet at Camp Da- vid on Saturday with national security advisers about the crisis, Mr. Ekeus said that the compromise with Iraq over inspecting the Agriculture Ministry was ac- ceptable to members of the U.N.

Any suspicious documents they find would be brought outside for scrutiny by three other weapons experts, two from the United States and one from Russia, Mr. Ekeus said. Iraq has had since July 5 to sneak away any relevant docu- ments, so Officials doubt much remains to be found. “Most probably this build- ing has been quite effectively cleaned out,” Mr. Ekeus said, while vowing that the experi- enced inspectors will hunt for any traces left behind.

But Mr. Scowcroft, appear- ing on CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday, called the ministry confrontation only “the tip of the iceberg.” “It’s important that the United Nations now keep the pressure on Iraq and not let him [Saddam] willy-nilly do what he wants to do,” Mr. Scowcroft said. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” also pointed to arecent pattern of resistance by Saddam to a range of U.N. resolutions that Iraq had ac- cepted as part of the Gulf War cease-fire. “He has in the last few weeks embarked on a course of confrontation,” Mr. Cheney said, though the defense secre- tary assessed U.N. efforts to dismantle Iraq’s weapons sys- tems as effective. While Mr. Bush said Sad- dam “caved in” in the face of mounting allied pressure, the Iraqi president continued to show his belligerent nature. “The mother of all battles is not over,” Saddam said Sunday at an awards ceremony, accord- ing to the Iraqi News Agency. His reference to continuation of the Persian Gulf War was not further explained. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 27, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Kuwaitis still live on the edge By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT of Cox News Service KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait — At Jamal al- Ajameni’s little amusement park, fear of war has been cutting the box office in half. So when he heard Sunday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had once again backed down in the face of renewed allied attacks, his face erupted in a joyous smile. “That’s good,” he said, bounding out of his ticket booth. “That means everyone will come out here again.” He grabbed a visitor by the shoulder and insisted on sharing a free spin in one of Playland’s electric-powered bumper cars. Like millions of Arabs, Jews, Druse, Kurds and others within Scud missile range of Iraq, Ajameni had spent a glum Sunday waiting to see if war would break out again. Try as they might, Ajameni and others can’t keep their daily lives separate from the ca- pricious will of the man in Baghdad. On a good day, hundreds of Ku- waitis drive to Ajameni’s vest- pocket Disneyland to spin in the Hully Gully merry-go-round or whirl in his mock fighter planes on the ride called Air Force. But as the latest Baghdad crisis escalated toward air strikes, his crowds have evaporated. “All the fathers and mothers are scared,” Ajameni said, as he waited for news about whether Hussein would back down. ‘They aren't scared for themselves or for their country or for their money, but they are scared for their children.” That wasn’t the only sign of fear. In one popular market, an Indian tailor told of how some white-robed Kuwaiti men were furtively turning up at his store to buy the kind of men’s trousers normally worn by Pakistani expatriate workers. “If the Iraqis come again, they want to be able to get out,’ explained a member of the Indian commercial community. Just across the back fence from Playland is a horrifying reminder of what happened nearly two years ago when Hussein thought he could make the world knuckle under. It is a mile-long stretch of sand and weeds on which the Kuwaiti government displays more than 750 destroyed Iraqi tanks, artillery guns and other steely relics of the allied blitz that supposedly finished Hus- sein’s ambitions in early 1991. Until the latest war scare, this captured Iraqi war paraphernalia drew scores of cars full of prideful Kuwaitis every day to this site on Sixth Ring Road, on the outskirts of the city. But the prospect of more fighting has cut down on that urge. Hammad al Majidi, a 35-year-old government clerk, one of the rela- tively few who visited the tank graveyard Sunday, said, “I was thinking about the Iraqis who died in all these tanks. It is terrible to think it could happen again.”’ As the Baghdad crisis intensi- fied, the Kuwaiti government put its army on alert and prepared to send a delegation of ministers to other Arab capitals to drum up support. This time, Kuwait’s ruler, the emir, has remained in the country rather than taking an extended summer vacation. Mutlak al-Mutlak, a 29-year-old Kuwaiti army sergeant, was one of the troops dispatched to the north- ern front Sunday to wait in a hot, swirling dust storm to see whether Hussein would try to take on Kuwait once again. “We are not afraid,’’ he said as he took a break from the 135-de- gree sun to enter a roadside grocery store. ‘‘With God and countries like the USA on our side, we feel very strong.” The Kuwaitis have seen enough of Hussein’s devious shrewdness to know that he hasn’t given up his of- ten-expressed intention to someday turn Kuwait into Iraq’s ‘19th Prov- ince.” : Tampa Tribune - July 27, 1992 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Swedish disarmament expert keeps UN, on weapons’ trail By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Ambassador Rolf Ekeus Claims not to know the difference between a milk separator and nuclear bomb parts. He knows enough about weapons and diplomacy, however, to keep U.N. inspectors on the trail of Iraq's dead- ly arms networks more often than not. Mr. Ekeus, executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) set up to elimi- nate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, returns to meatal today to get the inspections back on track, He diverted a military confrontation last weekend but still could face a hostile reception from a belligerent Iraqi leadership that has tried to thwart U.N. teams for more than a year. Mr. Ekeus, who recently disavowed being a weapons expert and modestly described himself as “floating without any expertise at all,” is in fact a Swedish diplomat of 30 years’ experience. For at least the last decade he has focused on disarmament, after joining Sweden’s Foreign Ser- Vice in 1962 and serving in Bonn, Nairobi, New York and The Hague. Born in 1935 and schooled as a lawyer, Mr. Ekeus was drafted into service by the U.N. secre- tary-general to head UNSCOM when it was creat- ed after the Gulf War in April 1991. He repeatedly has traveled to Baghdad to douse diplomatic brushfires that the regime of Atlanta Journal-Constitution - July 28, 1992 President Saddam Hussein has lit to obstruct in- spections. Mr. Ekeus has protested everything from Iraqi agents shooting at U.N, inspectors to the latest standoff over searching Baghdad’s Ag- riculture Ministry. Each time he has gotten Iraq to back down, but he came close to losing this last dispute. Even Mr, Ekeus, a polished, silver-haired statesman who believes negotiation beats armed confrontation, admitted it was the allied threat of military force that finally got Iraq to compromise. “T’'m afraid I have to say that it helped,” he said Sunday, amid reports he was prepared to quit his position if allied forces actually had been called to arms against Iraq. His background as Sweden's permanent rep- resentative to the Geneva Conference on Dis- armament from 1983 to 1988, followed by three year's of international military negotiations in Vi- enna, reflects his belief in a peaceful, diplomatic approach to world problems. After all, he said at a recent news conference, it was not the Gulf War that uncovered and de- stroyed Saddam Hussein's most devastating weapons, It was U.N. inspectors who found and are dismantling Iraq’s nuclear network, vast stores of chemical weapons and ballistic missile launchers, “Arms control has demonstrated that it is the way to destroy weapons, and not through bomb- ing and attacks,” Mr. Ekeus said, \f"

        "ocr_text": "Iraq boasts “brilliant victory’ President Bush is making military moves to force Baghdad to submit to U.N. inspectors’ terms. By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau KUWAIT CITY — Iraq declared Monday that it had achieved a “brilliant victory” in winning a compromise over weapons inspections, but the Bush ad- ministration poured on new pressure with more military moves in the region “We put the United Nations in a position in which it was forced to deal with us in a different way,” Aziz said. Such assertions have added fuel to a debate within the administra- tion and among policy experts, some of whom argue that the plan represents an important erosion of the U.N. inspection rights. Saddam “has won this game,” David Kay, an American who was the chief inspector for Iraq’s nucle- ar weapons facilities, said in an interview Monday. His vigil in a Baghdad parking lot over a similar dispute last year captured world attention. The Bush administration planned the U.S. military actions, including dispatching the USS Ken- nedy from shore leave in the Carib- bean to duty in the Mediterranean Sea, as a warning that Iraq must back off its resistance and not re- new aggression against Kuwait. The Patriots were a primary defense against Iraq’s SCUD mis- siles during the Persian Gulf War last year, and may be en route to Kuwait because new Iraqi rhetoric again proclaims Kuwait to be “our southern land” and “part of our and demands that Baghdad stop resist- ing United Nations mandates. Besides dispatching a third U.S. air- craft carrier to the area, the Pentagon also was reported ready to send a bat- tery of Patriot anti-aircraft missiles to Kuwait. In a cheeky commentary monitored in Kuwait City on Monday, Iraq said it forced the United Nations to accept its terms to search for a suspected trove of Iraqi nuclear and missile secrets in the Baghdad ministry. The boast came as the chief of the U.N. inspection commission, Rolf Ekeus, southern land” and “part of our country.” When Iraq invaded Ku- wait two years ago it said it was was acknowledging that his new team of “neutral” inspectors is unlikely to hit pay dirt when entering the Iraqi Agricul- ture Ministry today. “We are quite pessimistic now about making any major catch at the facility,” said Ekeus. After agreeing to replace the former chief inspector, American Mark Silver, Ekeus is due in Baghdad today with a German-led team consisting of two Germans and one person each from Russia, Switzerland, Finland and Swe- den. Interviewed in London before he flew to lead the new team into Baghdad, reclaiming what used to be its 19th }. province. While Iraqi officials were dis- paraging the United Nations and its resolutions restricting Iraq’s eco- nomic and military freedom, Presi- dent Bush insisted at a campaign visit in Grand Rapids, Mich., that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ultimately will abide by U.N. dic- tates. “He’s going to do it. He may not know it, but he is going to live up to those resolutions,’ the president said. Administration officials ac- cepted the compromise on weapons inspections, in which Iraq finally agreed to let a team enter its Agriculture Ministry as long as no inspectors from the allied nations were included. Iraq had barred en- try since July 5. But U.S. officials repeated again Monday that they remain unhappy with Iraq’s behavior in a range of other areas, and Bush met with his national security advisers Monday night to discuss the situa- tion. Albright reported from Ku- wait; Kunstel reported from Washington. The New York Times contributed to this report. Ekeus said he had been confident that the ministry contained revealing ar- chives on Iraqi missile and nuclear weapons, But the outnumbered U.N. team was forced by officially inspired Iraqi crowds to abandon its 17-day vigil, leaving Ekeus to press for the abstract principle of the U.N.’s right to inspect. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Monday that Baghdad had established a precedent and that interna- tional inspectors could no longer enter buildings on their own terms. THE ASSi TED PRESS, “We are quite pessimistic now about making any major catch at the facility,’ U.N. inspection com- mission chief Rolf Ekeus says Monday during a stop in Bahrain on his way to Baghdad.

By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau KUWAIT CITY — Iraq’s Saddam Hus- sein pumped up more anti-American fer- vor among his war-weary citizens Tues- day even as the United States urged another, immediate test of Iraq’s willing- ness to comply with United Nations man- dates. While pressure for military action now against Iraq eased a notch in Wash- ington, U.S. forces prepared for large- scale military maneuvers next week here inspection,” said Fitzwater, refer- ring to the two U.S. inspectors who waited outside the ministry Tues- day to review whatever material the team recovered. 4 After half a day of searching, the new German-led inspection team returned to their Baghdad hotel, where they refused to say whether they had found anything. The Iraqi regime barred West- ern TV cameras from photograph- ing the inspectors entering the building, and instead arranged a made-for-TV demonstration in which Iraqi loyalists burned an ef- tigy that looked like a dwarf figure of President Bush. Banners written in English proclaimed the crowd’s eternal loyalty to Hussein. Hussein’s press secretary, Ab- duljabbar Mohsen, set the tone for the demonstration by calling Bush a “tunnel-visioned charlatan” in an article in the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party. The article announced massive demonstra- tions across Iraq in support of Hus- sein and against Bush, who was also described as ‘‘a vagabond, full of rancor, savage and a hag.” on Hussein’s southern border. Almost lost in the escalating rhetoric was the fact that Hussein’s regime did finally remove the padlocks from its Agriculture Ministry and allowed six Iraqi-approved U.N. inspectors to begin rummaging for documentary proof of Iraqi weapons secrets. Before the inspectors even reported their findings, administration officials made it clear they want another test of Hussein’s readiness to adhere to U.N. resolutions, and they want it soon. “Tf it were up to me, I’d say tomor- row,” said a senior administration offi- cial. “It’s important to test it soon.” The White House is not dictating to the United Nations, he said, but U.S. experts have identified other sites where they . The evening Baghdad television news said Hussein spent the day swimming across the Tigris River in what appeared to be a Kurdish- populated region of northern Iraq. The scene was chosen to remind watchers that Hussein — and not the U.N. — is in command through- out his country. For his part, Bush got strong support from bipartisan congres- sional leaders he called to the White House for consultations. With the Republican National Con- vention just a few weeks away, the president signaled his growing frustration with events in Baghdad but did not say how he plans to respond. Fitzwater said the president was seeking congressional advice. After the White House meeting, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said he fully expects that the United States will have to re- sort to military strikes to bring Hussein into full compliance with the 1991 cease-fire resolution. “I think it’s predictable it will happen,” Dole said. “But I don’t know when.” Palm Beach Post - July 29, 1992 believe Iraq is hiding weapons informa- tion and “would like to encourage (the inspectors) as soon as possible to go in.” White House spokesman Marlin Fitz- water also said the administration wants the inspections to continue. “We do be- lieve they should be tested,” he said. Fitzwater said a compromise taking Americans off this inspection team would not be a precedent. Iraq lifted its nearly monthlong ban on inspectors entering the Agriculture Ministry only after U.N. offi- cials agreed to field a team without any inspectors from the allied nations that fought Iraq in the Persian Gulf War. “We will have Americans on other teams. America is deeply involved in this House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Washington, said the Democrats do not believe the administration is letting election-year politics influ- ence its decisions on Iraq. He also said the meeting led congressional leaders to assume that immediate military action against Iraq is not likely. Yet there were mixed signals from the U.S. Defense Department on how much military pressure Washington is preparing to apply. On one hand, the U.S. Marines are readying two weeks of war games in the same Kuwaiti desert their Marine compatriots captured from the Iraqis 17 months ago. On the other hand, Defense Sec- retary Dick Cheney told reporters he thinks people “are ratcheting it up more than this deserves,” and cautioned that resorting to military force is not imminent. A more substantive sign was the Pentagon’s cancellation of plans disclosed only 24 hours earli- er to send a third aircraft carrier, the USS John F. Kennedy, to within striking range of Baghdad. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Kuwaitis cheer Patriot missiles Move seen as deterrent to Baghdad By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel STAFF CORRESPONDENTS Kuwait City — To the cheers of Kuwaiti schoolchildren, a de- tachment of American soldiers arrived Wednesday and erected Patriot missiles, their big square snouts pointing northward toward Iraq. Numbering fewer than 100, the U.S. troops in their forest- green uniforms took over a va- cated Iraqi military camp to form what may turn out to be the leading edge of a Desert Shield II buildup. “It all happened very sudden- ly,’’ said 2d Lt. Lara Ballard, 23, of Johnson City, Tenn., who had been on active duty for only a month when she was ordered from Germany to Kuwait to lead 20 of the Patriot missile troops. ““You can still see some old Iraqi fighting positions. It is a strange feeling.” The Patriots, which were used to intercept Iraqi Scud mis- siles fired at Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, have been sent to Kuwait to pro- tect against possible attacks from Iraq. The military moves were ac- companied in Washington by other pressures on Iraq, which are expected to mount in coming weeks. The Bush _ administration gave unprecedented new support for Iraqi opposition figures when Secretary of State James Baker hosted the group at a State De- partment meeting. And U.N. Ambassador Ed- ward Perkins told a congression- al panel that he would press for frequent U.N. weapons inspec- tions to ‘“‘put Saddam Hussein to the test time and time again.” He also said he expects to seek U.N.

Meanwhile, in Baghdad, U.N. inspectors searched Iraq’s Agri- culture Ministry building for documents relating to Saddam’s ballistic missile program, but ap- parently found nothing. Among the first to spot the Americans in Kuwait were some schoolchildren, who waved and shouted greetings as the troops were rushing from a Kuwaiti air- field to set up their missiles, Lieutenant Ballard said. She and other officers de- clined to say exactly when the Patriot crews arrived. But by Wednesday morning, thousands of Kuwaiti commuters spotted the Patriots on their way to work. Instead of trying to conceal them, the government chose to place them like billboards within a few hundred yards of a heavily traveled Kuwait City super- highway. “T think they are here primar- ily for psychological purposes,” said Mohammed Ajeeri, editor- in-chief of the Kuwait News Agency, who spotted bulldozers making berms for the missiles early Wednesday. Word of their arrival raced through Kuwait, by word-of- mouth in the traditional markets and from one businessman’s car phone to another. “It’s the talk of the town,”’ said Abdullah Nibari, a leading Kuwaiti intellectual and candi- date for Parliament. ‘Ordinary people think of this as a guaran- tee for the sheer existence of Kuwait.” About six hours after the missiles became operational, the: Kuwaiti Defense Ministry: rushed a busload of Kuwaiti TV: crews and a few foreign journal-- ists to record the scene for the lo- - cal evening news.

        "ocr_text": "Saddam’s foes ask U.S. aid to oust him Iraqi opposition wants to form rival government By Marcia Kunstel WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington — Iraq’s newly united op- position leaders are here seeking adminis- tration and congressional support for still sketchy plans to form a rival government and ultimately oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. They are being received more seriously than ever before, partly because their frac- tious groups gained credibility by finally forging an alliance, and partly because the Bush administration is so frustrated at Sad- dam’s growing intransigence. The Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni leaders want help fleshing out and executing a scheme they hope would persuade soldiers to defect from the Iraqi army and join their bat- tle against the Iraqi dictator. Requisite to the plan, outlined in inter- views by members of the opposition delega- tion, are American financial and technical aid and a U.S. commitment to keep at bay Saddam’s aircraft and helicopter gunships, which cut down rebellions by the Kurds and Shiite Muslims last year. The aircraft are be- ing used against the Shiites again this year. “You cannot expect soldiers to defect if there is a 90 percent chance of [their] being gunned down [by Saddam]. If it is even 50- 50, they would begin to respond,” said Arif Abdul-Razagq, a Sunni Muslim and former prime minister of Iraq who now lives in Cai- ro, Egypt. The six opposition figures emerged satis- fied from exploratory discussions this week with Secretary of State James Baker, the highest-level meeting ever accorded the Ira- qi resistance. They are to meet today with national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, and have had talks with congressional lead- ers as well as other officials in the State De- partment. They could not point to specific promises of aid, but were convinced a new opportunity is open to them. ASSOCIATED PRESS Iraqi dissidents are enjoying a warm reception in Washington as they ask aid to help oust Saddam Hussein. With Secretary of State James Baker (middle) are Mas- soud Barzani, Mohammed Bahr Al Eloom, Arif Abdul-Razaq and Jalal Talabani. “We believe this is a qualitative change. Meetings at this level could introduce a very important dialogue,” said Mohammed Bahr Al Eloom, a Shiite cleric living in exile in London. Their goal, as detailed in meetings with congressional leaders, is to establish a sepa- rate government in the “liberated” northern sector of Iraq known as Kurdistan. They are not asking for recognition as a separate state, but rather as an alternative government to Saddam’s regime in Baghdad. The Kurds recently held free elections in Kurdistan, which remains under the protec- tion of allied forces. At various times Kurdi- stan has held status within Iraq as an autono- mous province, and the elections were for a Kurdish assembly. Whether the diverse opposition elements would be able to join there in a government representing factions other than the Kurds is still in question, but that appears to be the aim — with US. help. If they cannot manage an alternative gov- ernment, Mr. Abdul-Razaq said they at least envision some sort of unified “command” based there. Ultimately they would like Western help financing a communications network and an expanded military operation. Besides im- proving their odds against Saddam’s troops, they believe better weapons and the moral support of the West would attract defectors from the regular Iraqi army. Most important would be some signal that the West will not again let Saddam's troops gun down resistance forces, A.U.N. Security Council resolution pro- hibits Saddam from military repression of his own people, but the Iraqi regime has been violating that with impunity, especially in re- cent attacks against Shiites in the south.
