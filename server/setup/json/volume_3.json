        "ocr_text": "Alliance Needs Selling In Mexico: U.S. Survey By Joseph Albright (Newsday Washington Bureau) ; Washington — President and Mrs. Ken- redy, who begin a three-day trip to Mexico to- ay, face a sizable selling job on behalf of Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress. Confidential sovernment. intelligence surveys indicate less nan-in-the-street awareness of the Alliance aid program in Mexico than in any of five other atin-American countries studied. Well in advance of this trip, Newsday learned, Kennedy received from the United States Information Agency (USIA) a scries of lassified reports on Latin awareness of the Iliance. According to the reports, awareness ast fall was highest in Bogota, Colombia followed in order by Montevideo, Uruguay; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Rio de Janciro, Brazil, and in various Mexican cities. These intelligence readings supplemented other information indicating cynicism about the alliance in Mexico and elsewhere. Ken- 1edy is understood to be sensitive to these reports, since they are very similar to the pres- ige studies that became a hot issue in the 1960 . presidential proaches the Mexico visit as it did Kennedy's journey last December to Colombia, then olltakers will soon make another survey to determine by comparison how Kennedy actu- lly Succeeded in selling the Alliance in vicxico City. The exact statistics in the intelligence’ urveys are still classified: It can be reported, 1owever, that about 1,000 adults were asked campaign. If USIA ap- last fall in several Mexican cities with popu- lations of more than 10,000 whether they had. heard of the Alliance by name. Less than a quarter said yes, with the most favorable re- sponse concentrated in more prosperous areas. Officials were happier about other answers in the still-confidential surveys, Newsday learned. lor instance, polltakers found that a heavy preponderance of Mexicans interviewed thought Mexican-American economic relations were good, and even more thought they would continue to be good. At the time of the surveys, Alliance aid programs in Mexico were hardly off -the ground. * i » A survey completed this spring in Lima, Alliance in Lima than in Mexico. The statics for Bogota reportedly brought the most joy to Washington. Although Alliance awareness was found to be high prior to Kennedy’s visit, polls showed knowledge of the Alliance jumped by more than 50 per cent after his visit. Virtually all of those questioned in Bo- gota after the visit knew Kennedy had been there, and about a third saw him or heard him on the radio. ; / Under White House instructions, the con- troversial questions dealing directly with th U.S. “image” abroad have been taken out of the questionnaires, perhaps to prevent another campaign donnybrook about U.S. prestige. USIA obtains its answers by hiring focal Spanish-speaking polltakers who do not say the U.S. is paying for the studies. Among the questions in some of the: suryeys was this one: Who is sponsoring the Alliance for Progress— The U.S. Cuba, Russia or some-other nation? Most people answered correctly. “© June 29, 1962 \f"

Vacuum ) He's Getting Air Tubes By Joseph Albright ‘(Newsday Washington Bureau) - Washington—Some news doesn’t travel fast enough to suit President Kennedy, so the State Department is planning to whoosh secret messages to the White House in a $325,000 penumatic-tube system. ~ Kennedy, who reads at 1,200 words a minute, has been “screaming his head off” about how long it takes some papers to reach his desk, a State De- partment official explained. The proposed air tubes would propel messages 4,500 feet underground in 90 seconds flat, or about 34 MPH. The White House is about a half-mile from the State Depart- ment as the crow flies, : Even now, Kennedy doesn’t exactly tely on car- rier pigeons. When something important happens, State Department bigwigs can reach the White House on special scrambler-equipped telephones which are supposedly immune to wirctapping. Or the State Department can transmit documents to the President over an electronically secure Teletype ircuit. Or one of 45 trusted messengers can’ be sent by car.

This would mean the messages would have to follow a wiggling course, the report said, but at the same time would hold the cost to around $325,000. If a Russian spy gets into the tunnel disguised as a plumber, he probably would wind up in the clink. Super-duper electronic watch- men will alert security inspectors at the first hint of tampering. And if Caroline should drop a doll down an ait chute, and it clogs up the works, modem science will be able to determine instantly where it got stuck. Some State Department men are hoping Ken- nedy’ will get less irritation from his pneumatic tubes than they get from the ones already in the State Department building. The other day a man on the fourth floor telephoned someone on the second floor and asked. for two copies of a speech, Tubes hustled both copies in ‘five seconds to a message center, which happened to be on the sevy- cnth floor, But the message center put them in the interoffice mail, so it took until the next mom- . . t mg for the speech to arrive, A State Department spokesman said officially yesterday the pneumatic tubes to the White House will be proposed in next year’s budget*as-part of a “continuing effort to meet national security needs,” aiticularly during periods of intemational crisis.

During the next 15 years, while a law professor, he continued to spend many of his wak- ing hours convincing labor and mian- agement of his impartiality.

Yet he has made a virtually unanimously favorable impression on labor and man- agement representatives. ‘Chey extol his patience, in- tegrity and plain hard work.

The betting yesterday was that he would make a more cautious and contemplative labor secretary. When things are quiet, Wirtz’ working day mins Tl hours.

And even * for conservatives around the country who did not belong to the society, the report was at best mostly cloudy with scattered rays of sunkght. The extreme right took its hardest knocks in California, where voters overwhelmed Republican Reps. John H. Rousselot and Edgar W. Hiestand —the only two avowed Birchers in Congress. Ad- vertising consultant H. L. (Bill) Richardson, 32, tried mightily to become the third Birch repre- sentative from California, but was trounced by a liberal Democrat who claimed support from ‘the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE). De- feated for Congress along with the three Birchers was another California ultra-rightist, Republican Charles $. Foote, who belonged to the ‘“Consti- tution Party” in 1960. All were heavily financed by right-wing sympathizers, but they were running in districts heavily stacked against them through gerrymandering, Up to midnight Tuesday, election returns showed some signs of a nationwide conservative vic- ‘tory. Among the first batch of congressional races to hit the TV screens was Louisville, Ky., where Gene Snyder, a 34-year-old Barry Goldwater Repub- lican, knocked off an incumbent Democrat. Among the first Rocky Mountain Senate tallies was conserva- tive Republican Peter H. Dominick’s smashing up- set in Colorado of incumbent Democrat John A. Carroll. Dominick attacked Carroll for his 100 per ‘cent Americans for Democratic Action rating. l'i- nally, in a somewhat surprising Tennessee congres- sional race, conservative Republican William FE. Brock III, a 31-year-old candy executive, whipped a Kennedy man who backed medicare. The tide switched against the conservatives around midnight, and by daybreak the picture was different: @ e@ Although hospitalized, aging Sen. Carl Havden (D-Ariz.) had breezed by Phoenix auto dealer Evan Mecham, 38, who says he “sort of likes” the John Birch Society. . e@ Unexpectedly, Democrat Birch E. Bavh re- tired conservative Sen. Homer I. Capehart (R-Ind.). e@ A liberal Democrat had ousted Rep. Walter H. Judd (R-Minn.), who supports the administration on foreign aid but is also linked to rightwing-fringe groups. e In Wisconsin, liberal John W. Reynolds beat conservative Philip G. Kuehn for governor. Candidates endorsed by the AFCIO’s Commit- tee on Political Education won nine of the head-on clashes with Senate candidates backed by the conservative Americans for Constitutional Action. The conservative-suppotted candidates won five of these races. - November 8, 1962 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Fear Russians Plan to Send Arms to Congo By Joseph Albright (Newsday Washington Bureau) Washington—A small circle of top United States officials has been alerted that Russia’s next move im the Cold War may be a lightning-quick airlift of military men and supplics to the Congo. Strong indications that the Sovicts arc contemplating a sudden shipment of warplanes and other equipment in the Congo have reached Washington through top-secret U.S. intelligence and diplomatic chan- nels, Newsday learned yesterday. The information has chilled hopes im some quarters that the world was in for an era of good feclings between Premier Khrushchev and President Kennedy after the Cuban crisis. ‘““Vhis could be a very serious situation,” suid one key intelligence official. The immediate Russian purpose in the Congo, as intelligence officials now see it, would be to give the central government in Leopoldville enough air power and other conventional support to end the lingering secession by Katanga Province led by Moise ‘Vshombe. The Russians’ long-range goals, U.S. officials fear, would be (1) to make possible a pro-Sovict regime staffed by associates of the late Premier Patrice Lumumba, and (2) to set up a base for subversion and guerrilla warfare in the heart of central Africa. As a bonus, if Russian military aid enabled the central government to crush the Katanga secession, then the Kremlin would have dealt a humiliating defeat to the efforts of the U.S, and the United Nations to return the mine-rich area of Katanga to the Congo. Want UN Foreed Out According to “damned definite” reports reaching Washington, in- formal offers of a military airlift have been made in’ Leopoldville by Ambassador Sergei Nemchina and other Sovict diplomats. Sources said that a month ago the Sovict offers were being conditioned on a demand for the ouster of the 18,000-man UN force now on the scene at the request of the Congo. More recently, however, the Russians reportedly have Jaid less stress on conditions and more on what kind of weapons are needed. It would not take a massive injection of Russian aid to give the central government in Leopoldville a chance of smashing the Katangese army. The kev to ‘lVshombe’s survival has been his air foree, which now consists of about 20 planes ranging from light single engine civilian craft to two French Mivstere_ jet trainers with machine guns strapped to the fusclige. Small as it is *Tshombe’s air force gives Katanga a military and psychological edue over the Leopoldville army, which has no air force. | a Sovict officials were said lo be trying to get acce ptance for the military airlift from the government of Premier Cyrille Adoula . . - pai 3 moderate committed so far to ending the Katang; a ecession ao UN help. Adoula’s position has been severely shaken in poke a as the ament has become more and more insistent that Tshombe be overcome. One likely possibility, officials said, is that Soviet aid might start if and when Adoula is overthrown. Russ ; equipment has not been a factor in the Congo since September 1960, when Col. Joseph Mobutu turned out the Lamumba government and ordered Communist bloc diplomats and advisers to leave in 48 hours. At that time the Russian military contingent consisted of 17 —Continucd on Page 90 an omilitary Red Arms May Go fo Congo —Continued from Page 2 lvushin twin-engine transport planes, about 100 trucks and 500 technicians. . In response to the threatened Soviet arms airlift, U.S. diplomats are continuing to pressure Tshombe to end his secession and are at the same time, making it clear to the Leopoldville regime that the U.S. strongly objects to any influx of Russian weapons. What other Steps the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency may be taking cannot be determined. U.S. officials are’ pinning their hopes on three men—President Joseph Kasavubu, army Chief of Staff Mobutu and Premicr Adoula. But officials said these men are “obsessed” with the Katanga problem and could conceivably turn to the Russians if the UN solution fails. Their justification, one U.S. diplomat said yes- terday, would be similar to Sir Winston Churchill's explanation of why he joined forces with Joseph Stalin after the Germans invaded oe in 1941: he would praise the devil if it would help him defeat ‘Titler.

State Department spokesman Lincoln White said yesterday the Soyiet embassy in’ Washington notified the U.S. on Dec. 19 of ‘the Russians’ intention to undertake two such nonstop flights a week. The planes are TU-1]4s, the first of which touched down in Havana Saturday after a 6,800-mile trip - from Murmansk. The huge planes are de- signed to carry 170 passengers or 28 tons of cargo. Although their cargo has not been _determined, officials do not rule out the- pos- supersecret military hardware. The plane that landed in Havana Satur day was intercepted by U.S. jet fighters when’ it flew 65 miles off course--about 50 miles east of Palm Beach, Fla. The F-102 fighters had scrambled from Homestead Air Force Base in Miami when radar screens reported an unidentified object. However, it apparently identified itself.and continued on to Havana. The TU-114 was reported yesterday to be grounded in Havana, presumably by technical difficulties. An official Pentagon intelligence estimate is known to express doubts that-a twice-a-week schedule can be maintained. From Murmansk to Havana is about twice as far as from New York to London, and the entire route is over water. Pentagon intelligence men believe the TU-1]4s will have to carry extra fuel to in- Russian Jets Fly to Cuba —Continued from. Page. 2 ment analysts said that if the nonstop flights had begun two months ago, they would have strongly suspected the introduction of atomic warheads for Russian missiles, Several government experts said the ‘most likely explanation is psychological and political—that Premier Khrushchev wants to demonstrate his devotion to Fidel Castro. There are some dissenters, One said: “If this were just a psychological move, then why hasn’t the Cuban government greeted the TU-114 with a deluge of publicity?” White said that in accordance with an international civil aviation agreement, and at the request of the Soviet embassy, routine flight’ information will be radioed to the Russian TU-114s in the interests of ait safety. A Federal Aviation Agency spokesman explained that when Russian planes enter air zones covered by the Internationa Vlight Safety Centers in New York and Miami, American flight con trllers will ‘designate propet altitudes and radio frequencies “for the Russian planes and will relay routine weather broadcasts. cargo capacity. U.S. officials believe that behind this un- expected move by the Soviets is their desire to circumvent umnpublicized _ difficulties Havana-bound Soviet planes have run into since the Cuban crisis at their traditional stopover points in Canada and Africa. Sources said the Russians are irked by some countries’ refusal to grant landing and overflight nights to planes en route to Cuba and at other countries for insisting on searching Russian planes during stopovers to see they contained no offensive weapons. What intrigues American intelligence an- alysts is why the Russians want an air link to Havana so badly they are willing to flv 6,800 miles over water in a plane * that is thought to be not_completely reliable.

(Ted) _ Kennedy (D-Mass.) has to figure out how to cover a public relations sitzmark he made Saturday in a | film-snatching episode at a fashionable ski lodge in Stowe, Vt. His choices are painful: apologize to a 140-pound news photographer and’ pay to repair his slightly-damaged camera or face a lawsuit. There was one consolation for the President's youngest brother, who has been working overtime _in Washington trying to be inconspicuous. He had spiked a picture showing him inches away from a celebrity-hunting Canadian beauty queen. Publisher William Loeb, the cameraman’s em- _ ployer, issued an appologize-or-be-sued_ demand. j former Vérmont Gov. Frank Ray Keyser Jr. as his special counsel. “We are looking into the possibility of filing a criminal assault complaint as well as a civil damage suit,” said Loeb, a conservative Re- publican. “We will wait about a week but we don’t expect him to apologize.” The senator couldn’t be reached for comment. Loeb, who called President Kennedy a liar last week on Cuba, accused Ted Kennedy vesterday of \\ving about the ski lodge incident. “We are facing’ a crisis of veracity,” said Loeb: “If we cannot rely on the first family to tell the truth, then who can we rely on?” What Loeb -called a‘ lie was Ted Kennedy’s statement that when he “asked”?

Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (D-N.Y.-) has a distinction only a few United States congressmen can claim: sticks and bones may break his bones but names have never hurt him. Powell, in his 17 years in Con- gress, has known bad publicity many times, but he remains unruffied. “I hhate to say this to vou,’’ he told a reporter in a recent interview, ““but I don’t think the people care what they read in the paper, except for a morbid curiosity..They may tut-tut for a week or so, but thei it’s all aver.” But while his Tflarlem constituents have made him one of the seven won- ders of the political world, his col- Powell jeagues in Congress are beginning to show signs of discontent over the way he throws money around. Sen. John J. Williams (R-Del.) charged in a Senate speech last month that the government was “‘shov- eling out” funds for activities promoted by Powell. And yesterday, a House accounts subcommittee slashed ihe budget request for the Flouse Education and Labor Ga n- amittee, which Powell heads. Powell dismissed WVilliams’ charge by saying it was made because Powell is a Negro. He has weath- ered worse stormis; he owes his power to no one. Hie is both the back-room: boss and the spellbinding front man of F¥arlem, where he is also pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. When he married Yvette Flores in 1960 (he had formerly been married to pianist Elazel Scott), he not only kept her on the congressional Payroll, he mere than quadrupled her $3,074 salary and’ sént her to live in Puerto Rico. Her job, he explained, is answering letters from his constituents. : Flis most recent tongue-clucking episode was last year’s all-expenses-paid junket to Europe with two young and shapcly assistants. They went to the best theaters in London and tock in the floor show at the Lido in Paris, with the tab paid for out of government counter- part funds. “What's wrong with night clubs?” he asks. AY PNev only whe wrong wi at Sonmie people can't go. A tall, heavy-set, mustachioed man who is de- scended from slaves (his grandparents were slaves, his father a minister), the 54-year-old Powell holds several university degrees, is a champion of civil rights, and despite all the surface flash, manages to get some things done by his education and labor comniittce. As for his junkets and continental capers, Powell claims he never spends ‘‘moére than $50 a day,’? and that his colleagues also finance their travels with counterpart funds. When the glare of publicity becomes too bright, he takes comfort in the belief that the American tradi. tion of rooting for the underdog is on his side. ‘‘If every- one keeps flagellating vou,” he says, “calling you a rogue and a scamp and a demagogue, the American people will take your side.” March 6, 1963 \f"

Haitian informants—not necessarily reliable—said that Barbot shot his way out of an ambush with the help of some anti- Duvalier elements in the Haitian militia. ‘ Haitian doctors were evidently seized because the Tonton Macoute believed that they may have treated the bullet wounds of Barbot or his fellow conspirators.

By Joseph Albright (Newsday Washington Bureau) Third of a Six-Part Series d : Port-au-Prince—Everybody talked about getting rid of Haiti’s brutal dictatorship, “but that’s about all they did—talk. The truth about the recent Haitian crisis is that President Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier really was vu i\" mised oe but his enemies were, rooming itn tOwslcstigy him. omewhat stronger, but he” Today his position appears s still is not safe. When spring came to Jlaiti this year-~ wild hopes flickered that somebody—somehow—would overthrow the soft-spoken little man, who looks like the friendly under- taker but is one of the hemisphere’s last old-style strong- men, But as May became June in this Negro republic just +0 miles off Cuba, hope turned to despair. on Duvalier’s victory was not a case of a super-efficient police state crushing a formidable opposition—but rather of a lightweight outmaneuvering indecisive featherweights. “One well-placed incendiary bullet would blow his whole palace sky high because there is an ammo dump in the basement,” said a military expert. A foreign intel- ligence man stationed here went further. “There are holes in his security system. If I were ordered to do the job, I could personally assassinate Duvalicr inside of 48 hours, even if he never left the palace. Or it would take only 20 well-trained men to capture Duvalier alive.” Gravy Train Keeps Rolling Whatever his weaknesses, Duvalier was clever enough to keep the loyalty of own political machine. Members of Duvalier’s entourage had reason to fear their gravy train would stop if the leader fell, but little to gain if they joined the opposition. ‘To the 350-man palace guard, Duvalier had just given spiffy new blue uniforms, worth $150, complete with $40 high leather boots. To the Ton- ton Macoutes—Creole for “Bogeymen’’ and_ the local nickname for Duvalier’s secret police—and the denim- Shirted ciyil militiamen went new-found power and guns. Yo higher-ups in the organization went freedom to “tax local shopkeepers without turning in the proceeds, At the same time, Duvalier shunned high living, thus avoiding jealousies that might be focused upward at him from his followers. In contrast to the late dictater Rafael ‘Trujitlo of the Dominican Republic, who had dozens of mistresses and about 100 illegitimate children, Duvalier lived quictly with his wife, Simone, and two children. Mass opposition to Duvalier was never more than a weak undercurrent.

Robert D. Hein]. An army coup d'etat was planned for April, but a loyalist Haitian lieutenant tipped off Duvalier in time for him to crush it. The leader of the planned coup, Col. Charles Tour nier, was beaten to death during interrrogation, then his naked body was tossed on a cobblestone street, perforated with a broken bottle. That was the last of the army’s resistance, Sixty-four officers fled into foreign embassies, went into hiding, or were arrested. ‘The outcome of the plot was no surprise to foreign military experts. One said sadly: “I’ve never met one of these officers who could »plan»his.way outof a paper bag.” Jopes ‘then shifted to Clement Barbot, murderous onetime chieftain of Duvalier’s hated ‘Tonton Macoutes. Tle was one of perhaps 15 anti-Duvalier politicians who hid in Port-au-Prince. But only Barbot was heard from; first with a clandestine leaflet bravely warning that by May 15 “Operation Dry Cleaning” would eliminate ‘‘the pestiferous insects who war with the gorilla (Duvalier),” then with an attempt to kidnap Duvalier’s children. Underground sources confidently predicted that Barbot had secret allics among Duvalier’s bodyguard who would soon pull the trigger. They never did. Barbot, always dangerous himself, still manages to toss a few bombs in the capital and avoid arrest but at Jast word he was down to six active followers, It appeared once that a group of Haitian exiles in the Dominican Republic would launch a sort of overland _ Bay of Pigs invasion, abetted by Dominican President Juan Bosch, But the exiles had a falling out over leader- ship, proving an old Haitian proverb: “Whoever has a head thinks he can wear the crown.” Finally the plotters broke camp, accusing Bosch of taking away their firearms. Meanwhile, Duvalicr had exploited Bosch’s involvement to rally national pride. ‘The appeal worked. Haitians still remember that in October, 1937, about 10,000 of their countrymen were massacred in the Dominican Republic Part of the militia of Haitian President Francois Palace in Port-au-Prince May 15, the D. by Bosch’s predecessor, Trujillo. Bosch still believes he can topple Duvalier. ‘How. ‘That's a professional secret,” he says. For many Haitians in the opposition, United States intervention — perhaps with Organization of American States window dressing—was the only solid hope all along. The U.S. State Department went as far as ordering a withdrawal of diplomats’ families, sounding out Latin- American nations on the use of force, and finally suspend- ing diplomatic contacts with the Haitian government after May 15. All the while, a Navy carrier, carrying heli- copters full of U.S. Marines, steamed around the Bay of Gonaives, just over the horizon. Irom Washington reports, it appears that high U.S. officials based their planning on unfounded intelligence reports that Duvalicr would flee to Paris by mid-May. The State Department believed, as Undersecretary George Ball indicated publicly, that Duvyalier’s government ap- peared to be disintegrating. Washington officials now admit the rumors of Duvalier’s imminent departure were probably planted by Duvalier himself, apparently im hopes of staving off U.S. intervention. When Papa Doc failed to flee, the U.S. backtracked. By suspending diplomatic contacts and then quickly restoring them, the United States government achieved what it hoped most to avoid; it incurred the wrath of both Duvalier and his opponents. An inflnential Haitian cabinet minister told Newsday: “It’s just about like Birm- ingham. You don’t like the Haitian government ‘because we are Negroes.” The same day, a swom foc of Duvalier told an American: ‘Your secretary of state received Duval- jer’s foreign minister, and vour Mr. Rusk sold out.” Mhrough the entire two-month crisis, Duvalier was the one clear gainer. All he really did was sit tight in the palace, but his enemies made him look like Horatius at the bridge. “Ihave 4,000,000 little black brothers,” says Duvalier. “When they ask me who is our mother, I say ‘the Virgin.” But when they ask who is our father, then I must answer, you have noone but me.” One stray bullet could casily change that, but for now he’s right.

Party boss Gustavo Machado fingered his Scotch-and-water and admitted: “We don't . think in terms of a Communist government in these elections, but rather of joining a coalition with all who want to liberate Venezuela from the monopolists.” Where the Communists are really in danger is in the congressional elections. Last year the Communist Party and MIR were suspended from political activities, and now action is pending before the Venezuelan Sus preme Court ta make the anti-Red ban permanent. Vor years congressional immunity for a handful of Communist deputies has helped keep the party dangerous in Vene- zuela by enabling leaders to travel freely, stirring a lence at home and serving as couriers to Havana ane Moscow.

        "ocr_text": "est Jet Cuts Noise—Whooh Did It re Acoustic Hardware For Testing Noise Surrounds a Ground Test Jet Engine Note: First Washington story after returning from five years as management trainee and editor at Newsday in Long Island By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau Washington—The tape recorder clicks on, and a technician's voice ‘announces that you are about to hear the sound of a jet engine. For eight seconds the high screcchy whine of a turbofan engine assaults the eardrums. Then, for the next eight seconds, the shrill screech is gone. In its place is a throaty “whooh” that sounds perhaps half as loud. Both noises were generated by the same kind of commercial airplane engine, the one now used with slight variations on both Boein 707s and Douglass DC-8s. The only difference is that the “whooh’ came out of a Bocing engine whose metal outer shell had been lined with a sound-deadening material as part of a $19,000,000 National Acronautics and Space Administration research project. No plane equipped with the acoustically treated engines will fly until next year, but William S. Aiken, a NASA official who supervises the project, said that ground tests have gone better than NASA had expected. And the tapes he played constituted an impressive piece of evidence. Newsday After listening to the same tapes and analyz- Closeup ing other preliminary reports, Isaac Hoover, director of the Federal Aviation Administration’s noise abatement office, said that the chances were better than 50-50 that within the next few years the FAA would order the airlines to install acoustical materials in the engines of their existing jet fleets. Hoover estimated the cost to the airlines at $1 billion. The extra cost might be recaptured through a two per cent ticket tax over a five-year period, he Suggested, The idea of tearing apart the engincs of all their newest jets to install silencing material—tetrofitting as it is known to the experts— has not brought joy to the airline industry. American Airlines vice president Franklin W. Kolk, complained that NASA officials “never did anything in their lives for money, they’re government people.” Kolk said he figured that the cost of retrofitting the engines of one airplane would be about $1,500,000, about a third higher than Hoover's estimate, Kolk estimated that the additional weight of the acoustical material might reduce a plane’s efficiency to the point where it could fly only 92 per cent as far on a load of fucl. Aiken said that it would be impossible to calculate the exact loss of efficiency until the quicter engines were put on an experimental plane and flown next year, but he admitted that there would be some loss. He said the flight tests would also be necded to reveal any bugs in engine designs. According to Aiken, the Boeing team’s ground tests last December indicated a perceived noise reduction of between 10 and 15 decibels. The Douglas aircraft firm has achieved an eight-decibel reduction in perceived noise during ground tests, he said. The Boeing group's acoustical material is a sandwich of many layers of porous plastic cloth, while Douglas has chosen to work with compressed metallic fibers which resemble steel wool.

The transcript said that loi repeated the report of Reinig's face being “all bandaged up,” and that Lombardo added: “You knock a few of their. . . teeth out and they can’t sleep nights.” The transcript and two others taken ftom “bugged” conversations of loan sharks, were to _ be presented today to the Senate Small Busi ness Committee by Michael Metager, the as- sistant New York County district attomey in charge of organized crime with the rackets ureau, The committee, which is headed by Sen, George Smathers (D-Fla,) is studying oe Of ard Knocks infiltration of underworld loan sharks into Je- eitimate businesses in New York and Chicago, The three-day study and taking of testimony began yesterday, In a second conversation said to’be between Lombardo, Reinig, and Sebastian Alo, ap. parently conducted before Reinig's beating, the transcript shows Reinig being asked by Lombardo whether he can afford to pay $30 a week, “Ralphie,” Reinig purportedly answers, ‘T couldn't afford five cents right nov.

This is an F-105 of the type that Fairchild Hiller Corp. re- quested the Defense Department return to production after a three-year layoff. entagon Turns Dow Bid for More F-105s By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau Washington—The Pentagon has brushed aside a concerted sales pitch by Fairchild Liller Corp. for the reopening of dormant F-105 production lines. lor two-and-a-half months Fairchild Hiller’s pro- posal to build more Thunderchief fighter-bombers has been officially described as “under review” by the Air Force. A Defense Department press spokes- man said yesterday that the Air Force has “reviewed the Fairchild Hiller proposal and has no plans at the present time to resume the production of the F- 105.” Asked why the statement was hedged with the phrase “‘at the present time,” another Pentagon source said, “We can’t say we'll never change our minds, because you never know what might happen in the world. But from what we can see now, there really is no need for reproducing the F-105.” At Fairchild Tiller’s Republic Aviation Division in East Farmingdale, L.J., where the new I-105s would have been fabricated, a spokesman said that the company had not been notified of a rejection of its proposal, and therefore “we aré in no position to have any reaction at this point.” He said that even though the company issued a press release in March giving details of the F-105 proposal, it had not included any F-105 production business in its latest sales forecast. ked to comment on_ yesterday’s op stitement, Rep. Otis G. Pike (D-River- i ii i dlouse subcommittee on tac- SPs £/ b F ticar aircraft, said, “I am not surprised. It has becr very difficult to start up a production line which ha been closed down for three years. The expense 1s comparable to an accelerated production of a more advanced plane.” The Pentagon statement followed a series of briefings by Fairchild Hiller for Air Force officials here and-at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. No more briefings are planned. An Air Force colonel said, ‘‘We listened to what they proposed and then said, ‘Thank you very much.’ We have no plans to undertake a complete evaluation of the proposal, or to be in touch with the company Another Pentagon colonel said that a similar F-105 proposal was fairly evaluated last year and then rejected, because: (1) it would take several years to get the first new F-105 into production; (2) the final price would probably be much higher than the one quoted by Vairchild Hiller; and (3) two other planes now being produced, the I Phantom and the A-/ Corsair II, can perform as well as or better than the F-105, The Fairchild Willer proposal released in March contemplated the production of 300 planes for $2.500,000 each, an increase of $300,000 per plane r the model that has flown more than half of aa Air Force’s bombing missions over Vietnam.

Readies Plans Kennedy Burial This saddened city prepared to rt Prancis Kennedy tomorrow on a hillside banked with flowers near the grave of a slain Presi- dent who was his brother. It also prepared today to cope with the thou- sands expected here for the burial. : World Bank President Robert $. McNamara, the former defense secretary, flew back from a mission in Germany at the request of the Kennedy family to take personal charge of planning the burial at Arlington National Cemetery, it was learned. It is the second time that McNamara has taken personal charge of the burial of a slain Kennedy. In 1963, he stood coatless in a downpour at Arlington to mea- isure the plot for President John F. Kennedy’s grave and eternal flame. At the cemetery yesterday, a wreath and _ three bouquets for the late President were placed near the grave. Hundreds more for his murdered brother were expected. Arlington Cemetery Superintendent John C. Metzler said that no decision on the size or exact - location of Robert Kennedy’s grave would be made until later today. As a service veteran who has served in Congress, Robert Kennedy is entitled to an Arlington burial under a 1967 Department of Army olicy. The White House declined to sav yesterday whether President Johnson would be at St. Patrick’s Cathedral today while Kennedy’s body lies in state or whether he planned to attend the Requiem Mass there at 10 AM tomorrow or the burial in Arlington Cemetery. tomorrow afternoon. The White Hause generally has not released advance information on the President's travel plans for security reasons. Vice President Humphrey expects to attend the mass in New York and the burial at Arlington, a spokesman in his Washington office said. Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy (D-Minn.) plans to travel to New York tomorrow for the mass but has not decided whether to attend the burial ‘service, a spokesman said. A) spokesman for Richard Nixon said that the former vice: president probably would attend the burial at Arlington. Gov. Rockefeller did not announce his schedule for the two days. “Most nations plan to have their U.S. ambas- sadors represent them at the services, the State Department said. United Nations Secretary General ‘Thant plans to attend the mass and will send a representative to Washington for the Arlington burial, a UN = spokesman said, adding that U.S. Ambassador Arthur Goldberg, a friend of the Ken- nedy family, “will be at everything.” From the entertamment world, singer Andy Williams and his wife, actress Claudine Longet, a close friend of Mrs. Kennedy, were expected to attend both the mass and the burial. A spokesman for the Kennedy family said that a formal invitation list for the services bad not been drawn up but that most of the persons who accompanied Kennedy’s body on the flight from Los Angeles to New York yesterday probably would attend. Military and police officials said that final ar- rangements for the funeral procession would depend on the wishes of the Kennedy family. A spokesman at Kennedy campaign headquarters said it appeared likely that the procession, in the form of a long line of automobiles, would begin at ancient Union Sta- tion, pass between the Old and New Senate Office Buildings, go by the gleaming dome of the Capitol, wind. to Pennsylvania Avenue where Presidents parade, but then turn onto Constitution Avenue. The procession will then robably continue past the US. Art Gallery, the vs. Archives, the Smith- sonian Institution and the Department of Labor.

Carleton W. Voltz and Capt. Ben W. Stutts, two pilots whose H-23 heli- copter was shot out of the air by North Korean “Self Defense Forces” on May 17, 1963. Exactly one year later, at five minutes after noon, two North Korean jeeps rolled up to the truce village at Panmunjom and stopped. Out stepped Voltz and Stutts wearing gray cotton tunics. A few words were exchanged by uni- formed American and North Korean officers, then some papers were signed, and at last the two young lots were emareation Line that divides the two Koreas. Western newspapermen noted that both men looked fir and well-fed, and on orders from fficers Voltz and Stutts said nothing to mar the illusion. But later, in the secrecy of a debriefing session in Seoul, they told how they had been forced to divulge military secrets after being subjected to a variety of ingenious oriental tortures, like having a knotted fishline tight- ened around their foreheads until the pain was un- endurable. Has similar treatment been inflicted on the 82 sur- viving Pueblo crewmen? At least one Washington souree thinks it has, and that this explains why the skipper, Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher, and his crewmen consented to their statements and letters home “‘con- fessing’’ to espionage and pleading for leniency. It has now been 137 days since the Pueblo’s crew- men met their North Korean captors. It has been 136 days since Secretary of State Rusk denounced the seizure of the Pueblo as an “act of war.” It has been 135. days since President Johnson ordered 14,787 Air Force and Navy reservists to active duty, After those first angry days in January when _ mili- tary intervention in Korea was actively debated, the Johnson administration made a judgment that patient, unpublicized diplomacy was the best hope of freeing the 82 Pueblo crewmen alive. (One crewman was killed during the seizure of the ship.) “We are happy the (Pueblo) issue has receded somewhat from public discussion.” an administration official said this week. “We feel our negotiations at Panmunjom have a better chance of success.” Unhappily. the series of closed-door negotiations be- tween American and North Korean representatives in Panmunjom has produced no concrete results. In- formed sources said that North Korea is continuing to demand an admission that the Pueblo entered her territorial waters on a spying mission, plus an apolo- gy. plus promises that guilty officers will be punished and the violation will not he repeated. The U.S. has continued to reply that (1) we have no reason to believe the Pueblo entered North Korean waters, even during a 10-day period of radio silence before its capture last Jan. 23, therefore no apology, and (2) after the crew is released, we would allow an impartial tribunal to determine whether the Pucblo violated North Korean waters. and then ta take “appropriate action.” fe is a measure of this nation’s present concern lowed to walk south across the Military- Still in North Ko- reanhands are the Pueblo, shown be- fore her capture last January, an 82 men in crew. about the Pueblo that when the State Department announced the latest meeting between U.S. and North Korean delegates at Panmunjom last week, the an- nouncement was allotted two short paragraphs by the ~ Washington Post and not a line by The New York Times. More important, not a single congressman’s mimeograph stirred in protest. In California, where many of” of the créw mémberslivedsythe eras remained alive: one committee had sent out 12,000 ‘emember the Pueblo” bumper stickers; another was talking about raising a $1,000,000 ransom fund, and a San Diego paper was still running a daily reminder of the Pueblo case on its editorial page. But in the rest of America, it seemed that the Pueblo crisis had been pretty well blotted out by more recent news bulletins. To many of those with relatives on the Pueblo, the fading of the issue from public consciousness is a national scandal. “I am extremely alarmed at_the apathy of the American people,” said Mrs. Rose Bucher, the anguished wife of the Pueblo’s skipper. Mrs. Bucher, who lives in a Navy-built ranch house in -San Diego, Calif., with her two teenage sons, blames President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk even more than the public. “They said last January that the seizure of the ship couldn’t be tolerated,” she said last week in a telephone interview. “Well. they have tol- erated it for 129 days. How much longer are they going to tolerate it?’”? She has placed four telephone calls to President Johnson without reaching him and has peppered the State Department and the Pentagon with calls and letters pleading for faster action. “I just seem to get the runaround when I call back there for information,” she said. Mrs. Bucher’s deep fears about not getting her hus- band back in one piece have been tranquilized slightly in an odd. previously unpublicized way. On April 20 she flew to Chicago for a three-hour tape-recorded discussion with former helicopter pilot Voltz, who did survive North Korean prison life four years ago. (Stutts, his companion, also walked out alive, but died in 1966 in a military plane crash.) What Voltz told her about North Korean torture methods is not a pleasant bedtime story. hut she asked him not to spare her feelings and he didn’t. At least it helps her under- stand her husband’s abject “confession” one day after his ship was towed into Wonson Harhor. And at least aoe SESE ee Vo be blunt about it, they torture you.” it gives her hope that Bucher will some day come back without permanent injuries. Voltz, now a 31-year-old American Airlines copilot who often flies jets on the Chicago-to-New York run, agreed the other day to tell a reporter what he said at his secret debriefing in 1964 and later told Mrs. Bucher privately. “To. be blunt about it. they torture you,” he began. _ “The main way was to cut off the blood supply to your limbs. They used a fishline about 3/16 an inch in diameter, and they would tie it around your ankles as tight as they could while they forced you to kneel on a cement floor. Then they would force your hands up behind your back into a position that is higher than you can hold them yourself, then tie your wrists. They would tie the same cord around your neck, so that if you let your hands come down you would choke yourself. I used to get mad at myself because I couldn’t keep from choking myself. “Another of their favorite methods was to tie me in a chair with my face six inches away from an expo! light bulb and then leave me this way all night. What gets you is the bugs. Then sometimes they would take a small length of cord and tie knots in it every inch and a half, then make it into a loop. They would put it around my forehead and tighten it by twisting a stick in the loop.” His tormentors were always careful to avoid per- manently injuring him, Voltz said, and he was always offered decent food, which he seldom felt like eating. Their purpose seemed to he to extract any scrap of military information he possessed, from the size of certain battalions to the location of American missile sites to the range of B-58 bombers. “Anyhody who says you can just sit there and take it saying absolute- lv nothing has seen too many Hollywood movies,” said Voltz. “So T would lie..l would say one thing and then they would torture me and then I would change to another Jie. They would stop awhile to check this out, and then they would come back at me again.” T THE end of four months, said Voltz. his arms and legs were grotesquely swollen. his neck was a mass of sores and he could not stand up. Abruptly a North Korean doc- tor stepped in and stopped the torture. Voltz said his next four months were spent listening to endless indoctrination lectures, on slums and squalor in the U.S.. and on the glories of the North Korean Communist regime. Dusing his final four months of imprisonment he was allowed to reeuperate without being molested. At the Pentagon, the White House and the State June 8, 1968 \fDepartment, officials directly involved with the Pueblo Hegotiations maintain they don’t know if Bucher and is crewmen were similarly abused before they “con- fessed.” Said one expert on North Korea: “I doubt if there was phys ical torture because they want to get the maximum of propaganda value out of this when they are released.” Another official said that while force or even drugs may have been used on the officers, the crew members were probably not roughed up. “They probably had the officers read their statements to the erew, and after that it robably wasn’t very hard to get them to confess,” is said. An examination of Propaganda Photos sent hack by North Korea reveals no visible signs of maltreatment, he added, But there Was at least one official in Washington who believed otherw During the Koreah War he had been cap- tured and tortured with some of the same methods described by Voltz, N ANY case, the Johnson administration is much More intent on getting the crewmen back than finding out what is happening to them now, The iirst negotiating session in Panmunjom was held , _ iM public, a day after the Pueblo’s capture, and tt consisted of an exchange of colorful insults: North Korean: “Your side committed a crude act of illegally infiltrating an armed spy ship of the United tates imperialist ageressive Navy. ... ; merican: “Your last wild statement and distorted Version of your piracy off Wonson were obviously intended to divert attention from your regime's at- fempt to assassinate the president of the Republic of (South) Korea.” North Korean: “Don’t wag your tongue at random at this table after proof of a most overt and vicious provocation... .” However, almost immediately the two sides agreed to meet also in smalle vet sessions that have been relatively free from insult and vitupers secret meeting, which took place last y like all the others. Washington Tt took place at the Panmunjom conference site—a circle about 1,000 yards in diameter located on a sandy plain, surrounded by low hills and rice paddies.

A U.S, official speaking on a “background” basis and not for quotation, told Teport- ers that the meeting produced neither a breakthrough nor a breakdown, only an agreement to meet again. The private talks have demonstrated that the North Koreans can say no in a businesslike way just as firmly as they say it in a nasty, insulting tone of voice at public truce meetings, But USS. official say they have little alternative to keeping the talks going much as they have gone so far.

So far the U.S. countermeasures have not been notably effective, chiefly because Viet Cong firing crews can sneak the rockets into position quickly, fire them from a range of 6% miles, and then vanish before American helicopters and artillery can respond.

Guard Called to Halt Disorders After Resurrection City Is Shut Story on Page 3 LBJ Asks Registry of All Guns And the Licensing of Every Owner ! Guardsmen Called to Halt Unrest After Camp Is Shut By Myron $. Waldman and Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau Washington—The nation’s capital was under a state of emergency early today after authorities smothered several minor ghetto disorders with clouds of tear gas, 1,450 National Guardsmen and a sudden curfew last night, The disturbances in the streets of Washington came after police had moved earlier yesterday to shut down Resurrec- tion City and arrest more than 340 lead: ers and members of the Poor People's Campaign. The stern anti-tiot measures, taken even more quickly than they had been during the disturbances in April following the murder of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jt., appeared to have ended what Mavor Walter E. Washington described as “an escalation of disorderly behavior” in sev- eral areas of the city, Police arrested 12 persons in the disorders and reported one man wounded by a detective’s bullet as he fled a looted liquor store. The major, who had called in the Guardsmen, appealed for “business as usual” today. He said that the curfew would be lifted “as soon as conditions are restored to normal.” Today’s outlook was complicated, how- ever, by uncertainty over when the Rev, Ralph D. Abernathy, leader of the South- em Christian Leadership Conference, would be released from jail, and by the expected arrival of fresh recruits to the Poor People’s campaign from out of town, They were expected to include 300 per- sons from Philadelphia andat least 30 from New York, described as hippies who had vowed to get themselves arrested. The governemnt was expected to move today, meanwhile, to dismantle many, if not all, of the A-frame shanties in which the poor people of Resurrectin City had lived until their eviction by 1,000 police- men yesterday morning, 13 hours after their camping permit had expired. Although police arrested 119 members of the Poor People’s Campaign inside Resurrection City yesterday morning and another 224 as they marched on the Cap- itol, the only serious injury of the day came at 11 PM last night when a police detective shot and injured the suspected looter running away from a liquor store in a ghetto atea, Police Chief John B, Lay- —Continued on Page 58 June 25, 1968 \f Newsday Photo by Alan Raia OCCUPIED CITY.

At least six civilians, choking and vomiting from heavy doses of tear gas, were treated at the leadership conference’s headquarters last night. The most threatening  situat oc- curred yesterday in late afternoon in front of the conference headquarters at 14th and U Streets N.W., the corner where the first incidents of the April rioting had begun. About 2,000 Negroes—perhaps one fourth of them from Resurrection City and the rest local residents—milled about despite urgings of conference offi- cials to disperse. Several hours later, after several window- breakings and looting incidents and one confirmed arson, police and National Guardsmen repeatedly blanketed U Street for a block in both ections with a fog of tear gas, driving the crowd inside build- ings, choking and crying. At 8:36 PM, the citywide curfew was announced, effective from 9 PM to 5:30 AM. By early today, the streets were al- mast emnty. The move to shut down Resurrection City, which touched off the day’s events, had not come as a surprise. Conference and federal sources said that the Rev. Mr. Abernathy had learned late Sunday night of the government plan. The decision had been agreed upon just a few minutes earlier, they said, in a conference of Wash- ington Interior and Justice Department officials, with the Justice men speaking with White House authority. It was then, they said, that the Rev. Mr. Abernathy had decided to take as many of his people as he could to the Capitol grounds for one last display. As a result, the Rev. Mr. Abernathy led more than 200 of his people to the Agri- culture Department at about 10 AM yes- terday, then moved on to Capitol Hill, where in the humid, hot morning they walked into the company of sweating Capitol policemen. Behind the marchers lay Resurrection City, sealed off by 1,000 policemen and manned by 119 poor people. Police on loud speakers said shortly after 10 AM that all those who did not leave would be arrested, and offered the services of Travelers Aid to get the fundless home. Layton said about 30 to 50 took advantage of the offer. Then at 11:15 AM, about 200 officers, wearing riot helmets and olive drab vests, and equipped with tear gas cannisters moyed into the camp and began searching each plywood hut for people and weapons. But all they found, Layton confirmed, were a few personal possessions. Midway through the city, at the Cul- tural ‘Tents, police found the 119 resi- dents, mostly Negroes and mostly people in their late teens and early 20s. ‘‘Free- dom, freedom now!” the residents were singing, and one by one in a smooth passive manner, the police frisked them, photographed them and took them into custody. Those arrested were charged with campi without a permit, a misde- meanor, violation of park regulations, and disorderly conduct. Meanwhile, outside the halls of Con- tress the Rev. Mr. Abemathy pleaded with police to be allowed to march on the Capitol grounds in order that he and his people could be arrested on its steps. Capital police chief J. M. Powell said that if the demonstrators broke into groups of 10, they would be admitted to the area and would not even be arrested. But the Rey. Mr. Abernathy insisted that everyone wanted to be arrested, and in the end, they were, as soon as they stepped on the sidewalk leading to those steps. The first incident of scattered looting in the streets of the capital took place in the late afternoon when someone smashed the glass door of a storefront china ware- house near 14th and T Streets. A reporter saw about. 15 persons—men, women and children—hurrying around the corner with cartons of dishes in their arms. Rocks and Bottles Only a few policemen were in sight, the nearest about half a block away ne had said a few minutes earlier, Je don’t want to antagonize anyone.” But as new reports of scattered looting increased, police with shotguns and gas masks ap- peared at 14th and U Streets. Some were peppered with rocks and bottles, police reported. Residents did not leave the streets for good until National Guardsmen arrived with a powerful gasoline-operated tear gas generator around 9 PM_ and sprayed a stronger tear gas through a heavy hose. The Rev. Andrew Young, the confer- ence’s second in command, said last night that in addition to the demonstrators - from Philadelphia expected today, groups would be coming here from other cities for at least the next three weeks. The demonstrations, the Rey. Mr. Young said, are to be part of a new phase of the Poor People’s Campaign, which will include mass boycotts’ in 40 cities, possibly ““bs the first Sunday in July.” Openly, the Rev. Mr. Young expressed his relief at being forced out of the mud- stricken, crime-ridden shantytown. The police, he said, “did us a favor by kicking us out because the focus (of the am paign) had been on Resurrection City 47 not on poverty.” Newsday: ; June 25, 1968 (continued) \f"

Llers With Servant Woes Get Congressmen’ Help By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau Washington—From Brookville to Blue Point, matrons and middle-class housewives are calling on their friendly local congressman to help them solve their servant problems, and like five Mr. Cleans, Long Island’s congressmen are coming to the rescue, In at least 50 instances this year, the congress- men have asked U.S. consulates in Trinidad, Jamaica and elsewhere to expedite visa applications for sleep-in maids for constituents. The result in many of those cases has been that the maids have atrived-about.a month quicker than other maids imported by housewives who never called their congressmen. “Tt is a favor we do for all congressmen,” a State Department official said yesterday. “Some busy consulates in the Caribbean have a several-months’ backlog in appointments to get visas. W hen we get a cancellation in one of these appointments, we will try to slip in a case from a congressman.” Since immigration officials began a crackdown last week on maids working illegally in the New York area while on visitors’ visas, congressmen have been getting anxious, sometimes-angry letters from employers. A Hewlett man sought help after his Korean butler had been arrested. From a parent of five small children in Woodbury came a letter ask- ing help in keeping an Iranian maid because, “as you know, reliable help is next to impossible to find,” Before the crackdown, all five Long Island con- gressmen regularly had written letters to govern- ment agencies to help constitutents cut red tape in importing maids legally. The office of Rep. Lester Wolff (D-Great Neck) said that 14 such requests _ were received each week. A spokesman for Rep. Herbert Tenzer (D-Lawrence) said that his office gets two or three a week. Reps. Otis G. Pike (D- Riverhead), John W. Wydler (R-Garden City) and James R. Grover (R-Babylon) said that they each receive about one such request a month. All of the congressmen said that they took action on the requests. In at least one instance, a Long Island con- gressman went further than writing letters. Wolft introduced_a_ bill in Congress last August to_pre- vent the deportation of Agustinho dos Santos Freitas and his wife, Carmelina, Portuguese-born aliens from Brazil who worked as gardener and maid for a Kings Point executive, The bill was rejected by the House Judiciary Committee on grounds that the couple entered the country il- legally. Wolff reoffered the bill two months ago, on grounds that the maid had since given birth to a son, who is now an American citizen and that the couple were unaware of any illegality when they came to the U.S. The baby has medical problems which require the attention of an American doctor, according to a Wolff aide. Until the committee reconsiders the case, the Immigration Service can- not deport the Freitas couple. Freitas, 32, is working for $75 a week as a gardener for Mr. and Mrs. Mark Schindler of 36 Sunset Rd., Kings Point. Mrs. Freitas, 27, works for the Schindlers part-time while she cares for her 6-month-old son, Paul, July 3,1968 \f"

Celler, the influential chief House backer of both gun control bills, was told that both might fail unless he agreed to oppose the licensing and registration measure for this session. Celler reluctantly agreed. Rules Committee Chairman William M. Colmer (D-Miss.) then predicted last night that the less sweeping “‘long-gun’’ bill would clear his committee today and would probably pass the full House later, accompanied by some “\\weakening” amendments. Several more liberal. con- gressmen agreed with Colmer’s  assess- ment. ; The long-gun bill, Sponsored by Presi- dent Johnson after the murder of Sen. Robert F’. Kennedy, would Prohibit sales of rifles, shotguns and ammunition by mail-order and forbid all sales to persons under 18, out-of-state” residents, narcotics addicts, ex-convicts and the mentally ill. _ The price Colmer and other tules com- mittee members extracted from Celler was his. pledge to oppose any later efforts to tack registration and licensing amend- ments onto the long-gun bill on the House floor or in a House-Senate con- ference. During Celler’s appearance be- fore the rules committee to urge passage ef the long gun bill, most committee members used the opportunity to press him for a commitment that no further gun legislation would pass. this. session. Celler tried to avoid making such a com- mitment during two hours of questioning, described by an aide later as even tougher than Celler’s grilling by the rules com- mittee on the recently passed civil rights ill. _ But during a recess Celler conferred Privately with member of the rules and Judiciary committees and was told that both gun pills might fail unless he changed his stance. Finally, with evident reluctance, Celler said. “While I'm in faver of registration and licensing. I’m anxious to get a rule on this bill.” by which he meant he wanted the proposal in mail-oder sales sent to’ the House floor. He went on, “In order to get a rule, I’m willing to oppose any amendment offered on the floor of the House dealing with registration and licensing. In conference, I will oppose any attempt to add registra- tion as an amendment to this bill.” However, Celer did not abandon plans. to hold Judiciary Committee hearings on registration and licensing, but he con- ceded it is doubtful that there is time to finish action before Congress adjoins. Colmer said later. “Mr. Celler is a reputable member of this Tlouse, a man of his word. If he stands by it, there will ‘ , be no further legislation.” Several_mem-, bers of the rules committee indicated that they could vote for a ban on sales but would oppose registration. A source close to Sen. Joseph D. Ty- dings (D-Md.), one of the chief Senate Proponents of registration and licensing, said last night, “If Celler stands against us in a (House-Senate) conference, then we have real problems, because even the Senate conferes won’t be all that firm on licensing and registration.” Meanwhile Sen. Thomas J. Dodd (D- Conn.,), a long-time gun control advo- cate. announced that gun importers have applied for liéenses to import 300,000 foreign guns since the enactment of the Omnibus Crime Bill wh set up a six- .8tace period before imposition of ™Mport controls July 9,1968 \f"

        "ocr_text": "wy By JosephAlbrigh' Newsday Washing on Bureau Washington—The /House of Repre- sentativés passed a landmark housing bill last night that could cost $50 billion over for dozens of low- and ousing programs, The bill includes programs designed to assist both urban ghettos and suburban “pocket slums.” It also provides assistance for suburban and rural growth. The bill, approved on a 295 to 114 roll call vote, now goes to a House-Senate conference committee to compromise at ° Thursday, July 11, 1968 —Continued from Page 3 and Urban Development explained that these two programs were designed chiefly to assist urban ghettoes, but they will also apply to suburban pocket slums like some on Long Island, Officials said that another program was designed largely to deal with suburban and rural growth. It authorizes $150,000,000 to expand House OKs $50-Billion least 90 minor variations from the Senate- passed version, The measure has been one of President Jolinson’s legislative musts. (President Johnson suggested yesterday that Congress return for a special post- convention session if his key legislation is still pending at convention time. Story on Page 7.) The budget Bureau is preparing a re- quest to Congress for a supplemental ap- propriations bill that would provide initial funds for the programs begun or con- tinued in the 280-page housing bill. Lead- ing the * administration forces, Rep. House’ Passes LBJ s $50-Billion Housing an existing open-space land acquisition program; adds $300,000,000 to the amount authorized for water and sewer facilities grants; and authorizes $160,000,000 for comprehensive planning grants to regional governmental units. A separate title of the bill authorizes $190,000,000 more for urban mass transportation. Wright Patman (D-Tex.) called the bill “one of the biggest bills Congress ever passed.” But Rep, Wayne Hays (D-Ohio) said at one point, “If this bill were trans- lated into Russian and handed to the Supreme Soviet, it would be rejected as too socialistic.” The bill authorizes $5.3 billion for housing over the next three years, but the eventual price tag could run as high as $50 billion because the bill authorizes 40- year commitments to subsidize mortgages. The housing ‘bill earmarks $300,000,000 for the mortgage subsidy Rn aes ir CNN The housing bill also includes an at- tempt to speed federal urban renewal procedures, Under the new plan, urban renewal authorities would be freer in many cases to make revisions in their plans as the project proceeds rather than being bound by a cumbersome initial plan, The bill authorized $1.4 billion for urban renewal next fiscal year plus Housing Bill program, under which homeowners with yeatly incomes from about $3,000 to $7,000 will be eligible to receive partial subsidies for mortgage, insurance, and property taxes. The goal is 480,000 new units started under this program within three years, Another $300,000,000 is authorized for a new program for the rehabilitation and construction of 700,000 rental units on properties for low- and middle-income families over the next three years.

The most significant weakening amendment passed during three days of House debate was one by Rep. John B. Anderson (R-Il].) which restricted the home ownership subsidies to families with incomes not more than 30 per cent above the income eligibility limit for public _ housing. In New York, this would set the top limit at about $7,500 a year instead of about $10,000 as originally proposed. Rep. - Jonathan Bingham (D-Bronx) led a move to reverse the Anderson amendment yes- terday, but he was defeated in a roll call vote, 271 to 137, July 11, 1968 \f"

If the debate drags on after both the Republican and Democratic conventions,: lortas’ supporters also conceded the outside chance that Congress may be so anxious to adjourn to the campaign trail that it may never take a final vote on confirmation.

Sam J. Ervin ( 4 placed the call at someone else’s suggestion, Fortas replied, “I will not go into any conversation, either to affirm them or deny them, that I’ve had with the President . . . ask you to indulge me.” The businessman who reportedly got Vortas’ call, Ralph Lazarus of Federated Department Stores Inc. in Cincinnati, refused last night to comment on the incident. Lazarus had told a press conference on May 12 1967, that he had learned from government officials that “the administration planned to spend an extra $5 billion for Vietnam escalation.” The next day Lazarus issued a public statement to clarify that the money was not needed for any sharp escalation.” : . Without mentioning names, Fortas testified that he had told an old friend, “as a citizen, that I was very distressed in what I considered to be a state- ment attributed to him which was wrong.” Fortas testified he told the man that his statement was harmful to the country. Fortas was not asked to explain how he knew his friend’s information or Vietnam spending was wrong. Judiciary Committee Chairman James O.

Ervin said yesterday that once floor debate be- gins, he plans to speak at length but refused to call the move-a filibuster. At least a dozen Republicans and southern Democrats are expected to join the talkathon. Dirksen said yesterday that while he is confident Portas would be confirmed if and when a vote finally comes, he was not sure that enough votes could be mustered to cut off debate. “It will be right close,”’ he said. Other sources agreed that if the debate is de- layed until after the Democratic convention; which begins Aug. 26, Congress may never reach a final vote on Fortas. Until Portas’ nomination is resolved, the Senate cannot take final action on Johnson's choice of Homer A. Thornberry as associate justice. July 18, 1968 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Lobbies, Public Opinion By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau 3 Washington—Rep. Clark MacGregor (R- Minn.), who sponsored a major loophole amend- ment in the administration’s gun control bill this week, is a moderate Republican,highly respected by his colleagues, from a high-income suburban district outside Minneapolis. And he hasn’t fired a gun in 10 years. In searching for an explanation of why he fought for two days to amend away the bill’s controls on shotgun shells and rifle bullets, it helps to know that a major employer in his district is the Federal Cartridge Crop., which Newsday Closeup manufactures both shotgun shells and. rifle bullets. And in trying to learn why Rep. Robert L. F. Sikes (R-Fla.) introduced an amendment which would exempt the National Rifle Association from some if not all provisions of the gun bill, it helps to know that until last vear Sikes was a national direc- tor of the association. And in seeking the reasons why Rep. John Db. Dingell (D-Mich.) sponsored a special exemption for gun collectors which the bill’s floor manager, Rep. Emanuel Celler (D-N-Y.), denounced as a “loophole as wide as the Grand Canyon,” it helps to know that Dingell is right now on the rifle association's national board of directors. It is one thing to understand why a few con- gressmen had special interest in gutting the adminis- tration’s bill to end mail-order sales of rifles, shot- guns and ammunition. But figuring out why the full House of Representatives voted to accept the amendments is another question. j Undoubtedly the main reason was that. many rural voters consider it an intrusion in their lives by, the federal government. Last week their congress- men were faithfully representing their wishes. As Rep. Edward G. Biester Jr. (R-Pa.), explained, the need for gun controls “is basically. an urban problem.” Still, the votes on the amendments were close enough so that if al] congressmen from urban states had voted with the administration, the amendments would have been killed. An analvsis of the vote shows that the amend- ments won strong throughout the South, West and Midwest, even in some urban constituencies. In the East, congressmen in rural areas of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New England often supported the MacGregor amendment. _— However, part of the responsibility for the loop- holes has to rest-with the bill’s backers and _ strate- gists. For one thing, the plan to keep pro-gun control congressmen on the floor proved ineffective during a series of crucial non-record votes. “‘I looked around the floor, and we just didn’t have our people there,” Corman said. Some congressmen believe, also, that the White House could have swung more weight than it did. ; : Some observers said that the amendments. might N beaten if gun control advocates had made an issue out of the motives of Sikes Dingell and MacGregor. But MacGregor was not hesitant in talking with a reporter about Federal Cartridge, which employs about 2,000 persons and is the third- largest ammunition manufacturer in the country. “If he (a colleague who raised that point) was suggesting that I was fighting for some jobs of people in my district, then I agree,’”? MacGregor said. William B. Horn, a Federal Cartridge vice presi- dent, said by telephone that his company had con- tacted MacGregor and some other congressmen after surveys showed that up to half of the company’s 38,000 dealers around the country would have gone out of the ammunition business rather than comply with the original administration bill’s record-keeping provisions.

And som@ of a ]éhour day of campaigting immaculately neat as when he started. He is the sort of governor who built up a rather impressive record on civil rights, but then gave up much of his liberal and Negro support by a sequence of hard- nosed responses to racial disorders. Just a week ago, he _ said: “If a man comes out of a looted store with loot in his hands and refuses to stop when ordered to do so by a police officer, the officer should not hesitate to shoot him. Probably the most startling thing about “Ted” Agnew has been his rate of political ascent. Now 49, he has built almost his entire political career since Richard M. Nixon’s first run at the presidency. After being defeated when he ran for Baltimore County judge in 1960 and dropped from the county zoning board in February, 1961, Agnew, Gov. Spiro Theodore ore Zoning, Board to the ike toothpaste ow, at the end - is clothes are as ~ a lawyer, decided to run as a reformer for Baltimore county executive the following fall. He won, despite the county's 66-vear habit of electing only Democrats, and soon distinguished himself as a local administrator, among other reasons for running sewer lines to-old neighbor- hoods endangered by septic tank pollution, Although, unknown outside Baltimore, he ran for governor and won im 1966 over Democrat George P. Mahoney, who ap- pealed for white backlash votes with his slogan, “Your Home Is Your Castle—Protect It.” vpebly the most controversial facet of Agnew’s tien a en his evolution on the race issue.

As county executive, he persuaded the owners to admit Negroes in rh E W, | Friday, August 9, 1966 Order Is a exchange for a promise that the demonstrations would cease. That experience Jed him to propose and push through the reluctant, Democratic-controlled county council a public accommodations law that was one of the nation’s first on the county level. He carried 94 per cent .of the state's Negro vote when he ran for governor, and once in the state house he pushed through an open housing law that ruled out discrimination in future apart- _ ments and subdivisions. _- Agnew’s approach toughened when Cambridge, Md., was struck by burning and looting last summer after a rally led by H. Rap Brown. Agnew immediately ordered police to arrest anyone making a speech which officers felt could touch off future demonstrations anywhere in Mary- land. When Baltimore was hit by rioting after the murder this spring of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Agnew -summoned 100 Negro moderates to his office and casti- gated them for failing to criticize black militants, More than half the leaders walked out, Greek Fellowship Special to Newsday Miami Beach—Republican _vice-presidential nominee Spiro T. Agnew, a Greek-American, has an ardent booster in Montana GOP convention delegate Basil Andnikopoulos. _Andrikopoulus, who is the. father of three _ children and a resident of Butte, is employed in the personnel and training department of Mon- tana Power Co, He said Agnew would do very well in Montana, “Everybody likes Greeks out here,” he said, “What a wonderful democracy,” Andrikopou- lus said, after Agnew’s nomination last night. _ “This is the greatest Greek victory since Thermo- pylae.” Prime Goal In April, 227 students from predominantly Negro Bowie State College sat down in Agnew’s outer office to dramatize demands for more money for the school. When they refused to leave at closing time, the, governor ordered them all arrested. He also shut down the Bowie campus for a week when militant students occupied the adminis- tration building, When order was restored, he arranged for the state to give an extra $300,000 to the college. He summed up his feelings on rioting in a New York speech: “Tt is not the centuries of racism and deprivation that have built to an explosive crescendo, but the fact that lawbreaking has become a socially acceptable and occa- sionally stylish form of dissent.” Meanwhile, he has advo- cated Negro ownership of business as a solution to eco- nomic deprivation. His record outside the field of race relations has been hard to classify. He has advocated a state Jaw on registra- tion of hand guns, but he appointed an official of the National Rifle Association as his representative on a legis- lative committee considering gun legislation. When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Maryland’s lovalty oath, he said that he was pleased because the oath was a product of a “very inquisitional time.” On Vietnam, he has generally supported President Johnson's policy, saying that he did not feel justified in criticizing Johnson because he was not privy to all the President's information.

Even in collective bargaining, you will sometimes find, m order to get a new contract, that you have to change negotiators,” Humphrey said ending the Vietnam war would take top pronty if he is elected President. “I consider that the number one priority because that will relieve so\\ much of our tension and resources and facilities for other things that need fo be done,” he said. And he said: “I’m ‘willing to walk the extra mile to get that peace and suffer whatever pains that may come in that effort.” Although the vice president said he was speaking for the administration when he said that “restraint and reasonable response” on the part of Hanoi would be sufficient for the US. to cease bombing the North, he hinted that he did not think that the current lull in the ground war signified such a response. “There is a debate in the government right now as to what the evidence reveals,” he said. “W'e'll just have to wait and sce.” The vice president also criticized Richard M. Nixon, “saying that his appeal to the South is far different than the appeal the GOP presidential candidate is making, “T believe that in his (Nixon's) dealing with the South that he dealt with the old South,” Humphrey said... But the South of today is a much more progressive South . . . And the difference between Mr. Nixon and. myself is that he’s appealing to the old South of Strom Thurmond and I'm appealing to the new South of a Terry Sanford and a Carl Sanders” (Both Sanford, former governor of North Carolina, and Sanders, former governor of Georgia, have been meationed as possible vice presidnetial candidates.) Humphrey steadiastly refused to comment on his own choice of a running mate. He dodged a query as to whether either McGovern or McCarthy would be the kind of men he would consider, saving only: “I think they’re men of considerable caliber and both of them think they can serve as President and quite a few people think they can, too.” Furthermore, the vice president said he believed Agnew was selected by Nixon as the vice presidential candidate “so that the Nixon campaign could direct its appeal more to the conservative attitude that Mr. Nixon thinks now exists in the American community.” Humphrey, attired in a dark blue sports jacket, blue trousers and a blue-and-white-striped shirt, scemed not at all distressed when he was asked whether he felt, as some of his supporters have said privately, that he is failing to make an impact on the public. ae “We're not looking for an actor or. a_ scintillating personality,” Humphrey said. “We're looking for someone that can govern. Someone that knows how to manage things. Someone that has both the firmness and the sense of humanity that this country needs.” August 15,1968 \f"

But does it mean—crime control or suppression of minorities? By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau Washington—The nice thing about the “law and order” issue, now being taken up by all sides in the presidential campaign, is that the federal government’s official figures on crime in the U.S. give all sides something to shout about. Republican Richard M. Nixon can’ say with no fear of contradiction that crime has been going up nine times as fast as population. Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey can cite with finality the fact that George Wallace’s home state of Alabama has the highest murder rate in the nation. And Democrat Edmund S. Muskie can assert confidently that states with Demo- cratic governors have much lower crime rates than ones with Republicans in their state houses. __Nor are the candidates the only ones who dig different meanings out of the Federal Bureau of In- vestigation’s “Uniform Crime Reports,” which the FBI compiles from information fed in by local police. Only last _weck, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover told the ‘President’s violence commission that “these statistics represent an epidemic of crime and violence . . . The mugger, the rapist, the hoodlums stalk our streets in frightening numbers.” On the same day, Attorney General Clark, Hoover’s nominal boss, took a cooler view. “To the extent that the statistics are accurate,” Clark said, “the individual’s chance of being a victim of a crime of violence in the U‘S. is once in every 400 years; the odds are one in 146,800 per day.” With all this diversity in high places, what can be said for sure about the patterns and trends of crime in America? 3 _ Sherlock Holmes once observed, “It is a capital mistake to penalize before one has data.” Many crimi- nologists and sociologists say that. the FBI’s crime data are-inadequate and sometimes misleading. As the Presi- dent’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Admin- istration of Justice put it 18 months ago, “The U.S. is today, in the era of the high speed computer, trying to keep track of crime and criminals with a system that was less than adequate in the days of the horse and buggy.” Putting aside statistical imperfections, there can be no doubt that the number of crimes reported to the police is going up, up, up. Between 1960 and 1967, the number of “serious crimes” in the I'BI’s crime index increased 89 per cent while the nation’s population was up only 10 per cent. The biggest rise in crimes has come since 1964. As a result, serious crimes are now being reported to police at the rate of about 4,000,000 a year, or seven cach minute. Only about 12 per cent of those “serious crimes” are classified as crimes of violence—murder, forcible rape, aggravated assault and robbery. The remaining vast majority of all ‘‘serious’” crimes are offenses against py — eel larceny ($50 and over) and auto theft, All categories of serious crimes rose substantially from 1960 to 1967 with the less serious offenses showing the biggest percentage increases. Preliminary figures for the first half of 1968 show the crime curves still going up.

FBI figures show that while crimes ncreased everywhere, the great bulk of the in. crease has been in the cities, and the bigger the citi ‘ the bigger the increase. In cities of over 250,000 nor > pet cent since 1940 and the rate of aggravated assault has increased almost 300 per cent. About half of the violent crimes in the country are reported in these big cities, even though only a fifth of the population lives in. these cities. One's economic status within the city also helps determine one’s chances of avoiding involvement with violent crime, both the perpetrator and victim, Clark told the violence commission of a recent survey in Chi- cago indicating that the risk of physical assault for the Negro ghetto dweller was one in 77 per year. For the white middle-class resident of Chicago, the odds were one in 2,000, For the upper middle class and rich resi- dents of the Chicago suburbs, the risk is one in 10,000. Negroes, who make up 12 per cent of the total American population, were involved last year in 59 per cent of all arrests for murder, nearly half of all arrests for aggravated assault, and 47 per cent of all arrests for rape. These figures have a corollary that isn't alwavs mentioned: that about half the victims of marder, aggravated assault and rape were Negroes. But iw ctimes against property, which account for 83 per cent of all serious crimes in the country, Negroes were involved in less than one-third of last year’s arrests. FBI's constantly rising crime rates that individual Americans are more “criminal” today than their coun- terparts 25 vears ago. That may or may not be true, but figures do not give the answer. Eighteen months ago, the President’s law enforcement commission bare down hard on the question of “criminality” and de- cided that it wasn’t possible to tell whether the average 78-year-old was more criminally-minded today than in ie good ald davs. SS Part of the sharp increase in crimes during the 960s, the commission decided, was the fault of the bst-World War VW baby boom because now the amper crop of 1940s children was coming into the rime-prone period of their lives. The FBI's arrest btals, which are considered more a measure of police cHvity than of actual wrong-doing, say that arrests ‘ot persons under 18 increased 69 per cent from 1960 ‘0 1967, while the number of persons in the 10-17 age group rose only 22 per cent. Other factors cited by the law enforcement com- ission to explain the recent crime rise included hese: the rapid migration of Americans from rural areas into the cities; the improvement of crime record systems in many areas: and growing affluence, which makes more items available to be stolen. mission to explain the recent crime rise included these: the rapid migration of Americans from rural areas into the cities; the improvement of crime record systems in many areas: and growing affluence, which makes more items available to be stolen, For manv Americans, the issue of “law and order” has more to do with preventing and suppressing urban riots than with the FBI's standard categories of serions crimes. The government has not published official figures on riots, but according to one authoritative account, the Justice Department counted 120 racial disturbances in June. July and August of this year as against 137 in the same months last summer. Of the 720 this summer, seven were classified as “major” and 20 as “serious” as against 11 “major” disturbances last vear and 35 which were marked “serious.” The figures do not include the disturbances in more than 100 cities after the slaying in April of the Rev.

But the White Ilousc refused to withdraw the nomination, con- tending that it still might have a chance. When the “ayes” and ‘nays’ were tallied at 1:14 PM yesterday, the count was +5-43 in favor of stopping the fili- buster against a motion to consider the nomination. The tally was 14 votes short of the necessary two-thirds margin. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield tempo- rartly put the nomination aside so that the Senate could handle other work. Faced with probably one of the heaviest legislative defeats that Johnson had ever suffered as senator or President, the NWVhite House said there were no plans to withdraw the Fortas nomination. TFortas’ office would not comment. White IHWouse Press Secretary George Christian said Johnson still felt that Yortas would be confirmed. Pressed on what Johnson’s next step would be, Christian said, ‘““We would hope that the nomination could be brought up (again) for a direct vote on the nomination.’’ It Seems Impossible That appeared last night to be an im- possible dream. There was every sign that the anti-Fortas forces would hold all their strength if a second vote comes on whether to cut off the filibuster. If Fortas is not confirmed by the Senate, it would be the first time since the George WVash- ingtou Administration that the Senate had rebuffed a President’s chief justice nomi- nation, and the first time ever that a filibuster on the floor has been mounted to killa major appointment. Asked if he would call for a second vote on an Rae debate through a cloture petition, ansfield said, “I want two or three days to think- it over.’? Fle said he did not plan to contact Johnson. On the roll call, 35 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted for cloture. Nineteen Democrats and 24 Republicans voted no. _the Tortas KFortas Later, Senate Minority Leader Tverett Mi. Dirksen told a press conference that struggle will have a lasting effect on future appointments to the Su- premec Court. “‘Iicreafter the investigation of the nominee will be a good deal more thorough,” he said. Asked if he thought that Fortas could continue to serve on the court as an associate justice with good grace, Dirksen said, ‘‘Ile can if he wants to.’”” In the floor debate before the vote, Dirksen had explained that despite his long-announced support of Johnson’s nomi- nation of Fortas he would join the efforts of Republicans and Sorthern Democrats secking to block moves to shut off debate. _ Tfis reason for switching, he told the Senate, was a Supreme Court decision last June known as the Witherspoon Case, in which the high court ruled by a 6-3 margin that the defendant in an IHinois murder case could not be sentenced to death by the jury since potential jurors had been excluded on the basis of scruples against Capital punishmen. Dirksen, who is up for reelection this year in Illinois, raised the possibility in his speech that Chicago drifter Richard Speck’s conviction and death sentence for killing eight stu- dent nurses might be affected by the NVitherspoon. decision. “‘If this should be the outcome, the people of INinois will be ready to rebel,”’ Dirksen told the Sen- ate. : During the balloting Sen. Carl Hayden (ID-Ariz.), the 9OQ-year-old dean of the Senate. caused heads to turn on both sides of the aisle when he softly voted “Ave” to cut off debate. Hayden had consistently opposed all cloture petitions since he entered the Senate 42 years ago on the ground that unlimited debate was a necessary protection for small states. Ilayden, who is deaf and bent over from arthritis, said later in an interview, “‘I dicm’t want to turn a friend down.” Tle said he has known FYortas for more than 20 vears “‘and he would make a fine chief justice.”” Hiayden, who is retiring from the Senate this year, said he had nover pre- viously supported cloture ““because I just never thought it was important enough to do it.”’ October 2,1968 \f"

        "ocr_text": "By Joseph Albright Chief Washington Correspondent Washington—Suddenly Richard M. Nixon, the old Cold Warrior, was predicting last night that the Soviet Union would use its influence to promote peace in Berlin, Vietnam and the Middle Bast Russian leaders will try to “cool off the West Berlin situation,” Nixon forecast at a press confer: ence, because they don’t want to jeopardize a future summit meeting to discuss more important questions with the U.S, which he said was “in the wings,” Similarly, he said it was his “cautious” conclusion that Moscow “will play possibly a peacemaking role in the Mideast and even possibly in Vietnam,” The Russian motive for promoting peace, Nixon sai, would be to avoid escalation of hostilities in a pe- ripheral area of the world that could lead to a con- frontation with the US, “We are going to expore that road all the way We can,” Nixon said, “because, let's face tt without the Soviet Union’s cooperation the Mideast is going to continue to be a terribly dangerous area... , And without the Soviet Union's cooperation it may be Red Dove Flies Into Nix citficult to move as fast as we would like in setting the war in Vietnam,” During the last campaign Nixon did suggest that the Soviet Union should be brought into the Vietnam peace talks in Pavis, But throughout his career as vice president and as a campaign orator, Nixon has not exactly been the leading advocate of the hope that the US. could profit from cooperation with the Kremlin, The authorized summary of his campaign posi tions, “Nixon on the Issues,” contains the following Nixon view on the Soviet Union: “We must always remember that our goal is different ftom theirs: we seek peace as ant end in itself, they seek victory with peace being at this time a means toward that end.” Atter Nixon's famous 1959 “kitchen debate” with Soviet Premier Nikita 8, Khrushchev, Nixon wrote in “Six Crises” that there is never a time “when it is sale to let up in the battle with our Communist opponents,” The Communists, he went on, are “out to win, and one of the tactics they use is to keep the pressure on, . , to keep them from winning and to win ourselves, we must have more stamina and more determination than they have.” From what Nixon said last night, there appeared ons Kitehe to be at least two factors behind his new-found hope that the Russians will prove cooperative in achieving peace, First, Nixon said that when he talked last month to Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, he had found Dobrynin willing to talk about matters of substance in a conciliatory manner, Second, Nixon said that Soviet diplomats had been helpful in work. ng out the understanding with North Vietnam that led to the bombing halt last Oct, 81 and later in breaking the impasse in Paris on the shape of the bargaining table, | In answer fo a question, Nixon conceded that Soviet policy in the Mideast and Vietnam is “ame bivalent,” In Vietnam, Nixon said, Russia i heating up the war by furnishing 80 to 85 per cent of the sophisticated military equipment for North Viet. namese forces, In the Middle Bast, he added, there would be no crisis unless Russia had rearmed. the Arabs after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. But Nixon cautiously concluded that Russia might play a peacekeeping role both in Vietnam and the Middle East to avoid a confrontation with the US, adding ominously that “each of us knows what a confrontation would megn.” October 20,1968 \f"

As a general rule, however, a lobby group can give sub- stantial contributions to congressmen with no fuss or- embarrassment, even when the recipients were members who had introduced amendments that specifically benefitted the lobby. Wit- ness the case of the Committee for Economic Growth. From the statements that the Com- mittee for Economic Growth filed with the clerk of the House of Representa- tives, there is no way of telling what kind of a group it is or what its goal may be. Its only listed officer is a Sharon A. Rose, treasurer, and she has an unlisted telephone number. The Committee for Economic Growth actually is an arm of the restaurant industry, one of Capitcl Hill’s better- - known pressure groups. And Sharon A. Rose is a secretary who worked for the National Restaurant Association’s Washington office. Since 1966, the Committee for Economic Growth has reported contri- buting $70,700 to 53 congressmen and senators up for election. Newsday’s Survey found that at least 36 of the recipients served on _ congressional have been instrumental in shaping or killing bills that affected the contribu- tors. / © More than 150 members of key congressional committees have ac- cepted campaign donations from fund- raising groups set up by lobbies which have specific business before their committees. @ At least seven cases were found where an interest group set up an in- nocent-sounding committee that served as a conduit of cash to favored Congressmen while masking the real source of funds, There is no secret on Capitol Hill about this practice, and not much in- dignation about it either. Federal law does not prohibit congressmen and senators from taking campaign contri- butions from a lobby’s political com- mittee so long as (1) they make no promises to vote a particular way, and (2) they comply with the notoriously loose reporting provisions of the Fed- eral Corrupt Practices Act ‘of 1925. The ethics codes of Congress contain no strictures against accepting cam- paign gifts from lobby groups, so long as the recipients don’t use campaign contributions for personal expenses. When questioned about accepting contributions after going tu bat for a ~ bill supported by a lobby group, con- gressmen usually reply, in effect: “I backed the bill because it was a good idea and it will help the people in my district or state. I wasn’t influenced by the contribution—after all, it’s a tiny fraction of my whole campaign.” There are some Congressmen, how- ever, who regularly turn down such contributions, Twice in the last year, a lobby group’s fund-raising efforts have back- fired. This summer, Rep. Fred Schwengel (R-Iowa) asked the House ethics committee to look into reports that an affiliate of the truck owners’ lobby had given $29,000 in the last three years to key members of con- gressional committees which were pro- cessing a bill to permit bigger trucks on interstate highways. The reports, originating in the Des Moines Register and Tribune, were accurate, but the House ethics committee did not find reason to start an investigation. The adverse publicity was heavy enough to keep House leaders from calling. the bill up on the floor, however, and it died in the House Rules Committee, A similar embarrassment befell L.. Blaine Lilijenquist, president of the Western States Meat Packers Associa- tion, last year when word got around Washington that he had asked a num- ber of meat packing executives to con- tribute to a campaign fund for “friendly” congressmen.

However, Roosevelt's bill failed to pass the a da ly, Dent pointed out that in a eee brought under the law for the first time, workers were escalated up to the minimum wage in gradual steps. He said that the restaurant in- dustry, like hotels, farms and a few others, maintained their exemptions from overtime provisions “because it had particular business conditions which did not lend themselves” to the overtime clause. — Former Rep. Charles E. Goodell (R- N.Y.), now New oe Bee junior yas one of seven other mem- Sie of the DUO Labor and Education Committee who accepted campaign checks from the Committee for Eco- nomic Growth during the last three years. Goodell received one $1,000 check on May 4, 1966, and another $1,000 check on Aug. 26, 1968, When the minimum wage bill was debated on the House floor May 24-26, 1966, three weeks after he had ac- cepted the first contribution, Goodell was one of several congressmen who introduced amendments specifically designed to reduce the impact of the law on the restaurant industry. Goodell’s amendment, which failed by a voice vote, would have allowed res- taurant owners to count a higher per- centage of a waiter’s tips as “wages” than the original subcommittee bill, provided that the owners could prove to the U.S, Labor Department that the employes actually received a higher amount of tips. That would have moaant that vegtanrants which attract association to PSC NUR ary eee quired to pay waiters a little less to meet the .minimum wage law's standards. Goodell says now, and restaurant lobbyist Nunn confirms, that the National Restaurant Association was not backing the Goodell amendment at that time, “They wanted another ap- proach,” Goodell said. He said that he had been unaware that his campaign committee received the contributions from the restaurant ‘industry until asked about it by Newsday, “My ap- proach is to pay no attention to such contributions,” he said. Rep. John C, Kluczynski (D-Ill), who is the owner of the Syrena Res- taurant in Chicago, later introduced an amendment which Nunn did want. It, too, was designed to allow restaurant owners to count a higher percentage of tips as wages.

Nunn said that the associ- ation has opposed, or had reservations about, all four. So far it has been on the winning side all four times. The pension plan - proposal, like minimum wage, was handled by the House and Senate labor committees. The other three proposals were under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. Of the 25 members of the latter committee, nine have re- ceived campaign contributions in the last two elections from the Committee for Economie Growth, totaling $13,000. Of the 12 members of the Finance Committee who have run for reelec- tion in the last three years, seven have gotten checks from the restaurant group, totaling $9,500. Asked what the restaurant industry got out of its largesse, Nunn expressed a view commonly held among Wash- ington lobbyists: “I think you get a lot of good will from it. I don’t know of anyone up there (in Congress) I could buy for any amount of money. But they will consider your things a little more carefully...” Nunn readily conceded, in answer to another question, that the groups name, The Committee for Economic Growth, “looks misleading.” Per- sonally, Nunn said, he thought the name should be changed, but he con- tended that it would be a complicated procedure. “It seems we are trying to hide something,” he said. “We ar not.” 1968 (continued) \f"

Jack Miller’s little amendment on nursing home reim- bursement passed the Senate twa years ago with neither debate nor a record vote, Though the Iowa Republican did not mention it, the amendment had been drafted for him largely by John K. Pickens, general counsel and regis- tered lobbyist for the American Nura- ing Home Association, On Oct, 10, less than three wecks after the Miller amendment passed the Senate, Pickens signed a check for $2,500 made out to i ail a fund-raising commi or the senator's reelection. The check was drawn ‘out th American Nursing Home Education and Political Action Committee, of Alexandria, Va. Pickens was treasurer of the group, A week after the Senate had acted, actuaries for the Social Security Ad- aninistration calculated that the amend. mend would give private nursing home operators several billion dollars a year in federal subsidies under the Medi- care program. The effect on the costs and financing of the program would be catastrophic,” wrote chief actuary Robert J. Myers. Armed by Myers’ private warning, nued October 29, 1968 —-Continued from Page 4 : he House-Senate conference comm i. quietly refused to accept the Miller amendment. In ita place, the conferees wrote a substitute amendment that just ar quictly became law, providing an increase in reimbursements to nursing homes of $60,000,000 a year.

Miller said, “and whenever there is an inequity alfecting a large proportion of the business in my state, I am going to do something about it whether they contribute or not.” He said that contributions to. his campaign committees totaled about $150,000 in 1966, Asked if he gaw any conflict of in- forest in necepting a- compaign dona- lion from a latby whese interests he had supported, Miller said, “T see no reason why those people who have benefitted from my services should not make a reasonable contribution to a campaign for reelection. Where else is one to finance n campaign?

Al Ullman (D.Ore.), $3,000 in 1966 and $4,000 in 1968. Ullman, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, was instrumental in persuading that cammittes to pass a provision in the Medicare bill in 19635, to permit intensive care of rome patients in nursing homes Instead of hospitals, an a meana of lowering the toial cost of Medicare. “Generally speaking, T wanted to expand financial incentives for nursing homes to estah- lich facilities for highly Intensive care,” Ullman explained, adding that he alro had fought to establish high nursing home standards.

Ercolano, the association's executive director, said that the nurs- ing home committer gave to Ullman because “he is a fairly Liberal Demo- erat, but our people from Oregon told us he was a man who wonld listen to wa... He advanced our arguments in the Ways and Means Committee.” @ Rep. Tom Steed (D-Okla.) and Rep. J. d, Pickle (D-Tex.), $5,000 each over the Jast three years. Among other things. At the request of the Texas Narsing Home Association, Pickle in- troduced a bill this year to allow com- munity nursing homes to accept veterans as patients without having to pay their employes the $1.60 minimum wage as provided in ihe federal ser- vices contract act. Sieed testified in favor of the bill. A modified form of Pickle’s bill passed both houses of Congress just before Congress ad- journed this month, deapite objections of the U.S. Labor Department. Veterans groups, including the Vet- crans Administration, favored — the togislntion. @ Rep. Hale Boggs (1D-La.), $3,000 in 1966, Boyes is House Democratic Whip and third-ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Commit. tee which has jurisdiction over Medi- care and Medicaid, Under those two prograins, the federal government pays about $1 billion to nursing homes each year, Besides Ullman and Boggs, 11 other members of the 25-man Ways and Means Committee got contribu. tions in 1966, generally $500 apiece, Boggs “was helpful to us before we were ever able to contribute anything,” Pickens explained. Based on the public record, none of the 35 recipieats did more about nursing home problema than Miller, who was a member of the Sonate So. lect Committee on the Aging. No Debate When Miller rore in the Senate to support his amendment on nursing home reimbursement in Sept. 22, 1966, there followed a few minutes of casual discussion but no debate and no op- position, Miller’s argument was that the government's original cost-pluq formula for calculating how much moncy skilled nursing homes should be reimbursed for taking aged pationts under the new Medicare program wag unfair to nursing hamves, “If something ia not done soon, there may be thou. sands of people who will not receive care to which they are entitled,” Miller told the Senate, “because not only proprietary but nonprofit nursing bomes are fneed with @ crisis in view of the regulations proposed by the Department of Health, Education ond Welfare on nursing home reimburse- ment.” He said that many nursing homes would refure Medicare patients rather than accept the formula. The whole colloquy occupied less than a page of the Congressional Rec- ord, and it ended when the Senate passed the amendment by voice vote, facked onto a routine Finance Com- mittee dill on computerizing federal tax records. The first to realize the potential impact of the Miller amend- ment were Lwa actuaries at the Social Security Administration who were as- signed to draft memos giving the ad- ministration’s cost estimates, On Sept. 29, 1966, chief actuary Robert J. Myers sent a blunt warning to. the House- Senate conference commitice that the Miller amendment “would have a catastrophic effect on the costs and financing of the HI (hospitalization insurance) program.” Myers sent along a three-page an- alysis from Gordon R. ‘Trapnell, a social security actuary, which explained that the Miller amendment would make the nursing home business virtually a “siskless investment” and would thus touch off a “scramble of investors and speculators to build ECFS (extended care facilities),” Price Tag ‘Trapnell’s memo did not put an ex- act price tag on the amendment, bat he concluded: ““Shus, if the Miller amendment became law, the cost of the HY program would be increased by Fevoral times over the next few years. Looking over the 2-vear-old memo Inst werk, Myers raid that the “FT pro- gram” casts about $2.5 billion a your and sa Trapnell waa talking abowt a cost of between $2.6 billion and $5 bil- lion n year for the Miller amendment. Miller's response now is that be did not have the actuarial estimates when he sponsored the amendment, and that the ameniiment may have been too high. As for the Nursing Home Asso- ciation, Pickens said his estimates were that the amendment would have cost only $17,000,000. Tn ony case, the Houre-Senate con- ference committer rewrote the amend- ment during closed-session meetings between Oct. 14-19, The resulling com- Promise formula was still a break for Aursing home operntors: $60,000,000 a year was Myers’ price tag.

The So- viet Union must be brought to that conference table. Other interested na- tions in Asia have to be brought there, because, by broadening the number of “nations and the issues, we will be able to have a negotiated settlement.” On its face, Nixon’s statement went slightly further toward spelling out how he would negotiate an end of the Vict- nam war than he has previously been willing to go. However, a Nixon press aide said two hours later that the can- didate had not meant to advocate bringing the Russians literally to the Paris peace table.

Here is the last of five articles, by Joseph Albright of the Newsday Washington Bureau, naming some of those who pay and those who get paid. Washington—“Money,” says California politico Jesse Unruh, “is the mother’s milk of politics.” The money to feed 468 races for the House and Senate has to come from somewhere. And it has to come in rather awesome quantities, Back in 1846, - when Abraham Lincoln ran for Congress, his whole campaign supposedly cost 75 cents used to buy a barrel of cider for some thirsty constituents, But in 1968, it can easily cost $25,000 to $75,000 just to run for Congress, Former Rep. Steven B. Derounian (R-Roslyn) spent $79,868 trying to make a comeback in 1966, but lost to Rep. Lester L. Wolff Friday, November 1, 1968 The Lobbies Rush In Where —Continued from Page 9 Foundation, one of the few outside experts on cam- paign contributions by lobby groups, points out that interest groups ‘have a right to contribute money to men they like. “The trouble is,” he said, “that the urgency of a campaign often leads a candidate to believe he needs an additional public opinion poll or series of TV spots, and this may lead him to accept contributions which he would not be willing to take in calmer times.” Most candidates frostily deny that their backers ask lobbyists for campaign contributions. But Stephen Slipher, lobbyist for the savings and loans association industry, said that he receives 200 soliciting letters a year ‘from committees set up by candidates for Congress. “A lot of these fellows just figure it makes sense to mail a letter out to the list of all lobbyists,” Slipher said. Just this month, for instance, it was disclosed that the administrative assistant for Sen. Daniel B. Brewster (D-Md.) had written to maritime lobbyists asting them to buy tickets to a $100-a-plate fund-raising dinner honoring Brewster, citing the fact that Brewster was on the Senate merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee. When the story broke, Brewster disavowed the letter and said, “I cannot control what my friends do.” As for cam bee accepted them. But:often a member hag some after-thoughts when ho fs questioned by a reporter about such a eo Sen, P. Griffin (R-Mich. accepted $14,000 from the Committee fe he (D-Kensington) who spent $27,909. One Democrat in North Carolina spent $250,000 in his congressional race two years ago and still lost. As for the Senate, a good campaign is a big industrialized state costs $500- 000 or more, Robert F. Kennedy's 1964 campaign for the Senate cost between $1,200,000 and $4,000,000. Since the last thing any candidate wants is whis- pering and suspicion surrounding his campaign funds, it seems only logical that by now Congress would have written some rules to tell its members specifi- cally what money can be ethically accepted. But despite the ugly headlines about Bobby Baker, Sen. Thomas J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and former Rep. Adam Clayton Powell (D-Manhattan), few rules exist besides the law against out-and-out bribery. When the House passed its code of ethics this spring, . it decreed that a congressman “Shall accept no gift of substantial value directly or indirectly from any per- son, organization or corporation having a direct or said later that he would favor a bill requiring that all contributions come from individuals instead of polit- ical committees, And Rep, Herbert Tenzer (D-Law- rence), who accepted $500 from the Government Improvement Group in 1966, criticized the organiza- tion fer not disclosing its purposes. “Their contribu- tions should not be surreptitious,” he said. The only listed officer of the Government Im- provement Group is James E. Mack, the registered. lobbyist of Rolled Zinc Manufacturers Association. Asked to describe the purposes of the Government Improvement Group, Mack said, “It is not my duty to reveal the business of my client.” Mack did not keep the membership a secret from the 32 candidates who got campaign checks from the Government Im- provement Group in the last three years. “They are all the big -candy manvfacturers in the United States,” disclosed Rep. Herman T. Schneebeli (D- Pa.). “Jim Mack said, ‘Your friends at Hershey are included in this group.’” Why do special interest groups set up committees that mask their true intentions? Some of their spokesmen explain that they want to keep their lob- bying and fund-giving activities well separated, But another concealed lobby group’s executive director said privately, “It might look embarrassing for a con, from Arkansas to get a contribution from us,” Federal law forbids unions or corporations to make contributions to political candidates directly out of union or company treasuries, but the law does not forltid the establishment of fund-giving “political committees” ‘supported -by voluntary contributions made by members of one union or corporation. Even hardened cynics around Capitol Hill concede that the number-of congressmen whose vote could be indirect interest in legislation before the Congress.\" However, the word “gift” was not intended to cover campaign contributions. Matter of Conscience In other words, it fs up to the candidate's own conscience and political judgment to determine whether it is ethical to accept a campaign contriby. tion from a lobbyist doing business before his congressional committee. Evidently, at least 150 members have determined that it is ethical, becauss they have done it.

Following Humphrey’s Astrodome appearance, his aides displayed the results of favorable Harris and Gallup polls. Humphrey aides pointed otit that the new Gallup Poll reveals a two-point drop for Nixon, while Hum- phrey picks up four points. Four per cent are termed “undecided.” Later, Humphrey strategisis claimed that the vice president would win 313 electoral votes (43 more than the necessary 270) to 145 for Nixon and 80 for Wallace. The Humphrey claim is based on winning 16 “certain” states with 237 electoral votes and a num- ber of “toss-up” states with 121 electoral votes. The strategists declined to specify which of the 12 states considered “‘toss-ups” the vice president would carry. ‘The “certain” states and their electoral votes are: Connecticut (8), District of Columbia (3), Maine (4), Maryland (10), Massachussets (14), New Jersey (17), New York (43), Pennsylvania (29), Rhode Island (4), West Virginia (7), Hawaii (4), Michigan 21), Minnesota (10), Missouri (12), Ohio (26) and Texas (25). The “toss-up” states are: Delaware (3), California (40), Nevada (3), New Mexico (4), Washington (9), Alaska (3), Colorado (6), Kentucky (9), Tennessee (11), Virginia (12), North Carolina (13) and South Carolina (8), campaign, was “a grandstand stunt.” And he said that it was up to Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk to determine whether he could be helpful in working out what he called the “semantical differ- ences” keeping the Saigon government from sending representatives to the Paris peace table. The White House said that it had no comment on Nixon’s offer or on his charges. ; During the national telecast, the GOP candidaie’s only campaign activity yesterday, Nixon reiterated that “under no cireumstances” would he attempt io deal with presidential electors backing George C. Wallace, the third-party candidate, in the event that none of the three nominees wins a majority of elec- toral votes Tuesday. “The most important thing is not to make a deal with Wallace,” he said. Wallace said in Atlanta yesterday that in two states, electors pledged to him had been approached by Nixon repre- sentatives “offering them a deal.” He refused to elaborate. November 4, 1968 \f"

Rockefeller. ‘Nixon planned another round of dis- cussions today, in which the date for a - meeting with President Johnson and possibly another meeting with Vice President Humphrey were due to be fixed. od _ As Nixon looked to his future ad- ministration, election officials con- _tinued to tote up the margin of his _ victory over Humphrey Tuesday, and the edge remained paper thin. With 97 per cent of all precincts reporting, _Nixon’s total was 30,268,849, Hum- ey’s was 29,981,643 and George C. _Wallace’s was 9,309,616. However, with .8 electoral votes in Alaska and 10 in Maryland still undecided, Nixon com- manded a 299 to 181 lead, or 29 more than necessary for election, with Wal- lace holding 45. Nixon’s extensible reason for flying to Florida was to relax, and he also found time to do that yesterday. He spent a good part of the day in a blue sport shirt and black Bermuda shorts, and at\\ least once he went into the placid waters of the bay for a swim. It was a fine day for resting: the temperature was in the 80s, the sun was out, and around his house pink hibiscus and ether plants were in bloom. ik Last night, Nixon went to a public restaurant in Key Biscayne for a steak and a five-to-one martini, along with his wife and children and 21 members of his entourage. In a toast to Nixon, California Lt. Gov. Robert A. Finch Neapiethest Nixon dined at the same restaurant, the Jamaica Inn, two days after he lost the 1960 election. Nixon, who seemed to be in an ebullient mood, proposed a toast in response to “lieu- tenant governors and vice presidents: nay they have a better fate than they ve now.” Then he turned to several eporters at the next table and said, . ‘Send a copy of that to Hubert.” As “he left the restaurant, Nixon au- At graphed a toy elephant for head bar- tender Andrew McCormick, and then _ told those sitting at the bar, “Always ‘- thust him; he will never give you a fickey.”* “Finch, who is one of three top ad- ovisers who conferred with Nixon yester- day about forming the new administra- ‘tion, said after the dinner that a great ‘many names had been discussed as possibilities for the Cabinet, but that : Moy decisions were reached. “Rockefel- Ter’s (name) was obviously one of them,” Finch told Newsday. Rockefel- ler has been mentioned as a possible candidate .for secretary of state, de- fense or housing and urban develop- ment. Rockefeller said yesterday that he would “consider” a major job in the Nixon administration, but added that he had not been offered one. The New York governor, arriving in Lisbon, Por- tugal, for a vacation, said, “I have not been asked, so far, to serve nN the gov- ernment.” Should Nixon make an offer, Rockefeller said, he would “consider it, but I do not know what the final answer would be.” . 2 Another frequently-mentioned Cabi- net possibility, former Gov. William Scranton of Pennsylvania, said yester- day that he has told Nixon advisers that he is not available. Nixon’s official press aide, Ronald Ziegler, told a press conference earlier yesterday that the President-elect had dec 1:d not fo svncimee any Sabir of appo-acaeit ort. ‘Ler Dee 5, “Mr. Nixon wants to have time to consider individuals of high capabili- ties from all sections of the country— from the Democratic as well as the Republican Party,” Ziegler said. One Democrat speculated yesteday on the possibility of a non-GOP ap- pointment. Sen. Vance Hartke of In- diana predicted that Nixon will offer a cabinet-level post to Humphrey. Hartke suggested that Humphrey might be of- fered the post of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He would not guess whether or not Humphrey would accept it. Ziegler said that Nixon planned to stay in Key Biscayne through Sunday. He will then return to New York and set up a headquarters, probably at the Hotel Pierre, Ziegler said. Nixon held his initial conferences .m » While Nixon could afford to x finally, after his close victory, ode. fa sible result of it emerged vested nye when Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and Rep. Emanuel Celle (D-Brooklyn) an- nounced plans to seek a change in the method of electing a President. Bayh said that he has proposed substituting direct popular election for the Electoral College method, and Celler, suggested a system under which each state’s elec- toral vote would be divided in propor- tion to popular vote totals. Two other candidates concerned with closeness of vote totals remained on tenterhooks yesterday, although it appeared near certain that Republican Robert Packwood, 36, would succeed in unseating incumbent Democratic Sen.

But in the Nixon administration, Rebozo will probably be heard of more and more, even though he personally detests publicity. Many a President has had a crony he could ‘relax with, a sounding board for his private ruminations. From all indications, the next President’s main confidante outside official circles will be Rebozo, the wealthy Key Biscayne investor with whom Nixon likes to go fishing and watch the late TV movie. Yesterday, some straws in the wind: In the mor- ning, Nixon conferred with his top advisors about the transition of power at Rebozo’s house, In the after- noon, Rebozo rode in Nixon’s motorcade to Opa Locka Airport and. stood behind Nixon and Vice President Humphrey as they spoke on television. In the evening, when Vice President-elect Agnew was arriving at the same airport, Nixon and his family were at a barbeque at Rebozo’s house, The Nixon-Rebozo friendship goes back to 1951, when Sen. George A. Smathers (D-Fla.) arranged to have Rebozo take Nixon fishing. “We just hit if off, I guess,” Rebozo told an interviewer. Whatever the ex- planation, their friendship matured to the extent that Rebozo was the only person Nixon invited up to his ne room to hear the unhappy election returns in 1960. If Nixon has profited personally from knowing Rebozo, he has also. profited financially. At Rebozo’s urging, between 1961 and 1967, Nixon bought 176,000 shares of Fisher Island Inc. an unlisted corporation that owns most of a 207-acre undeveloped island just off Miami Beach. Nixon’s business manager, Vincent Andres, said that Nixon paid $1 a share for the stock, and that he estimates that it is now worth $2 a share. Rebozo is president of the corporation. — Ronald Ziegler, Nixon’s press aide, said the Presi- dent-elect had no plans to sell the shares or put them in a trust because there was no way his actions as President could affect the land value, Before Nixon’s election made -Rebozo a_ local celebrity, he was known only as a handsome, single man who had become a millionaire by hard work and who liked to squire around a- variety of beautiful women.

After civil rights groups organized a boycott of Hempstead merchants, the village board changed its mind and rezoned the same property residential in what it said was a move to “prevent riots and injuries.” Subsequently, however, New York courts ordered the property to revert back to indus- trial zoning on grounds that the village board should not have “surrendered to pressure groups.” In analyzing the village board’s motives, the study concluded, “Although there was no premeditated in- tent to harm the Negro residential community, there was also no apparent concern for the welfare of this group of citizens.” It also concluded that the Negro residents “rightly protested the intrusion of industrial activity into their neighborhood.” Communications between the village and the Negro community were described in the report as “poor” at the time of the dispute but improved in recent years. The study said that from the point of view of professional planning practices, there was no justifica- tion for rezoning the parcel industrial, since it was in the middle of a residential area and not on a major highway.

        "ocr_text": "By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau Washington—As he prepares for his farewells, U.S. Attorney General Clark is concerned that during the next ad- ministration much individual privacy could be destroyed by vastly improved techniques of electronic bugging in the hands of the police. The outgoing attorney general said in an interview with Newsday Thurs- day that law enforcement officials should develop techniques for catching criminals withouth relying heavily on electronic surveillance. Otherwise, he said, the country is in danger of be- coming a captive of eavesdropping technology, because science already has made it possible to overhear conversa- tions “through brick and steel and half way around the world.” Last summer, Clark led an unsuc- cessful fight to prevent Congress from authorizing wiretaps and bugging to combat organized.-crime. Clark advo- cated limiting their use to cases involv- ing national security.

If banks would keep guards on duty and install protective alarm de- vices, they would cut down sharply on the number of bank robberies. One factor that helps to explain their reluc- tance to spend money on their own protection is the insurance pooling ar- rangements under which individual banks do not bear the entire brunt of losses in a bank robbery. @ Community relations is “the most important problem” facing local police departments, and poor police-: community relations is a big reason’ why most crime is never reported to the police. The answer is not to assign a larger group of policemen as com- munity relations’ experts; all officers must do better. e@ “Even with the vast turbulence and frustration and anger that exists in the cities, effective police action today can prevent nearly all riots from hap- pening and quickly control any that occur.” The major reason why there were not more riots last summer js that police officials around the country had undergone training in riot preven- tion and control. So far there is no evidence that guerrilla warfare is de- veloping in the ghettos as was feared at the time of the Cleveland disturbance last simmer. But that does not mean that we do not have to prepare very carefully for the possibility. - Clark said that he really did not know what job he would take aftey Jan. 20. “I have not considered it ap- propriate to talk to any law firm oy company which may have wanted to talk to me (about a job),” he said, organized crime. Clark said with some bitterness this week, “The Congress authorizes wiretapping because it does not cost any money. But we’ve asked them for two years to give us the money for 73 more specialists to use in our strike forces against organized crime , . . Wiretapping is a very ineffi- cient method of combatting crime.” Clark also warned the next attorney general against a policy of “‘repressive- ness” in handling racial disorders and said that such a policy might even lead to guerrilla warfare in the ghettos. Asked if he thought that a new at- torney general with a different ap- proach to riot control might bring more racial problems next summer, Clark said that no one official could change the amount of rioting in ordinary cir- cumstances. But, he added, “The one fear that you could have is that this office could lend its strength to repres- siveness and a ‘get tough’ policy where the means to the end do not matter. If this happened, if there was no place in the responsible government commun- ity where there was insistence that the police act within the framework of the law themselves, then you could find chiefs of police who know so much better giving in to the forces demand- ing repression within the police depart- ments and within city politics and within the community. I think this would Jead to extensive and _ very dangerous types of violence. It might manifest itself in guerrilla techniques.” Taking some of the sting out of his words, Clark said in the next breath that he personally did not share such fears about the next administration. do not believe that when the burdens and responsibilities are assumed that they will be handled irresponsibly,” he said. “I would expect the occupant of this office to insist always that police act within the law—as, indeed, police nearly always do.” At 41, Clark is the youngest cabinet member by two years. He is also, per. haps, the most unpretentious, having served in high positions during the New Frontier and the early part of the Johnson administration without even owning a tuxedo. His drawl and his lanky frame betray him as a Texan. As he speaks, in the office occupied five years ago by Robert F. Kennedy, it is without a single gesture or anecdote. Ramsey Clark was first known to the public as the son of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, now retired. The attorney general is perhaps best known now as the man Nixon promised during every campaign speech to turn out of office for failing to do more to halt the rise in crime. Within the present administration, Clark is most admired for his role in marshaling the forces of various gov- ernment departments to control the 1967 March on the Pentagon, and this year’s Poor People’s Campaign in Washington without widespread vio- lence.

Walker said he was appealing to Chief Judge William J. Campbell of the U.S. District Court in Chicago to sanction the release of material which was deleted from the report at the request of Justice Department officials. “I should like to go under oath here and now, a public and per- sonal oath to the American people, that my report was not rewritten, neither by Ramsey Clark . . . nor any- one else,” Walker told a news confer- ence here. Campbell said he had no comment on either Clark’s or Walker’s statement. : ‘ Meanwhile, the chairman of a House Un-American Activities Committee panel said yesterday that evidence in hearings this week shows participation by Communists and other revolu- tionaries in street riots which accom- panied the Democratic corivention. _ Clark, responding in Washington to a copyrighted story in the Chicago Tri- bune, termed as “pure fabrication” a statement -attributed to an authorita- tive source that the report, and particu- larly the summary which accused police of unrestrained brutality, was “substantially rewritten” under the at- torney general’s direction. i.

UT what seems different about the tone and empha-- sis of Lyndon B. Johnson in the last six months_is his ¢ stronger concern about pre- serving the past. He talks about Roosevelt and Truman and even Hoo- ver, but at the center of his thoughts is his own history. As his wife, Lady Bird, said the other day: ‘“The process of leaving Washington after 34 years is a little like drowning—all your past flashes before you.” ‘The word is spread by those wha see Johnson frequently that he is suffused with an attitude of great mellowness which makes him easier to get along with than a year ago. A White House official said, “He will go out of office reasonably well satis- fied that his stewardship has been productive. In almost every area of the world or of the economy at home we are stronger. In the foreign policy record bei 2 p in Asia. He doesn’t ha about being able to settle the war in Vietnam, but he is going to leave the military situation over there in the best shape it’s ever been, and the legislative record of this administra- tion is certainly nothing to ashamed of.” Johnson and his associates feel he has been unfairly maligned by - the Washington press, and they are betting that historians of the future will be a lot kinder, once the scars of Vietnam have time to fade, to make sure that what he privately calls the flagrant untruths in the press are ex- posed, he care te insure that the record of his eareer will not slip away. Frantz’ oral-history project was one form of his insurance, but far from the only one. In fact, if all Frantz’ tapes and transcripts were lost somehow on their way from the Executive Office Building safe to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library, future historians would still find a larger mound of source material on Johnson than on any other President. Johnson’s personal papers fill about 2,000 four-drawer filing cabinets. All of these papers will be shipped to ‘Texas under tight security when the President leaves office. This .vast col- lection of documents is said to include every memo, draft, and letter he has written in the last 34 years, plus in many cases careful stenographic motes on his meetings and phone calls. Someone has calculated that there will be nearly as many file her documents in the Lyndon mes Library as in f * . braries of the last four Pree together. Then there is the rik te Pest -  &overnment? writte ; Ss nm history project. Last May has taken extraordinary - Presidente pest . presidential assistant Joseph A. Cali- fano sent a directive to all depart- ment and agency heads requiring them to assign “at least two highly qualified individuals’? to prepare his- tories of their part in the Johnson administration. Most of the depart- mental histories have been turned in to Califano now, and some run as long as six thick notebooks. Another’ section of the Johnson Library will house the immense col- lection of still pictures and newsreels of the President, his family and his advisers shot by official White House and Navy photographers. The well- known still cameraman Yoichi Oka- moto has been on the White House payroll most of the last five years, with access to the President at all times of the day, even during some top-secret meetings. Okamoto and his two assistants have been unobtrusive- ly clicking away at the rate of per- haps 150 frames a day. Also, a special detachment of Navy cameramen has been filming newsreels of the Presi- dent and his family on a regular basis. This, then, is the spirit of Johnson Past. However, one should not de- duce that the President has fallen victim to lassitude in his 40 last days in office. The. Spirit of Johnson . Present is still a_ titanic force to be reckoned with. Every night after watching the 11 o’clock news on his triple-screen TV set, he goes to bed with his “night reading”—about 100 memos that call for his prompt ac- tion. By the time he goes to sleep at or 3. he 6 ‘4 Gast EN oak Sieagtnd each one. just “call me.” With a war in Vietnam and a peace conference in Paris, the Presi- dent is still churning out a flow of command decisions every day. About three or four times a week he must Bive word-by-word approval to new instructions for Ambassador Averell Harriman in Paris, and there is al- ways a stream of messages to the U.S. Mission in Saigon. When he wakes up at 6:30 the next morning, he is handed a corps-by- corps report on the military positions in Vietnam prepared by the White House situation room, As he downs his breakfast, often scrambled eggs and sausage, he goes through a stack of daily world intelligence reports from the CIA, the Defense Intelli- gence Agency and the State De- partment. Once a week there is Am- bassador Ellsworth Bunker’s week- ly cable from Saigon, which can run 4,000 words. Some of the news is good, such as the recent analysis from Saigon indicating that the Viet Cong has been losing control of territory in South Vietnam at the rate of three per cent a month. Other intelligence is not so happy, such as the indica- tion that the Viet Cong and North Johnson’s normal into two -parts, After time day is dividea spending some 2 swim in the around 9:30 AM. George Christian White House pool Press Secretary _ liv x and Christian’s assistant, Tom John- son, arrive at the President’s living quarters at 10 AM so they. can get his guidance for their morning news briefing. From 11 AM to 2 PM the President is in his oval office in the west wing of the White House, greet- ing visitors and officials who have appointments. He has lunch around 2:30 PM back in the mansion and then gets into his pajamas for a nap. He is back in his office by around 5:30 PM for his second burst of work. “By this time all the papers that have been circulating during the day are beginning to flow up to him,” said a | White House official. There are of- ficial appointments until about 8 PM, with phone calls before, during and after. Sometime during the evening he sits down at a signing table and signs perhaps 100 letters. After the 11 PM news on TV, he gets into bed for another round of his “night read- ing.” F The timing of his dinner hour is a sore point, at least with Mrs. Zephyr White, the President’s cook. Often she has dinner ready to serve at 8:30 PM, and Johnson doesn’t arrive with his guests until 10, 11 or 12 at night. If Mrs. Wright were to prepare the President’s favorite dinner, without counting calories, it would consist of crab cocktail, roast beef, stewed corn, green beans, green salad (chopped fine so he can eat it with a spoon), popovers and custard. But the Presi- dent weighs about 212 pounds now, a gain of 26 pounds since he came to the White House. So Mrs. Wright usually cooks lamb chops, steak or ex instead. __ A Nes AS iE IETNAM is only one of a hundred topics that can occupy the President dur- ing a day. The Middle East is always on the front burner these days, and it is known that Johnson is still working through his emissaries to pull one last big rabbit out of the diplomatie hat—a climactic trip abroad culminating in a summit conference with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin. Meanwhile, his agents on Capitol Hill have been counting moses to see what would happen if he called a special session of the Senate to ratify the nuclear ee ie treaty. m the domestic side, J. ° most important responsibili oes iste i is a ee the fe get under which President- 1 i on will operate for the fiscal on beginning next July. “There oe really three possibilities,” explain a one White House official. “The ence is _to propose an array of big ne programs.

On the other hand, said one Johnson confidant, ‘he doesn’t want to cease being Lyndon Johnson or a Democratic President. So the prob- lem he feels is how to speak out on his own convictions without seeming to lash out at Nixon.” The problem will be most acute in drafting the final State of the Union message, a task which the White House has | searcely begun. Johnson has another little problem to work out with Nixon: whereas Yuki, the mongrel pet, will go to the LBJ Ranch in January, Johnson has said he hopes the next President will be willing to keep Blanco, the shy collie, at the White House. What about the Spirit of Johnson Future? Although Johnson’s hair is gray and he looks tired for only 60 years old, it is hard to imagine the _Johnsonian energy harnessed to a rocking chair. One clue suggesting that he will continue to push himself — even in retirement is that he has al- ready begun discussing with his as- sociates what tone he should strive for - in his seminars next spring at Rice University and later at the. Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Af- fairs.

Ziegler Press Assistant By Joseph Albright - Newsday Washington Bureau Washington—The California mafia will be taking over at the White House where - Lyndon Johnson’s Texas mafia and John - F Kennedy's Irish mafia left off. By the pattern of his first White House appointments, Richard M. Nixon is show- ing that he will lean hard on men from his 1968 campaign staff who have been loyalists through the tough years when many considered him a “has-been.” Judg- ing from his first six choices to flesh out the White House staff, the President-elect .. 18 looking for three qualities beyond loyalty: youth, the} Closeup ability to sell a prod- uct and the skill to make things run on time, Each White House staff takes on a col- oration that reflects the man in the oval office, and Richard Nixon’s White House will be no exception. It happens that five of the first six appointees went to college in California or were associated with Nixon - when he was a California senator, As Nixon goes on to name his cabinet and his . other top aides, the percentage of Califor- : nians is bound to drop, Yet at least two - more close allies from California, Nixon’s - former press secretary, Herbert G, Klein, - and California Lt. Gov. Robert H, Finch, are in line for top White House positions if they want them. Four of the first six staff members can be lumped together as sophisticated sales- men, Of the four, three are Californians who came to Nixon via the J. Walter Thompson Co., advertising agency. Chief among them is H. R.: (Bob) Haldeman, 42 and crewcut, who was head of the agency’s Los Angeles office before becoming Nixon’s campaign chief of staff this year, Haldeman, a member of the California Board of Regents, worked for Nixon in his 1956 vice presidential campaign as a volunteer, In 1960, he moved up to chief advance man, and two years later he was Nixon’s campaign manager. At the White House, he will have overall direction of Nixon’s staff, a function similar to the one he performed during the campaign. ; Two other J. Walter Thompson products were named as special assistants to the President yesterday, They were Dwight L. Chapin, 28, who will keep Nixon’s daily appointment schedule, and Ronald L. Zieg- ler, 29, who will handle his day-to-day press releases. In many ways the two were stamped from the same mold, Both were campus leaders and members of Sigma Chi fraternity at the University of Southern California in the early 1960s, Both labored in minor capacities in Nixon’s 1962 campaign for governor of California, and both stayed close to him politically in the years after he was de- feated, What's more, Ziegler and Chapin look and dress alike—handsome, black-haired, blue pin-striped suits, conservative ties, and tab-collar shirts, After Haldeman hired both to be account representatives at J, Walter Thompson, their careers diverged a bit, with Ziegler staying in Los Ang And Madison Avenue Style to handle the Disneyland account and Chapin heading to New York to work with Scott Paper. Bryce N. Harlow, 52, is a salesman of a different sort. During the Eisenhower ad- ministration he was one of the most effec- tive members of the White House congres- sional relations staff. Nixon, who presided over the closely divided Senate in his posi- tion as vice president, got to know Harlow well in those years.'And in the 1960 cam- paign, Harlow was a top Nixon speech writer. Unlike the others on the staff, Har- low was born and educated in Oklahoma and is not a Californian. Efficiency and precision became the hallmarks of the Nixon campaign, and his first appointments have given hints that he wants his White House staff to operate with similar smoothness, Also among the first six appointees are John D. Ehrlich- man, who mastered the intricacies of scheduling Nixon’s campaign appearances so well that the candidate was almost never late, and Rose Mary Woods, Nixon’s long-time personal secretary who has a passion for precision and neatness, Ehr- lichman, a 43-year-old Seattle attorney who will be counsel to the President, is a graduate of the University of Southern California Law School. During the 1960 and 1962 campaigns, he worked as an ad- vance man and schedule maker for Nixon, Miss Woods, who was born about 47 years ago in Ohio, has been Nixon's personal secretary since 1947 when he was a gen- ator, In recent years the President-elect has depended on her for political advice as December 1968 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Kennedy Has Footholc By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau Washington—Sen. Edward M. Ken- nedy (D-Mass.), by vanquishing a Southern veteran in a Senate leader- ship struggle, emerged yesterday with a new forum that could propel him toward the presidency in 1972 without exposing him to endless dinners, trips and speeches. Sen. Russell B. Long (D-La.), the man Kennedy ousted from the job of assistant Senate majority leader, or whip, remarked sadly that it had been a “very interesting experience” to run against a Kennedy. “I would suggest that Mr. Nixon should be very careful and watch himself for the future be- cause in all probability he has a very able opponent ready for him,” Long said. The Louisiana legislator, a son of the late Sen. Huey Long, came to the Senate 20 years ago. He recalled that he had not lost an election since he was 16 years old. Kennedy was elected to the Senate in 1962. Long and his backers, mostly South- erners and conservatives, had expected to win narrowly, But when the secret ballots were counted at: the caucus of Senate Democrats that preceded the opening of Congress, Kennedy won in an upset by a vote of 31-26. (Editorial, ‘Kennedy’s Victory,’ Page 15.) t In a footnote that seems sure to have political repercussions, Sen. ennedy —Continued from Page 3 turned aside suggestions that his elec- tion as whip would give him a power base for a 1972 bid for the presidency. “I do not believe it has implications tremely time-consuming job which will of that kind,” he said. “It is an ex- give me responsibilities in the Senate and keep me busy there.” The duties of the whip have con- sisted principally of rounding up Democratic votes for important roll calls and of assisting the majority leader, Sen. Mike Mansfield (D- _Mont.), in running the day-to-day af- fairs of the Senate. One reason why Kennedy won yesterday is that many senators believed that Long, who has been. whip since Hubert Humphrey gave up the job in 1965, did not spend enough time on the Senate floor be- Eugene J. McCarthy (D-Minn.) voted for Long and ~~ against Kennedy. Pressed to explain his vote, McCarthy said in a brief interview, “It goes back to some things in 1964 and some things in 1968.” He would not elaborate. Asked whether he thought he would be hurt politically by voting against Kennedy, McCarthy said, “I- don’t generally do things in terms of what they will do to me. If I did, I would have done what the rest of the people who are unhappy about the war did—nothing.” McCarthy is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, of which Long is chairman. Kennedy’s victory came half an hour after liberal-minded Republicans in the Senate succeeded in electing Sen. Hugh Scott (R-Pa.) as minority whip. By a vote of 23-20, Scott de- feated a conservative candidate, Sen. Roman L. Hruska (R-Neb.), for the post left vacant by the defeat of liberal Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel (R-Calif.) in a primary. Scott’s victory was also something of an upset since Hruska had the support of Senate Minority Leader Everett M. Dirksen (R-IIl.). In another Republican contest, Sen. Gor- don Allott of Colorado defeated Sen. Robert P. Griffin of Michigan for the chairmanship of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. Emerging from the Democratic cau- cus room yesterday morning, Kennedy —Continued o cause of his duties as Senate Finance Committee chairman. Kennedy pledged yesterday that as a member of the Senate leadership he would try to cooperate with President- elect Nixon “in trying to solve the extraordinarly difficult problems we face in urban areas and elsewhere.” He indicated, however, that the Democrats will propose their own programs, and added that his victory expressed the “sense of Democratic senators in favor of an aggressive and creative program in the upcoming Congress.” Sources close to Kennedy said later that the 36-year-old Massachusetts sen- ator had been attracted to the post of majority whip because it would allow him to build a solid reputation while postponing any decision on whether to MEETING.

Kennedy’s most obvious rival for the 1972 Democratic nomina- tion, Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Me.), made a nominating speech for Kennedy at the caucus yesterday. Muskie had declined to run for the whip’s job on grounds that it would be “too confin- ing.” After the vote, Kennedy joined his '99- colleagues on the Senate floor as Vice President Humphrey swore in the 16 new senators, among them Sen.

        "ocr_text": "Nixon Team By Joseph Albright Chief Washington Correspondent Washington—The sharpest break so far in philos- ophy and tactics between the nascent Nixon admin- istration and the Johnsonian past has been in the domain of “law and order.” Whereas most Cabinet heads are still winding up to make changes, the cleavage between the new attor- ney general, John N. Mitchell, and his predecessor, Ramsey Clark, is already visible to the naked eye. Under Mitchell, there will be more wiretapping and bugging and less of a push on a new gun control law; more inclination toward drastic measures to keep potential criminals off the streets and less toleration of “activist” demonstrators. After President Nixon’s campaign speeches, it comes as no shock that the first great changes in his administration should surface in the Justice Depart- ment, Nixon promised at every rally to appoint a new attorney general, often referring to Clark Closeup | as “tragically unaware of the magnitude of America’s organized crime problem.” First indications of a new look in the Justice Department came at Mitchell's confirmation hearing before Inauguration Day when he said that he would reverse Clark’s policy against using wiretaps and elec- tronic eavesdropping devices in criminal cases. Congress authorized expanded use of wiretapping and bugging under court order last summer in organized crime and national security cases, but Clark declined to use the authority except in spying cases, citing the danger of invasion of privacy. Mitchell was asked at a press conference the day after the Inauguration whether he would have issued a parade permit to the group of demonstrators that threw objects at Nixon’s limousine during the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Mitchell replied that he had no objection to legitimate, peaceful demonstra- _ tors, but it seemed to him that the Inauguration Day Bares Own Style on ‘La protesters were activists, In the future, he said, there would be no permits if his intelligence reports showed that the would-be demonstrators were activists. Clark had approved a permit for a Counter- Inaugural Parade the day before Nixon’s swearing in, and it was Clark’s decision to grant permits for the March on the Pentagon in 1967 and for the Resurrec- tion City camp-in in Washington last summer. Under Clark the Justice Department unsuccessfully advised Chicago officials to grant permits for a controlled demonstration during the Democratic National Con- vention last summer. Further signs of a new direction in the Justice Department were provided yesterday by Deputy At- torney General Richard G.. Kleindienst, who said that part of the administration’s crime program for the District of Columbia will be “preventive detention” | where necessary to keep arrested suspects from com- mitting other crimes when out on bail. Under ques- — tioning, Kleindienst said, “The legislation for a pre- ' ventive detention program might well be applied to all the District Courts in the country.” He did not spell out any mechanics of “preventive detention,” but it appeared that such a plan would involve more restrictive bail requirements and longer sentences for repeaters. Kleindienst also said that in his opinion the licens- ing and registration of firearms should “to the extent possible be handled by the states.” Registration and licensing on a federal level were among the goals former President Johnson called for in his State of the Union. message.

In the White House tess than a month, President Nixon Ras already settled into a well-orga- nized routine. By Joseph Albright Chief Washington Correspondent T IS 7:45 AM. The President of the U.S., Richard M. Nixon, has been up about 45 minutes. The President has shaved for the first time of the day and has put on one of his perfectly pressed Wall Street lawyer suits. He has eaten his breakfast alone—typically, cold cereal, strawberries or another fresh fruit, a sweet roll, toast and coffee—while his wife was still in bed in her own room. And now it is time for the President to go to the office.

Someone lighted the kindling wood when the Secret Service man called ahead a few minutes earlier te say that the President was about to leave the family quarters. A fire in the fire- place is high on the list of things —Continued on Following Page February 15, 1969 \fNixon —Continued Nixon really likes, it seems. “I’ve never known anyone who likes to have fires more than he does,” says Rose Mary Woods, the President’s long-time personal secretary. When the President’s briefcase is unpacked after the previous night’s work, his secretaries will find as many as six 18-minute belts from the dicta- tion machine he keeps in his living quarters. The briefcase will also con- tain one or two fat folders of “must” reading which he waded through the night before. Then there will be an- other folder of ‘‘FYI” reading which Nixon may or may not have read. “The FYI’s are the things we want him to see if he has the time—the particularly touching letter about the inaugural speech and that sort of thing,” explained Miss Woods. IXON’S mind operates in orderly channels, breaking down a problem _ into Points A, B and C and then Subpoints 1, 2 and 3. After 26 days in the White House, Nixon has already devised a system of organizing his daily activities that seems more precise and methodical than anything Presidents Kennedy and Johnson ever thought up. One procedure, instituted by President Eisenhower but not used by Kennedy or Johnson, is the preparation of a daily check-list. It is compiled by Kenneth Cole, a middle-level White House aide who holds the title of White House staff secretary. Cole, 30, is responsible for main- taining a central list of all the re- ports, drafts and other paperwork which the President has commis- sioned. Each day there are about 30 presidential projects coming due, Cole estimates. The man responsible for each project gets a little note from Cole a few days before the deadline, reminding him when the project is expected. And every afternoon Cole sorts out the 10 or 15 most important assignments which are due the next day and lists them in a memo that goes to Nixon and about a dozen top White House assistants. Cole’s memo tells nat only who is responsi- ble for what (“D. P. Moynihan, agen- da for urban council meeting”) but also gives a deadline for turning it in, down to the hour. Generally Nixon’s first business conversation of the day is with Robert Haldeman, the White House chief of staff, who functions as the conduit between Nixon and the rest of his staff. Nixon may also receive quick visits in the early morning from some of his other close assistants, perhaps Bryce Harlow or Arthur Burns on some legislative problem or perhaps Ronald Ziegler on what to tell the press at the 11 AM news briefing. About 9:30 each morning, Nixon calls in his national security adviser, Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, for a 15-minute oral briefing on the latest worldwide intelligence and the highlights of the overnight diplo- matic cables. And sometime before 10 AM _ Nixon finds an hour or so to read a new batch of paperwork that has accumulated overnight, includ- ing a 10-to-15-page news summary culled from various out-of-town news- Papers by Special Assistant Pat Buchanan. Nixon’s first formal meeting of the ee UPI Telephoto Among the members of Nixon's personal staff are Rose Mary Woods, his personal secretary, and his chief of staff, Robert Haldeman. Nixon’s mind operates in orderly channels, break- ing a problem into Points A, B and C and then Subpoints 1, 2 and 3.” day, generally with the cabinet, the National Security Council or the newly created Urban Affairs Council, starts as a rule at 10 AM. Nixon usually opens the meeting with some remarks, designed to set a tone. The subsequent discussion by his advisers adheres to an _ elaborately worked agenda. For instance, the agenda of the National Security Council, which meets twice a week on foreign prob- lems, is already planned for the next month, and the cabinet and urban council are also developing “forward agendas.” The key word in a Nixon policy meeting is “options.” In direct con- trast to President Eisenhower, Nixon insists on being confronted with all the possible solutions to a_ policy question, even those which his cabi- net members personally do not like. Before a question gets on the agenda, planning papers have to be produced listing the foreseeable consequences for each option plus the penalties if it should fail. Nixon enjoys hearing the merits of an issue debated—so long as the debate doesn’t run beyond the scheduled end of his meeting. He also is said to enjoy the final process of deciding among the options. A meeting of the National Security Council may result in 12 decisions or requests by the President. They are passed along to Richard Moose, National Security Council staff secre- tary, who keeps a list of them and checks them off when the mandate is carried out. Similarly, after every cabinet meet- ing John Whitaker, secretary to the cabinet, prepares an “action memo- randum” that sums up what the cabi- net has decided and what reports Nixon has called for. If a cabinet member is given 10 days to produce a study, Whitaker calls him up after about five days to see how it is pro- gressing. In case, God forbid, Whitaker should ever forget, Cole sends him a reminder before every cabinet meeting that a draft of the report is due at such and such an hour. IXON’S fascination with the decision-making pro- cess notwithstanding, he also tries to schedule some ceremonial public appearance each day that lets him shake hands with selected citizens. One day it’s to be photographed, along with his three dogs, beside Tracy Greenwood of Velma, Okla., the 1969 March of Dimes poster child. Another day he’s standing among the members of the U.S. Davis Cup team trying on the team tie. Or perhaps he is greeting 102 fresh-faced high school seniors who have won $1,000 scholarships, im- parting to them his philosophy about winning and losing. ‘I am an expert in both,” he tells them. “The im- portant thing is not whether you win or lose, but whether you play the game. You’re going to win some and you’re going to lose some. Better to fight and lose rather than not fight at all.” The students clap lustily February 15, 1969 (continued) when he finishes.

Montana, ah yes. Good rugged country... ere you from? Springfield? Oh, sure.” Corny? Oh, sure. But it is part of the job of being President, and Wall Street lawyer Richard M. Nixon doesn’t seem to object. Such occasions are announced in advance by the White House press office as “photo opportunities.” They are obviously opportunities for the President as well as the photographers, and Nixon knows it. He generally shaves again before these sessions. But unlike President Johnson, the new President does not permit cameramen, even his personal photographer, to snap pic- tures during business meetings in the White House. “It is disturbing to Mr. Nixon to have anyone prowling around during an important discussion,” says Ollie Atkins, the new White House photographer. One of Nixon’s first directives, issued through Haldeman, was to get rid of President Johnson’s expensive push-button retrieval sys- tem for filing thousands of negatives which White House still-photographer Yoichi Okamoto snapped of Johnson and his family. The machinery has been torn out of the wall of the White House photo lab in George- town and given to another govern- ment agency. Gone, too, is the man detachment of Navy cameramen which filmed a newsreel of President \f UPI Telephoto Johnson and his family every month. WNixon’s morning appointments end promptly at 12:30 PM, and within a half hour he walks back along the edge of the Rose Garden to the ele- vator, which takes him up to the fam- ily -floor for lunch. Usually it is a business discussion with some impor- tant staff member or cabinet officer, and usually the conference goes un- publicized. By 2 PM Nixon is back in his office and ready to begin his after- noon appointments. U'We try to do everything on time,” says Dwight Chapin, Nixon’s 28-year- old appointments secretary. ‘You could set your watch by our appoint- ment times.” Nixon has two standard varieties of appointments in his of- fice, 10-minute appointments and 20- minute appointments. He schedules formal appointments or meetings from 190 AM to 12:30 PM and from 2 to 5 PM, leaving exactly 20 minutes free during each hour. Sometimes coffee is served during a longer app: t- ment, but during a 10-minute session there is no time for pleasantries. Be- fore each visitor is ushered in, Nixon takes time to study a memo prepared b: . White House slaff member that is. designed to shortcut any needless talk. by delineating what the visitor has. on his mind. ‘By 3 PM Chapin has locked up the following day’s schedule.

Kissinger, with President in photo below, gives Nixon a daily 15-minute brief- ing. At right is Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments secretary. almost certain to see the President on Wednesday. ‘““Most governors would go through Vice President Agnew,” Chapin said. Unlike Johnson, the new President seems to have no love affair with the telephone. Johnson used to keep the White House operators busy placing perhaps 60 phone calls a day. So far, Nixon is averaging five or six a day. Under Haldeman’s protective eye, Nixon’s speaking dates and appear- ances are now being marked down for well into April, and advance schedules are circulated for planning purposes. As soon as a new itinerary crosses the desk of Special Assistant James Keogh, the ‘editor’ of Nixon’s speech-writing team, Keogh parcels out each speaking opportunity to one of his four writers. Keogh’s group foes to work to prepare suggested re- marks for every future appearance by Nixon without waiting for a request from the Oval Office. “We get the proce: tarted by feeding him some- thing and having him react to what we’ve suggested,” explained one speech writer. Nixon has not been de- livering many formal speeches so far, but the Keogh group has not lacked the .work. Part of its function has been writing “off-the-cuff” remarks for Nixon’s appearances at the 12 gov- ernment departments. And to turn out Nixon’s Jan. 31 message on crime in the District of Columbia, speech- writer Ray Price wrote all the pre- vious night and sent his draft to Nixon at 8 AM for final revisions. About six presidential assistants have standing permission to poke their heads into the Oval Office with- out an appointment when they have something important for the Presi- dent, according to Miss Woods. But when Nixon wants to do some. soli- tary thinking or writing, he retires to a small, green-carpeted working space, with a sofa and some easy chairs, that is just off the Oval Office. The staff has come to know Nixon’s desire for periods of “brainwork,”’ and after his door is shut, it would take a major calamity for anyone to interrupt. - HE President leaves his office and walks back to the family quarters at about 6:30 PM for dinner, usually with his wife, Patricia, and his daughter Tricia. ‘‘We’ve had din- ner together every night this week, which is a record in the history of our marriage,” said Mrs. Nixon recently. Sometimes the Nixons are joined at the dinner table by an old family friend, perhaps Bebe Rebozo from Key Biscayne or Hobart Lewis, exec- utive editor of the Reader’s Digest. Nixon’s tastes run from Mexican food to barbecued chicken to fresh fish to a good steak. “We’ve been telling the chef to surprise us,” said Mrs. Nixon. Lately, however, dinners have not been all in the family. Word has fil- tered onto Washington society pages of at least three working dinners at the White House, one for Rep. Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) and Rep. John February 15, 1969 (continued) AP Photo ©* ‘vou could set your wateh by our appointment Limes,” says Nixon aide Bivight Chapin.” Byrnes (R-Wis.) of the House Ways and Means ommittee, another for some high administration officials, and a third in honor of Manlio Brosio, secretary general of the North Atlan- tic Treaty Organization. Two davs after the inauguration, Nixon and his family watched a screening of “The Shoes of the Fish- erman” in the White House theater, but on almost every other evening he has gone off by himself after dinner to tackle a briefcase full of night reading. His evening hideout is the Lincoln Sitting Room, which was used as an office from the mid-19th Century till a renovation of the White House in 1902. Nixon has installed his favorite brown velveteen armchair and has taken to playing the music from old musical comedies on a rec- ord player while he works. “It’s just a comfortable feeling to have your own things around,” explained Miss Woods. By the time the President has watched the late TV news, read everything in his “must” folders and finished his dictation, it is generally after midnight—and he is finally ready to sleep. It has been a 17-hour day regulated by checklists, photo opportunities, agendas, dictation machines, options and briefing papers. Hardly the stuff boyhood dreams are made of, but the drama of the presidency can come later. “The first responsibility of leadership is to gain mastery over events,” Nixon said during the cam- paign, and that’s what his first 26 days have been all about. \f"

        "ocr_text": "Nixon Raises New NZ Suggests It Consider Social Involvement By Joseph Albright Chief Washington Correspondent Brussels—President Nixon invited the members of NATO today to con- sider whether their defensive alliance could cope with social problems such az water and air pollution and the congestion of the cities. Nixon arrived in Tngland from Belgium today for the second stop in his eight-day tour of five European nations. He landed at Heathrow Air- port at 11:50 AM (New York time): and was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Wilson and leaders of the Conservative opposition. In the first major statement during his jet-propelled circuit around Europe, Nixon told the council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that to “keep the alliance abreast of the times,” its members must ask themselves about some common in- ternal problems, The step appeared to be a surprising ground-breaker that few NATO officials expected, “We are all grappling,” Nixon said, “with problems of a modern environ- ment, which are the by-products of our advancing technologies—problems sth as the pollution of air and water, and the congestion in our cities. To- gether, we can dramatically advance our mastery of these.” ne President, who arrived here yes- terday on the first stop of his tour, also dwelled today on his oft-repeated promise that the U.S. will consult with the Aulantic allies before reaching major international policy decisions and before entering negotiations with the Soviet Union. “The chances for suecessful negotiations depend on unity,” he said. Then he added an element which he had not mentioned before: “I believe wé have a right to expect that consul- tation shall be a two-way street,” He appeared to be suggesting that the U.S, would not take kindly to unilateral back-door approaches to the Soviet Union by any members of the Atlantic alliance—presumably including France, He did not elaborate. Nixon used his speech to NATO, formed in 1949 as a counter to Soviet military aggressiveness, to make more explicit his intentions to begin talks with the Soviet . “In due course, and with proper preparation, we shall enter into negotiations with the Soviet Union on a wide range of issues,” he said. The eye-catcher in the speech, his idea of enlarging NATO’s scope to fight environmental problems, was evidently lifted from a chapter by Henry A. Kissiner, now Nixon’s na- tional security adviser, in a book en- titled “Agenda for the Nation.” In discussing, before he became Nixon’s adviser, how NATO could be modernized, Kissinger wrole: “All modern states face problems of bureaucratization, pollution, environ- mental control, urban growth. These problems know no national considera- tions. If the nations of the Atlantic work together on these issues—either through private or governmental channels or both—a new generation habituated to cooperative efforts could develop similar to that spawned in dif- ferent circumstances by the Marshall Plan.” Some NATO officials were privately skeptical about the idea of using the Atlantic alliance to combat water and air pollution. One NATO official said that the Scientific Committee of NATO had recently taken up the question of what to do about pollution of the North Sea by German factories be- cause the pollution had caused harm to Dutch coastline. Even so, the same official said he personally did not be- lieve the Atlantic alliance was the proper vehicle for discussing internal social problems. In general, NATO officials saw Nix- —Continued en Page 28 Feb AWA UPI Cablephoto or Nivan_at Rrouscela Airnor ruary 24, 1969 \fNixon Suggests NATO Social Involvement —Continued from Page 3 on’s pledge to consult with the allies before and during negotiations with the Soviet Union as the most important element of Nixon’s speech—even if he had said almost the same things before. For years there have been suspicions in Europe that some day an American president would make a deal with Moscow that would damage their in- terests, and Nixon’s statement was taken as a guarantee that this would not be done during his administration. In his speech the President quoted a passage from his principle campaign statement on NATO last October: “If our ideals of Atlantic interdependence are to mean anything in practice, it’s’ time we began lecturing our European partners less and listening to them more, What we. need is not more proclamations and declarations, but a Rees attention to what our allies However, some other parts of his NATO campaign speech were toned down or omitted. Today he called for a study of the nature of the Soviet threat. However, he did not—in public —couple this with a criticism of NATO for miscalculating the threat of Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia. Nor did he repeat his shserintie sunt U.S, troops in Germany are oorly equipped and that other NATO. partners have allowed their Contribu- tions to fall below prescribed levels. Missing also was his suggestion of last October that NATO coulg help build bridges between rich ang poor nations outside Europe. The Omission was not explained, but, significantly, Kissinger wrote last fall in “Agenda for the Nation” that any effort to yse NATO for “global burden - sharing might only produce stagnation.” The President's Air Force One jet touched down at Zaventein airport at 2:58 PM. Eastern time yesterday, ‘The arrival was only momentarily and slightly marred by shouts of a handful of extremist Communists chanting “Nixon go home.” Police carted away four of the demonstrators, of whom three were identified as pro-Chinese Communists. They had stationed themselves atop the nearby airport terminal. But there were far’ more cheers than boos for the President from the terminal roof, where 400 persons watched the ceremonies, A fey, hours before his arrival, an anti-Nixon _rally was held in downtown ‘Brussels, . but it was only a brief affair. Waiting for Nixon at the airport was the youthful-looking, handsome King Baudouin of the Belgians. The two, flanked -by Belgian dignitaries and members of . the presidential party, stood at attention under a pale half moon in the 43-degree chill of a clear winter night, while a military band played the anthems of both nations. As the President, smiling broadly, stepped down the ramp of his plane, an honor. guard of 80 military cadets snapped. their rifles to attention. From the airport, the President was whisked at a swift clip along a secret route toward the royal palace for his meeting with Premier Eyskens and Foreign Minister Harmel, along with the aides of both. Despite the secrecy of the route, clusters of people lined the broad boulevard to cheer Nixon. Waiting in the chill outside the palace were about 100 people, anxious to get a glimpse of the new American President. Some shouted “Vive Nixon!” as red-coated palace attend- ants opened the gates to admit the President’s party. The area was thick with police and security personnel of both countries. The President was escorted to the famed Venetian stairway, so-called be- cause of the paintings of scenes of Venice on the walls and the glittering Venetian glass chandelier. The President, the secretary of state. other aides and the two Belgian gov- ernment leaders and their assistants seated themselves around a mahogany and lemonwood table in an elegantly furnished salon, to plunge at once into the affairs that brought the President here on his all-for-business journey. The President left the palace at 11:40 PM, after spending nearly two hours in consultation with the Belgians. ° Nixon got lusty cheers from thou- sands of Belgians today in his first real public appearance of the European tour. Crowds lined the streets leading to Belgium’s monument to the un- known soldier as the President’s heavily protected motorcade drove up to the strains of the Star Spangled Banner, Many waved American flags. Nixon arrived 25 minutes late and was obviously pleased as he stepped from his car and went through a line of dig- nitaries to shake hands before a wreath-laying ceremony. President Will Move Brussels, Belgium—Even in his private discus- sions with NATO and Common Market leaders, President Nixon was reportedly reluctant today to bring up some of Europe’s gut problems, including bombs, butter and the latest blowup between France and Britain. that Nixon has decided not to raise the problem of President de Gaulle’s alleged proposal to the British which the French have now de- Market should he widened into Closew a.loose free-trade area and that NATO be scrapped in favor of Britain, West Germany and Italy. If another leader raises the question, Nixon is reportedly ready to respond that in the U.S. view, such a proposal is not Market. But U.S. sources said they doubted that the Franch-British fracas would be raised by anyone in Nixon’s meetings today with NATO and Common question might be aired in private later this week in some of his meetings with European heads of state. The problem with butter is that the six Common of this year, the Common Market is projected to have a.crushing surplus of 300,000 tons of butter. Un-~ happily for Nixon, that situation hits America right Sources in the American traveling delegation say nied making, that the Common an inner political directorate consisting of France, the right way to get Britain into the Common Market leaders. ‘he sources said, however, that the Market countries produce too much of it. By the end below the farm belt. The reason is that Common Market leaders are about to take up a recent proposal by Sicco L. Mansholt, the leading agricultural official in the Common Market organization, to impose a heavy internal tax designed to raise the price of margarine to the point where Europeans would eat more butter and less margarine. American farmers now sel] about $450,000,000-a- year worth of soy beans to Common Market countries and it is principally used to make margarine. U.S. sources said early today that Nixon was somewhat reluctant to raise the butter isgue because the Euro- peans are equally upset about American suggestions that domestic cotton textile products need more pro- tection. “Our skirts are not entirely clean on trade,” one U.S. source said. The problem of bombs surfaced four days ago when British Defense Minister Denis Healey called on the U.S. to reaffirm its ggmmitment to defend Europe with nuclear weapons. Ffealey’s remarks were the latest reaffirmation of misgivings among some NATO allies about the strapegy of “flexible re- sponse”, a doctrine originated py the Kennedy ad- ministration which called for g buildup of conven- tional forces so that a Soviet attack.in Europe could be countered without escalating to nuclear war. Nixon was described by official sources as being unready to get into detailed discussions about NATO force levels or strategy concepts pending yesults of a strategy review now underway. If askeq. however, Nixon was said to be prepared to reaffirm America’s long- standing commitment to use nuclear weapons to de- achieving a significant relaxation of tensions.” ‘cautiously Photos on Pages 10-11; Editorial, Page 1B There was no firm information on whether Nixon intended to take up the thorny question of whether NATO should end its official ‘period of mourning” following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Last May, NATO adopted a policy toward eastern Europe which U.S. Ambassador to NATO Harlan Cleveland has described as “defense cum dentente.”” Under that policy NATO hoped to move beyond a “static”? mili- tary grouping to an “active” stance in which NATO would work toward mutual troop withdrawals from Burope by NATO and the Warsaw Pact. However, Czechoslovakia put the idea of “defense cum detente” in a deep freeze and from all indications early today, Nixon is not ready to thaw it out. In fact there is considerable uncertainty over whether the U.S. will ever go back to a “‘defense cum detente” concept tor NATO. Henry A. Kissinger,’ WNixon’s influential national security adviser, cast doubt on the whole idea last fall before his appoint- ment. In the book “Agenda for the Nation,” he wrote, «| . turning NATO into an instrument for detente might reduce its security achieving a significant contributions without relaxation of tensions.” —Albright February 24, 1969 (continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "The Right Begins to Thin By Joseph Albright Chief Washington Correspondent Washington—President Nixon is not hitting it off well with many conservatives and organization Re- publicans who used to know in their heart he was right but now aren’t so sure. Among Democrats and liberal Republicans, Nixon has earned a surprising measure of respect during his first seven weeks as President. But it does not take a sensitive seismograph to measure the rumblings to his right. Consider what several conservatives have said: e@ Rep. John M. Ashbrook (R-Ohio), the young and articulate chairman of the American Conserva- tive Union: “The average conservative is upset about President Nixon’s failure, so far, to clean out the State Department ... We have a right to expect better performance from a man we elected ... He needs the people whom he is alienating right now, because the liberals won’t be with him in 1970 and 1972.” e@ James D. Martin, the Republican National Committeeman from Alabama: “I understand George Wallace has just mailed out over a million letters asking for money for 1972 and telling people he was right after all, that there wasn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two other candidates. I don’t happen to agree with him, but I must say Nixon could have headed this off if he had taken more stands that demonstrated there was a difference.” The White House clearly knows where the hornets are buzzing. “We've got a problem with the conserva- tives—a serious problem,” conceded one administra- tion official who has been identified as a conservative thinker. Asked what Nixon would do about the problem, the official said: “You will see things hap- pening in the future which the conservatives and ixon Isn't traditional Republicans will have good reason to applaud. There is an intention to improve our rela- tions with conservatives where they have deterior- ated.” One measure of Nixon’s problem on the right flank turned up in a recent Lou Harris Poll. Of those who voted for Nixon, 88 per cent interviewed before Jan. 20 predicted that he would do a “good” or “excellent” job; five weeks later, the figure dropped to 75 per cent. Among Wallace voters, 59 per cent thought that Nixon would do a good or excellent job as of Jan. 20, but the percentage fell to 44 after five weeks of the Nixon administration. On the other hand, in the same period Nixon moved from 44 to 46 per cent approval among Humphrey voters. e@ A source close to Sen. Paul J. Fannin (R- Ariz.): “What bothers Fannin somewhat is that when it comes to appointments the administration is con- —Continued on Page 30 The Right Begins to Think Nixon Isn’t —Continued from Page 3 centrating on the liberals who didn’t turn a hand to help him last year. He was not particularly pleased when they brought James Farmer in with a big hoorah, and then when someone like Warren Nutter gets appointed, they try to hide him in the closet. It wasn’t the James Farmers who elected Nixon and worked for him.” So far the conservative powers in the Republican Party are not going out of their way to criticize Nixon. True, the “Republican Battle Line” a conser- vative newsletter, headlined its latest issue “Mr. Nixon, So Far, Disappoints.” But, just last night, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R- Ariz.) went to bat for Nixon with fellow conserva- tives, telling them that “too many Republicans are complaining when they should be applauding.” Addressing a National Young Republicans’ Leader- ship School, Goldwater urged critics of the new Presi- dent to be patient. “I wish I could tell you that every objectionable official of the Johnson administration is gone,” Goldwater said. “He is not. But we know where they are.” And Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), who has said nothing critical of Nixon, volunteered that the President’s trip to Europe had “inspired the nation with feelings of pride and of hope.” A trusted Thur- mond ally said yesterday, “The senator is not entirely pleased, but neither is he entirely discouraged.” ‘Those Republicans who do criticize Nixon preface their xemarks with expressions of hope and confidence that in the long run Nixon won’t let them down. But, as Rep. William L. Dickinson (R-Ala.) put it, “If at the end of four years this administration has made no substantial difference, it will wipe out the Republican Party in Alabama. I won’t have a damn reason for being a Republican.” : Part of Nixon’s problem in recapturing those on the right that he has lost will be the multiplicity of small gripes that have accumulated in the weeks Nixon has been making points with the center and left. Such as: In January, Thurmond sent a telegram to Nixon on behalf of a textile mill in South Carolina, and the request was leaked, apparently by a holdover Democrat who wanted to embarrass Thurmond and Nixon. Such as: Secretary of Labor Shultz named five Democrats and one Republican as his top six assis- tants. When three regular Republicans on the Senate Labor Committee demanded why they weren’t con- sulted in- advance, Shultz replied that he had checked out the appointments with Sen. Jacob Javits (R- N.Y.), ranking Republican on the committee. But Javits never has been known as a staunch Nixon man. Such as: Gene Taylor, the Republican National Com- mitteeman from Missouri, received 15 or 20 phone calls yesterday, plus a stack of mail, on the adminis- tration’s decision to remove the Post Office Depart- ment from politics. “There is nothing I can do,” Taylor lamented. Nixon has been doing a good job as President nationally, Taylor said, but most Republi- cans in his organization are “disenchanted and dis- gruntled” by the post office decision. In the South and in some Border States, the most burning issue is how the Nixon administration will apply the federal school desegregation guidelines in school districts which have adopted “freedom of choice” plans. A South Carolina Republican politician put it bluntly: “Nixon made a commitment during the campaign in a TV broadcast from Charlotte, N.C., in favor of freedom of choice. Unfortunately, Secretary (of Health, Education and Welfare) Finch has not backed this up.” In fact, Finch has not mada it clear whether or not freedom of choice plans will be acceptable. But to many southern Republicans. Finch’s decision to appoint James Farmey a Negro’ who once headed the Congress of RaciaF! Equality and New York Education Commissioner James E. Allen, a proponent of busing, to high jobs in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare pro vided a definitive litmus test on the administration intention on desegregation enforcement. ee Among Republican pros, patronage is Nixon’ other gut problem. The common complaint is thag more liberals and Democrats have found themselveg in good jobs than conservatives and old-line Republ cans. Among the high appointments that many con’ servatives haven’s liked: Henry A. Kissinger, a Rocke, feller man from Harvard, as White House nationa security ‘adviser; Daniel P. Moynihan, a Kennedy’ Democrat, as White House urban affairs expert; and Allen and Farmer. i At the same time, the Nixon administration has moved too slowly, according to many conservatives, in replacing Democratic holdovers in the second- and third-echelon jobs throughout the administration. The chief conservative symbols in the administration so far are Richard Kleindienst, a Goldwater braintruste: who is deputy attorney general; Harry Dent, a Thu mond ally now on the White House staff, and C Warren Nutter, a Goldwater adviser who is assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. As one national Republican official put it, “The fact that there is a Harry Dent somewhere and g Kleit- dienst somewhere and now a Warren Nutter some- where is not enough for many Republicans.” March 14, 1969 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Whatever Happened to Security Gap: by Joseph Albright Chief Washington Correspondent Washington—Tucked in the 20th paragraph of President Nixon’s anti-ballistic missile announcement yesterday was the casual disclosure that the President had ruled out any increase in the number of Ameri- can offensive missiles and bombers, “T have ruled out this course,” Nixon said, “be: cause it provides only marginal improvement of our deterrent, while it could be misinterpreted by the Soviets as an attempt to threaten their deterrent, It would therefore stimulate the arms race.” The words apparently signaled a sharp reversal in the President's thinking since he gave his widely publicized “Security Gap” speech last Oct, 24, In the speech, Nixon lamented that the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had allowed America’s edge in missiles and bombers to slip to the point where. America was threatened with being second best to the Soviet Union, Nixon said the Democrats had made a “crave misjudgment” when they decided that if the US. kept up a numerical superiority it would “dash our hopes for friendly relations and peace,” Nixon was not asked about the apparent demise of the Security Gap at his press conference yesterday because most reporters did not notice the key para- graph until later, When Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard was confronted with the question at a mid-aftemoon briefing, he replied: “We have a very adequate deterrent capability right now. We have a good, strong land-based missile force, We have a very capable Polaris system. We have a very capable manned bomber system. I think if we could have assurance that the Soviets would agree to something along the present level, this would provide a very stable situation.” Another reporter asked, “Where is the Security Gap, then, sit?” “L don’t know,” Packard replied. “I haven’t talked about that,” The late Security Gap of the 1968 campaign was the orphan son of the Missile Gap, a specter which John F. Kennedy raised during his 1960 campaign against Nixon, A few days after Kennedy's inaugure tion, Defense Secretary McNamara declared on the basis of new studies that the missile gap would not exist alter all. Nixon began deflating the idea of his Security Gap at an earlier press conference when he said his ad- ministration would settle for “sufficiency” instead of “superiority” in nuclear weaponry, Until yesterday, he had not announced that the exiting offensive arsenal was sufficient for the time being, It now consists of 1,054 land-based interconti- nental ballistic missiles; 656 Polaris missiles based in submarines, and 646 manned bombers, The Soviet Union has about 720 land-based intercontinental ballistic missles; a Polan-type submarine. program under development, and more manned bombers than the U.S, has, March 15, 1969 \f"

Eisenhower’s widow, the girl he met at a dinner- dance when he was a lieutenant in 1915, will ride in a Union Station at-about dusk tonight and travel west- ward at about 50 MPH. Family members, honorary pallbearers and a few invited guests will travel in Pullman cars and take their meals in a dining car. Another train will pass along the same route just - ahead to clear the tracks of spectators. At the widow’s request, the route was not formally announced, apparently in an effort to prevent huge crowds from lining the tracks as they did last June when the body of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was being transported from New York to Washington. Two on- lookers were killed by a train going in the opposite direction as they waited for a look at the Kennedy “train, military officials noted. Nevertheless, the route was leaked to the press by railroad officials, and —Continued on Page 28 Pullman car.

The casket will ride just be- hind the locomotives in a separate car, which is blue on the outside and shrouded with crepe on the inside. The casket will be lowered into the ground at about noon Wednesday at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kan., where Eisenhower milked cows and Played football as a boy.

Color guards from Xavier and Cincinnati Univer- Sities, as well as the mayor, the governor and local veterans organizations are planning a lengthy cere- mony at the railroad terminal. Leaving Cincinnati, the train switches from the tracks of the Chesapeake and, Ohio Railroad and onto a Baltimore and Ohio roadbed. Soon a landmark will appear off to the left: A squat obelisk atop a high hill in North Bend, Ohio, marking the tomb of President William Henry Harrison. There will be a 10-minute stop for a crew change at Washington, Ind., time enough for a memorial Service led by a color guard from the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. _At about 4 PM, the train is due to roll across the mile-long Eads Bridge spanning the Mississippi River. It will rest in St. Louis for an hour-and-a-half, but local police said that the public would not be 300-foot tall World War I memorial which was rededi- cated to world peace a few years ago ina ceremony that Eisenhower attended. : The train then follows the muddy Kansas River allowed inside the: train shed where maintenance crews will service the cars. _ As dusk approaches, the flat Midwestern corn- fields will give way to rolling hills and patches of woods, dotted with pig farms and sorghum fields. After dark, the train will reach Kansas City and the westward through the country Truman Capote wrote about in his book, “In Cold Blood.” About midnight, barring delays along the route, the train should reach Abilene, which is set in the wide, grassy Flint Hills section of central Kansas. Eisenhower has called Abi- lene a “community of God-fearing, hard-working, simple people,” but it was also the town where Mar- shal Wild Bill Hickock subdued thirsty cowboys in the days when Abilene was the end of the Chisholm Trail. The bodies of at least three former Presidents, Lincoln in 1865, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945 and Herbert Hoover in 1964, were carried on funeral trains. Lincoln’s funeral procession from Washington to Springfield, Ill, wound a circuitous route that lasted 12 days. The Eisenhower train ride, by con- trast, will take about 30 hours. Eisenhower’s body will be buried Wednesday in a sunken crypt inside a tiny limestone chapel about 100 yards from the the Eisenhower Library on the south- east side of Abilene. Beside his grave will be that of his first son, Dwight Doud Eisenhower, who died in 1920 at the age of three of scarlet fever. And here also, eventually, will Mrs. Mamie Eisenhower be buried. Inscribed on a wooden tablet over the crypt is the prayer Eisenhower composed and delivered in his first Inaugural message in 1953: “Give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong and allow all our words and actions to be governed hereby and by the laws of this land. Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station, race, or calling.” Newsday Map by Joe DeSantis Map Shows Cities Through Which the Eisenhower Funeral Train Will Pass En Route to Abilene March 31, 1969 \f"

        "ocr_text": "US, Plans to Deploy Multi-Head Missiles By Joseph Albright Chief Washington Correspondent Washington—A $10-billion Pentagon system for increasing the power of U.S. offensive missiles by providing multiple warheads, conceived in 1961 on the basis of overly gloomy intelligence re- ports, is now on the verge of being deployed, even though outside weapons experts are calling it a potential stimu- Jant to the Hast-West nuclear arms spiral. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe at Russian researchers are hard at work developing a simi- scientific quarters, however, is that uissian technology is a year or two nehind that of the U.S. The American system goes by the ame of MIRV, a pleasant-sounding nit of military jargon that stands for ultiple Independently Targeted Re- try Vehicles, In simplest terms, it eans that a U.S, offensive missile can op bombs on three or more targets nstead of just one, A more elegant de- iption was offered by Dr, John §, ‘ster, the Pentagon’s research chief “Let's just call it the space bus, be- ause the payload isa space bus which ontains many individual re-entry chicles with thermonuclear warheads, {ter the main booster has cut off, the keeps making minute adjustments its speed and direction, and after each adjustment, it ejects another war head. Thus, each warhead is delivered on a trajectory to a different city, or if desired, all can be delivered within one city.” Despite its $10 billion-plus price tag, MIRV has come under relatively little scrutiny from the liberals in Congress and on the campuses who have re- cently been mobilizing to block the de- ployment of President Nixon's safe- guard ABM system, The main reason seems to be a sober political judgment, “MIRV may be scarier than ABM as a weapon,” an aide to Sen, Edward M. Kennedy said, “but you hate to divert the attention of the country away from the ABM issue just when people are beginning to understand it.” One of Kennedy's chief scientific witnesses against the ABM, Prof, George Rathjens of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was equally pragmatic, “There is no chance that we can get Congress to halt MIRV unilaterally,” he said yesterday. “But there is an even chance of getting Con- gress to halt the ABM, The way to halt MIRV, hopefully, is through nego- tiations with the Russians,” Already, though, there have been about half a dozen flight tests of MIRV-equipped missiles from Cape Kennedy, Fla, and the initial tests were by some sources to have gone . relatively well, The U.S, Polaris sub- marine James Madison is undergoing an $81,000,000 enlargement of her 16 firing tubes to make her the first sub to carry a load of operational MIRV missiles, And if the current deploy- ment schedule holds, 30 more of the 41 Polaris submarines will be refitted with MIRV missiles by 1975, The cost of refitting the firing tubes and of purchasing the new MIRV missiles, called Poseidons, will run about $7 billion including research and devel- opment, according to a 1967 estimate, That would make the Poseidon pro- gram as expensive as President Nixon's much-publicized modified ABM. sys- tem, The Air Force is also buying MIRV to multiply the destructive power of some of its land-based missiles, Just how many of the 1,000 Minutemen will be MIRVed is a military secret, but former Defense Secretary Clifford has called it “a large number.” The Minuteman with a MIRV, which is known as Minuteman III, has cost $1.2 billion so far, and another billion is budgeted for the next fiscal year. The deployment schedule has been laid out through 1974, with even heavier spend- ing reserved for the later years, The Minuteman II], which then Defense . Secretary McNamara termed “as far ad- vanced over the Minuteman J as the B-52 is over the B-17,” is designed to carry three highly accurate small-yield warheads in its space bus. By contrast, the Poseidon can reportedly carry up to 10 warheads, but with somewhat less accuracy. Outside Congress, what worries many defense and disarmament ex -perts is ‘the prospect that both Russia and the U.S. will deploy a lethal com- bination of ABM systems and large, accurate MIRV forces. If that hap- pens, both sides might be tempted to strike first sometime in the 1970s, cal- culating finally that the other side’s missile force could be eradicated with one preemptive blow that would pre- vent any serious counter strikes. “The rationale. for this is simple enough,” wrote William C. Foster, the Johnson administration’s chief dis- armament negotiator, in a recently published magazine article, “Suppose, for example, that a large portion of each side’s ICBM had, let us say, five MIRV warheads in each missile, Then the side which strikes first could hope, at least in theory,.to destroy up to 25 enemy warheads (in five enemy mis- siles) with each of its attacking mis- siles. Clearly this could be viewed as a reason for wishing to strike first.” _ Although the Pentagon did: not in- vent MIRV to gain a capacity to make a preemptive first strike, some experts contend that the Soviets might not act accordingly, As Carl Kaysen, a former member of President Kennedy’s White House staff put it yesterday, “The Sovs might get really nervous if they saw us with a lot of MIRVs,” particularly be- cause the U.S, has a large Polaris fleet nd Russia so far doesn’t, At least two counter-arguments have been made in the Pentagon. First, Russia might well have gone ahead with developing MIRV even if the U.S..re- frained from its development, Second, 0 quote McNamara, a defense planner nust be “conservative” in his calcula- ons, preparing for the worst plausible possibility and not just what is prob- able. It las been learned that: McNa- mara’s decision to deploy the Poseidon as based on an intelligence projection. own as the “high NIPP,” which is he highest of several projections of what Russia would do by. 1976 as con- ained in the. “national intelligence —Continued from Page 10 projection for planning.” One of the little-known facets of the MIRV story is how the system kept on developing for five years after its ori- ginal justification had vanished. The reason is that new justifications came along just as the other ones seemed to peter out, Back in 1961, the CIA and its brother intelligence agencies began getting evidence through spy satellites and other means that Russia was be- ginning to deploy an ABM system around Leningrad. In short order, the Pentagon’s advanced research projects agency began working on what came to be known as Project Defender, a hush- hush program to devise methods of penetrating the Leningrad ABM mis- sile shield. According to one high Ken- nedy administration official, a chief conclusion of the Project Defender re- search was that multiple warheads con- stituted one of the best devices for penetrating the system. At about the same time, others in the Pentagon added the concept of targeting the multiple warheads independently. At least one of the reasons was to make it possible to hit more targets at less cost, since the expense of building more mis- sile launchers could be avoided. Within a few years, later intelligence showed that the Soviets stopped de- ploying the Leningrad ABM system apparently because it did not work. But research and development on the American MIRV did not stop. And by the mid-1960s, somewhat ambiguous in- telligence turned up indicating that the Soviets might be building an ABM sys- tem around Tallinn, a city in north- west Russia. At the time, Air Force intelligence seemed sure that it was an ABM system, but other intelligence agencies were quite dubious. In 1967, McNamara, deciding that he could not tule out the possibility that the Tallinn system was designed as an ABM net- work, ordered the deployment of the Poseidon system, thus getting the Navy version of MIRV off the drawing board. Talks with Russia aimed at limiting both offensive and defensive weapons, originally called for by President John- son in 1967, are now expected to begin this summer. How far they will progress toward a MIRV agreement before the Polaris submarine James Madison pulls out to sea next April is anyone’s guess. April 10, 1969 \f"

In another office downtown, a lawyer who never liked Fortas offered a different appraisal: “He was a quali- ty lawyer, with brilliant mental pro- cesses. J disagreed with some of his Supreme Court Opinions, but they were reasoned in a way that made good sense. The tragedy of Abe Fortas is that he was a wheeler-dealer in pri- vate practice, a result-achiever, and he somehow couldn’t stop being that when he got on the court.’” ‘There was one theory that Abe For- tas’ downfall was a deeply-rooted need to acquire and spend money.

Four months ago, if was where Lyndon Johnson went to his most in- timate farewell dinner before leaving for Texas. a Yesterday, this Georgetown mansion was where a Winnic’s sandwich truck sold hot dogs to the papparazzi gath- ered on the sidewalk to try to photo- graph the first man ever to resign in .disgrace from the Supreme Court of - the United States. For an instant, it appeared that the charming,. brilliant man at the center of this high tragedy might have wit- nessed the sad symbol of his downfall from the second-story window. Some- one on the sidewalk saw a figure in the window moving a violin bow, but soon the figure went away. Downtown, the friends and detrac- tors whom Fortas had accumulated by the dozen during his career of legal triumphs were worrying yesterday about what caused Abe Fortas to, walk head first into tragedy. From one of Fortas’ legal friends came this- explanation: “I think he is an absolutely brilliant lawyer who has upon occasion demonstrated incredibly bad political judgment about how the public will react to something.” The same observer said that Clark Clifford, who also had served Lyndon Johnson as a lawyer-ad- viser, always had “an inf initely better sense _of the public re- sponse.” According to Fortas’ friend, i the. reason” the as of its date. justice decided to accept a $20,000 fee from the Wolfson fund is traceable to two \\ basic beliefs that characterized his career as a private lawyer.

As _ the fifth child of a cabinetmaker from Memphis, Tenn., he put himself through Southwestern College and Yale Law School by playing the violin at dances and parties. After 12 years of experience as a hot-shot New Deal bureaucrat, Fortas made the switch to private practice in 1946 and over the next 20 years became a rich man. Besides his $250,000 house in George- town and its $25,000 domed swimming pool, he also owns an $80,000 retreat in Connecticut, overlooking Long Island Sound. Even so, the theory goes, Abe Fortas never thought he had enough of a nest egg. Yet, Fortas, more than many of his legal peers, was willing to forgo his stiff fees when he came upon a tough civil liberties case. It was Fortas. along with his partners Thurmond Arnold and Paul Porter, who fought the Army for months in 1949 until it agreed to exonerate -Samuel Wahrhraftig, a $7,000-a-year civilian employe who had. been summarily fired on disloy- alty charges. It was Fortas who per- suaded the Supreme Court in the land- mark Gideon vs. Wainwright case that an indigent defendant had a constifu- tional right to have a lawyer. For 30 years, Fortas served Johnsen as confidant and go-between. in 1965, against his better judgment, IJortas agreed to leave private practice and go to the Supreme Court because Johnson asked him to do it. Even then, how- ever, his role as a presidential adviser did not cease. So closely have the iwo men’s careers intertwined that J .hn- son’s historical reputation will inevit- ably be scarred by Fortas’ fall. As for Fortas’ future, nothing is known. “The body’s not even cold yet,” said a secretary at Arnold and Porter when someone tnquired if For- tas might be coming back to tre law firm. For his part, Fortas told one imterviewer yesterday that the Buda- pest String Quartet had offered him a job as second fiddle. May 16, 1969 \f"

And when Kennedy made his victory remarks in the Senate press gallery that day, he seemed to be forecasting a low-silhouette approach to his new duties. “It is an extremely time-consuming job,’”’ he said, “which will give me responsibilities in the Senate and keep me busy there.” After six months as whip, and after a year as the only male Kennedy old enough to run for office, Teddy has made one thing indisputably clear: he certainly has a funny style of lying low. Take Tuesday, May 20, for example. This was the day Kennedy picked out in advance for a reporter who wanted to follow along and observe the action. As things turned out it was a fine day for Kennedy-watching, a day on which Teddy was a dove on Vietnam, a battler against the oil lobby, an autograph signer, a defender of the Alaskan natives and a Senate functionary. It was, as Ken- nedy said later, ‘fa particularly active day,” al- though no more frenetic than some of his other days this spring. By the time Kennedy left his house in McLean, Va., at 8:30 that morning, it had already been quite a week. First there was his decision at 4:45 PM the previous Saturday to fly out to California that night to join Caesar Chavez at a rally in support of the Mexican-American grape strikers. On the jet, Kennedy and his administrative as- sistant, David Burke, had a couple of drinks and spun out some rhetoric in longhand for a speech to the grape-pickers. ‘‘To all of those who are comfortable,’”? they wrote, “who have just pushed away from a full dinner, whose children now sleep in air-conditioned homes—to all of those who believe the myths that all Americans are fat and healthy—I say, come with us and see the poor who work—come to see those you have forgotten, those who have been kept down. . .” The next day in Calexico, Calif., Kennedy stood up on the back of a flatbed truck and gave the speech from memory, finishing with a few words in Spanish: “Viva la causa.” It was rousing stuff, and the Mexican-American farm workers started a chant: ‘“<Kennedy in 772.” That was Sunday. On Monday he flew to Clark University in Worcester, Mass., to help dedicate a library in honor of Robert H. Goddard, who Jaunched the first liquid-fueled rocket. With the Apollo 10 spacecraft speeding toward the moon, and with Mrs. Goddard in the audience, it might : . . : -have seemed a good time to say a few words Kennedy, in the two photos above, listens attentively during praising the U.S. space program and then sit down. testimony at subcommittee hearing on oil import quotas. Instead, Kennedy stood up and said that the na- tion’s space program should be slowed down to divert money to fight poverty, hunger and pollution and provide more housing. “We need not try to get May 31, 1969 \fto Mars or Venus,” he said, “just because the Rus- sians might get there first.” And now it is Tuesday. A few minutes after 9 AM the heavy door of the Senate majority whip’s office swings inward and in steps Kennedy, his face pink from the sun and his voice a trace hoarse. After all you have heard about the man, the thing that surprises you right off is that his hair is going a little gray at the temples. After about 10 minutes in the whip’s office it is time to leave for his appointment, a meeting of administrative assistants and legislative assistants te the 57 Democratic senators. The meeting was EKenneds’s idea, part of his program for involving the assistants in the broad range of Senate business. What strikes you now is the voice—it is as though Teddy inherited his dead brothers’ vocal cords. “EF am—ah—sure that there—ah—will be some of you. ” he begins. ‘“‘Who—ah—have other re- sponsibilities this morning. IL want you—ah—to feei—ah—free to leave.” After a three-minute in- troductory talk, he introduces the first of four speakers and soon leaves himself. 10:20 AM. Next stop: a small, crowded hearing room in the new Senate Office Building, where the Senate antitrust and monopoly subcommittee is holding hearings on oil import quotas, the govern- ment’s program to restrict the importation of for- eign oil. li is a subject Kennedy knows well, if eniy because it raises the cost of gasoline in Mas- sachusetts. He has issued six press releases on the subject in the last six months. ‘It’s outrageous,” Kennedy says of the program as he moves down the corridor toward the hearing. Haroid M. McClure, president of the Indepen- dent Petroleum Association of America, is on the witness stand, arguing with the help of elaborate eharts that the unrestricted importation of cheap foreign crude oil would force up to 75 per cent of American oil wells out of production. Sitting be- hind Kennedy in the hearing room are two young, former Justice Department lawyers, James Flug and Silas Wasserstrom, who work for Kennedy on the staff of his own subcommittee on administra- tive practice and procedure. The night before, Flug had talked to Kennedy on the phone about today’s hearing, and Wasserstrom had worked up a list of suggested questions for the witnesses. The reason becomes obvious about 10 minutes inte McClure’s presentation, Pointing to a chart on American oil reserves, Kennedy interjects four questions on whether Alaskan and Canadian oil deposits are included in McClure’s figures. Once, when the answers seem evasive, Kennedy gibes, “Just answer the question—are they included?” HEN comes another series of questions in which Kennedy seeks to find out what percentage of the oil used in Vietnam comes from the Middle East, and wheth- er the oil shipments from the Middle East to Vietnam were interrupted during the Arab- Israeli war. The three oil company witnesses, who had been defending the oil quotas as essential to the national security, have to say they don’t have the answers. “ET am interested in your viewpoint,” Kennedy says acidily, “since you and the other gentlemen have been talking about national security with such ease and understanding.” Kennedy, seemingly at ease in his role as cross- ed 3 Tite tee Observed by one of the two women walking at right, Kennedy and aide Wayne Owens pass through Capitol on the way to the Sen- ate chamber, where Kennedy delivered an attack on U.S. military policy in Vietnam. Wear the end of his day, Kennedy returns to his office. examiner, tries another thrust. What the consumers have seen under the oil import program, says Kennedy, is a decline in the world market price of oil and ‘‘a doubling of their costs.” McClure cuts in: What did the senator mean by a “doubling of the consumers’ costs”? By his figures, McClure says, the consumer’s cost had gone down. OR this moment, Kennedy is over his head on the figures. He pauses a few seconds, then begins ‘“‘Well, the cost as I under- stand .. .’’ Then he turns for help to the subcommittee’s chief economist, Dr. John M. Blair. ‘‘Let me just have Mr. Blair give the cost to the consumer,’’ says Kennedy. “Go ahead.” Blair says, “‘I think what Sen. Kennedy is refer- ring to is simply the fact that as a result of increased use of oil in this country, the excess cost to the consumer has risen from around $3 billion to over $7 billion.” Kennedy. nods and keeps on questioning, taking no notice of his tiny, but perceptible, fluff. 11:33 AM. Dave Burke, Kennedy’s administra- tive assistant, enters the hearing room through a back door and whispers something to the senator. After a few minutes, Kennedy slips out the back entrance and into a committee anteroom to look over a five-paragraph speech Burke has written in the last two hours. Kennedy had decided to give the speech early this morning, after reading the morning’s newspapers. He and Burke talked it over for a few minutes on the way to the oil hearing. Now it takes Kennedy about five minutes in the anteroom to make a few minor changes in Burke’s text. And soon he is off for the Capitol, two blocks away. Kennedy moves out like a Tennessee walking horse, and aides Wayne Owens and Dave Burke have to hurry to keep up. Crossing Constitution Avenue, Kennedy breaks into a run to beat a bus. If his bad back is hurting from his plane crash in 1964, it doesn’t show. Burke says of the speech, “Ti’s about Vietnam. We will be getting some flalkc from it this afternoon.” Kennedy’s speech to the Senate takes about five minutes, coming just after a bill for the relief of Mrs. Irene Queja and just before a message from the House about the New Hampshire-Vermont in-. terstate school compact. It is delivered quietly, without oratorical flourishes. “President Nixon has told us, without question, that we seek no military victory, that we seek only peace,” said Kennedy. “How then can we justify sending our boys against a hill a dozen times or more, until soldiers themselves question the madness of the action? ...TI feel it is both senseless and irresponsible to continue to send our young men to their deaths to capture hills and positions that have no relation to ending this con- flict . . . The assault on Hamburger Hill is only symptomatic of a mentality and a policy that re- quires immediate attention. American boys are too valuable to be sacrificed for a false sense of military pride.” Sen. Hugh Scott (R-Pa.), an able debater and the Senate minority whip, rises to answer. Scott says he will not try to second-guess the President. He goes on to tell about the Battle of Gettysburg: “Tf those hills had not been fought for with the blood of American soldiers, then the entire out- _come of that war might have been different.” Asking Scott to yield the floor, Kennedy inter- jects: ‘Does the senator see any distinction be- tween the battles for hills that our troops fought for at the time of the Revolution and during World War I and II, and their importance in achieving our total national objective of military victory, and the objective as stated by the President in which he indicated that a military solution is not the objec- tive of our national policy at the present time?” The ball goes back and forth between them a few more times, all without Scott or Kennedy raising his voice. The “flak” that Burke had pre- —Continued on Page 29W May 31, 1969 (continued) \fray inucd From Page 7W does not stop when Scott sits down.

On Sunday, Defense Secre- ery Laird adds, “We shouldn’t try to second- gu our commanders after an action has iaken place.’ On Monday, one Democratic and two Re- publican senators join the criticism of Kennedy, and the Whiie House holds a background briefing to explaim the casualty figures. Kennedy aides, mneanwhile, say his mail is running 60 per ceni in favor of his position to 40 against. 12:25 PM. Kennedy walks out of the Senate chamber and down an ornate hall to the regular- ly seheduled meeting of the Democratic Confer- ence, which consists of the 57 Democratic senators. As assistant majority leader, Kennedy is one of the ranking senators in the room, but he defers to Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. The upshot of dhe one-hour closed meeting is unanimous endorse- meni of Mansfield’s proposal that the Democrat- je Pelicy Committee start taking up policy ques- tions, now that a Republican is in the White House. Most of the senators depart at 1:30, leaving Mansfield, Kennedy. and Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D- W.Va.) io explain the decision at a press confer- ence. Again, Mansfield does most of the talking. Hennedy could have pointed out that he called for ich a strengthening of the policy committee back February, right after he was elected whip. But he does not, and no one else thinks to bring it up. 1:50 PM. Kennedy looks at the index cards in his pocket to find the room number of his lunch- een appointment in the Rayburn House Office Building with a group of congressmen and former government officials interested in Africa. It was a 72:30 luncheon for about 20 people. When Kennedy arrives. only six are stil] in the room. 7 A steak is quickly produced for Kennedy, and he eats while Robert Good, the former U.S. ambas- sador to Zambia, finishes his talk about what is bothering Zambian-American relations. Kernedy wants to know more about Zambia’s desire to buy surface-ioe-air missiles, and about whether the gov- emment of Zambia is under pressure from its army. Kennedy, already laie for his 2:30 PM appoint- ment, somehow avoids seeming pressed for time. “Well? he asks, “do you want us to doe anything? I am glad io werk in any way we can.” One real problem. he is told. is that the Nixon admimistra- fien hasn't vet given enough aitention to problems ef Zambia. Kennedy offers to help the group get a meeting with Under Secretary of State Eliot Rich- ardson and then leaves ai 2:40 PM. 4:10 PM. The Senaie had been in session four s and 10 minutes, save for a one hour and 20 minutes lunch break. Kennedy had walked on and off the floor half a dozen times during the day, but all in all he had been on the floor for less than an heur. Phe whip is needed hen there is something io voie on, but today there is nothing. Instead, EHennedy has taken a courtesy visit in the whip’s office from a Mormon elder from Salt Lake City, has decided io turn down a request to reread his Hamburger Till speech in front of a TV camera, and then has spent a leng time on the telephone. tech NEVE IS AES UT now Kennedy is back on ithe floor ready to give a repori io the Senate on his recent trip to Alaska as chairman of the Senate subcommitiee on Indian edu- cation. The trip was noi Kennedy’s finest hevr. what with three Republican senators quitting the iour and denouncing ii as a publicity stunt. Today, Kennedy does not refer back to that but instead he offers a bill to com- at pollution in the Alaskan native villages. Severe health problems, he says, “are one of the Swnajor factors causing the extremely low educa- tie ¥ performance of native schoolchildren.” The ene cospo r who will serve Kennedy someene cr publicity stunt: Sen, Ted , a Republican. senato:: Karl Mundt (R-S.D.) and D-W Wa.) are on hand to listen, and y améywer. In the next day’s Cen- Kemmedy’s speech would sound fel ci sentences like, “It makes one angry to peer into a child’s ear and find no ear drum left at all except for a rim.” Actually, Kennedy read the first few paragraphs of his pre- pared speech in a flat monotone. Then, using a commion Senate shortcut, he handed the rest of the text to a clerk to be printed in the record. 4:16 PM. Kennedy performed one of his few duties of the day as whip: he moved that the Senate adjourn for the next three days. 4:30 PM. Kennedy is in his own office on the fourth floor of the old Senate Office Building. The room is lined with Kennedyana—a scale model of the carrier John F. Kennedy, inscribed pictures of Teddy with his older brothers, the presidential flag from President Kennedy’s office. On the wall near the door there is a framed letter which John Kennedy wrote when he was at Choate school. “Dear Moiher,” he wrote. “It is the night before exams so I will write you Wednesday. Lots of love. P.S. Can I be godfather to the baby?” The “baby,” who turned 37 this spring, is now giving a newspaper interview. His coat is off, but somehow he does not seem as relaxed and loose as he does while out before the public. Here is a sample: On his duties as whip: “I am not sure that the complete responsibilities of the job have yet been revealed. There has been a very thin legislative Pregram so far.’”” On his own political appeal: “I am very much aware of the fact that there are people in the country who had a very strong affection and re- spectful feeling toward both President Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. I feel particularly for the kinds of stands they took on matters of great imperiance and significance. That’s a very impor- iant and proud tradition which I feel hopefully can be lived up to in terms of personal involvement in publie affairs. It has its advantages and disadvan- tages. It has the advantage of having been closely associated with my brothers over a very important period of the development of my public life. It has the disadvantage of being constantly measured in terms of their own performance in matiers of weight and substance.’ On his plans for 1972: “The future will take care self. One factor we’ve always seen is that one 7% plan for events or the future. fT look forward to being involved in matters of great interest to me in the Senate, and I will try io be effective in ihe reordering of our national priorities.” His mother, Mrs. Rose Kennedy, solemn and deliberate about the whole feel he should zo on in _politic she interviewer late last year. “‘He is ambitious. wants to do what the other boys did.” Teddy Kennedy has about twe vears to decide whether to iry “what the other boys did’? in 1972. Already Herbert G. Klein, Nixon’s coerdinator of communications, has publicly dubbed Kennedy the May be less thing. “I told an He Of his plans for 1972, Kennedy says: May 31, 1969 (continued) -their not appearing, weepucweqdl Weethe thee Wileep Jikely Democratic candidate in 1972 and accused him of turning the ABM debate into a campaign jssue. Already the pundits are saying that Kennedy will have a hard time avoiding the 1972 nemina- tion, even if he wants to wait. We Teddy does decide io run, he will not be free of liabilities. For one thing. his mind does not always produce split-second, precisely articulated answers—something that could hurt him in a TV debate. He also has a tendency to trip ever his syntax. Here is one of Kennedy’s less memorable sentences of May 20, taken from the transcript of the oil imports hearing: “Well, then, Mr. Chairman, for those who have been inconvenienced by their travel, sbeuld we not make available io them, as you ‘have indicated today, the opportunity to appear here at a later time? If this is a Primary reason or the reason for that they would—that this committee would at least try and aecommodatie io the extent that the chair’s schedule permiis it or ether members of the committee setting alterna- tive dates sometime in the future to hear those representatives of the major industries, those pres- idenis or chairmen of the boards, that want to apnear, and to make whatever commenis they £0 jesire HEN there is always the skeleion in the closei—ihe fact that at 19, he was ex- pelled from Harvard because he got a elassmate to take a freshman Spanish examination for him. Kennedy, who made a public admission of the expulsion during his 1962 Senate campaign, returned to Harvard folowing Army service and won his degree ihere in 19856. Against his Habilities are arrayed some spectacu- lar assets, the greatest being the family name. As ene Democrat who is backing another candidate for °72 put it, “I don’t think George Washington could compete with the Kennedys on their own terms, namely charisma. Veddy has ihe  best- known, mest popular name in the Western Hemi- sphere.”? Yet somehow Teddy has not stirred as many anti-Kennedy passions as his brother Hobert. Aside from the name, Kennedy can already point to a creditable history in the Senaie, based ona lot of hard work. By 1972 he will have had a chance to cut a bold record as an opposition leader, using as a base his chairmanship of four Senate subcommittees. Finally, he has a sharp, eager staff, which he puis to good use, and access io seme big money. With all that, plus a glamorous wife whe wears silver miniskirts, it is no wonder that the Whiie House is treating Teddy as a threat in the mid- 1970s ranking right up there with the Soviet mis- sile system.

By Jcsenph Albright What man found on the moon Iast night was a surface layer cof fine par- ticles of a ‘‘grayish cocoa color,” Ht- tered by an unexpected wariety of rocks, including at least one that was purple. The variegated cbservations of As- tronauts Neil A. Armstrong and EFd- win E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. scemed to restore an element cf poetry and ro- mance to the moon after months of - prosaic predictions from space scien- tists at Houston about the grayness of _the lunar surface. Hiarocid Masursky, chief of the astro- geological branch of the U.S. Geo- graphical Survey, said today that the one “startling”? result of the moon walk was Aldrin’s discovery of a purple rock. \"VTheusands of closeup photc- graphs of the moon’s surface have been snapped by unmanned Surveyor probes, but last night was the first time any color besides gray and brown had been Ceiected on the moon. As Aldrin watked on the pock- marked lunar surface, he told his com- panion, ‘‘Neil, didn’t I say we might see some purple rock??? “Find some purple rock?’? Armstrong queried. “Yep,” Aldrin said. “Pretty, small, sparky fragments of purple rock. Take a first guess: some type of biotite.”” Biotite is a crystal, and Masursky said later that the presence of biotite would indicate that the moon was at one time volecanically active, something which many scientists have disputed. Aldrin, a trained geologist, appeared uncertain about the identity of some of the rocks he found. First, he described them as ‘“vesiculated,”?” which means that they were covered with small cavi- ties, such as caused by the expansion of vapor in molten lava. Later, he changed his mind and said that the small indentations appeared to be cra- ters caused by tiny meteorites. He said ...Pretty, smell, 2 that the roeks locked like basalt, 2 mineral found commonly on the earth. In Grand Rapids, Mich., Astrophysi- cist Ralph Baldwin said that the rock samples and photographs brought back to the earth by the astronauts could help settie the controversy over whether the moon and the earth had some cata- clysmic encounter some _ 700,000,000- years ago. Efe said that the television pictures made him suspect that tava was flowing om the moon several hundred -snillion wears more recently than that, thus casting doubt on the “cataclysmic” theory. Although the moon’s surface is made up of a layer of powdery particles, the astronauts found it so cohesive that their landing wehicle penetrated only about three inches. Their boots made footprints ome-eighth of an inch thick and Aldrin said that the blue color of his boots was completely covered by the greyish cocoa-browmn particles. But the surface strength evidently varied from place to place. When Arm- strong first began collecting recks, he pushed his sampling tool sr to eight inches into the surface with no trouble. But when Aldrenm tried to pound a cor- ing device into another spot, he noted, _“— hope youw’re watching how hard Tf have to hit this into the ground to the tume of five imches.”? At that point, Ai- Grin said, the particles were so cohesive thev almost seemed ‘‘wet.’ The closest thing to a simile came when Armstrong said, “It has a stark beauty all of its own. It’s Hike much of the high desert of the United States. Et’s different, but it’s very pretty out here.’? To earth men, the scene looked something Like a dried river bed cov- ered with horse tracks. 4 Although the astronauts found some traces of color, most of the moonmscane was variations of gray. “It’s very white, chalky gray as you look imto the zero Phase Hine and considerably dGarker gray—more like ashen gray—as you look out 9O degrees to the sun,” said Armstrong.

        "ocr_text": "Behind Gun Bill Vote: Lobbies, Public Opinion By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau : Washington—Rep. Clark MacGregor (R- Minn.), who sponsored a major loophole amend- ment in the administration’s gun control bill this week, is a moderate Republican, highly respected by his colleagues, from a high-income suburban district outside Minneapolis. And he hasn’t fired a gun in 10 years. In searching for an explanation of why he fought for two days to amend away the bill’s controls on _ shotgun shells and rifle bullets, it helps to know that a major employer in his district is the Federal Cartridge Crop., which Newsday Closeup manufactures both shotgun shells and-rifle bullets. And in trying to Jeam why Rep. Robert L. F. Sikes (R-FJa.) introduced an amendment which would exempt the National Rifle Association from some if not all provisions of the gun bill, it helps to know that until last year Sikes was a national direc- tor of the association. And in seeking the reasons why Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) sponsored a special exemption for gun collectors which the bill’s floor manager, Rep. Emanuel Celler (D-N.Y.), denounced as a “loophole as wide as the Grand Canyon,” it helps to know that Dingell is right now on the rifle association’s national board of directors. It is one thing to understand why a few con- gressmen had special interest in gutting the adminis- tration’s bill to end mail-order sales of rifles, shot- guns and ammunition. But figuring out why the full House of Representatives voted to accept the amendments is another question. Undoubtedly the main reason was that many rural voters consider it an intrusion in their lives by, the federal government. Last week their congress- men were faithfully representing their wishes. As Rep. Edward G. Biester Jr. (R-Pa.), explained, the need for gun controls “is basically. an urban problem.” Still, the votes on the amendments were close enough so that if all congressmen from urban states had voted with the administration, the amendments would have been killed. An analvsis of the vote shows that the amend- ments won strong throughout the South, West and Midwest, even in some urban constituencies. In the East, congressmen in rural areas of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New England often supported the MacGregor amendment. “, However, part of the responsibility for the loop- holes has to rest-with the bill’s backers and strate- gists. For one thing, the plan to keep pro-gun control congressmen on the floor proved ineffective during a series of crucial non-record votes. “I looked around the floor, and we just didn’t have our people there,” Corman said. Some congressmen believe, also, that the White House could have swung more weight than it did. ; ' Some observers said that the amendments might havebeen beaten if gun control advocates had made an issue out of the motives of Sikes Dingell and MacGregor. But MacGregor was not hesitant in talking with a reporter about Federal Cartridge, which employs about 2,000 persons and is the third- largest ammunition manufacturer in the country. “If he (a colleague who raised that point) was suggesting that I was fighting for some jobs of people in my district, then I agree,”” MacGregor said. William B. Horn, a Federal Cartridge vice presi- dent, said by telephone that his company had con- tacted MacGregor and some other congressmen after surveys showed that up to half of the company’s 38,000 dealers around the country would have gone out of the ammunition business rather than comply with the original administration bill’s record-keeping provisions.

The first public activity of the anti- Communist group was sponsoring a speech in Mobile in January, 1964, by Tom. Anderson, a Tennessee news- paper columnist who was then on the National Advisory Council of the John Birch Society. Giddens stood up and introduced Anderson, who launched into a fiery speech in which he cited an alleged Communist timetable for taking over the United States by 1973. _ No Reply A liberal official of Mobile’s League of Women Voters, Mrs. Robert Wood, wrote a letter to Giddens at the time * spelling out Anderson’s well-publicized Birch affiliation and calling on Gid- dens to resign from the organization. She said that she never got a reply from .-Giddens. Giddens said that he Wood, however. He also said that he did not know Anderson was a Bircher. Sul ibsequently, Mrs. Wood, who now | Miwes in Atlanta, put out under an as— sumed mame an 18-paze me graphed pamphlet entitled, ‘“The Feact_ ical Right in Mobile, 1964.” She listed Giddens in her 106-name “‘who’s who” of Mobile rightists as a member of the of the anti- Communist organization. , However, Mrs. Wood said that she had no docu- mentation for listing Giddens as a Bircher except that she thought he “followed the Birch line.” A careful turned up no other evidence that Giddens ever belonged to and Giddens has strongly denied it. Giddens’ anti-Communist group was : apparently rather benign compared to Giddens contributed to the campaigns ' Pr of both Wallace and Nixon: last tally Me : some other conservative  anti-Com- munist groups, since it sought to avoid controversial political issues. Giddens was born 60 years ago toa poor farming family in the tiny town of Pineapple Junction, Ala. After get- ting a college education and a degree in architecture Giddens lived on very little money until about 1939, when he got a federal contract to build govern- ment housing.-He used his profits to buy land and. build movie theaters, which proved a very lucrative invest- ment during World War II while he was in the Navy. His imterests have since multiplied . to a point where, according to his part- ner, Jay Altmayer, Giddens is worth about $10,000,000. Giddens has also taken time to visit 40 foreign countries and to perform various civic duties such as chairing a committee to port a property tax increase for Mo- Dile’s only charity hospital. ~ served on the board of the National Association of Broadcasters from 1962 to 1965 and on the board of the New Orleans branch of the Federal Reserve Bank from 1961 to 1967. One key to Giddens’ successes, cording to Altmayer, is that he is “ruthless in getting the job done.” It is a quality that may serve him well in Washington.

        "ocr_text": "J h Albright ° ° By eee eeD or gt au mY ad 67 Washington—lour vears ago, the Food and Drug Administration got word that sodium . nitrite, a food additive used to keep Nova Scotia lox pink and fresh, could trigger a by-product that gives cancer to rats. But the WDA has a Jot of worries and a limited amount of money. And so today, the 4,200%-man ageney js not. sure of whether anything should be done about sodium nitrite, extremely sophisticated chem- ical tests are necessary to determine whether minute quantities of the cancer-causing by-prod- uct are present in fish treated by sodium nitrite. And the tests are still incomplete after four years. Reflecting a pervasive feeling inside the FDA, Lessel L. Ramsey of the PDA’s Bureau of Science said that like many other projects, the sodium nitrite inquiry would have been wrapped up sooner, except that “we just didn't have Ohe resources to pul into it.” Onky one suientist was assigned to the investigation, he said. While sodium nitrite ia being tested, it re- mains on the FDA's list of safe food additives, Aside from its role in preserving Nova Scotia fox (which is the only smoked salmon that uses the preservative), sodium nitrite is approved for the curing of smoked shad, chub, and sablefish; for fixing the color of smoked tuna; and for curing meat, including hot dogs, which would be gray without sodium nitrite’s pink coloring. It also is sold directly to consumers for home curing of meat. Each use has its own approved dosage, varying from 10 to 600 parts per million, The FDA's worries, which have never bren communicated to the public, are not trivial. They originated in 1965 when LDA officials read in a British medical magazine that cattle, sheep and mink were poisoned in Norway when fed a fish protein concentrate manufactured from herrings treated with sodium nilrite, The finding came less than a year after the FDA bad granted “permission, in 1964, for the use of fodium nitrite in smoking salmon, shad and sablefish and in home weat-curing, “We were immediately concerened,” Ramsey recalled. Norwegian scientists investigating the poi- soning found that under certain conditions of temperature and acidity, the sodium nitrite would react with an organic chemical in the herring to produce an agent called DMNA (M- nitrosoimethylamine), suspected to be the deadly element. Other scientific  Hterature showed that in 2954 two British chemical workes handling DMNA had suffered sevecsliver damage, And in 1948, British scientists had fed small doses of DMNA to rats and found that it Rave them cancer of the liver, In later studics, 7 daily diet of as little as 50 parts per million of DMNA resulted in the death of a complefe set of test rats within a year. On the other hand, sodium nitrite itselt hee been fed to three generations of rats withot, causing cancer, Under the 1958 Delaney Amendment, the FDA was required to ban any trace of a food additive that caused cancer in experimental an- imals, There was no evidence, however, that sodium nitrite could produce DMNA except in the unusual circumstances present in one Nor- werian fishmeal factory where herring was made into a concentrate under high heat Tour sears AO, the existings test for TOIMININ, tsa smoked salon and other products came od negative. But the tests were’ tao crude to sativiv the FDA, and new, laborious techniques that ean detect as little as 10 parts of DMNA per billion have been developed. , Reo FE.

Washington Police Chief Jerry W. Wilson, cool to the point of being stone-faced, was walking on the sidewalk toward the red mist as two young girls trotted at his side chant- ing: “Pig! Pig! Pig!” Tt was 4:45 PM when Wilson's walkie-talkie crackled, apparently one of his commanders asking whether to deploy the helmeted reinforcements with their tear gas. “Not at this time, George,” Wilson answered. “Keep them on standby.” Another commander called, and Wilson said into the radio, “Not as of now, Roland. I’ll yell when I need you.” On Constitution Avenue, dozens of volunteer marshals from the New Mo- bilization Committee to End the War foot, four-inch-tall police chief got on his radio and gave a command: “I have given several orders to disperse from this area . . . Disperse the crowd by whatever means you consider necessary.” Then Wilson slowly unbuckled the in Vietnam were pleading with the crowd of young revolutionaries tovStop throwing things. But it was too late. Five minutes earlier, several youths had hauled down the American flag that hung outside Attorney General Mitchell’s office and substituted a Viet Cong flag. When a policeman put back the American flag, there was loud boo- ing from the crowd. And now bottles, oranges, apples and large rocks were sailing over the heads of the marshals and through the first-floor windows, At 4:50 PM, Wilson took a bullhorn and twice ordered the crowd to dis- perse or be arrested. The order was inaudible to some observers as close as 95 yards. The crowd did not disperse. About three minutes later, the six- khaki pouch strapped to the left side of his waist, removed a cylindrical tear gas canister, and lobbed it into the crowd. His men immediately followed suit, and the controversy was born. By yesterday evening, 24 hours later, there —Continued on Page 26 Newsday Photo by Alan Rala Shouting Protestors Demonstrate at Justice Department November 17, 1969 \f—Continued from Page 3 whole affair. “A couple of windows got broken, but it was a non-violent march,” Becker said in an interview. 'T think it was a lot of fun—just like a 88 being a Yippie, minimized the trick-or-treating.” SS From the vantage point of a team of Newsday reporters at the scene, none f those versions tells the full story. As ‘ar as can be learned, the New Mobili- zation Committee, which sponsored the huge rally at the Washington Monu- ment Saturday afternoon, had nothing to do with organizing the Justice De- partment protest. New Mobilization spokesman Ted Johnson said last night that a New Mobilization official, at one point, had tried unsuccessfully to talk the Yippie leaders into holding the Justice Department protest on Sunday instead of Saturday. But although some New Mobiliza- tion leaders anticipated and feared vio- lence at the Justice Department, the organization took no official action ahead of time to prevent it, except to detail some marshals to head off a ton Monument that the demonstration confrontation between demonstrators and police. There was no warning from the speaker’s platform at the Washing- at the Justice Department might t out badly. et In fact, many if not most of the COMPLIANCE, Four orders of a policeman 250,000 at the Washington Monument heard about the plan to march on the Justice Department for the first time when it was announced in a speech by New Mobilization Committee  co- chairman David Dellinger. Asked whey the committee had not acted to discourage participation in_jhe-demon- stration, Johnson said/“The /‘New Mobe has this policy of norrexclision.” The New Mobilizgtion Committtewis an umbrella orgayization, whose lead- ership takes in All peace groups that want to join, ffom the Quakers to the Communist Pfrty. Further tf the left of the New Mobilizatiod Committee is a collection of tiny, buf noisy, splinter groups who are bittefly contemptuous of the committe¢. One is the Yippie Party, which décided several weeks ago ic take advantage of the huge crowd in ~ Washington for a rally of its own. “We're! going to picket the “Injustice Department,’ pick it up and carry it away,’] predicted Yippie Abbie Hoff, man, gne of those on trial in Chicago The Justice Department was report¢¢ still at the same location after fie demogstration.

Those radicals came to Washington, perhaps 1,000 strong, even though they looked down on the New Mobiliza- tion’s candlelight “March Against Death” and its appeals to liberals. They gathered Friday night in DuPont ixcle, some with helmets and gas masks, chanting “Ho Ho ecker, hvho helped plan the Justice epartmepi rally, said yesterday that /at a aneeting in New York the Yippies nad goften promises from the en and the other fringe groups that there would be no violence. It did not’ turn out that way. : At 4:30 PM on Saturday, a dis- organized, fast-moving crowd of about 10,000 young demonstrators arrived at the Justice Department after a four block march from the Washington Monument grounds. It was led by the Yippies, shouting, “Stop the trial.” Be- hind them came other radical groups and many others who just came along to watch. The Vippies had a permit to march around three sides of the Justice De- block the crowd from access fourth side, which, accordjfg to Becker, the Yippie negotiay never asked permission to usé, Technically, the march became illegal at about 4:33 PM, when 4 large stream af marchers broke throvgh the restrain- ingNline of the NewMobilization mar- shals aiftd-kept-g6ing around the Justice Department, making a complete cir- cuit. The first window was broken ap- proximately 10 minutes later, and the first tear gas came 10 minutes after that. During those 20 minutes, the police were, for the most part, spectators while the marshals tried valiantly but vainly to scatter the demonstrators. Just be- fore the first burst of tear gas, with lines of Police and radicals facing each other and a line of marshals in between, a youth carying a Yippie placard came up to the end man in the line of mar- shals and asked, Do you need help?” The Marshal replied, “Man, we sure do.” The youth dropped his placard and linked his arm with the marshal P The first barrage of gas, at about 4:54 'M, scattered the demonstrators only for a few minutes, and at about 5:02, into 2 A 6 someone hauled down the American flag again, substituting the Viet Cong flag. One girl with long brown hair said, “Oh, that’s the greatest sight in the world” The American flag was then torn into pieces by souvenir hunters. As the tear gas spread, the radicals and onlookers rushed north and west, with the police pursuing their westerly course. As one marshal passed police- man J. H. Jones, he said: “Please, sir, you’ve got to understand. We fri stop it. It’s not us, it’s the ethers, just a few of them.” Jones nodded, and said softly, “I know, son. ¥ know.” The police origina}¥y planned to force the crowd eastw9fd, onto open grassy area known as the Mall, which \\ stretches from Capitol to the\\ Wash- ‘ington Monumeht. But police left a gap escape northward on a ny did just that, and the lowntown show windows as| they .\\A Justice Department officigl said yesterday that the police at that} point did not have enough manpower {o seal off the gap.

An after-effect of Saturday’s vio- lence came yesterday as radicals joined a protest by some Washington blacks at the site of a proposed bridge. Two young protesters, whose affiliation was not known, were seen punching two police Officers and wrestling away a nightstick. The two protesters were ar- tested. One was clubbed by a police- man, but not injured seriously, He was able to walk to a paddy wagon, At the scene of the Justice Depart- ment incident, there were scars on the old, grey stone building.

They included, according to Nixon, the “top three people in the government.” The President’s brother said that he was seated at the dinner next to Stylianos Pattakos, who is deputy premier and min- ister of the interior. Donald Nixon said that it was merely a “social iccasion” and that he discussed no politics, Asked how Pattakos impressed him, Donald Nixon told Newsday: “He impressed me as a good, solid individual—I say that without knowing what his politics are. He struck me as very kindly—he was a nice gentleman.” Pattakos, a brigadier general in the Greek Army, played a central role in the April, 1967, coup, in which he turned his tanks on the constitutional gov- ernment. Officially, the U.S. government still seeks the return of constitutional government to Greece but gael avoids saying how the Greeks should achieve Nixon’s host for the dinner was Thomas Pappas of Jonalo By Joseph Albright Newsday Washington Bureau Chief Washington—Restaurant executive F. Donald Nix- on, the President’s younger brother, got off on the right foot with his new employers this spring by signing up a juicy new account: Aristotle Onassis’ airline. The younger Nixon, scarcely three months on his mew job as vice president for community and industry relations of the Marriott Corp., spoke to Onassis for an hour in March. “I just made the pitch and he listened,”” Donald Nixon recalled in an interview with WNewsday. Onassis, accompanied by executives of Olympic Airways, met Nixon at the Greek airline’s Fifth Avenue headquarters in New York City. The Marriott Corp. has been trying to sell its inflight catering services to Onassis’ airline for two years, according to company president J. Willard Marriott Jr. Something Donald Nixon said must have clicked, because a tentative deal was struck at the New York meeting under which Marriott will provide on-board meals to Olympic passengers on Rome and London flights. The agreement was made final during Nixon’s subsequent trip to Athens during which he and another Marriott executive dined with top members of the Greek military junta. A top associate of Onassis who was at the New ork meeting, Costa Gratsos, said yesterday that Donald Nixon struck him as a “very, very nice person very agreeable and very knowledgeable.” He said Nixon Boston, who has set Up a vast business empire in Greece that includes oil refineries, a steel mill, a petrochemical plant and the Coca-Cola concession. Aside from being one’ of the strongest American boosters of the Greek military regime, Pappas wa: among the top fund-raisers for Richard M. Nixon in the 1960 and 1968 presidential campaigns. He is on the executive committee of the Republican Finance Committee, and Donald. Nixon calls him a “longtime friend of the Nixons” However, Pappas is not in- volved in the Marriott airline catering deal. Nonetheless, in a brief interview he gave in Athens to the newspaper Ethnos, Donald Nixon publicly identified Pappas as his host in Greece.

Donald Nixon said that it was merely a “social iccasion” and that he discussed no politics, Asked how Pattakos impressed him, Donald Nixon told Newsday: “He impressed me as a good, solid individual—I say that without knowing what his politics are. He struck me as very kindly—he was a nice gentleman.” Pattakos, a brigadier general in the Greek Army, played a central role in the April, 1967, coup, in which he turned his tanks on the constitutional gov- ernment.

Donald Nix- on, the President’s younger brother, got off on the right foot with his new employers this spring by signing up a juicy new account: Aristotle Onassis’ airline. The younger Nixon, scarcely three months on his mew job as vice president for community and industry relations of the Marriott Corp., spoke to Onassis for an hour in March. “I just made the pitch and he listened,”” Donald Nixon recalled in an interview with WNewsday. Onassis, accompanied by executives of Olympic Airways, met Nixon at the Greek airline’s Fifth Avenue headquarters in New York City. The Marriott Corp. has been trying to sell its inflight catering services to Onassis’ airline for two years, according to company president J. Willard Marriott Jr. Something Donald Nixon said must have clicked, because a tentative deal was struck at the New York meeting under which Marriott will provide on-board meals to Olympic passengers on Rome and London flights. The agreement was made final during Nixon’s subsequent trip to Athens during which he and another Marriott executive dined with top members of the Greek military junta. A top associate of Onassis who was at the New ork meeting, Costa Gratsos, said yesterday that Donald Nixon struck him as a “very, very nice person very agreeable and very knowledgeable.” He said Nixon Boston, who has set Up a vast business empire in Greece that includes oil refineries, a steel mill, a petrochemical plant and the Coca-Cola concession.

Handouts on the High Seas The U.S. government subsidizes the commercial shipping industry far beyond the needs of national security. This story, first of a series of three, details the Nixon administration’s proposal to increase these subsidies. By Joseph Alvbrightt Newsday Washington Bureau Chict Washington—A bloated commercial shipping in- dustry, once n ed as the fourth arm of our de- fense, is being kept afloat on a sca of government subsidies that is far costlier that any Defense Department requirement. The survival of $700,\n000,\n000 a year in direct and indircet subsidies stands as a monument to the po- litical clout of the merchant marine lobby, which is perhaps the slickest and strongest pressure group of of its size in Washington. Former Maritime Adminis- trator Nicholas Johnson, now despised in both marit?me union halls and board rooms, was scarcely exaggerating when he said in a Newsday interview They have succeeded in getting con- gressional authorization for a pipeline into Fort Knox from which they are ali sucking gold. With laws like that, you don’t need to be dishonest. The maritime industry and the flock of powerful pro-maritime congressmen dismiss Johnson as a sensation-monger and a kook, However, they have a more difficult time ignoring Sen. John J. Williams (R-Del.), ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. who told the Senate this spring J think that the existing law is far too lenient as far as the maritime industry is concerned and does not protect the in- terest of the taxpayers, Fortunately for the maritime lobby, Williams is retiring after this year, leaving behind virtually no strong public critic of maritime subsidies in any of- ficial position in Washington. A few high officials of the executive branch say privately that the pro. gram is a misuse of several hundred million dollars a year, but the dissent isnt uttered in public. As one official put it, F’ve got my job to think about. In a time when nearly all government spending programs are being crimped and President Nixon vetees education and hospital bills as inflationary, the administration has proposed to triple the number of ships that will be built with government subsidies during the next 10 years. Under the administration program the budget authority of the Maritime Ad- ministration would go up 60 per cent in the next fiscal vear. The full effect of the new program wouldn't be felt for a few years, but the Maritime Administration’s spending would rise four per cent in the next fiscal year and more sharply after that. Qn what basis did the Nixon administration de- cide to propose to increase maritime subsidies in- steack of cutting them? It waan’t national defense. A six-week inquiry by Newsdny hos established that Nixon was advised by his White House Working Group on Maritime Policy that the military requirements could be easily met if the government continued to subsidize 10 ships a vear instead of jumping to 30. And it wasn’1 an economic reason, since the President’s top advisers told him that there was no Pconemic rcason for subsidizing more ships. Actually, White House sources have conceded, the decisian to set maritime subsidies far above any military requirement was in large part a political recognition of the maritime bloc’s atrength in Con- gress. One key Nixon man frankly acknowleged in an interview Tf we came in with a small program, we knew we were foing to get rolled in Congress. The source. who refused to give his name for quotation, sid Some portion of this program is per- haps not required, but that ts @ very small factor compared with the price we would have had to pay (in Congress) on issues like the ABM and Cambodia.

Some \\neiense in maritime subsidies had been Washington—M aritime Ad- ministrator Andrew Gibson read an advance draft of this article after Newsday offered him an epportunity to make a written response as well as to point out any errors prior to publication. According to a spokesman, Gib- son decided to decline te com- ment, at teast for the present. He has decided to ignore it, the spokesman said. in the cards since election day,\n1968, because of a campaign pledge that Nixon made to the maritime in- dustry. In one of his few specific campaign promises, Nixon pledged on Sept. 25,\n1968, to support a ship- building program big enough so that U.S. flag cargo ships would carry 30 per cent of all American ex- ports and imports by the mid-1970s. Since only 5.6 per cent was then carried on U.S. flag ships, Nixon was promising the American merchant marine five times as big a share of the foreign cargo. Nixon followed up on his promise last Oct. 23 in a message to Congress that was acclaimed by the maritime industry and ignored by everyone else. Among the benefits that Nixon would have served up e@ Direct subsidies for shipbuilding would more than deuble over the next decade, from the current level of about $100,\n000,\n000 a year to an average of $208.000.000 a year. The number of subsidized ships built each year would triple, fram 10 to 30. e A lucrative tax loophole, previously open only to the owners of the 300 directly subsidized ships, would be widened to give the owners of at least 300 more ships the privilege of deferred taxation. e® The 34-year-old recapture clause, under which about $4,\n000,\n000 a year in excess subsidized shipping profits has been handed back to the U.S. Treasury, would be dropped. @ Direct subsidies for shipbuilding and sea- men’s wages would become available for the first time to operators of bulk ships which carry ore, rrain and oll. Previously direct subsidies were paid only to freighters on scheduled routes. The direct subsidies would gradually replace the indirect sub- sidies in the form of premium freight rates on gov- ernment cargo. Those goodics in the Nixon maritime package were accompanied by some worthy reforms. As a condition for tripling the number of ships to be built with subsidies. Nixon insisted that a smaller perconinge of the cost of each ship be Lorne by the government. Ar for the $200,\n000,\n000 a year the government Pavs to supplement the wages and benefits of Ameri- can merchant scamen, Nixon introduced a new cal- culation method designed to prevent subsidized wages from ballooning faster than an index of wane increases in other industries, The reforms have tended to gloss over the fact that during the next 10 years the cost of all mari- time subsidies would be about $8 billion. Without the Nixon program, the cost would be about $7 bil- Fon, The main beneficiaries would not be the con- sumers or the freight shippers or the taxpayers. In- ftead, the hounty would go principally to about 125,- 000 maritime and shipbuilding jobholders and their unions, The unions had faced a sharp cut in member- ship because of shipboard automation but, with the new program, would lose fewer jobs. aut ee ne rig, Siu phulldiag companies would cir cut too. orn Secre proudly testified merce tony Sans  We would expect the Profits of the industry to be considerably higher than would otherwise be the case (without the Nixon program) Stans went on to claim that the federal govern- ment would collect more taxes because of the re- newed vigor of the industry. - few weeks before Nixon announced his mari. time program, the National Security Council finished a major study of American military require- ments for coming years. After reading the report, Nixon approved a secret directive to the Defense Department and other agencies that future defense budgets should be calculated on a new, and much less costly, assumption. Known as National Security Decision Memorandum 27, the directive stated that this country should at any time be prepared to fight one major war like World War II and should have enough in reserve for one minor contingency. Since the old assumption called for forces to handle simultaneously two major wars and one minor contingency, the Defense Department was soon able to plan sharp cutbacks in bases, supplies, weapons and troops. ae Since the main justification for subsidizing com- mercial ships during the 1950s and 1960s was to prepare for a wartime emergency, Nationa) Security Decision Memorandum 27 obviously had a direct bearing on the size of the forthcoming maritime pro- gram. In fact, Nixon’s White House Working Group en Maritime Policy examined the national security memorandum and then told Nixon in writing that the wartime requirement for both military and essential civilian cargo could be met through the 1970s by subsidizing between zero and 10 ships a year. Sud- denly one of the main premisces that Nixon had offered in his 1968 speech as justification for a big maritime program was quictly shot out from under hm. In the months since the national security mem- orandum was circulated, an exhaustive study by the U.S. Navy known as the Integrated Sealift Study has confirmed that wartime needs for merchant ship- ping could be met by a subsidy prcgram for 10 com- mercial ships a year plus the required Navy ships. Even so, Nixon went ahond with a 30-ship-a-year program. Thus, while the Defense Department was buying enough guns and missiles and destroyers to fight one and a half wars simultancously, the Com- —Continued on Page 6R Te teen neem aes e i eae s Newed. pas fe bs Alar are stacked on o Brooklyn dock @ leaded onto o froighter July 20,\n1970 (continued) \f Workman Paints a Keel That Will Be Laid in Place on a New Ship at the Brooklyn Navy Yard Out of Industry, Into the Government Washington--— Three high administration officials who played key roles in developing the President's expensive new maritime program were maritime company officers or executives just before joining the government The lineup includes Peter M.

(The latter ship was awarded an unusual waiver by the Treasury Department in March,\n1970, Permitting it to get into the lucrative domestic trade even though it had been previously registered under the Liberian flog. Flanigan has denicd having had ing to de with obtaining the waiver, which was quently canceled. Treasury was one of the agencies Flanigan oversaw at the time, but Treasury fiie'als say Flonigan was not consulted.) On Sept. 26 1969—about five months after he joined the White Hause and took over responsi- bility for the maritime program—- Flanigan directed his lawyers to transfer about $20,\n000 worth of stock he owned in Barracuda to a blind trust which he had heen in the process of setting up since coming to the White House. As a company chartering forcign flag tankers to an aij company, Barracuda would neither gnin nor tose anything from the maritime program that Flanigan helped to put together. The two other companics he formerly headed were Pico Tanker Corp., owner of a small tanker called the Avila, and Figueroa Tanker Corp., owner of another small tanker christened the Santa Maria. Flanigan awned no shares of cither company when he came to Washington, but the ownership was spread among his former Ditlon, Read partners. As owners of demestic oil tankers in the Alaska trade, Pico and Figucroa would not benefit from the maritime progeam as Nixon announced it. The Heuse of Representatives, howevor, added a provi- sion that might allow the two compnnies to set up tax deferral funds to build new tankers in the fu- ture. Flanigan's White House responsibilities put him ins the ton of having to help decide how hard the administration should push in the Senate to knock out the widened tax deferral provision that might apply tw Pico and Figueroa.

By Joseph Albright, Newsday Washington Bureau Chief Washington—The maritime lobby has erected what amounts to a perpetual mo- tion machine to keep the taxpayer's dollar flowing into merchant marine subsidies. It works like this VERY YEAR Congress pumps about $300,\n000,- 000 into direct subsidies for American shipyards t and shipping companies. Through the grace of Coneress, the industry also gets another $400,- 000,\n000 a year in indirect subsidies. The theory be- hind subsidizing the merchant marine is that the federal covernment should serve as a crutch to keep the marilime industry on its fest in the face of low- ware foreign competition. As it turns out, the subsidy program has been so generous Intelv that it has pushed up the wages and henefits of American seamen twice as fast as those of workers in Ameri- can manufacturing industries. The seamen are so grntefiul for their hich wares that they make voluntery contributions to the voliti- cal action committees of their unions. The National Maritime Union. which haa jurisdiction over the directly subsidized steamshin companies. gathered in S222.000 in 1968. After each vovace. the returning seamen are asked to buy one or two $5 tickets apiece for the National Maritime Unian Fighters Fund. Not everyone kicks in. The rival Seafarers International Union is even more successful in amassing voluntary political con- tributions. Although it represents only 20,\n900 jobs, the Seafarers Union’s political kitty is bigger than that of any other union in America and four times as big us that of the million-member United Steel- workers union of America. The most open-handed contributors to the Seafarers Politicnl Activity Do- nation Cammitter are apparently alien seamen— men like Jintoku Toma. Jinyu Yarika and Lim Bian Seng—who are so grateful for the chance to get hired on an American ship that they shell out $100 to $500 per vovage. Members of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Assaciation make up in generosity what they lack in numbers. Although the union has only about 12,\n000 seagoing members and jurisdiction over 5,\n500 mari- time jobs, the active and cetired members sluiced $370,\n752 into several political funds in 1969. One thing about the marine cngineers, they are regular in their giving habits. Examination of a 221-page printout showed that more than half of last year's political kitty was donated by about 1,\n700 retired members, nearly all in the form of $10-a-month contributions. Leon Shapiro, the treasurer of the retirees fund, explained that the retired members had voluntarily signed authorization for regular monthly deductions from their pension fund checks. He said they could be revoked at any time a retired member requested. Onc retired mnrine engincer, Bror G. Lindberg of Glen Head, expressed surprise when informed that he had given $120 to the union's voluntary political fund last year. I've been retired for seven years, and I haven't given anything (to the fund) since then. Lindberg insisted. Another retired engineer, Norman J. Judkins of Valley Stream, knew of his contribution and wae proud of it. He said what we are trying to do is recreate adecent merchant marine. We are remind- ing the congressmen about it through a little tobbying. ircle of subsidies is completed when elec- ean ra vols around. Then Washington representa- lives of the maritime unions dole out close to $1,\n000,\n000 the 200 or so of their favorite congressional candidates. Anyone in the House who has faithfully voted for maritime subsidies can al- most certainly get $500 from the Seafarers donation cormnmittee just by asking. Any friendly senator or any of the 37 members of House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee can usually get $1,\n000 or more from the Seafarers. In 1968, Sen. Daniel Brewster (1D-Md.) got $20,\n000 but lost his election. Between elections, the AFL-CIO Maritime Trades Department which is led by the Seafarers, is glad to give honorariums to legislators for address- ing its weekly maritime luncheons in Washington or its annual conventions. In 1969 the Department gave four senators a total of 59,\n500 in honorariums, plus an undisclosed amount to several dozen congress- men. (The Seafarers Union and eight of its officers were jolted last month with a 17-count federal in- dictment which charged that the union illegally con- tributed $40,\n000 to Republican and Democratic campaigns in 1968, and that the officers had con- spired to contribute $4,\n750,\n000 illegally between 1864 and 1968.) The flow of campaign dollars from the maritime unions is only a partial explanation for the invulner- ability of merchant marine subsidies to the kind of criticism that hns engulfed many government spend- ing programs. Of course the top executives of the shipyards nnd shipping lines give money too, both to congressmen and to presidential candidates. Their contribution volume is apparently smaller than that of labor. Two subsidized shipping companies, the Ameri- ean President Lines and the Pacific Far East Line, pleaded guilty early this year to charges of illegally contributing a total of $8,\n200 in the last two con- gressional clections. The Internal Revenue Service charged that it had caught them taking campaign contribztions out of the company till and writing them off as advertising and entertainment expenses. That, however, is a petty fraction of the legal cam- paign contributions by shipping company executives. Another kev to the remarkable strength of the maritime interests in Cenrress is that ordinarily no Tival interest group geta hurt when the maritime lobby gets a break. The maritime unions and ship- nine companies can lock hands and march together for higher subsidies. and there is no counterlobby to stand in the way. When there are fights, they are over how to split up the pie among the competing factions of the maritime lobby itself. Furthermore, even though the maritime industry is a tiny part of the economy, it is widely diffused among the con- Rressional and senatorial constituencies. Sometimes it's the little things that count. Par- ties have been thrown for union leaders and con- @ressmen aboard a 260-foot steam yacht anchored in the Washington channel. The $2.500.000 yacht, once ewned by Horace Dodge, was sold jointly to the Seafarers, the Marine Engineers and the Assaciated Maritime Officera Union. The Dauntless, as the vacht is christened, is said to visit Washington at least once a year for a round of nightly festivitics. The financial interest of the industry has long been inteztwinea with a patriotic desire to becf up our defenses, in the tradition of the bridge of ships that helped win World War II. The American Le- gion, an organization no congressman likes to cross, regularly passes national resolutions calling for a revitalization of the fleet through higher subsidies, calling it a basic element of our national defense. Another ideological supporter of maritime subsidies is the Navy League, the civilian mouthpiece of the uniformed Navy. The freight forwarders, who presumably would support a big American merchant marine, are al- most never heard from. Because of the frequency of strikes on American flag cargo ships and for ather reasons, the companies that ship cargo overseas ship more than 95 per cent of their commercial cargo on foreign flag ships. Rep. Edward A. Garmatz (D-Md.), the chair- man of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, is proof af how dependent upon a spe- cial interest lobby a congressman can with- out violating congressional ethics. Records filed by Garmatz in Annapolis, Md., indicate that he received $134,\n000 from campaign contributions in his last two election years including primaries. Of that, Newsday has traced $75,\n191 to executives and union groups in the maritime industry who had business before his committce. Garmatz scored best with the political commit- tees of labor unions, which is not surprising since the congressman was formerly an official of the electri- cal workers union. In the last two elections, he got $23,\n000 from the Seafarers Union, $2,\n750 from the National Maritime Union ana $20,\n050 from the Marine Engineers Beneficia! Assn. Of the total $45,\n800 from the three unions, Gar- matz reported only $20,\n500 to the Maryland secre- tary of state. That is a violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Maryland election laws which require political committees to report all contribu- tions of more than $50 to the Maryland secretary of state. A spokesman for Garmatz said that the dis- crepancy might have occurred because the missing union contributions, most of them in checks of $500 and up, were used to buy blocks of tickets to recep- tions which cost less than $50 ench. At least 513,\n525 flowed in from maritime com- pany executives. Under federal and state gicction laws, corporations are not allowed to give political contributions, But that did not stop four officials of Farrell Lines, which has received $120,\n900,\n000 aver the years in operating subsidies, from giving Gar- matz a total of $800 as individuals, When Garmatz feo his campaign accounting to the State of Mary- land, he listed the address of the four men as c/o Farrell Lines,\n1 Whitehall Street, New York.

One congressman who knows how the Scafarers Union deals out punishment is Rep. Thomas L. Ashley (D-Ohio), who bad the effrontery_to suggest in 1966 that a lot of money could be saved if the law were changed to allow some U.S. flag ships to be built abroad. Ashley made the suggestion in the course of questioning Senfarers President Paul Hall during Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee hearings, and Hall is not one who likes to be crossed. That autuinn Ashley. who had ao rating of 100 per cent from the Committee on Politica) Action of the AFL-CIO, found the Seafarers Union strongly backing his Republican opponent in the election campaign. Ashley saoid They did their best to circularize the factories and take away my tabor vote. They even brought a cavalcade of cars from New York, but that backfired. Ashley’s Republican opponent, Jane Kuebbeter, got S3.000 from the Seafarer’s campaign kitty that year. Although the Seafarers did not rucceed in de- feating Ashley, the union taught some other Con- @ressmen ai lesson one docsn’t fight maritime subsidies without taking a political risk. One of the maritime lobby’s biggest tests of muscle was its effort in the last three years of the Johnson administration to prevent the Defense De- partment from buying its own specially designed military cargo ships for fast military deployment in case of war. Defense Secretary McNamara fervently wanted these Fast Deployment Logistics Ships be- cause they could store bulky vehicles and helicopters for prolonged periods and then deliver the cargo anywhere in the world even without port facilities much faster than commercial ships. Although Me- Namera said that the fast deployment ships were needed for defense, Congress stopped the program cold three years in a row. Later, the AFL-CIO Maritime Committee, speatheaded by the National Maritime Union, proudly reported to its membership that we were seeerssts in knocking out the fast deployment hips. The’ marilime unions correctly feared the niufi- tary cargo ships because they would make it harder for the maritime bloc to contend that commercial cargo ships were needed for national defense. In its successful fight agninst the military ships, the mari- time lobby artfully blended the fears of foreign involvement among the doves in Congress with the pro-shipbuilding convictions of House Armed Ser- vices Committee Chairman L. Mendel Rivers (D- S3.C.), who refused to back the military shipa for Seamen waiting for jobs play cards in the National Mari- time union building on Sev- enth Avonue in Manhattan. Most members of maritime unions contribute heavily to unien political funds. Sva! eget Newsday Photo by Alan Rata defense unless the Johnson atministration would agree to subsidize 50 commercial ships a year. The maritime lobby, led by the Seafarers Union, now has a hammerlock on virtually every important congressional committee that deals with maritime subsidies. By quirks of geogrophy and seniority, nearly all the key jobs are held by representatives from shipyard cities or shipping centers. The roster of maritime bloc powerhouses, aside from Gurmatz and Rivers, include Rep. John J. Rooney (D-N.Y.) The chairmen of the appropriations subconmnit- tee which handles maritime subsidies. He also deals with the rest of the Commerce Department, the State Department and the Justice Department. Fis altitude on subsidies was well illustrated in 1964 when he told. a Maritime Administration witness Why do you not have a program here with 40 or 50 ships, instead of getting down to 17 ships? Over the years, Rooney has used his leverage to cut the State Department and even the Justice Department budgets but to add more money for te subsidies than the man in the While House wanted to spend. In 1968,\n9 typical year, Rooncy’s subcommittee hacked $152,\n800,\n000 from the combined State, Justice and Commerce appro- Priation but at the same time added 129,\n500,\n000 within the bill for extra ship subsidies. For several years Rooney bas personally blocked the Maritime Administration from laying up the nuclear ship Savannah even though this would save $4,\n000,\n000 a year. Rooney simply writes in a provision that bars any funds to lay up the Savannah. Rooney’s obvious leverage on the executive branch has endeared him to the maritime Sobby, and sometimes this warm feeling is translated into , coe cash. During the 1968 election William T. nore of Centre Island, L.I.. president and board chairman of Moore-McCormack Lines, was listed es contributing $1,\n000 to Rooney’s campaign. In the ast 33 years Moore-McCormack has gotten $348,- 0,\n000 in operating subsidies, much of it during Rooney's tenure on the appropriations committee. Rooney's other benefactors in 1968 included Ralph K. Davies of San Francisco, board chairman of American President Lines, $500 the Seafarers po- litical committee, $1,\n000, and the Marine Engineera Beneficial Assn. political committee, $1,600. Sen.

Such a decision could be understood if the ship subsidies brought great economic benefits to the nation. And indeed, the Commerce Department, which includes the Maritime Administration, told Nixon that there were compelling economic justi- fications, The Commerce Department said that under the new program, the U.S. balance of payments would be improved by $200,\n000,\n000 a year because of freight charges that would be paid to American flag ships instead of foreign ships, Furthermore, the Com- merce Department said, the existence of a strong Amcrican merchant flect would prevent foreign ship- owners from gouging U.S. shippers on freight rates. And the Labor Department backed the program be- cause more ships would mean a smaller cutback in maritime employment. The Council of Economic Advisers, the Presi- dent's statutory font of economic wisdom, came down hard on the other side, however. The formal recom- mendation of the Council, Newsday has learned, was that the administration should not spend any money on shipbuilding subsidies beyond what was strictly needed for national security. CONTINUED TOMORROW Maritime Lobby Keeps the Pump Primed —Continued from 'Page 6R istration bill he leaned some more. At one point he told Commerce Secretary Stans As far as I am concerned, may I say, with the hind of business we are voting on in the Finance Committee, I know it would not make a difference to put an- other $1 billion in there. That is a very small item. What gives Long extra leverage on ship subsidies with fellow senators and administration officials is the fact that he happens also to be chairman of the Sennte Finance Committee, which handles a bundle of critical legislation ranging from taxes to welfare reform. Rep. Gerald R. Ford (R-Mich.) The House minority leader, For years Ford has been committed to strengthening the merchant ma- rine as a matter of ideology and conviction. It also happens that unlil a recent redistricting his congres- gional district faced Lake Michigan and contained some Great Lakes steamship interests. Ford's role as House minority leader provides him a chance to see President Nixon at breakfast once a week, and at least once last summer he reportedly used the op- portunity to press Nixon to propose a bigger ship subsidy program. Ford also pressed the case with Bryce Harlow, who was handling President Nixon's congressional relations, and Harlow as a central figure in the administration's private deliberations about how big a maritime program to propose. Ford accepted a $4,\n000 campaign contribution from the Seafarers in 1966 but nothing in 1968. In duly,\n1969, he addressed the 14th biennial conven- tion of the Seafarers Union and pledged that the Nixon administration would not propose building ships in foreign shipyards to save money. Sen. Warren G. Magnuson (D-Wash.) The chairman of the Senate Commerce Com- mittee which has jurisdiction over the Maritime Administration. President Kennedy once paid trib- ute to Magnuson by saying that he was the senator who could put through a bill to create a new Grand Coulee dam while no one else in the Senate was looking. He has been actively pushing maritime subsidies in the Senate since the 1940s, longer than any other senator. He is in an excellent position to push, because virtually every senator wants some- thing from the Senate Commerce Committee. What Nixon actually proposed as his new mari- time program in 1969 is a stimmed-down version ot a bill Magnuson introduced on Nov. 9,\n1967, when he gave up his efforts to persuade the Johnson administration to submit a bill he considered big enough, One of the frank calculations by the Nixon White House team was that Magnuson had the power to put through the bill on his own this year even if Nixon submitted no maritime program. When Magnuson ran for reclection in 1968, com- mittees working for him received at least $5,\n000 from the Seafarers political committee and $9,\n400 from a political arm of the Marine Engineers Bene- ficial Assn. Seattle, which is Magnuson’s home, is the home port of the American Mail Line, Ltd., which has received $83,\n500,\n000 in operating differ- ential subsidies in the last 33 years. Seattle is also a shipbuilding center, led by the Lockheed Shipbuild- ing & Construction Co. Probably the only thing that could break the hammerlock which the maritime lobby now has on Congress would be for the President ta go on televi- sion and denounce maritime subsidies as a multi- million-dollar waste of taxpayers money. McNamara once suggested that President John- Son should start a publicity campaign about the wastefulness of maritime subsidies, but the idea got nowhere, The chances of Nixon or any future President putting his prestige on the line for such a relatively small fraction of the federal budget seem minuscule. Nixon's own attitude was revealingly described by Ford when he said that the President wanted a new, forward-looking maritime program that would help all parts of the merchant marine and that all Segments of the maritime industry would support. So there it was, on the floor of the House. The Program had to please everyone in the industry. CONTINUED TOMORROW July 20,\n1970 (continued) \f Pion This is the last installment of a series on U.S. subsidies to the maritime in- _, dustry. It outlines the way the government could save $4 billion in maritime subsidies during the next 10 years while still meeting defense requirements. Ry Joseph Albright, Newsday Washington Bureau Chief Washington— Unless you happened to be.a direct beneficiary of the merchant marine lobby, you would not suffer if Congress were to cut in half the $8 billion that maritime subsidies will cost the U.S. economy over the next 10 vears. In fact you just might come out ahead. In 10 years the United States still could have a fleet of modern U.S. flaz merchant ships that cauld carry enough cammercia) cargo to guarantec that U.S. exports and imports would not be gouged by foreign shipping cartels. And in case of war, the U.S. merchant fleet still could mect the Defense Depart- moent's estimated sealift requirements. Cutting subsidies sounds simple, but politically it is leprosy. The whole commercial shipping and shipbuilding industry is a tiny part of the U.S. economy, with fewer capital resources and fewer jobs than _a big company like General Motors or the Penn Central Railrood. But it has power in Congress that is out of all proportion to its size. Its strength is based in part on two centuries of tradition and sentiment and in part on a well-heeled tobby. Former Maritime Achninistentor Emory S, Land, sll the grand old man of the merchant marine at the are of 91 1966 gave hin own blunt justification Tor keeping subsidies. The Great Society is series of subsidies, Land said. Let's face the facta. The operating differentini subsidy, percapilo, amounts tea the cast of one scotch highbail. The construction differential subsidy, per capita, may amount to the cost of one bottle of beer. It scems to me we onight selne a two libations per annum and support a proper shipb ng industry and a prosper- oun U.S. merchant marine. Nhat kind of reasoning carries a lot of weight in sion. After all, direct maritime subsidics are enough to justify mnak’ng so many powerful people mad, And very few congressinen have ever stopped to delve into the Intlicework of indirect subsi- ilies that Land didn’t mention. At the same time, tbe pro-maritime bloc can point out thal almost every forcign country gives ts chipping industry come kind of protection or subsidy. Ane for that matter, whot about the supersonic trans- port and the $4.6 billion being spent every year to support the income of farmers? Nonetheless, if the maritime lobby’s requests were not satisfied, $4 billion in maritime subsidies could be anved over the next 10 years. About $2.7 billion of the 34 billion that could be saved would directly bencfit President Nixon’s hard- preesed Treasury Department, either by nol. spending government money on subsidies or by closing a tax loophole that gives an indirect subsidy. That would be enough for the government to finance 149,\n000 new units of low- and middle-income housing. Or it could mean that during the next 10 yenrs the avernge taxpayer would have to pay $35 less to the Internal Revenue Service. Or it could pay for another 200 fighter planes. The other $1.3 billion saving could come in the form of flower acean freight rates, meaning that con- sumers would pay tess for items transported by ship. Here are the areas in which savings could be made, and the amounts that could be cut back Operating Differential Subsidies Largely because of overmanning and high Ameri- can wages, labor costs rbout four times as much on nn American flag ship as on an identical foreign fag ship. Fo make sure that American ships engaged in forcign commerce can compete an on even basis with foreign ships, the Maritime Administration gives American shipowners cash subsidies to make up the difference between foreign and U.S. woge cosis. The operating differential subsidy also extends the princi- rle of perity™ to ncidentals like the cost of ineur- mnce and repairs, but 85 per cent of the subsidy is for wanges. This direet subsidy program is now enjoyed by 14 okt-line shipping componics which operate scheduled f-cighters and possenger liners on specified trade ries. Onera.iug subsidices sre casting the taxpayers about £200,\n000,\n000 a ycar. Whert the cubsidy really subsidizes is jobs for Auncrican seamen, Originally a 3936 New Deal 1cusure to get higher pay and more jabs for the downtradden ship worker, the operat’ng subsidy has Instec? through bad times and good. About 14,\n000 jobs ft sen ase new supported by onerating subsidies, which means thal esch job is subsidized to the tune of about $12,\n000 a year. Since an individual seaman sails only about six or eight months a year so that the eg LED th Pas ah teb leds Estab et ts ef Seweday DPheto hy A A Freighter Moves Through Fog i ihe Murrows Off Brooklyn work can be split up, the annual subsidy to any one seaman is about $6,\n000. QOpernting subsidies are set up in such a way that seagoing wages are bound to skyrocket—and they cdo. At the bargaining tabdic. the subsidized shipping com- panics have not had the usual incentive to take a hard negotiat'ng line because they and the unions knew that the wage cost would be quietly absorbed by the — U.S. taxpayers. And this has been no secret to the Maritime Administration. It is litle wonder wUsut during the last five years the costs of seofaring lnbur have risen more than twice as fast as the labor costs in typical nunufactur- ing industries. By the Maritime Administration’s own ealculations the rate of increase belween 1964 and 1969 wns nine per cent a year for the seanwen and four per cent a year for all manufacturing industries, On a standard American carga ship the total inbor cost is now about $18.000 a year for each job. Lotely th cost escalation has specded up. The maritime industry bas now finished calculating the effects of last summer's moritime labor settlement. Although it bas never been publicly bruited about, the increase in Inbor costs amnunted to 18 per cent this year,\n11 per cent next year, and 12 per cent the third year. Compounded over three years, it comes to 46.7 per cent-—-clearly one of the more inflationary ware Packages of the year. The Nixon administration’s pregram figures to limit future wage increases by introducing an index! of other American wage settlements as a standard. It is also assuming—over oeptimistically—that anly 70 per cent of the new ships in Nixon’s chipbuilding program wil need aperating subsidies. £600,\n000,\n000 How could $600,\n000,\n000 be saved in 19 years? 1. Quickly phase out subsidies for the crews of U.S. Mag passenger ships, which now cost the laxpny- ers $45,\n000,\n000 a year, The airlines and forcian Jux- ury liners have killed the tourist trade for U.S. steamships. Why fight it with the taxpayers’ money? Right now there are so few Passengers on U.S. steam- ships that each passenger is, in effect, subsidized to the tune of $345. At the eame time, American ship- owners are losing money on passenger service, and five big passenger ships, including the S.S. United States, were laid up last year. 2. As a side benefit of phasing out passenger ship subsidies, Congress could then repeni the curious spe- cial requirement that causes the Defense Department to spend $7,\n600,\n000 a year to transport military men in commercial ships when the department would pre- fer to use airplanes because it would be cheaper. _ 3. The law could be changed to scale down operat- ing subsidies so they could cover onlythe cost of the rock-bottom complement of American seamen nced- ed to operate a ship safely and efficiently- American flag cargo ships carry about 30 per cent more crewmembers than are really necded. A de- tailed study of the Mariner clasa carro ship in 1965 found that 18 of the 64 men in the crew contd be elim- inated and the overall costs sharply reduced just by ates most of the shipboard maintenance to special the ntenance crews in port and by reshuffling some of oe an load.

Recently the government's budget has carried about $100,\n000,\n000 a vear for construction subsidies, or about $10,\n000,\n000 for cach of 10 subsidized ships. Only about 13,\n000 shipyard workers work on ships subsidized by the Maritime Administration. That means that the taxpayers pay about $8,\n000 annually » jn construction subsidies to keep one American ship- vard job fram being taken by a Japanese shipyard, President Nixon's new maritime program would subsidize 300 ships over the next 10 years, about three times as many as are now being subsidized. However Nixon plans to cul down the proportion of construc- tion subsidy. over six years. Nixon has warned that if the subsidy percentages are not scaled down this much, his commitment to subsidize 300 ships won't be bind- | $1.5 Billion 1, Congress could subsidize only enough ships to meet the Defense Department’s wartime emergency requirement for (a) shipping and (b) a shipbuilding mobilization base. According to estimates given to President Nixon, the national security requirement is no more than 10 ships a year. 2. The law could be changed to allow U.S. ship- owners to buy ships in foreign shipyards and to still register them under the U.S. flag with all the privi- leges of U.S. registry. 3. Even with a smaller shipbuilding program, Congress could insist on scaling down the percentage of subsidies from their present level of 55 per cent to about 43 per cent. That could be achieved by building half a dozen ships of the same design under cone contract, rather than customizing each one, and by emphasizing modular construction and standardized components. Shipbuilding Tax Shelter Unlike nearly all other industries, including vital defense production, subsidized ship operators are now allowed to postpone until far into the future the paying of most of their corporate income taxes. A special tax loophole dating back to 1996 allows the 14 directly subsidized ship operators to deposit all or vart of their net earnings, plus depreciation, into what are known as reserve funds, Earnings in those funds are not taxed, and there is currently no time limit on how long the money can be left in reserve. When the sarnings are finally withdrawn to be used for ship- building or ship mortgages, the government gets the deferred taxes out of earnings of the new ship—unless those earnings are also deferred into the future. Currently, the subsidized shipping companies pay about 27 per cent of their income to the Internal Revenue Service, compared to 52 per cent for com- panies without a tax shelter. It works like this Company A, an aircraft manu facturer, earned $1,\n000,\n000 in 1969 and paid $520,\n000 of it to the Internal Revenue Service in corporate income taxes. Company B, a subsidized ship operat- ing company, also earned $1,\n000,\n000 last year, but its tax bill came to $208,\n000 because it decided to deposit $600,\n000 of its earnings in a reserve fund, Company B paid taxes on only the $400,\n000 which it did not put in the reserve fund. Company B's privilege of paying $208,\n000 in taxes instead of $520,\n000 amounted to an inlerest-free loan from the government for shipbuild- ing. It has been a gratifying gimmick, especially for the most profitable of the subsidized shipping com- panies. The Treasury estimates that the shipbuilding tax loophole how results in a loss of $10,\n000,\n000 a year in tax revenues, The Nixon administration's new maritime pack- age recognized that the rest of the maritime industry was being left out of a good shelter. The Nixon bill would extend the tax deferral privilege to anather 300 ships owned by unsubsidized operators in the foreign trade. The House of Representatives passed this pro- vision 307-1, without ever learning how much it would cost the Treasury. The best estimate, from a Maritime administration source, jis 315,\n000,\n000 a year. While the House was at it, it extended the loophole even beyond what the administration had suggested The House bill would also allow tax deferral for shipping between the U.S. mainland and non-contigu- ous areas like Alaska and Puerto Rico (tax loss about $12,\n000,\n000 a year) for Great Lakes shipping (tax loss about $7,\n000,\n000 a year) and for fishing boats ($2,\n000,\n000 a year). $500,\n000,\n000 By simply changing the law to eliminate tax deferral privileges for all shipping companies, $500,- 000,\n000 could be saved in 10 years, At the same time, the Treasury Department could see if it could close another loophole that permits a tax exemption for the carnings of ships owned by foreign affiliates of U.S, companies and registered under the Panamanian, Li- berian and Hondouran flags. It might be difficult to write a law that would close the loophole without driving the shipowners to sell their ships and to then charter vessels from foreign companiea. Recapture Clause The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 included a recapture clause under which any subsidized com- pany carning more than 10 per cent return on capital annually had to give half the excess profit back to the government. The Nixon administration asked Congress to scrap the 34-year-old recapture clause because it was ineffective and cumbersome, and the House hag already complied, The recapture clause has recap. tured only about $4,\n000,\n000 a year, One reason, Mari- time Administration sources concede, is that shipping companies apparently have made a habit of inflating the capital requirements on their books to avoid having to pay back excess profits to the government. The Nixon administration also seeks to end the provision of the 1936 law under which subsidies would not be paid for executive salarics over $25,\n000. $40,\n000,\n000 How to save $40,\n000,\n000? Congress could restore the recapture clause, but with new rules to prevent companies from juggling their accounts to inflate their capital requirements in an effort to avoid recap- ture. To reward efficiency, the recapture clause could work on a sliding scale instead of a flat rate. The $25,\n000 salary limit on subsidy payments could be retained. Domestic Cargo Ever since 1817 the U.S, has had a cabotage jaw which prevents forcign flng ships from carrying cargo from one Amcrican port to another. Since the wages on fore'gn ships are abeut anc-fourth of American senfaring wages, the rates for carrying domestic cargo could be drastically chopped if foreign flag ships were allowed to compete. The Defense Depart- ment has estimated that the Idwer freight rates would save $1.2 billion over the next 10 years, and this would ultimately be reflected in lower prices to the consumers, Another federal law, the Jones Act of 1920, pre- vents American shipping companies from using foreign-built ships to carry domestic cargo, even if they employ American seamen. Since there is no construction subsidy for ships carrying domestic cargo, the high cost of building ships in U.S. ship- yards is passed on to the shipper, and ultimately to the consumer, in the form of higher prices. An esti- meted $1.3 billion in higher capital costs (amortiza- tion plus interest) will be forced onto shipowners over the next 10 years by the Jones Act. These eabetage laws will amount (o a $2.5 billion drag on the economy during the 1970s even though they do not show up as a cost to the U.S, Treasury. Domestic shipping rates are now so high that many Alaskan timber companies are finding it cheaper to ship their logs across the Pacific to Japan rather than paying domestic freight rates to have them hauled to California, What could be done? The Jones Act could be amended to provide that when American shipyards ae working at a level equal to their 1970 output, Omestic shipping companies could buy their ships abroad. The Navy plans to spend $35 billion to build new warships during the next 10 years which is $14 Tilton more than the Navy shipbuilding budget for ¢ last 10 yeara, Clearly the domestic shipyards could be filled to their present enpacily building just eo ships.

But, under scrutiny, it turns out that much of the accepted wisdom is outdated or questionable. Here is an examination of the eternal verities about the merchant marine The Vanishing Fleet The canventional wisdom was well stated last Oct. va by Commerce Secretary Stans Dhe United States merchant marine is in trouble. The United States fleet contained 3,\n686 ships at the close of World War IL and was then the largest in (he world. In the 24 yenrs sinee that time, it has steadily decreased. Neglect in recent years, resulting from a fundamental lack of understonding of seapower, has reduced the United States flag leet to $67 ships, only G50 of which are engaged in forei¢n trade. Worn-out World War II ships constitute the largest seginent of theé United States foreign trace fleet The disap- senrance of the war-built ships and a few postwar es partially offset by the delivery of ships present- i under construction, will reduce the foreign trade Heat to 272 ships by 1974 The alorming rate of decline for the Meet can be averted only if the dismal vessel replncement record of the past few yeara is  ig ak statistic was accurate, but when taken to- fer they form a distorted picture. The fact ia that rf argo carrying capacity of the U.S. flag flect bas — = ea markediy even though the number of ships ee es cing, down, The reason is that bigger, faster iS ins ave being built to replace the old World War II ships oe ebips.

Nixon’s program to subsidize 30 ships a year is big enough to bring a huge increase in today’s carrying capacity, at least doubling it by 1982. If all 300 ships were built. the owners would have to capture a far larger share of the nation’s commercial cargo from foreign shipowners just to stay profitable. If too many ships are built for the available commercial cargo, the government will find itself under new pressure from the maritime lohby to provide higher indirect sub- sidies in the form of laws that would reserve a higher portion of U.S. cargo for American ships. The Russian Menace The traditional pro-maritimne speech usually in- cludes a passage like this one recently given on the House fleor by Rep, Samuel N, Friedel (D-Md.) We have long been in an economic war with the Soviets who have threatened to bury us at sea. The growth of Russia’s merchant marine is perhaps the most startling in world maritime history 2. While the U.S. merchant marine has aged and dwindled to jess than 900 ships, the USSR can boast of 1,\n400 ships The flect that flies the hammer and sickle is a major instrument in Soviet national policy. Despite the scare talk about Russia outstripping the U.S. at sea, the Soviet merchnnt flect has about the gnme carrying capacity as the U.S. flag fleet. Russia has about 4.7 per cent of the world’s merchant flect now, and the Defense Department expects its share to grow to ahout 5 per cent hy 1975. When ships owned by American companies but operated under foreign flags of convenience are added (o those in the U.S. flag fleet, the total carrving capacity is double that of the merchant fiects of all the Com- munist countries put together. Furthermore, the ship- ping resources owned and controiled by members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization amount to about three-fifths of the world’s fieet. in contrast to less than one-tenth for Communist countries. The one realistic Russian menace is that low-cost Russian freighters are offering cheap freight rates that undercut the rates set by the world shipping cartels in which American flag freighters participate. Russian competition could force the cartels, known as ship- ping conferences, to lower their freight rates. While lowering rates would help the American consumer, it would put pressure on the profitability of U.S. flag shipping companies, Even if this should happen, it is hard to see how the Russian menace could be con- quered by buildin high-cost American freighters a $ear. = <ak Wee Se Balance of Payments Savings Ever since the Korean War, Americans have paid put more dollars to foreigners than they have gotten back, and the result has been a deficit in the nation’s balance of payments. The Commerce Department and the maritime industry have long argued the existence of a batance of payments deficit, was a strong reason for continuing Subsidies, _ Stans recently testified that the Nixon shipbuild NZ Program would cost the taxpayers an extra $1 biltion and would Produce an extra $2 billion savings in the balance of Payments.

The average tourist seldom finds out about Camp Heover and cannot stay there if he does. But a government big shot from Washington and his family can rent it for the weekend from the National Park Service for half the cost of a motel on the highway.

When Robert Finch, then secretary of health, edu- cation and welfare, visited Camp Hoover last October, his 13-year-old daughter, Priscilla, wrote some advice that has helped later guests: “Remember to make the fire in the back of the fireplace or you'll get smoked out.” The three senators who have used Camp Hoover in the last two years are Vance Hartke .D-Ind.), Henry Bellmon ‘R-Okla.) and Ted Sievens (R- Alaska). Bellmon and Stevens are the two junior Republicans on the Senate Interior Committee. Camp Hoover is a 164-acre wooded tract in the Blue Ridge mountains that was bought personally by President Herbert Hoover in 1929, The cabins were built by U.S. Marines with lumber that Hoover pur- chased. One cagin is still known as “Prime Minister’s” because British Prime Minister Ramsey MacDonald slept there when he came to sit on an old log in the woods to discuss world disarmament with Hoover in October, 1929. After leaving office in 1933, Hoover donated the camp to the federal government with the proviso that it be used by future Presidents. sargain Vacat The President has established what he calls 2 “open camp” policy to allow his cabinet members and the more impo:tant members of his White House staff to use his ret‘eat in the Catoctin mountains o: Maryland as a place to relax, As guests of the Presi dent, they pay only for the food served to them b the Navy mess stewards, Aside from the presidential lodge originally built for President Franklin D.

Yesterday, the reaction of Len Erik- gon, an 18-year-old wildlife conserva- tion student, was perhaps typical: “I really don’t have anything against Nixon, because he hasn’t done any- thing to affect me yet. What about the speech? I really liked it.” A group of about 30 white radicals, no more, interrupted Nixon’s speech every few minutes with isolated cries such as “Racist society,” and, “What about the war?” But a wave of sus- tained applause ‘swept the Kansas State fieldhouse when the President looked up toward the hecklers and said, “We cannot stand successfully for the rule of law abroad unless we re- spect the rule of law at home.” The state police allowed no protest signs in or in front of the fieldhouse, for “security reasons.” A few Yippies planned a Kool-Aid and cookies party inside, but the food was confiscated at iS Nixon and Students: The Cheer Is Mutual e door. During the speéch;~-three plainclothesmen quickly surrounded one bearded heckler, who had unfurled a bed sheet painted with the slogan “How many have you killed?” As the police approached, the heckler crumpled the sign and tossed it to other students four rows away. But law-and-order won the day: The student who caught the sheet promptly passed it to the police, and he was cheered for it. After Nixon had finished the speech and he and his six-helicopter entourage had whirred away across the checker- board wheat fields, about 100 students and professors gathered in an audi- torium for a rap session. It turned out that the radicals and liberals on campus were better represented at the second meeting than the pro-Nixon students, who were derisively called the “corn-feds.” “Nixon’s claim that we are ending the war is so absurd as to boggle the mind,” declared Dr. Stephen Ambrose, who is the Eisenhower professor of his- tory. (an. i UPI Telephoto “We've been used as a backdrop,” said Rowan Conrad, a graduate sty- dent. “Nixon showed that Kansans are among the dumbest people in the world,” said Jonathan Ross, an anthro- pology student from England. “Td like to see him make that same speech in the South Side of Chicago, Every brother and sister would tell him how brother Fred Hampton was murdered by the pigs,” said Andrew Rollins TU, a freshman and member of the Black Panther Party, John Ronnan, a tall, clean-cut stu- dent who called himself a “small-town farmer,” spoke up for Nixon. “I do think that the office of the President does deserve some respect,” he said. “I don’t think I was duped just because T got up and cheered. I think the hippies aroused the crowd against themselves,” The dean of the college of agricul- ture, Carroll V. Hess, said that he agreed with Nixon that Americans have become increasingly disrespectful of law and order and that this does hurt America’s position abroad, = : — : Nixon used his speech to emphasize that the country faces the greatest crisis in the history’ of education be- cause “at some of our great universi- ties, small bands of destructionists have been allowed to impose their own tule of arbitrary force.” American higher education risks losing the sup- port of the American people, Nixon warned. “It is time,” he added, in a familiar Nixon theme, “for responsible university and college administrators, faculty and student leaders to stand up and be counted.” In what seemed to be a slap ata forthcoming report by his own Com- mission on Campus Unrest, Nixon said that “to attempt to blame govern- ment for all the woes of the university isto seek an excuse, not a reason, for their troubles.” The commission, headed by former Gov. William Scran- ton of Pennsylvania, is expected by some Republicans in Washington to re- port soon that the war in Vietnam is in part responsible for much campus dis- satisfaction. Nixon’s speech was one in a series of lectures at Kansas State in honor of former Gov. Alfred M. Landon, the 1936 Republican presidential nominee, who was on hand to introduce Nixon. As part of the same series, Robert F. Kennedy spoke here on the fourth day of his presidential campaign in 1968, attracting 15,000 cheering students with his call for an end to the Vietnam war. According to local memories, Cal- ifornia GOP Gov. Ronald Reagan did Just as well with the students in 1967. Nixon made one break with the Landon lecture tradition: He did not accept any questions. He appeared on the platform with the state’s two senators and its con- gressmen, all of them Republicans, and with State Attorney General Kent Frizzell, who is running for governor. It was Nixon’s second college appear- ance of the year. The first was an address to 100,000 persons at the Uni- versity of Tennessee in May. As he did in Knoxville, Nixon opened yesterday with a tribute to the local college football team. There were cheers as he pointed out his purple- and-white Kansas State tie and said, “As some of you may have noticed, I am a football buff.” September 17, 1970 \f"

Nixon May Move to Save Hussein —Continued from Page 3 spokesmen were softer. State Depart- ment Press Officer Robert J. Mc-_ Closkey told newsmen yesterday aftcr- noon that “there are no plans for U.S. “military intervention.” Later, McClos- key said that the U.S. ambassador in Amman “has the authority to order evacuation if necessary.” The govern- ment estimates that 40 Americans are assigned to the U.S. embassy in Am- man and that another 350 Americans are in Jordan, some of them the wives of Jordanian citizens. Nixon’s press secretary, Ronald Zeigler denied reports from Chicago, where the President briefed Midwestern news executives privately yesterday, that Nixon had said that the U.S. was prepared to intervene in order to bol- ster Hussein. The Mideast situation was too fluid, Zeigler said, for the U.S. to make specific plans. There were, however, some strong statements from the administration. Defense Secretary Laird, speaking in- formally in Virginia, told reporters that the U,S. is prepared to evacuate Americans from Jordan “if necessary,” using C-130 transports sent to Turkey last week as a contingency when more than 400 persons were held hostage after four airline hijackings. And De- fense Department spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim informed newsmen that some units of the U.S. Sixth Fleet ‘have been moved to “precautionary positions in order to be available for evacuation use if necessary.” Nixon was said to have decided that military intervention in Jordan could not be justified unless American power would clearly make the dif- ference between the Hussein regime’s surviving or failing. The reason for Nixon's extraordinary concern about , even at a time of dwindling American commitments abroad, was said to be that he believed long-range peace in the Mideast hinges on having a stable government in Jordan. Jf Hussein were to be replaced by a Palestinian commando faction, the prospect of a peaceful Mideast settle- ment would seem even more remote than at present. The White House took the extra- ordinary step yesterday of volunteering that the government’s top crisis com- mittee, the Washington Special Action Group, had just met for an hour and a half to discuss the latest situation in Jordan “in light of U.S. interest.” Ziegler also announced that Nixon had spoken with his national security ad- viser, Henry A. Kissinger, at 2 AM yesterday. During the 10 days before the Cam- bodian border crossing last May, there also had been late-night phone calls and sudden meetings of the special action group. But they were not dis- _closed_until_many days later, lest them enemy learn in advance of the im- pending American step. This time, the White House seemed eager to'make it obvious that there was -a crisis atmosphere in high places. Ziegler insisted yesterday that the Jordanian commandos will be “held responsible” for the safety of the 38 American citizens still held by the hi- jackers. In all, 54 hostages of all na- tionalities are still-being retained. Later, Nixon himself declared - that all American citizens, no matter where they were born, “are entitled to the same protection of the American gov- ernment, and they will have it every place in the world.” The question of the hostages’ physi- cal safety in case Nixon does order a military move into Jordan was obvi- ously under intensive discussion here, but no details were made available. One of many questions facing Nixon was the reaction from Moscow. There were some estimates here that Soviet leaders probably would issue a state- ment hacking the guerrillas and warn- ing the U.S. and Israel against moving into Jordan. But the betting was that Russia would not take any stronger measures, partly out of the realization that the Mideast situation could escalate un- controllably if Hussein were replaced by representatives of the Fedayeen. Nixon Would Stop Syria, Iraq From Toppling Hussein mua. TaN & “Joseph Albright he < aoe y ph See a el Washing ton—President Nixon would, if necessary, order American mnititary-intervention in Jordan to keep King Hussein from being deposed by Syrian or Iraqi forces. That was the message that the U.S. was signaling, publicly and privately, yesterday to the Soviet Union and the other powers now caught in the mer- curial Mideast crisis. It was understood that the President was prepared to use the 38 American hostages still held by the Palestinian commandos as his public justification for moving directly into Jordan, : But the chief reason in the Presi- dent’s mind was said to be his convic- tion that it is “vital” to American In- terests in the Mideast for the king to keep his threatened throne. | z As of yesterday, American intelli- gence estimates said that Hussem had enough loyal Bedouin troops to with- stand the pressure of the Palestinian . commandos, or Fedayeen, living in Jordan, But if the radical Arab regimes in Syria and Iraq should intervene directly on the side of the guerrillas, _the estimate was that Hussein might. \\ fall. . There was apparently some prospect that if military power is needed to save ussein, it will come from Israel in- tead of the U.S. That contingency as no doubt high on the agenda for. ixon’s meeting at the White House day with Israeli Premier Golda Meir. ne drawback, however, was the fecl- ing here that Hussein’s position in the Arab world would be permanently de- stroyed by even an indirect military assist from Israel. ‘One immediate fear was that the 12,000 Iraqi troops already stationed in Jordan, originally sent there for de- fense against Israel, might now be or- dered to battle on the side of the fedayeen. Nixon obviously hoped that tough talk and ominous hints would prevent the Iraqi and Syrian govern- ments from moving against Amman. While WNixon’s tough-talk image was being projected privately some public statement. irom (onic September 18, 1970 \f"

But at the same time in California, well- “OWN conservative Max Rafferty was beaten for Superintendent of schools by Wilson Riles, a black, Of nation’s 70 statewide races for senator or gov- €mor, the Democrats won about: 50, The voters worked their will in curious ways. In the territory west of Lake Michigan, the Democrats took over nine previously Republican governorships men § and two previously Republican Senate seats. In that same area, which Nixon sometimes calls the heart of America, the Republicans did not take one Demo- cratic seat, Ironically, the Republicans did gain Sen- ate seats in Tennessee and in the Northeast, In the House of Representatives, the Democrats made their gains chiefly in Midwest districts, where unemployment is above average, and in the wheat- belt districts of the Dakotas, Washington and Minne- sota, where the Nixon administration’s farm program is unpopular, This was a big year for ticket splitting, and it traced out unexpected patterns, Except for Gov. Rockefeller in New York and Gov.-clect Milton J. Shapp in Pennsylvania, 1970 was a bad year for millionaires, Among this year’s losers were Sam Grossman, a Democratic businessman ran for senator in Arizona; Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller of Arkansas; Gov. Frank L, Farrar of South Dakota, who was reportedly hurt by a millionaire image; Gov. Dewey F. Bartlett of Oklahoma, who was tagged a “millionai doesn’t care.” Richard L, Ottinger-of New York and Gov. Claude Kirk of Florida:” One lesson froin the retumns was that, while it helped fort candidate to be telegenic, a blitz of television commercials did not always help a lack- uster or inexperienced candidate, The losing Senate candidates in Illinois, Ohio, and California, and the apparent loser in Indiana were lavishly promoted, but to no avail. Meanwhile, the most successful gimmick of the year was clearly Democrat Lawton Chiles’ 1000-mile walk in Blorida. In the South, he reason Nixon did not make the kind of gains his conservative advisers had expected was that many traditional conservatives migrated back to the Dengocrats. In selected precincts, the 1968 Wallace vote returned to the Democrats by a margin of almost 3-1, ; Across the country, blacks once again voted over: Whelmingly for the Democrats, apparently by a purn GOP Advances margin of about 9-1, However, one reason for Ot- tinger’s loss to Buckley in New York was that, ac- cording to NBC sample precincts, Sen. Charles E. Goodell (R-N.Y.) won three out of 10 of the black votes. That vote is ordinarily 9-1 Democratic. In Ohio, one reason Howard Metzenbaum lost to Taft was that the black vote was light, é Among Jewish voters across the country, NBC sample precincts indicated about 85 per cent voted Democratic, which is higher than in some past years. The Nixon and Agnew campaign appearances had mixed results: of 25 Senate candidates they cam- paigned for, 10 won; of 26 gubernatorial candidates they personally supported, eight won, ‘In normally Republican Winnebago County, Ill, where Nixon made a much-televised appearance last week for Sen. Ralph Smith (R-II), Adlai Stevenson carried about D4 per cent of the vote, And what of this reporter's midterm election meter, rashly invented on election eve to sort out the conflicting victory claims and proclaim who really Won? Scoring one point for every seat a party gains in House, 12 points for every Senate seat captured, : 12 points for every governorship of a big state and six points\\for every governorship that changes hands in a It gives the Democrats nine points for picking up i ts in the House. I gives the Republicans 36 points for the three liberal-to-conservative switches in the Senate, It gives the Democrats 24 votes for picking up governorships of two big states, Ohio and Pennsyl- vania. ¥ It gives the Democrats 48 points for picking up at least eight governorships of smaller states. Result: the Democrats won the election, 81-36, or so it says here, But Richard Nixon was the first President since Zachary Taylor in 1848 to come into office with both Houses of Congress against him. Taylor, who was a Whig, lost 33 points in the election of 1850 and that didn’t even count his governorships. November 5, 1970 \f"
