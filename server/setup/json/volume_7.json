        "ocr_text": "Carter's victory not stopping Kennedy By MARCIA KUNSTEL ~ Cox News Service F MANCHESTER, N.H. — Sen. Edward Kennedy vowed to keep battling for the Democratic presiden- tial nomination, despite President Jimmy Carter’s jaa victory in New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation mary. Kennedy headed South to campaign in Alabama today. Mr. Carter chalked up his third straight win in Tuesday’s balloting, pulling in 49 percent of the vote to Kennedy’s 39 percent. The President scored earlier victories in caucuses in Iowa and Maine. California Gov. Jerry Brown got about 10 percent of the vote, but will skip next week’s Massachusetts primary and the string of southern elections where he apparently has little He plans to face the front-runners again in Wisconsin in April.

See CARTER’S, Page 6. not stopping Kennedy Continued from Page 1. Conversely, President Carter said his victory showed the voters endorse the job he has done. THE PRESIDENT said he did not expect Kennedy to pull out of the race, but was leaving that decision up to the senator. Kennedy’s defeat was especially harmful since it came in his own back yard, a state which has been inundated with former Massachusetts residents fleeing the Bay State’s high taxes over the last few years. At one point last fall, Kennedy was judged to be as much as 30 percentage points ahead of Mr. Carter. The dramatic reversal has been tied to the foreign crises which have rallied popular support behind the President. KENNEDY STAFFERS milling about the after-election party were undeniably disap- pointed in the vote results. But official com- ments were upbeat. “We did better than anyone thought we would do,” said Tom Southwick, Kennedy's press secretary. ‘““We were 25 points behind a week ago, and we're down to less than half of that.” Southwick said the campaign is in good financial shape, brushing aside questions of whether three consecutive losses would turn off the already sporadic flow of contribu- tions. About 108,000 people voted in the Democratic primary. Other candidates were Lyndon LaRouche, the conservative Labor Party candidate running as a Democrat, and Richard Kay from Cleveland. The votes split 52,754 for Carter; 41,580 for Kennedy; 10,- 735 for Brown; 2,316 for LaRouche; and 644 for Kay. BROWN’S SHOWING was about as ex- pected. He has labored under severe finan- cial problems, which probably spurred the decision to bow out of the next round of primaries. Next Tuesday, Massachusetts holds its pri- mary. Kennedy is seen as being in some trouble in his own home state, although he is not expected to lose. Jody Powell, Mr. Carter’s press secretary, predicted Kennedy would take 60 percent of the vote there. Although Kennedy is campaigning in Ala- bama today, he is not expected to put a major effort in the South where Mr. Carter maintains a solid grip on the electorate. February 27, 1980 \f"

Plus, the voter turnout was low in all three states, and it was Democrats who cat this one out in droves. In Georgia, fewer than 400,000 Demo- rats bothered to vote in their primary, compared to more than 500,000 in 1976, The Democrats here gave their home- grown President about 90,000 fewer yotes than four years ago.

The President also saw Ronald Rea- gan emerge the unequivocal Republican Victor in the three states, capturing 105 delegates to the 9 won by his chief oppo- nent George Bush. That's good news for the President and his allies, who believe Reagan is the Republican they could most easily defeat in November. blue GOP ballot instead, Alabama resi- dents did. The Republican vote there more than tripled the previous count, growing from, 53,000 to more than 185,000. The Demo- cratic total plummeted to little more than 200,000, a third of the 1976 figure. No crossover is permitted in Florida, where both the Democrats and Republi- cans drew fewer voters than in 1976. Carter supporters like Charles Graves, However, a few dark clouds did hover over the President. Carter didn't fare so well with Jewish voters scandalized by the United Nations blunder. For example, Kennedy narrowly won Florida’s Broward County, a sector just north of Miami with a highly con. centrated Jewish population. A high-ranking Georgia Democrat, who has been a Carter backer, warned that the Israeli-U.N. issue could spel) trouble down the road, especially when the Georgia campaign manager, at- tributed the poor turnout to the lackadai- sical Democratic campaigns, rather than to disaffection with the commander-in- chief, Together Kennedy and Carter didn't - spend $100,000 and certainly didn’t pro- voke mass interest, while Republicans kept the adrenalin spurting until near the end. See PRIMARY, 134 March 12, 1980 PEHIMAPY canines tom 1 Although Graves and Marge Thurman, the Democratic chairwoman in Georgia, dismissed the low Democratic voter draw as insignificant for November, others gave it some weight, Jay Beck, Carter's campaign chief in Alabama, said before the votes even were cast that a big defection to the GOP could hurt, “T think it'll mean a much harder time in November,” he said. “On the 11th they've got to say they want to vote in the Democrat or Republican primary. If they do take that step, my guess is they will tend to vote Republican in November.” Kennedy, who refused to face the public Tues- day night to comment on his sweeping loss, found something to worry about besides meager totals. The Associated Press-NBC gyrvey of voters leaving polling places in Florida showed the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident lowered Kennedy in the eyes of 54 percent of those polled The figure was only 37 percent in New Hampshire and 26 percent in Massachusetts. It could get worse. The New york Times pub- lished another Chappaquiddick eynose Wednesday. The senator earned little more than half what he expected in the Southern primaries — his cam: palgners had counted on 50 delegates — but the main Democratic challenger wasn't ready to call it uits. “We didn't come here with q towel to throw in, and we're not going to throw jn one,” said Robert Kennedy Jr... the senator's nephew and Alabama campaign manager. “We're looking to Illinois and New York.” The Illinois primary next Tuesday, the first in a big industrial state, is crucial for Kennedy. But reports from there indicate he is sagging badly be- hind Carter again. The outlook is brighter there for Rep. John Anderson, a native who has captured the imagina- tions of the disenchanted in both parties. He tallied 9 percent each in Georgia and Florida without cam- paigning at all. He wasn’t on the Alabama ballot, Two new polls show Anderson leading in Illi- ois. The congressman was quoted Tuesday night as predicting the laggard Southern showing wouldn't transfer to the Midwest,.but saying he didn't need a clear-cut victory at home anyway to stay viable. “If Mr. Bush considers himself a national candidate after the devastating defeats in Florida, Alabama and Georgia, then I think I’m just as much of a national candidate as he,” Anderson was quoted by the Associated Press. George Bush, indeed, suffered serious setbacks in this last round of balloting. There seems little for him to look forward to in Illinois. Bush had pumped considerable cash into both Florida and Alabama, though he virtually ignored Georgia. He apparently selected Alabama as the deep South state for his southern stand, one that would prove him a vote-getter in Carter’s backyard, But Bush snagged less than 30 percent of the vote there and just made 30 percent in Florida, where last minute hopes got buoyed far beyond reality. Florida, in fact, delivered a nasty blow in the AP-NBC survey. Bush, characterized as the centrist appealing to a wide spectrum of right to middle voters, was the choice of only 16 percent of those who said they were moderates. The self-described moderates gave Reagan 46 percent of their votes and 35 percent to Anderson. The breakdown of voters calling themselves conservative was 65 percent for Reagan and 24 per- cent for Bush. A similar split in Tinois would be crushing, since Anderson is the darling of the leftward leaning this year. That would leave precious little territory for Bush. But in a network interview from Illinois Bush was stoic and determined to stick it out. “It's a national race. It's just beginning. I'm not the kind of person who gets discouraged when things don't go well,” Bush said, disclaiming any thought of withdrawal. As for Reagan, his big Southern victories may roll a new and more formidable opponent in his path within days: former President Gerald Ford, _ Who said he might run if Reagan looks invincible before other GOP challengers. Ford was in Washington Wednesday to consult with advisers about whether to enter the fray, after days of champing at the bit to face Reagan again, March 12, 1980 (continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": " By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Writer 7 REIDSVILLE, Ga. NE THURSDAY evening last month dozens of prison guards gathered on a bank of the Ohoopee River, vainly seeking a means to vent their anger over the latest in the long string of insults they felt they had suffered. They clamored to walk out, call a wud- cat strike at the state’s most volatile and dan- gerous prison. ‘Their frustration was no secret; state troopers already had been alerted for emer- gency duty at Georgia State Prison. But they did not strike, because Charles Balkcom was summoned’fo the meeting at the the orders of U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimo. “We're working with the monitor now to develop joint plans for compliance. To rush at it would be chaotic, caus- ing more problems than it would be worth,” Austin said in an interview last week. “I’m committed to it. The staff is committed to it. It’s the law and it will be done.” One person not committed to it was Charles Balkcom. That is why he forced David Evans, the commissioner of the Department of Offender Rehabilitation, to dismiss him. ‘ “I told Evans I wasn't going to lend my support to the court orders any more, that I was tired of it and I didn’t want to go through any more of it. I painted him in a corner where he had to do something,” Balkcom said. In choosing involuntary separation, the 40-year-old warden with 22 years of state service (and 30 months of accumulated leave) became immediately eligible for re- tirement pay. river bridge and told them not to. Charles Balkcom, the warden whose firing incensed the officers that day, convinced his men they could not afford to lose their jobs, too. “They were saying they wanted to go with me,” Balkcomt recalled recently. “I told them to get their tails back up there.” Balkeom was perhaps the only man they would heed, the deposed’ authority figure of a work family nurtured over four decades in a place where sides are drawn clear and the: ties bind tight. .

He was the first staff member killed by in- and on mates inside the institution. Reidsville Residents Resent New Regime, Changes at Prison in the white, cinder block houses built for prison staff families, fishing in the state- stocked ponds that dot the grounds, socializing in the small clubhouse on a wooded knoll. It was the latest affront to a family under attack for months. The most encompassing critique, heard from a variety of sources, is that the prison simply can never be made to work as a mod- ern penal institution. In the last decades of the 20th century, when inmates here are predominantly black and primarily urban, critics say this place is anachronistic, It is too rural, they say, draws its staff from a community that is too closed- minded and homogeneous, is too steeped in racism and too ( sumed with its own history of blood and violence. Interviews with staff members, Reids- ville town leaders, and present and former wardens, reveal a community drawn tight in the face of attack for sustenance from within. They showed strong opinions and sometimes firm resistance to change. They showed re- sentment, above all, toward the federal judge who has intruded upon daily operations here with orders for vast improvement, and toward the special monitor who reported the court orders are not being observed. Sam Austin, sent from Atlanta to be act- ing warden until a permanent replacement is hired, vows the prison will fully implement See PRISON, 64 mates in several areas of his exhaustive investigation. “I personally feel the in- mates knew when Nathan was coming and made things dirtier,” said one counselor who, like others interviewed, asked that his name not be printed. Many gave that response, although a professional sani- tarian who inspected the prison found numerous signs of accumulated filth and ne- giect. : Some blamed the inmates. “It’s just like building a new hog pen and putting hogs in it. They’ll mess it up,” said one veteran corrections offi- cer. “You could fix up a cell, paint it and clean it up, and in 24 hours they'll have it messed up.” A younger guard, whose family has been involved with the prison for years, believes Nathan’s report was needed and will do good. , “I believe it’s going to modernize things. It’s been behind the times (here). . . - There's been problems with the sanitation and _ the roaches. All it took was to get somebody in there to make them do it.” However, he did disagréed with the monitor’s charges on brutality. “It seems he was just tell- ing the inmates’ side,” he said. “I agree with him about everything except the brutal- | ity.” i A counselor and upper leve] supervisor said Natkan’s report included accusations that they used unjustifiable force, and both said they later were absolved in further questioning of inmates. Nathan had two lie detec. tor tests given to each inmate who reported incidents of brutality, but all the prison staff questioned dismissed the reliability of polygraph tests. - Besides the monitor’s charges, officers are reeling under another ruling by Judge Alaimo, this one holding three officers responsible in a beat- ing which broke an inmate’s Unknown date after Warden Ballcom's departure in March 1980 \f leg. The state was fined for damages, and the officers themselves were fined a total of $7,000. Their co-workers have established a defense fund-to help pay off the fine and possibly to take further legal steps. “You don’t really know where you stand over there now, now that Judge Alaimo ruled against those’ three guys. . . . The inmate would- n’t cooperate and they gave him what you’d call a whip- ping. None of the officers hold it against them. They were doing what they was told. They didn’t use no more force than they needed to,” said one guard, explaining the officers had been ordered to strip search inmates, and this one resisted. What about the broken leg? “That was a freak acci- dent,” he said. “Nobody thought them boys meant to do it.”’ The veteran officer nearing retirement cannot understand recent events. “They might as well turn it over to the NAACP. That’s what they’ve done anyway,” he said. “Inmates can do any- thing now — knock you down, spit on you, throw horse ma- nure on you — and you can’t anything. ... aah a2 dn at public opinion. They think we're dogs. I’ve never heard anything about the victims who were raped ‘strators they or murdered. You never see anything about sympathy for them. . . . Just like that July incident (when Harrison was killed and another officer in- jured). “That’s not gonna happen again, not even if we have to lock out the governor and the commissioner and the warden,” he vowed. “We're not gonna have to look at bodies butchered like that again and not do. anything about it.” The community of about 2,500 population depends on Georgia State Prison as its biggest employer, and _ it stands behind the people who work there. After the mayor made what many consider a blun- der — he told Atlanta demon- shouldn’t march on the town of Reidsville, be- cause it has nothing to do with the prison they were protesting — the Chamber of Commerce quickly promoted a prison appreciation day among downtown merchants. “As far as the prison is concerned, we’re proud to have them here,” said Frank Ritchie, owner of the Western Auto, a former city council- man and all around civic booster. “I don’t know why these things have come about, why the inmates got the au- thority to do these things, to have the federal judge take over the rules and regula- tions.” : ‘Um committed to it (compliance with the court order). The staff is committed to it. It’s the law and it will be done.\" Sam Austin Acting warden Bobby Collins, who runs Collins Department Store in a downtown clustered at one main intersection, agreed with Ritchie that most people in Reidsville don’t believe what's been said and written about the prison. “The people who work out there, they’re fine. They’re sympathetic, they’re elders in the church, a part of the com- munity,” said Collins, a mem- ber of a founding Reidsville family. “I feel most of our publicity has been unjust.” Maybe some improvements should be made, he said, but it’s going too far. “Thereé’s talk now that they’re going to have to pro vide outside maids and jani- tors,’’ he quip 3 Ritchie said the prison has kept the community stable, especially since wages and benefits have improved over the years. More staff housing has been built, where families pay about $70 a month rent, including utilities. And the hours have dropped from the 50 or 60 that was common when he moved to town 26 years ago. “Now some of the best jobs are out there,” Ritchie said. “I can think of a lot of young folks who would have drifted off in the the past but work at the prison now. It’s kept the young people and increased our population.” A survey of around 100 Tattnall County residents, taken in connection with a court case, found some re- vealing social attitudes. For example, 77 percent agreed that people accused of crimes should be required to prove their innocence. About 85 percent generally favored the death penalty, while al- most 90 percent said they felt capital punishment should be used more often than it is. Of those questioned, 35 per- ecent said either they or a close family member at that time worked at a state prison facility. Regarding prison issues, 82 percent said prison- ers are treated too well in our society, 50 percent agreed that prisoners accused of crimes by prison officials probably are guilty, and 76 percent felt prison riots are not a sure sign that conditions are inhumane and unfair. In his draft report, special monitor Vincent Nathan drew a most negative conclusion about the propects for change at Georgia State Prison. “There are some problems at Reidsville that money can fix; the less tractable difficul- ties, however, are those of people and their attitudes,’ he said. “‘There is a longstanding and deep tradition of vio— lence, brutality, and racism to be uprooted before pregress can be made toward develop- ing an institution in keeping with minimal standards of de- cency, the court’s orders in this case, and the laws of the state of Georgia.” But Nathan removed those comments from his final re- port, in part because he agreed the remarks were sub- jective opinion, and partly in a spirit of compromise hoped to attract new cooperation from the prison staff. Reeently he started meet- ing with staff representatives, which he, prison administra- tors and lower level staff all believe will ease the court order compliance process Na- than oversees. 2 Sam _ Austin, the acting warden, is convinced im- provements will go more smoothly once the $40-million renovation project is finished. It will divide Georgia State Prison into four small prisons, each a virtually self- contained unit. That will enhance both se- curity and the promotion of rehabilitative programs, Aus- tin said. “What the monitor was Saying is essentially that Reidsville is irredeemable — -bring out the bulldozers ana pack it up,” Austin § said, characterizing Nathan’s draft conclusion as overly pessimis- tic. “I think that’s not true by any means. Certainly if Y thought the place was ir- redeemable, I wouldn’t be here.’’ After Warden Ballcom's departure in March 1980 (continued) \f"

By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Writer A group of speculators is quietly buying blocks of property in Cabbage- town, and residents fear redevelop- ment of the neighborhood will drive them out and destroy the pocket of transplanted Appalachia, The developers, however, say they will try to retain the longtime tenants who wish to stay. They say they hope to install an array of badly needed so- Cial services in the area known as one of the city's poorest, toughest and proudest white sections. The four principals - Orman and Priscilla House, William Harrison and John Hood — refused to detail their development plans, which they said are not in final form, In fact, they have not accumulated all the property they want. The dilapidated houses now rent from $65 to $125 a month. Community residents say the developers have esti mated rentals of the redone units will range from $200 to $300, Some fear the tenants - many on Social Security or other fixed incomes — could not stand the new rents or purchase prices of homes rehabilitated in the fashion sweeping Atlanta's in- town neighborhoods, The developers are working to get rent subsidies or other government aid for residents who want to stay as ten: ants or perhaps even purchase the remodeled housing, but that has not allayed the fears, “Tt will devastate that community,” said City Councilman John Sweet, whose district includes Cabbagetown, “What's happening in Cabbagetown is what's happening in every other community in the inner city,” he said, predicting the changes would be felt more acutely by the people who have See CABBAGETOWN, 4A ye HAN of Appalac April 6, 1980 \f OWN contoues trom 14 @ | 2 3 | Ol eee place bbagetown,” he said. like,” the friend help the people?” Sweet see change the character of the Tine neh Wk loko such that it will not be Ca good: for tert og asked, “if it don't Councilman pects to the facelift. “Tt will “Ts that i most of which y had 8 though s row he made only - revital have re- . have arin peo — the punks, the thugs — we hope they what’ but hav the Phe Houses and Harrison me e me mi ly een Cones Mh, @ country store and a = plans for the 2825 hoses i the a ve op 't have to fit the John Portman into and tron amily homes for at . : a rgb April 6, 1980 (continued) a5 a3! gee the $5,500, purchased bi single- $3,000 to 7,000.

        "ocr_text": "Economic Gap Still Exists, Report Shows | ‘New South’ Is Myth for Blacks By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Stal Writer ; After 30 years of social upheaval, black Southerners have not come close to bridging the economic gap separating them from whites, according to a new report. The “State of the South,” prepared by the Southern Regional Council and made public Saturday, also finds the dramatic political gains of blacks leveling off and, in some cases, being reversed. The New South born of economic revolution has kept the financial struc- ture of the Old South, with white men as a class monopolizing the premier posi- tions, said Steve Suitts, executive direc- tor of the. SRC. “What is so chilling and depressing to me about all this is that it is impossible for anyone to explain to young black men and women — and to young white women — how it is their economic Myth Continued from 1A the past 30 years has hardly improved or in fact has declined.” Suitts said the median income of blacks has not been dragged down by an expansion of blacks not in the work force. The percent of blacks in the work force has increased over this period, he said, and the percent of able-bodied blacks in the southern work force is “substantially no lower than whites.” Politically, black strides foward in the South have been momentous, according to the report. : The number of black elected officials in this region increased from ‘only a. handful” in 1965 to more than 2,700 in 1979. ] “In less than two decades, blacks have hanged from political object to political participant and have made the South the . home of a majority of the nation’s biack elected officials and the most phenome- nal American political change in this century,” the report said. However, it adds, the momentum is petering out and the success rate level- ing off. ‘ For example, the number of black elected office holders increased by 26. status is no better than their grandpar- ents’ status a decade ago or two decades ago,” Suitts said. Compiled from federal _ statistics released in the last two years, the re- port’s economic section traces income disparities from 1950 through 1975. It shows southern black families made some gains, increasing median family in- come from 56 percent of white family income to 62 percent of white income by 1975. Nationwide, black families also raised their incomes to 62 percent of what white families earn, even though the na- tional figure in 1950 stood at 51 percent — lower than the black status in the South that year. A breakdown by sex, however, shows black men in the South lost ground over the period. They made 58 percent of what white men earned in 1950, but only 57 percent by 1975. percent from 1970 to 1971, but the’ in- crease in 1980 will probably be less than -- 6 percent, according to the report. While the progress is obvious, it hasn't . nearly exhausted the potential. Another gauge of changing economic conditions has been the growth of black- owned businesses, the report said. : It estimated more than 200,000 black- - controlled corporations and businesses now operate in the nation, with most in’ the South. Black-controlled banks _ in- creased from 21 to at least 45 between 1970 and 1975. But the businesses are small, offering . little aid for blacks seeking jobs. In 1972, four out of five black companies had no paid employees, and the report said fig- ures recently released for 1977 show no > change in the pattern. 1 Black businesses represent about § 3 percent of the private firms nationwide, comprising less than 2 percent of the country’s gross revenues from partner- | ships and sole proprietorships, the report | said. : It translated those figures into more _ ' meaningful terms: “If all the 1979 reve- | nue of all the black-controlled companies © Nationally, black male income as a percentage of white male income in- creased from 52 percent to 61 percent. Black women progressed some, but they had the furthest to go. Their income rose from 25 percent to 30 percent of white male income in the South, and from 23 percent to 35 percent nationally. White women, nationally and in the region, fell even further behind white men. With income at 44 percent of white male income in 1950, they dropped to 40 percent in the South and 37 - tionwide 25 years later. eine Although the fi ur j only th gures track income rough 1975, the report ulates that the 1980 census will confirm fice statistics and conclusions: “In the ab- sence of a miracle, the comparative eco- nomic status of blacks in the South over 4 See MYTH, 22A . worsen conditions. . in America were pooled, those funds would probably be less than half of the gross receipts received by the Exxon Corp. last month.” In an interview, Suitts offered no im- mediate solutions to the earnings gap or other economic developments: But he did have some suggestions about what would, s X Balancing the federal budget by cut! ting out programs for job training or in-; come redistribution — such as welfare and food stamps — would spell disaster for blacks, he said. ave “The figures we see now are going. t get much worse if those programs ar, cut out,” he said. , if _“The clear lesson here is that, © much as we may hope it were not, tk government and private sector need = of life that remains in the South and ¢.- rest of-the nation. — & “On _ the-economic issues,” he s2= “folks born black in the South today look forward to a future no better tf those who were born black in 1950, less the government changes and = country changes.” - yn § eae realize that-race is very much a “ef \f"

        "ocr_text": "By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Convention Bureau NEW YORK — Concern that Presi- dent Carter cannot draw out the crucial _black vote in November is jangling the -merves of even some of his most ardent black backers. While some campaign operatives sound assurances that blacks will flock to the polls — and vote Democratic — in the fall, many more of those queried about political alienation in the black community said it runs so deep that fail- ure to address it could cost Carter the election. Interviews with black delegates to the Democratic National Convention and with other black leaders here observing the spectacle produced frequent warn- ings that the administration must take visible initiatives toward black Ameri- ans. = No one suggested that blacks, who gave Carter at least 90 percent of their vote in 1976, would vote for Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan in 1980. Some blacks who had supported Sen. Ted Kennedy were murmuring kind words about. independent John Anderson partly because he felt Carter had not lived up to his obligation toward blacks. “There’s no question that generating a significant black vote for the President will be much more difficult this year, be- cause the promises he made in '76 have not been kept,” said White, whose home State gave Carter a plurality of less than 125,000 yotes and a total of nearly 300,- 000 black ballots. . The economy and high urban unem- ployment among blacks also will hurt rter, he said, suggesting they will sit out the election if the administration doesn’t sharpen its commitment to minorities and stop trying to balance the federal budget at the expense of the r. “That would be a travesty,” he said, “because Ronald Reagan would be the worst thing that could happen to blacks.” White aqmitted he personally will vote for Carter in any event, but does not plan to campaign for the President with- out a stronger motivation. Walter Fauntroy, a non-voting mem- ber of Congress representing Washing- ton, D.C, is another Kennedy partisan who said he wants to see more tangible evidence of Carter's concern for blacks. after Kennedy. lost the nomination, but few said they expect a black bandwagon for something as alien to the black ex- perience as voting independent. “I believe blacks will vote Demo- cratic,” said Benjamin Hooks, president of the NAACP. ‘The critical question for Mr. Carter is what will the number. of the black vote be. “If it’s 90 percent of 40. million, it might not be enough. If it's 90 percent of 60 million, it might be,’ Hooks said. Hooks was slightly more optimistic’ than some of his peers that enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket will be gener- ated this fall among blacks, but even he said it will take considerable energy be- tween now and the general election to make that happen. “It’s going to take a lot of work to motivate blacks, to convince them that the system is working,” said George Banks, an Ohio delegate pledged to Carter. “There’s a lot of apathy among all the minorities.” A staff representative with the United Steelworkers union, Banks predicted labor will be instrumental in getting out the votes of all traditionally Democratic constituencies. And Mayor Carl Officer of East St. Louis cautioned that his personal support of Carter will be hard to translate into votes from his predominantly black city with a population of about 85,000. “I can’t walk out to the street and promise jobs, I've got to deliver them,” he said, “Unless some very strong, posi- tive programs come between now and November, I’m going to vote for Jimm Carter, but I'll be hard pressed to deliver my constituents.” 4 Ben Brown, the highest ranking black person in the Carter campaign as its deputy director, verged on anger when countering the critiques from other black leaders who say they are dissatisfied with the President’s record. He cited a $2 billion youth employ- ment -and education act Carter sent to Congress recently, the creation of jobs and training in the Youth Conservation Corps, the appointment of blacks to the post of U.S. Treasurer, to the job of chief procurement officer and to 38 federal judgeships: ““We’ve made the progress.. That com- mittment is there,” said Brown. ‘Man, we've never been a part of a presidential _ team like this before.” Hurt Carter In Ohio the black turnout was viewed as instrumental in 1976, standing at about 285,000 votes. Carter’s slender winning margin there was less than 8,000 votes. “He's going to have to come into the communities and sell his programs,” said Banks, who expressed confidence in the Carter record over the last four years, but questioned whether it will be sufficiently communicated to the masses. Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson, this year a strong Carter supporter and con- vention delegate, also praised the Presi- dent’s actions on behalf of minorities and said the facts have not.been widely circulated. “A campaign is not only a quest for power,” Jackson said. “It is an educa- tional process.” “The President’s public relations in some cases leaves much to be desired,” he said, predicting Carter's image will be improved to more closely match his record by November. State Rep. John White Jr. of Philadel- phia, where Carter captured about 92 recent of the black vote in 1976, dif- ered with Jackson’s assessment. White supported Sen. Ted Kennedy this year, Brown also questioned whether the President’s image is indeed fraying among minorities, saying Carter beat Kennedy among blacks in all but two primary states and two-thirds of the black convention delegates are pledged to Carter. . “Maybe some of those leaders (ques- tioning black support) are out of touch with the black community,” he said. The Rev. Joseph Lowery of. Atlanta, president of the Southern Christian Lead- ership Conference, pointed to this sum- mer's racial disturbances in several cities as ample proof of black anger and frustration with the political process. _I really think it’s going to be very difficult to build up much enthusiasm for Carter,” said Lowery. “The Carter administration has been too content to let millions of people suffer . . . He did- n't fulfill his obligation (to blacks). He put us on the back burner. _, At no time during his administration did he have a powerful black voice in the White House,” said Lowery. “At no time was there a figure of power who could get his attention.” “A lot of black folks,”’ “might stay home in November.” ead a August 14, 1980 \f"

They saw Carter bring the South back to its traditional spot in the bosom of the Democratic Party in 1976 and are loathe to believe a native son could be repudiated in favor of the Republicans, who were anathema there not so long ago. But most also admit Carter would lose in the South were the election held today, conced- ing his popularity has plunged among South- erners as it has throughout the nation.

Louisiana state Democratic Chairman Jesse Bankston said the MOSt recent polls in his state show Reagan leading by a 49- $2 percent margin. Louisiana recently elected its first Republi- can governor since Reconstruction. This is the first year state and local parties can spend money on the national ticket, but Bankston said he doesn’t ex- pect his party to do much. “We'll spend what we can get,” he said. “We always have difficulty raising money in Louisiana. But we'll go back next week and meet on it.” ; Democrats in Alabama said Carter is in obvious trouble there, but most predicted he can pull that state out in the less than three months left before the election. ; “The turnout will be crucial,” said Mayor Richard Arring- ton, the first black chief executive of Birmingham. “There is a large conservative constituency, and it will be very close. I'm concerned, but I’m confident he'll carry the state.” U.S. Rep. Ronnie Flippo, whose north Alabama district is the state’s Democratic stronghold, said he has heard Carter’s support is sagging back home. He was not so confident. “People are frustrated and it’s hard to translate frustra- tion into votes,” Flippo said. “I think he has a chance.” Both North and South Carolina have the advantage of strong Democratic governors who will be campaigning for the ional ticket. : ait last figures give him a 12-point lead in North Ca- rolina, according to delegation vice chairman Russell Walker. The party there also plans to spend $250,000 on a “unity cam- paign” for the entire ticket, which he said will include polls, a telephone bank and targeted voter registration drives. In South Carolina, Carter campaign chief Jim Quacken- bush said the President and Reagan are about neck and neck, but he guessed that the momentum of the convention will push Carter ahead. The party there plans to spend only $15,000 to $20,000 to supplement the national campaign. In Tennessee, party chairman Bill Farris said there is no budget and that plans are yet to be laid, though Republicans claim their candidate is running neck and neck with the Presi- dent in the polls there.

        "ocr_text": "Carter camp not bending to GOP efforts to force more campaigning in the South By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Stafi Writer Despite Republican claims that President Carter is run- ning scared i i i Significant resources only into Texas and Florida. It is rely- ing heavily on _ traditional Democratic Party structures to help defend other states. The Carter camp has not yet bent under opponents’ ef- forts to force a diversion o valuable funds and manpower to what once was considered a safe home territory.. Leaders of Republican nominee Ronald Reagan’s campaign and of the i pendent political action com- mittees backing him hope to make Carter raise an expen- sive defense, by mounting their own campaigns in the President's back yard. Late last week U.S. Rep. Carroll Campbell (R-S.C.) claimed that’ the effort has borne fruit. “We decided that the thing to do was to run against (Carter) in the South, that we would accomplish as a mini- mum getting Mr. Carter to campaign in the South, ex- pend his time and resources trying to hold his home base,”’ Campbell said. “And at the maximum we would win a number of states down here. . . . We have succeeded in the minimum — obvi- ously.”’ He cited three visits by Carter, but one was the cam- paign kickoff always intended for a southerly locale, and a second was a Georgia trip that earned more than $500,- 0o0G for Democratic cam- paigning on the President’s behalf. The Reagan campaign will conduct polls over the next couple weeks and will decide after Oct. 15 exactly which states will see concentrated campaigning leading to the Nov. 4 election, Campbell said. He guessed Texas and Florida almost certain to be among the targets, with as many as three or four other Dixie states getting lesser doses of attention. ~~ ° > The selection of Texas and Florida would be no sur Since each has been expected to host a close contest. Both the GOP and Democrats have been expecting to stage major actions. But in other places, too both sides see soft spots that could be.vulnerable to Repub- lican initiatives. The Carter- Mondale campaign, however, apparently is not ready to allocate unplanned sums to shore up the Southern base so important to the 1976 victory. Rather, it has elected to tie itself into the Democratic grass-roots organizations, which are permitted for the first time this year to spend money on federal elections. Reagan will attempt to do tne same, but the GOP hardly enjoys as extensive a party structure as the Democratic machine that has.commanded Southern politics for decades. Mississippi exemplifies the Carter-Mondale campaign pattern. Bill Combs, the state cam- paign coordinator, said he has “meager resources” which partially support about a dozen full-time staff members and a single headquarters of- fice. Some of the personnel are paid partly by the Demo- cratic party, and they are ex- ted to use offices around the state which county party organizations will finance. Combs does not expect a seen everywhere. In contrast Reagan will benefit from his >, an anti-Carter message. : a Republican Democrat Statt Map—Mike Lester| The map shows presidential election results from 1976 “Republicans traditionally run media campaigns and Democrats traditionally run organization campaigns,” said Combs, and he plans to plug into the Democratic organiza- tion in Mississippi. Not only has the party long had a network for voter regis- tration and get out the vote efforts, but it also has lots of elected officials who will be stumping for Carter. + “They all run (for election) here and they're all going to run again. And their people are active and that’s probably the most significant political activity. It’s of incalculable value,” Combs said. “The Republicans don’t have that. With some variations, the story is similar in places like Louisiana, Alabama, Ken- tucky and Tennessee. .. In Georgia the Carter-Mon- dale campaign has done little except throw a major fund- raiser to get money that will be spent elsewhere. The Democratic Party here is at- Florida is different. In Texas, where 26 elec- toral votes are at stake, the Carter campaign has 60 paid staff working out of seven of- fices and a host of satellite offices financed by Demo- crats locally. So far the campaign has a $275,000 budget, which might be increased next month, ac cording to press secreta Kathy Baker. That doesn’t i clude media costs. Florida, with 17 electora votes, has what press secre tary Bob Liff described as “ very full operation,” with field organizers in all the September 28, 1980 \f"

So how great is Hill’s ac- cess to the President? “It's as great as he wants it to be,” Brown said. “He can ' get through to the President personally at any time.” Blacks do not uniformly praise either Hill or Carter’s efforts to keep communica- tions open with minorities. “Of the so-called black leaders, they (in the White House) feel more comfortable with Jesse than with other black leaders,” said one black political figure here, who asked to remain unidentified. “It’s because he doesn’t ask them for anything. He’s in- capable of making a de- mand.” “Here is the man who is by far the closest black to the President,” he said. “Ask any- body you talk to — What has he done? Who has he had ap pointed? What contract has he brought in?” Other black leaders were hard-pressed to come up with Specifics of what Hill has brought back from the White House, although many were certain his influence has benefited the black com- munity. Leroy Johnson, former State senator, said he could relate some examples but fel that would be improper. “His accessibility isn’t fo Jesse Hill per se, but it re bounds to the benefit masses of blacks. .. .Yo can call Jesse and Jesse wi pick up the phone and call White House and try to he ou,” Johnson said. The Atlanta Journal / THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION The ability of Hill and other blacks simply to get through to the highest levels of government reduces frus- tration among . blacks in general, he added. An Atlantan close to the Martin Luther King Jr. Cen- ter for Social Change, of which Hill is a director, said Hill helped get federal grants for the center. “But Coretta (Scott King) and Andy (Young) have pretty good connections, too,” he noted, naming the two most well-known directors of the King center who also are close to Carter. Leon Hall, an aide to Mayor Maynard Jackson and a long-time civil rights activ- ist, said Hill was one of several black leaders who twisted the President’s arm until he finally agreed to back a revised Humphrey-Hawkins full employment bill. Others said he has bird- dogged the of federal Hall pointed to other kinds of access he believes are just as important in government, such as blacks Carter ap- pointed to innumerable posi- tions. The statistics are plentiful and impressive: two Cabinet secretaries (U.N. Ambassador Donald McHenry holds Cabi- net status); 16 black ambassa- dors; 27 blacks in White House policy staff positions; 51 blacks appointed to sub- Cabinet level jobs and 40 blacks appointed to the federal judiciary, more than the number of blacks made federal judges by all other presidents combined. “There are people there to shepherd things through. They minimize the things that fall through the cracks. They keep track of things and alert us if interest is waning in a partic- ular area,” Hall said. Others say access to the President may be a hollow achievement. William O. Walker, the publisher of the black weekly the Call and Post in Cleve- land, will endorse Ronald Reagan this week. He has backed both Republicans and Democrats, he said, and took no Stand in the 1976 race. “Black unemployment has doubled. The relief rolls have increased,” Walker said. “Everything for blacks has gotten worse under Carter. So we might just as well try a change. , “What good is access if you don’t get anything out of it?” he asked. Even Carter’s supporters, like Hall, don’t give the Presi- dent an unqualified endorse- ment. “TI am disappointed that all this access has not translated into legislation, into things that would effect the poor and urban communities,” he said. There has been nothing, he said, of the caliber of the civil rights bills or the voting rights act. A black leader from Phila- delphia, who actively supports Carter, had similar reserva- tions. “I’m not impressed with being invited to the Rose Gar- den or the pink room or the blue room, and going home and telling everybody I met with Jimmy Carter,” he said. “The problem he’s got to overcome is following through.” Atlanta’s Johnson said eco- nomic conditions will be felt in November. tease SUNDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1980 Unfortunately we (blacks) are hit the hardest when the economy hits a dip,” he said. “That clouds our vision. The fact that he’s appointed X number of blacks to the federal bench, the fact that he has so many blacks in second echelon positions, that doesn’t ring a bell.” From the start of this presidential campaign, black leaders voiced reservations over getting out the vote in black communities. In spite of the examples they can and have been raising to convince voters that Carter does have the interest of minorities at les like Jesse HI — they still express fears that black turnout will be no better than mediocre next month. “The politicians, my peers, may be united (behind the said the administration),” { official from Philadelphia. “But there still is a great deal of skepticism and pessismism among the electorate.” October 5, 1980 (continued) "

        "ocr_text": "Democrats help other states By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Steff Yvriter Volunteers working for President Carter’s re-election toiled diligently at the Peachtree Street state headquarters last week, compiling eall lists from voter registration sheets and telephone books. The sheets and the phone books were from Alabama. That may be the best measure of what to expect from the Carter/Mondale campaign in the President’s home state. “I would suspect you'll find a lot of cases where we’ll be doing things for neighboring states,” said Betty Rainwater, the Georgia campaign coordinator. ‘“‘Folks who can afford to travel, we even want them to go into other states.” Emphasize “who can afford to travel.” That’s because the Carter campaign isn’t pour- ing much cash into a place everyone, including the opposition, expects to be a pushover for the Democrat this year. One knowledgeable estimate places the Carter campaign budget for Georgia at a mea- ger $22,000. Volunteers who want to pay their ow: way are welcome to be as active as they can- Even the state Democratic Party had to pay ae See DEMOCQAT-. 18 Democrat Continued from 1A the national Carter/Mondale campaign $1,900 for the posters, brochures and other paraphernalia that are part of the quadrennial ritual. If the party wants more stuff for statewide distribution, it must arrange the printing and foot the bills. That is not unlikely, since the party got tired of waiting and printed its own bumper stickers already, and is trying to figure out how to divvy up the total 500 posters sent from Washington for all of Georgia. “That’s about enough to cover a medium-sized city,” said Tommy Cole- man, executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party. The campaign budget, of course, will be supplemented by Democratic county committees throughout the state, which are bearing the greatest share of the campaign burden through “vote Demo- crat” drives that will benefit all the party’s nominees. Coleman could not guess how much the locals might put out this fall, since organizing barely has begun. For the last two weeks he has traveled around the state, meeting with local Democrats and urging them to raise money and otherwise participate in the election. The county organizations don’t have a routine to follow partly because some have been virtually dormant for years, and in part because 1980 is the first year the state and county parties have been legally permitted to spend money on federal candidates. At a meeting last week at the newly opened Cobb County headquarters, Cole- man explained what the party can and should be doing. It was sort of a primer on being good Democrats, year-round. Fewer than 10 people came. Two plugged candidates for Congress, one was a State party staffer helping Cole- man, and another was there to explain a get-out-the-vote project planned for Ful- ton County. That is one of the active groups. “I called a guy up the other day,” Coleman told the stalwarts, ‘‘and it turned out he hasn’t been the (county) chairman for four years. That’s partly our fault, but you (locals) should let us know these things.” After the basics, Coleman detailed some campaigning options the Cobb Democrats can pick up. They already have opened the office, as 18 to 20 local parties are expected to . do throughout the state. Campaign litera- ture for Carter and other candidates will be available. The state party has sent radio stations the scripts for non-partisan public serv- ice announcements urging people to vote Nov. 4, but Coleman suggested the locals prod station officials to cooperate.

        "ocr_text": "East Tennessee Democrats hope Carter’s visit will stoke Campaign By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journe! Stett Writer BLOUNTVILLE, Tenn. — Martha Leach, a car rental agent, is a well known figure at the airport here. She is a Democrat. That is a rare bird in these quarters. The East Tennessee mountains hold nearly a third of the state’s people, and the vast majority call themselves Repub- licans or independents. Mrs. Leach bubbled with enthusiasm Wednesday afternoon over the expected arrival today of an even rarer bird, a Democratic president coming to woo Tennessee voters. “Oh yes, it’s just so exciting,” she said, fluttering about in her green car agency suit. “Everyone is so busy. We opened up headquarters in Blountville and Bristol and Johnson City last night. We’ve got a meeting tonight.” Democrats in general have not showed such enthusiasm. Tennessee’s Demo- cratic leaders express the hope that Carter’s appearance here and in Nash- ville will stoke up a campaign that has not caught fire. The President’s southern swing will take him from here to Nashville, then to Winston-Salem, N.C., and finally to Florida, where he hopes to blunt a simi- lar foray into his home region by Rea- gan. The Republican candidate cam- ean in Alabama today and Florida on ay. : Carter won Tennessee’s 10 electoral votes without trying in 1976, capturing 56 percent of the votes for a victory margin second only to his landslide tri- umph in Georgia. Democrats have no cause to feel so secure this year. Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jere Griggs, who took a leave of absence to coordinate Reagan’s campaign in the State, declares that Reagan has a 50-50 chance to win with a good showing in this 3-county Republican stronghold in the east, Such bragging by Republicans might have drawn guffaws from Democrats not so long ago. But not now. Most statewide polls show a neck-and-neck race, with as much as 20 percent of the voters unde- cided. People don’t realize the Republican National Party has been operated out of Tennessee Tennessee for the last year,” said Ned McWherter, speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives and co-chair- man of the Carter campaign. He listed a range of GOP national functionaries from Tennessee, including Republican National Chairman Bill Brock. Tennessee also has a very popular Republican governor, Lamar Alexander, whereas the Democrats held the state- house in 1976. And U.S. Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker has overcome the fallout from his Panama Canal vote and regained a position of respect. Three of eight congressman are Republican. Griggs said both Gov. Alexander and Sen. Baker will campaign in all 95 coun- ties before the Nov. 4 election. The President’s stop is not an exercise in futility, despite the Republican herit- ee in this end of the state, McWherter said. “In 1976, Carter got more votes in east Tennessee than any Democrat in a decade,” McWherter said. ‘‘We didn’t carry it, but we did very well. Our polls indicate we're not getting the vote we got in 1976. We thought this (visit) might generate some support.” Carter won 47 percent of the vote against Gerald Ford in the 1st and 2nd congressional districts, which make up much of east Tennessee. Also working against Carter in Ten- messee are the evangelical Christian groups. Some conservative churches have run voter registration drives and are publishing literature harshly attack- ing Carter on the issues of abortion and homosexual rights. Of course, the President does have his strength in this neighboring state. Middle and western Tennessee are traditionally Democratic regions, includ- ing the major metropolitan areas of Nashville and Memphis. This week Joan Mondale, Vice Presi- dent Walter Mondale’s wife, made a whistlestop tour up the midsection of the state, emphasizing the need to work up active support in what should be friendly territory. Her visits to two predominantly black Nashville colleges underscored’ the importance of the black vote. “If Hubert Humphrey would have had just one more vote in every precinct across the country,” she told the students at Tennessee State University, “Richard pag never would have become presi- ent.” Although the messasge was clear, some black leaders wonder how seri- ously the Tennessee overseers of the Carter campaign take it. Vasco Smith, a member of the Shelby County Commission in Memphis, com- plained earlier this week that the cam- paign has been virtually nothing in black areas. “As far as we can see, there just is no leadership from the Carter-Mondale ticket. We would like to have the leader- ship come from there, but if they won’t do it, we will,” Smith said. “We have to ae a vigorous campaign these last few ays.” Black leaders from Memphis were meeting this week independently of the Carter organization to lay the ground- work. The return of U.S. Rep. Harold E. Ford, a black from Memphis who will arrive with Carter, is expected to spark new life into campaigning in his home district. October 9, 1980 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Carter avoids personal slurs during 3-state Southern tour By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Writer TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — President Carter hammered out a day-long critique of opponent Ronald Reagan during a South- ern campaign tour, but changed his style to avoid the personal slurs that have landed him in repeated controversy. Making good his pledge to stop calling Reagan names, Carter nonetheless deliv- ered a series of clear attacks on the Repub- lican during stops Thursday in Tennessee, North Carolina and Florida. The new style, often contrasting. his and Reagan’s specific stands on issues, fre- quently included comments tailored to the Southern terrain no longer perceived to be a political haven for the President. In an effort to bolster his sagging for- tunes here, Carter was scheduled to appear before a joint legislative session today to sign the Refugee Education Assistance Act, which provides money to schools burdened with refugee children. The Cuban influx blamed on the administration has been a sore point, espe- cially with residents of South Florida. Carter was to meet with elderly citi- zens in St. Petersburg later today. Late Thursday, his aides defended the President against accusations by Reagan that Carter was playing “retirement roulette” with Americans’ pensions by suggesting that pri- vate pension funds be used to help rebuild ailing industries. 2 Reagan is “shooting from the hip firing dum-dums,” press secretary Jody Powell said. Domestic affairs adviser Stuart Eizenstadt called Reagan’s state- ment “a preposterous contention.” At several stops earlier Thursday, Carter said he shared the history and tradi- tions and values of Southern audiences. Throughout the day, he especially under- scored a shared belief in a strong military, then made unspecific but unquestionable ‘See CARTER, 13A October 10, 1980 \fCarter Continued from 1A ° references to fears over how Reagan would handle military matters if he were in the Oval Office. - For example, at the Opry- house in Nashville, in re marks made before answer- ing a dozen questions at a town meeting, Carter said the world has lived under the threat of war since World War II. “But we have learned one thing in the last 20 or 30 years, and that is that peace is no accident,” he said. “War with all its horror can be an accident — a terrible misun- derstanding, a critical miscal- culation of intention or will or capability, or a misguided concept of what honor really _ is — but peace is no accident. “It has to be won everyday, | against all the forces willing to sacrifice others for their causes,” Carter said. , . The one hostile question at _ the town meeting came from _a Nashville high school stu- . dent who asked the President _ to explain why he has found it ' necessary “to lower yourself _ to the extent. of slinging mud ' and making slanderous state- ' ments” about Reagan. The question drew applause. Carter admitted he had erred and agreed that the campaign had become “side- tracked on too many personal references,” but he blamed - are ar CoE ae FRSC ET He was spurred to ema tional outbursts, Carter said after seeing the media ignore certain statements by Reagan that the President felt were of paramount importance. The only statement he cited was Reagan’s comment that he would try to scrap the SALT II treaty, withdrawing it from the Senate. At the same time, Carter said, Rea- gan expressed a belief that the arms race might be used as a “trump card” to be played against the Soviets. Thinking of the ramifica- tions of such a course, Carter said, he ‘‘felt motivated to speak out and I got maybe overly enthusiastic about it.’’ . Besides that one hostile question, the only thing to mar the day filled with sun- shine and balmy tempera- tures was the presence of some Ku Klux Klan members gathered along the roadside route Carter followed from the Nashville airport to Opry- land. Actually, Carter prob- ably welcomed the group of about a dozen white-robed figures, since they waved blue and white Reagan placards. Carter met friendly crowds at all his public stops, though he seldom attracted wildly enthusiastic fans. The most animated reception came from several thousand parti- sans at the Dixie Classic Fair- ~ grounds. Of the three states visited, North Carolina is the most solid Carter country this year. The President is in some trou- ble in Tennessee, which gave him 56 percent of the vote in 1976, and is in serious diffi- culty in Florida, where the 17 electoral votes are considered a toss-up. In fact, a contingent of Reagan supporters was both vocal and visible in the small ' President crowd that met Air Force One at the airport here. They did not stop Carter from ap- pearing the, spectators held ack by a tall fence topped with barbed wire, and the shook hands through the wires to make personal contact as he had done elsewhere.

Ted Kennedy, on a mise Sion for President Carter to stir Mexican-American yoters in this key Southern state, set aside direct political appeals today and made an emotional speech at a high school named for his brother, Kennedy fulfilled the promise made by the late President John F. Kennedy, who said in a Nov. 21, 1963, visit here that he would re- turn to dedicate the then-new school on San Antonio's pre- dominantly Hispanic south- west side. The president was killed the next day in Dallas. “As — president, (John Kennedy) was a teacher to us all. He taught us that our freedom could not long exist for anyone unless it reached out to every Mexican-Ameri- can in the Valley and every black in Mississippi,” Ted Kennedy told a responsive outdoor crowd of about 1,500 that pressed close to hear him on a cool, bright morning. — “There are citizens waiting even now for new leaders to see their plight, to label evils as unacceptable, to act against injustice, to end op- pression and offer hope for blighted lives,” he said. Unlike his earlier appear- ances on Carter's behalf in Houston, McAllen and San Antonio, the Massachusetts Senator made no partisan ap- peal for the Democratic ticket while addressing the crowd at JFK High School, _ Kennedy did speak to so- cial and political issues of special concern to minorities — in America, but he treated the occasion as an emotional - and personal moment. “In dedicating this school today, we remember Jack. And in remembering Jack, we remember the best in our country and Kennedy said.

        "ocr_text": "Ga. Peanut Brigade hits the road again By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Writer . Georgia’s Peanut Brigade cranked up again today, as a contingent headed for Tennessee to help Jimmy Carter save the presidency they helped him win four years ago. About 20 Carter fans, mostly Atlantans, departed from a Buckhead parking lot on a campaign trip they hope will give Carter extra support in Chattanooga and Clarkesville and tip the close Tennessee election in his favor. More Georgians will be fanning out to Alabama, Florida, Texas, Connecticut, southern Illinois and possibly South Ca- rolina, in a repeat of the 1976 performance that generated badly needed publicity and won political converts for the then unknown former Georgia governor. In each of those states the race with GOP nominee Ronald Reagan is virtually neck-and-neck, and brigaders hope to break the deadlock. “It pulls in other people and creates some excitement for them,” said Dot Padgett, an organizer of this year’s late-hour effort. She could not estimate how many Georgians will take part in the campaigning, but said all who do will pay their own ex- penses, About 1,500 joined the 1976 Peanut Brigade trips, but many of those were financed by the campaign that year. “We'll be doing anything they ask us to do (locaily),” said brigader Juanita Minor, “knocking on doors, handing out litera- ture, whatever they need.” Ms. Minor, who is self-employed as a market research interviewer, did not go on previous trips, though she did work for Carter in Georgia last time. Waiting in the brisk morning air for a van to arrive and carry the troops northward, Ms. Minor’s only regret about mak- ing the trip was that she would miss the barbeque and rally in Plains on Saturday designed to generate support for Democrats in this state. It is the third barbecue staged by the 1980 Club, mostly Georgians who formed a continuing support group after Carter first won the presidency. “That's Jimmy Carter's secret weapon, so many Georgians who are willing to drop everything and go where they're needed,” said Atlantan Archie Rainwater. “That's the kind of Support most candidates wish they had, but don't.” .

        "ocr_text": "a CE ct Poles apart in Texas politics Banker and activist examine the issues By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Writer HOUSTON — In some ways they are not so far apart, the Houston banker and the Chicano lawyer trying to establish himself in San Antonio. They both believe in family and country and, per- haps most of all, in capitalism. Yet they touch opposite extremes, in this state de- fined by the opulence built of oi! money no less than the dusty poverty left to Hispanic farmworkers. They speak from two different worlds reaching be- yond this one state, from populations that will help determine the presidential election. Texas is especially important to the outcome, with 26 electoral votes that neither side is sure of winning. Like many today, each man is frightened over the prospects of his candidate losing. More accurately, each fears for the future if the opposition is elected. “As you look around you, you’ve got to be nervous. If you're not nervous, you're not reading the paper,” said James E. Lyon, chairman of the board of River Oaks nd Trust. BT Ga is a multi-millionaire who believes “the sur- vival of the Western world” could be at stake in this election. He states the case for Republican Ronald Rea- _ Juventino. Guerra, without much enthusiasm, backs President Carter for another term. “Ronald Reagan scares me. He’s too much of an ex- pedient politician. I don’t think he’s a principled man,” Guerra said. He spoke of the war scare, but of other fears too. - . “Republicans are elitists all over the country,” he said. “I don’t feel ney address any needs of Mexican- icans. They never have.” AT onl ecnearvative tendencies were anchored in the Marine Corps and later buttressed by world events. He watched nations from China to Cuba fall into the communist camp, saw Korea mark the first time a United States war “changed from being a crusade” to a mere containment. ; “Over the years I observed the accommodation pat- tern,” Lyon said. “I became progressively disturbed.” A self-made man, he dropped out of college to pur- sue a boom-town real estate business. Lyon’s concern rose as government poked increasingly into the affairs of business, aS his nation’s moral atmosphere grew increas- ingly permissive. . oo “Generally, I perceived a deterioration in values and the competitive nature of the Western world,” he said. “My 5-year-old could buy at the U-Tote-Em books and magazines and things that I couldn’t get my hands arine, “ ei Deore tuienadbed not only in a spiritual, but in a itical solution.” pol inally becoming a Fone in 1964, Lyon a very deep grain of Texas politics. aia had ea Heal when he toured the country and made some talks in a generally philosophical and politi- cal vein for General Electic — about free enterprise, the creeping socialistic trend in government, said Eon a trim and vigorous-looking man of 53 with wavy brown i blue eyes. . a donated to Reagan’s gubernatorial races, “a his finance chairman in Texas in the 1976 presidentia Lyon finds Reagan hope of Western world campaign, and this year is on Reagan’s Texas Steering Commne’s ‘outspoken in his convictions on God ang family,” Lyon said of Reagan, though he could be 5 : ing of himself. “He’s for a profitable business climate producing a profitable political climate.

Inflation has eaten their lunch. Militarily, people perceive us as impotent, Our last refuge for a business climate appears to be a return to the isolationism that presaged the depression of the ’30s,\"\" Lyon said. ; “The presence of the government’s ill-conceiveg programs has probably done much to create the prob. lems,” he said. “Government can’t take the place of church. It can’t take the place of parents.” In some ways Tino Guerra agrees. “In earlier days, I always used to think it requireg legislative control or judicial control to accomplish change,” he said in an interview last week in his smaj) San Antonio law office. * a “But it boils down to economics. There just is no money in the Mexican-American community,” he said, “Money talks. It always has. It always will. Guerra, dark and chunky at 32, saw the, courts blunt what could have been a sharp tool for carving a new economic order. The celebrated case, San Antonio vs. Rodriguez, failed to establish that education is a consti- tional right violated when school funding based on property tax funnels meager resources to poor districts. Guerra, a former teacher and administrator at the school district involved, found the courts did not always work. Nor did the political process. “Since we got single-member council districts — about four years ago — the atmosphere for Opportunity for minorities is there, but the reality is not even close to that atmosphere.” ; Guerra believes that education and equal oppor- tunity are keys to tomorrow that the government must turn. “and bilingual studies The Associated Press Juventino Guerra feels Republicans too elitist He wants movement toward equal school financing » enhanced by stronger efforts t shake loose the business iti : Sect network traditionally closed to “There are backlogs of hundreds of (equal em loy- ment) cases, and that is devastati eG saill. \"ihe foteral : ating on morale,” Guerra . overnment is the only one big e to do it, the only one the employers teas g enough To skeptics, he cites a US. Civil Rights Commissi study which this month reported that Ractiaeten hiring and promotion barely has changed in San Antonio in a decade. That is a great discouragement to a young man who already describes himself as tired from the past years of struggle. Born into a middle class family, Guerra became an activist on his college newspaper and then in the Na- tional Education Association, where he co-founded the Chicano Task Force. In 1976 Jimmy Carter was an outsider, like most Hispanics are, and the chance of a Sympathetic ear had to be grasped. Guerra served.as regional campaign coor- dinator. . '~\"Your expectations were so high’ that you'd have somebody sympathetic to human needs. You expected re- forms in social programs that were dismantled under Nixon,” he said. ; -Calls to balance the budget and cut taxes meant it didn't happen. Other problems with the Carter administration partly explain why Guerra personally supported US. Sen. Ted Kennedy in this year’s presidential primary in Texas. “They didn’t even know what a Mexican-American was in the Carter campaign,” Guerra recalled. “Carter always has been a cold fish almost. He does not have the personal experiential base to draw from with Mexican- Americans, and neither do the aides he has around him.” Guerra said Carter has the same problems with blacks, who contend that his initiatives toward minorities have been superficial. __ But for the general election Guerra has come around, as have most Hispanic and black leaders in the nation, viewing the alternative as untenable. - “The Republicans never have been a party of human need programs,” Guerra said. “Their platforms haven't reflected it and neither have their office-hold- October 27, 1980 \f"

Not for a moment did spirits flag or support waiver. It was a houseful of Republicans, gathered, they hoped, to watch Ronald Reagan clinch a victory in the presi- dential race.” They left satisfied. “We can’t pop the champagne yet, but we can chill it,” said Carol Lan- caster, who opened her home to fellow Reagan campaigners Tuesday night. Miss Lancaster, a full-time cam- paign volunteer, even offered the view that the former California governor just might carry Georgia, the state his rival once governed. “I think he squelched the warmon- ger image Carter has been trying to paint,” she added. “I knew we were going to win before, but now it’s guar- anteed.” Others agreed. “He didn’t make any gaffes as far as I’m concerned,” said Glen Holt, the regional manager of a _ chemical company here. Steve Wolfe, who works for Dun and Bradstreet, felt Reagan “used his act- ing ability to push Carter right back in a corner.” The GOP nominee could have honed a few more barbs to toss, Wolfe sug- gested, but over all he thought Reagan did a splendid job. ‘“‘He was confident. He had the upper hand. Reagan got the best of him, no doubt about it,”” Wolfe said. No doubt, either, about how the crowd of 20 or so partisans received the arguments and responses of the two men vying for the nation’s No. 1 political job. Sipping coffee or punch, nibbling a variety of cookies and little frosted cakes, the group obviously enjoyed kibbitzing in Miss Lancaster’s comfort- able living room in one of the most comfortable parts of town. Derogatory remarks followed virtu- ally every comment the President made, while the cheers for his adver- sary were only slightly fewer. The most popular single word was “Liar,” sometimes whispered, some. times stated with considerably more volume, but always said with emotion. The only disappointment of the evening may have been the failure tg get through to the network phone num. ber for registering their view that Reagan won the debate. October 29, 1980 \f"

In Texas, Carter field coordinator Tom Henderson, a veteran of several statewide races with an intimate knowledge of the state’s demographics, puzzled over the net- work television projections. “We stil} haven’t figured out how we lost Texas yet,” he said, having few specific fig- ures to analyze. “Our turnout was very high. We did what we said we were supposed to do in getting out the black and brown voters. It appears we didn’t do nearly as well with labor as we thought we'd do.” : . The Democrats had counted on a large and supportive Hispanic vote, which it worked for and apparently got, in spite of the Reagan campaign’s effort to pull out 30 percent of the Mexican-American voters for the GOP.

Not everyone agrees. Those who have brushed disaster do. Brenda Tigner lost her husband to cancer in 1978. The insurance company re- fused to make good on his life insurance policy, until an Atlanta Legal Aid lawyer had a few discussions with the company and the auto dealer who had employed her husband as a maintenance worker. Tigner and her two young children got the $6,500 claim. “T had been living with my husband’s grandmother, and with the money I was able to pay for furniture and get my own place to live,” Tigner said. “If I hadn’t got on my feet like I did with that insurance money, there’s no telling where I’d be now.” Now Tigner, 25, is making it on her own, caring for her kids and working part- \" time as a nurse's aide to supplement Social i to Reagan orders his Jabor secretary testify on Capitol Hill in favor of a lower minimum wage for youths. 9A Security payments. ; The Atlanta Legal Aid Society opened 4,500 new cases this year in the five metro counties. All its clients live in poverty. Fortunately for the 50-year-old socl- ety, it receives only 75 percent of its nearly $2 million budget from the Legal Services Foundation, so if federal funding is cut, “there will be a shell,” said Mel Westmoreland, the society's deputy. direc- tor. He cited a United Way contribution which comprises most of the remaining 25 percent of the society’s budget as a base to continue the program. “Poor people in rural areas will be hurt worse,” he said. In Georgia, 800,000 people qualify for legal aid supplied by the society and by the Georgia Legal Services Program, which runs 21 offices covering the state outside metropolitan Atlanta. Last year, some 26,000 clients were seen by the two programs. Nurse’s aide Brenda Tigner: ‘There's no telling where I'd be now’ aes i See LEGAL, 94 Georgia Legal Services gets 95 percent of its nearly $8 million budget from the corporation Rea- gan wants to ax. Reagan has said state and local governments can provide legal aid, supple- mented by volunteer help from private lawyers. But John Shelton, a 34- year-old black laborer in Americus, wonders what will happen to others like him if the program fails. Shelton, who asked that his real name not be used, quit his job carrying and loading wooden pallets, weighing 150 to 200 pounds, because physically he couldn't do it. He was also required to run a powe ab saw, for which he had no training. His family’s food stamp benefits immediately were cut off because he quit. However, the manager of the public housing project where Shelton, his wife and two children live did not respond with the same speed to reflect the lost in- come in his rent charges. Shelton could not pay the rent; eviction proceedings began. The Georgia Legal Serv- ices staff showed food stamp administrators that Shelton's job risked his health and safety. The benefits were resumed. After an eviction hear ing, the local housing au thority was found to have erred in failing to reduce Shelton’s rent for the time he was not working. Now he has a construc- tion job, is paying his higher rent again, and is thankful for the legal help. “I wouldn’t have had any kind of chance if legal aid wouldn’t have represented me,” he said. ‘I don’t know if me and my family would even have been able to stay together.” A few weeks ago, the Georgia Bar's board of governors, meeting in New Orleans, refused to adopt a proposed resolution endors- ing continuation of the legal aid program. Debate lasted about two hours, with lawyer after lawyer rising to complain about specific legal aid eases that had caused them trouble at home, according to two attorneys who at- , “Legal aid establishes these offices and employs idealistic young lawyers with ideas about changing society,” said one Georgia bar official. “They sue hospitals, file class actio suits and they make them selves sort of a nuisance.” The bar official, who asked not to be identified estimated most S want to see some form of free, publicly funded lega service for the poor. He suggested that the current funding contro versy might “get the atten tion” of legal services law yers, convincing them the must draw back. — pa more attention to individ ual clients and stop trying to change the world. Actually, the vast major- ity of cases handled by both the Georgia and Atlanta legal aid agencies don’t even get to trial, but are handled out of court. Most involve nitty-gritty law like problems with public agencies, family dis- putes or consumer ripoffs. Few are class actions. John Cromartie, director of Georgia Legal Services Program, agrees that the lawyers who work with him are idealistic. But they are not fighting the system, he said; they have opted to work within it. “It’s a fairly conserv- ative concept, giving all people access to justice in the courts,” he said. Friends of legal aid sug- gest that some private law- ers resent facing: i March 24, 1981 \fLeaal Continued from 1A | tion that the poor could not mount without free legal services. Linda Cornelius, for example, hardly could have fought the bank that repos- sessed her car, in the proc- ess assessing her $500 in what later were found to be illegal charges. Her legal aid lawyer “had to do all the talking” in court, Cornelius recalled. “I didn’t know what was going on.” Cornelius, now a dental assistant in Atlanta, also is a strong advocate of legal aid. ‘‘There might come a time when I'm not working again and I won’t have any place else to turn to.”’ Will local and state gov- ernments take over the funding of legal aid? If past performance is any sign, poor Georgians are in trouble. In 1976, Gov. George Busbee and the Georgia General Assembly finally made good their threats, stopping all state support — about $1 million from the $1.6 million legal aid budget. The state government bowed out because the governor and lawmakers could not rationalize sup- port for a group that re- peatedly — and success- fully — had sued the state. Legal aid suits brought expanded vocational reha- bilitation aid for the injured poor in Georgia and led to the demise of co-pay- ments by Medicaid recipi- ents. A Georgia Legal Serv- ices lawyer has led the fight for changes at Geor- gia State Prison in Reids- ville, where a federal judge has found conditions uncon- stitutional and unconscion- able. The end of state funding coincided with the advent of federal financing, which now is in jeopardy. President Reagan’s idea that volunteer programs can fill in the gap also might run into trouble. The Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, one of the most successful such groups in the nation, could not function nearly so well without constant consulta- tions with professional poverty lawyers at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, according to foundation director Brian Stone. “It is that partnership that is the key to the _ cient delivery of legal serv- ices to the poor,” said Stone, explaining that pri- vate: lawyers have little knowledge of the govern- ment programs and laws that daily impact the lives of the poor. His volunteers get that expertise from the society. Stone, the lawyer who predicted the demise of public legal aid would bring disaster, said his 1,000 volunteers have represented 2,000 people. Last year the legal aid society probably repre- sented 6,000 people with its staff of 34 lawyers and 17 paralegals. “My sense is that we are precisely the program RFea- gan is talking about doing the work. But we can’t do it without the partnership,” Stone said. 4 “We could never make up the difference. It can't be done.”’ March 24, 1981 (continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Prison aide stabbed at Reidsville By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Wriler The stabbing of a deputy warden at the Georgia State Prison and injuries to two inmates in separate incidents Monda were the latest in a series of violent con- frontations that have escalated fear and led increasing numbers of prisoners to arm themselves. Jerry Thomas, the deputy warden for security at the Reidsville prison, was stab- bed in the chest by a prisoner who at- tacked him with a sharpened ballpoint pen, according to Sara’ Englade, spokeswoman a the Department of Offender Rehabili- ion. Thomas, 36, was treated at the prison hospital and released in good condition. He had one wound several inches deep in his chest and another superficial laceration, Englade said. In another incident earlier Monday, inmate Solomon Hughes’ throat was slashed with a razor during a brawl stem- ming from a homosexual proposition. Charles Miles was identified as the prisoner who propositioned Hughes in a dormitory around 1 p.m. __ The altercation prompted one or more inmates to attack Miles, who was beaten severely, Englade said. Prisoner Howard Reed, 53, was being held in disciplinary isolation in the attack on Thomas, who has been deputy warden there less than six months. Englade said Reed was being removed from disciplinary isolation when he de- manded to see Thomas, who met the prisoner in the rotunda. Reed “became very hostile and abusive to Thomas,” who ordered the prisoner shackled in leg irons and handcuffs, she said. ___ Reed was taken to a prehearing deten- tion room, the -restraints were removed, el and Reed then attacked Thomas with the sharpened pen he had hidden in his hair, Englade said. Reed is serving a life sentence for murder on a 1966 conviction in Fulton County. In the earlier incident, Hughes, 26, was flown by helicopter to Talmadge Me- morial Hospital in Augusta. He was listed in fair condi- tion. Miles was being treated at the prison hospital for a broken nose, other face wounds and a small stab wound on the upper left arm. A suspect in the at- SVI e Continued from 1A . tack on Miles has been placed in disciplinary isola- tion, Englade said. Hughes, from Macon, is ~ serving a life sentence plus seven years on armed rob- bery and aggravated as- sault charges. Miles is from Jackson, Miss., and is serving a sentence of 14 years and 2 months for armed robbery and volun- tary manslaughter. Violence at Reidsville — there have been 15 inci- dents since late January — has drawn the concern of USS. District Judge Anthony Alaimo, Earlier this month, ‘he warned the state that it must act immediately ‘to abate the physical attacks, which have been provoked by everything from racial hatred to gambling argu- ments. ‘The DOR has made no response to Alaimo’s recent order and has not an- nounced any steps aimed at alleviating the trouble. Even those who are con- sidered inmate advocates, including the lawyers representing inmates in the federal court suit under Alaimo’s jurisdiction, have not come up with proposals that might ease the situa- ' Montgomery, tion described as increas- ingly tense. The judge did not spell out any actions to make the institution more secure, noting that full security will not be attained until all dormitories are re- placed with single cells by the end of 1985. Persons in communica- tion with inmates through the mail or personal visits say the prisoners fault lower-level guards with allowing or provoking the violence. | “If knives are there in the living areas, they’re there because the guards allow them to be,” said Chinyelu Lumumba, acting director of the Georgia Clearinghouse on Prisons and Jails. Others with contacts in the prison said inmates tell of guards failing to turn on the metal detectors in- stalled to ferret out weap- ons, or ignoring them when the detectors sound off. Some charge that guards themselves supply weapons or the material to make them to favored inmates. The rash of violent con- frontations has swelled anxiety throughout the maximum security prison, which last had a major riot in 1978. A few guards have re- sented Warden Charles who was brought from a federal fa- | cility in Arizona last June to run the prison. Observers of the Reids- ville prison have expressed optimism about Montgom- ery’s commitment to federal court orders for re- form and about his ability to win over or drive out those correction officers opposed to change. However, the recent spate of violence has led them to question whether the warden can act quickly enough to prevent a majo: eruption at the prison. { Deputy Warden Thomas, whom Montgomery brought from the Arizona prison late last year, quickly be came popular with the staff for his willingness ta wade into troublesome situations.

        "ocr_text": " Court-appointed monitor, Vince Nathan, discusses Reidsville problems with a Staff Photo—Bill Mahan an inmate Nathan must translate court mandates into every- day life at a prison once called third-worst in the nation — behind New Mexico State Prison and Attica. He must deal with personalities as varied as mass murderers and state bureaucrats. Reforming Reidsville: Court monitor strives. to join hostile forces By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Writer ; REIDSVILLE, Ga. — In almost two years of frequent visits to Georgia State Prison, this was the first time a convict vowed, face-to-face, to kill Vin- cent Nathan. As the special court monitor paused in a dim corridor of the “high maximum security” unit housing the most dangerous men here, the inmate calmly issued a direct threat on his life. Nathan, appointed monitor to en- force US, District Judge Antiony Alai- mo’s orders for better conditions at the prison, is savvy enough to know the in- mate will kill himifhe can. Nathan can do nothing about it, not if he hopes to do his job right. That job is meshing disparate and sometimes hostile forces — including prisoners, guards, state officials and prison administrators — into a smooth opera- tion forging the progress the judge im- posed on them. He must translate court raandates into everyday life at a prison once rated the third-worst in the nation — behind New Mexico State Prison and Attica, both the sites of deadly riots. The deficiencies cited have ranged from inhumane medical treatment, to dan- gerously unsanitary food service, to guard brutality, In this juggling act Nathan bal- ‘ances the input of personalities as varied as mass murderers and state bu- reaucrats, All have a say in the process, The monitor must not cross the line of usurping the warden’s powers. Yet he must ensure that the state satis- fies the judge’s demands for multimillion-dollar reform ordered in the lawsuit Guthrie vs. Evans, initially filed in 1972 by convicts seeking inte- gration. Resistance from a small cadre of longtime guards has proved perhaps the toughest obstacle to change. But prison- ers like the man who threatened Na- than — a white convict irate that he might be forced to eat or work with a dlack inmate — have not greased the skids of reform, either. Many staff members and prisoners Jo cooperate, top management is com- mitted to compliance, and even the governor finally has stood behind the effort. To date the change has been mas- sive. But it is not complete. With clearance by the Department of Offender Rehabilitation, Nathan was trailed by a reporter for three days on his almost frenetic pace through the prison compound, to see how he at- tempts to marshall these forces in pur- suit of creating a prison that complies with Alaimo’s orders. He apparently does something right. Last week Nathan was named monitor in Texas, where the entire prison system is under court order, See REIDSVILLE, 6B April 26, 1981 \fReidsville Continued from 1B On his last visit here Nathan crammed informal dis- Cussions, private interviews, mass meetings, inspections, Gisagreements and a scattering of sardonic jokes into every day. Each day started over breakfast at 7:30 with his expert consultants — this visit a sanitarian, a psychia- trist and a former FBI agent — at the Vidalia motel that provides the closest thing to comfort in rural southeast Georgia. Each ended at 9 p.m. or later over working din- ners, After directing the experts toward their respective duties — assesssing conditions and recommending ways to fulfill the court orders — Nathan settled into the prison for round after round of meetings. ; . Standing before his inmate representatives council, convened in the pool room off the gym, Nathan bore more than a trace of the law professor he used to be before he became a corporate lawyer, before an Ohio judge invited him to monitor a local prison case six years ago and nudged his career into corrections. He appeared without guard escort, as he always does, wherever he moves in the prison. On this day Nathan had mixed news for the couple dozen men seated on metal folding chairs. Most smoked, and many took detailed notes. He complimented them for the calm response prison- ers made when guards recently ransacked some cells and destroyed inmates’ property. “] will follow the matter until it is concluded,” he vowed. He talked of court developments, fielded complaints and relayed essentials of his earlier session with a guards’ group, proposing that on his next visit the inmates’ council hold a rap session with guards. “T'd like the two groups to meet, not for the purpose of haranguing each other, not for the purpose of yelling at each other, but for the purpose of talking to each other, and,” he emphasized, “listening to each other, which might even be more important.” Standing, pacing, smoking, his jacket draped on a chair, the monitor remained relaxed, as much when he joked — he says humor is essential in this closed world — as when he coolly disagreed with a prisoner writing off a deputy warden as a useless power broker. “Tt’s just like they tell us,” said the prisoner, refer- ring to comments guards had made. “You speak one way to them and another way to us.” “That,” Nathan replied, “is something I wanted to taik to you about. That’s a problem. It’s very true that staff are deliberately misrepresenting what I say. It’s equally true that inmates are deliberately misrepresenting what [ say. “I'd like to speak very frankly about my disappoint- ment in something.” After his last visit an inmate spread the word that the monitor had promised to get a particular guard fired. Not so, Nathan said, challenging the group to recount any time he had made such a threat. “E appreciate that there are people on both sides that are not on my side. It creates real problems, and I guess maybe I shouldn't say that because that’s what somebody wants to accomplish,” he said. The monitor certainly doesn't need anyone poking at his already tender relations with the guards. Besides meeting with the lower level guards, Nathan held his premier face-off with their bosses, the commis- sioned officers who by most accounts have been the locus of real power at Georgia State Prison. Tt was not cordial. About a dozen sergeants, lieutenants and captains, some in civvies, wore uniformly dour looks throughout most of Nathan's talk to them. And it hardly was a talk with them, as his repartee with the inmates had been. These men had little to say: Few questions, no com- Stat Photo—Bil Mahan 4 . : Typical Reidsville dormitory: Monitor's j00'S to bring order to prison once called nation’s third-worst his explanation of how the Guthrie suit orders wl! help them do their jobs. ‘ Rational and just systems for discipline and @abjj}.- tation will break up traditional inmate power gralPS return power to the administration, Nathan told #¢™m.

The manager of the trustee hiding can’t get meals delivered on schedule? Nathan lodgd the complaint with food service, then with the warden, service doesn’t get the guards assigned to it? The mbitor wants to know why. In meeting after meeting, he addressed both delop- ing major reforms and the routine tasks of daily adtinis- tration, all relating to orders in the Guthrie suit. Tracking the blurry line between monitor and fison administrator demands a constant vigilance; the walen’s preserve of authority easily could be violated. } warden’s meeting last week, is that the prison! is at the. saturation point. . “During the past nine months, we have weathered one crisis after another,” Montgomery wrote, citing the multi- ple Death Row escapes, a staff boycott, an inmate work stoppage and a rash of prisoner stabbings. “All have been resolved without firing a single shot or busting one cannister of (tear) gas and (with) a mini- mum of force being used,” he said, adding that meanwhile significant progress has been made. “We have, I believe, reached our saturation point, however. I believe our current rate of forward thrust is being impeded by an almost insurmountable number of issues which are being addressed at the same time,” he said. The Guthrie suit demands are among them, and that is the biggest complaint management staffers make about the monitor: He never stops. One deputy warden called Nathan “one of the three smartest people I know,” yet still chastised him for always pressing for more, for refusing to let the prison administration set its own priorities for change. ‘ An example: Why deal with plumbing that has been bad for 50 years (it permits raw sewage to be sucked into drinking water), when you haven't resolved a security breach that allowed a double-murderer to escape? For Nathan the situation is not either/or, but do both. Nathan's lack of front-line correction experience was blamed more than once for his demanding approach. Prison managers are right that new elements have been. introduced into the case. As recently as last month the court demanded an investigation of overall sanitation in dormitories and work areas, which never had been done, and set deadlines for new psychiatric and medical treatment systems, These were new to Warden Montgomery's regime, but the issues have been part of general orders in the Guthrie case for two and three years. They simply hadn't been ad- dressed, Nathan freely admitted his pressure tactics in another encounter with inmates, this time the trustees housed in a separate building. The prisoners offered what they said were longstanding gripes, while admitting they hadn’t raised them earlier to the moni “If you call me and tell me it's a-hetenight that night, I'm not going to do anything about thafsbe told the trust- ees, “But when you tell me something'that relates to Gut- hrie, I'm going to do something aboutatefivery time. And that’s one reason why Guthrie is working, because they (administrators) have learned that I dOf't do it on a hit or miss basis.” om r Nathan said he writes Montgomegy to a dozen let- P ters a week relaying complaints or problems. The warden farms them out to his staff for responséim, “And believe it or not,” Nathan ‘told the prisoners, “about two-thirds of the time his res; is: ‘Somebody screwed up. And this is what happenedyand I've gotten on his case, and we hope it won't happen again, and please let me know if it does.’ tae “He and 1 are working together, so’take of advantage of that, really, I urge you.” = April 26, 1981 (continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "Counselor fired, 2 resign after women’s prison sex scandal By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Writer One counselor has been fired, and two others have resigned from the state’s women’s prison in connection with a three- month investigation into sexual liaisons be- tween prisoners and male staff members. Corrections authorities confirmed the departures Thursday, saying they have completed the probe that resulted in the resignation of a deputy warden in January. Sara Englade, spokeswoman for the Department of Offender Rehabilitation, re- fused to identify the personnel who re- signed or were fired from the Women’s Unit of Middle Georgia Correctional Com- plex in Hardwick. The two counselors resigned during the course of the investigation into the sex scandal, she said, and the man dismissed Officially was fired for “misconduct” related to alleged falsifying of information during pre-testing lie detector procedures. See PRISON, 14A Prison Continued from 1A Mark Martin, the former deputy warden for security, resigned Jan. 9 immedi- ately upon being confronted with inquiries of sexual misconduct. He allegedly had extended special favors to women inmates in re- turn for intimate encoun- ters with them, Letters from inmates and widespread rumors led to the preliminary investi- gation in January, and Martin’s resignation prompted DOR Commis- sioner David Evans to order a full-scale probe. Englade said the investi- gation included interviews with inmates and staff and a round of polygraph tests. The internal affairs of- fice received no allegations that women were forced to submit to sexual relations, according to Englade. Apparently the prison’s smal] counseling rooms, having curtains over the door windows, often were the sites of liaisons, al- though some activity re- portedly took place in the inmates’ living quarters, Some staff members also were said to have been at the prison at odd hours — late at night or early in the morning — to engage in sex with prisoners. As a result of the investi- gation, Evans has ordered several procedural changes designed to prevent a recurrence of “personal” contact between staff and prisoners, which DOR regu- lations prohibit, Englade said. All meetings between counselors and inmates must be held in rooms with doors open, and the cur- tains are prohibited. Evans also ordered stringent en- forcement of the regulation that all employees, includ- ing the warden, must sign in and out of the institution at all times. The commissioner insti- tuted a rule that all male staff members now must be accompanied by a fe- male employee when enter- ing inmate living quarters, which Englade said has been the practice at male institutions when female employees go into living areas. Women at Hardwick do not sleep in dormitories, but live in separate “cot tages” with sleeping rooms for two to four inmates, The prison houses about 400 women, though it was built for half that many.

Last summer H-House formally became death row, and the electric chair and remaining condemned prisoners were transferred there from the old death row at the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville. Now virtually all male inmates under death sentence in Georgia are imprisoned at Jackson’s H-House. Before the suit was filed, H-House in- mates received no outdoor recreation, no psychological testing or mental health services, and limited rights of visitation, religious services and use of legal materi- als, West said. Besides mandating classification test- ing, the new agreement would require that a “qualified mental health professional” be available to aid death row prisoners at. least eight hours a week, It would give the inmates 32 hours out of their cells each week. The decree also would let the men re- ceive visits from approved friends if their family members don’t visit them, and would expand visitation periods several hours on weekends and holidays. . Prisoners would get more access to law books from the main institution li- brary and would be permitted group reli- gious services if approved by the classi- fication committee. The state would be legally required to keep television sets in death row, which it now does but has no legal obligation to. The decree notes that inmates “have the obligation to avoid deliberately damaging or destroying” televisions and other recre- ational materials such as chess sets and sports equipment. Although the agreement states the warden could house condemned prisoners elsewhere than death row, there has been no prohibition against that in the past, ac- cording to a spokesman from the attorney general's office, Tn fact, this decree would formalize the concept of death row, since it states that class members — prisoners under death sentence — shall be housed together. The maintenance of a death row has been informal policy, rather than a matter of law or an order of the court. See PRISON, 224 May 14, 1981 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Reidsville calm following night of fires, By. MARCIA KUNSTEL and CELIA W. DUGGER Journal SlaH Writers At least nine inmates were in solitary confinement today at Geor- gia State Prison in Reidsville, fol- lowing fires and disturbances that caused the evacuation of 400 prisoners Monday night. The prison was described as calm today, although routine sched- ules were abandoned and the insti- tution was in “lockdown” status. In- mates left their quarters only to eat, and they were led to the dining hall in small groups “to prevent further outbreaks,” said Sara En- glade, director of public affairs for the Department of Offender Reha- bilitation. : The precautions followed a night of commotion that easily could have expanded into a riot, accord- ing to several persons familiar with the situation. Apparently the dis- turbances were contained and several agitators isolated in quick action by authorities. No serious injuries were directly attributed to the outbreaks, al- though one volunteer firefighter died of a heart attack before he could enter the prison, and several guards were treated at the institu- tion’s hospital for smoke inhalation, Ms. Englade said. The mattresses set aflame. re- portedly were the type that a federal judge banned after August of 1978, because they burn so easily. A sanitarian recently brought to Reidsville as part of an ongoing effort to assure compliance with court-ordered improvements discovered the prohibited polyu- rethane mattresses in use in at least some of the dorms where fires occurred. He found the mattresses during a ip in April, and prison officials were notified that they should be removed, according to Robert Cul- len, the attorney for inmates who filed the suit leading to widespread eforms. The sanitarian returned. again last month, only to discover e mattresses still in use. Cullen said the mattresses called ‘or by the court are difficult to unrest | The extent of the damages from the fires was uncertain, although prison officials had discovered plumbing problems this morning. The trouble started about 7 p.m. Monday when angry inmates. de- manded that they be allowed a gym period. They were not scheduled for exercise, but gave the duty officer five minutes to meet their demand. He consulted with the assistant warden then in charge, but before he could return to select a spokes- man to detail grievances, the prisoners had set fire to mattresses and newspapers piled at the en- trance to their dorm. Authorities’ evacuated about 400 inmates in two buildings, Ms. En- glade said. The initial arson began in F-3, one of three remaining segregated dorms housing 55 to 60 black prisoners. It has a tough reputation. Then sporadic fires broke out in three nearby dorms, and a number of inmates in a separate, high se- curity unit refused to go back to their cells and had to be taken there by force, she said. In yet another dormitory at least six prisoners began shouting and causing new disturbances. They were pulled out and placed in pre- hearing detention cells. Also placed in solitary confinement were three or four inmates identified as re- sponsible for setting fires, Ms. En- glade said. Cullen said he understands that the prisoners in F-3 had complaints “about a ‘whole range of issues” in- cluding ventilation, food, heat and recreation. The lawyer said he also has been told that ventilation im- provements ordered to be made by June 1 had not been accomplished . by the most recent inspection. Ms. Englade said prison officials believe that an escalation of the disturbance was prevented by the quick response of off-duty guards called back to the institution, and by Georgia State Patrol officers who relieved prison guards at the facility’s perimeter to allow them inside to seal off troubled areas.

District Judge Wil- bur Owens was receiving an update on the county's voter registration proce- dures, and the county's attorney had just told him that the tax commissioner, who conducts registration, employed only 20-year-old white women. “Public officials bitch, to speak plainly, about the federal courts interfering in their local affairs,” Owens is quoted as saying in a transcript of the pro- ceeding, “and here we have given these people two years to correct their own situation, and two years later we hear that the tax commissioner hasn't even got common sense enough to hire somebody other than young’ white folks to run the process. “T don’t understand it, I tell you, I really don't... .

The recalcitrance by Putnam County officials that Owens experienced illustrates the continuing need for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that mandates full voting protection for blacks and other minor- ities, according to propo- nents of the law. Key portions of the act will either expire or be ex- tended by Congress by Au- gust of next year. The provisions that are due to expire are bitterly con- tested and apply only to five Deep South states, four other states and small por- tions of 11 more, The provisions demand that the Justice Depart- ment preclear all election ‘law changes in those af- fected jurisdictions to make sure the changes would neither inhibit nor dilute the black vote. Proponents of extending the act question what Geor- gia officials would do if the law was “T find it incredible that local officials in Georgia want to be relieved of pre- clearance —_ requirements, when in so many situations they've acted in violation of that very law for 17 years,” said Christopher Coates, a lawyer with the southeastern office of the American Civil Liberties Union, Coates, whose specialty is voting rights violations, has filed more than 30 suits against local governments inthe past couple of years, many on the grounds of failure to get preclearance from the U.S. Justice De- partment for election changes. : ” Of the changes that have been submitted by Georgia government “officials . to Washington for scrutiny since 1965, 226 have been found objectionable — ‘| find it incredible that local officials . . . want to be re- lieved of preclearance requirements, when in so many situa- they've acted in violation of that very law for 17 tions years. Many more turndowns than any other state has had, and more than one-fourth of all objections filed by the Justice Department, In all, the local and state governments around the country that must preclear their election law changes have submitted nearly 34,- 800 changes to the Justice Department. Of those, 811 were found unacceptable, a rejection rate of just over 2 percent, compared to Geor- gia’s turndown rate of 7 percent. i All of the 226 objections in Georgia were for elec- tion law changes in 49 of the state's 159 counties, plus the state government. Few of the objections have been for election law changes in north Georgia, where relatively few blacks live. Most of Georgia’s more populous areas have tried to make voting changes over the years that the Jus- tice Department has found discriminatory. _ But so have many rural and suburban areas, and the areas offering question- able election changes form no particular geographic pattern, other than the scarcity of problems in the mountains to the north. Objections can be major or comparatively minor. For example, the Justice Department's 1972 objec: tion to Georgia’s Senate and House redistricting is counted as a single objec- tion, despite the statewide im ea Yet when the Justice De- partment objected in 1975 — Christopher Coates, ACLU lawyer to'Rome’s annexation of 60 land parcels on the grounds that the annexations would dilute black voting strength within the city, it was counted as. 60 separate objections. ; Aside from anfexations, the local election modifica- tion that is most often found unacceptable is the that winning candidates receive a clear majority of votes when the local law had previously required a mere plurality. Since 1965, the Justice Department has rejected 30 such attempts by city and county governments in Georgia on the grounds that requiring a majority would make it more dif-” ficult for a minority candi- date to win. But the turndown rate is only half the story, accord- ing to those familiar with voting rights violations. The flip side is the hun- dreds of election law And changes that never get sub- mitted to the Justice De- partment for review. _ At eat half of the sub- missions from Georgia were not originally volun- . tary ones, a voting rights official in the Justice De- partment estimated.

        "ocr_text": "A trial of wills and wiles in Burke County By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Steff Wriler WAYNESBORO, Ga. — Life is curiously absent from the Burke County courthouse, a red-brick structure with a peaked clock tower that dominates the town. People are here, but not many, and they are dwarfed by high ceilings and broad hallways. The outside heat and leaden humidity of southern August emphasize listlessness. Yet this courthouse in southeast Georgia frames an ieee and potentially historic struggle of wills, black vs. white. The victor will be determined in another courtroom, by the Supreme Court of the United States, and the deci- will touch the futures of minorities throughout the na- jon. _ At stake is whether groups who believe they are being excluded from the electoral process can make their case with circumstantial evidence, or whether they must show direct “smoking gun” proof of the intent to discrimi- nate against them. < If the high court rules direct proof of intentional dis- crimination is required, it could spell the end to innumer- able voting rights cases before they ever are lodged, according to lawyers who are closely watching the Burke. case. Local black citizens sued the Burke County Commis- sion in 1976, charging that the at-large electoral system is maintained to keep blacks out of government. The totality of conditions here makes it impossible for blacks to win, they said, despite being nearly 60 per- cent of the population. They want elections by districts. Further, they charged, the use of at-large elections springs from habitual race discrimination evidenced in part by the stillness in the Burke County courthouse. The prevailing inaction is not a by-product of summer’s dog days, but a chronic condition whose most distinctive symptom, to the black community, is lack of service to the governed. Racial violence hardly has sullied the Bourbon image of Burke, a one-time plantation society, where agriculture still reigns and five white farmers comprise the governing body today. But that does not mean racism has not flourished. Said the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in its deci- sion last March: “The vestiges of racism encompass the totality of life in Burke County. The discriminatory acts of public officials enjoy a symbiotic relationship with those of the private sector.” ‘insensitivity to rights’ found once That is not all. In upholding U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimo’s decision in favor of the black plaintiffs, the court also said that the county commissioners “have demonstrated such insensitivity to the legitimate rights of the county's black residents that it can only be explained as a conscious and willful effort on their part to maintain the invidious vestiges of discrimination. “To find otherwise would be to fly in the face of over- whelming and shocking evidence.” Alaimo was so convinced in 1978 the black complain- ants were right that he ordered a new district system into effect, immediately scheduling a special county election and shortening the terms of the commissioners by two rs. . ; ay Blatks offered themselves for office in all five of the new districts. But the U.S. Supreme Court finally_granted the coun-__ ty’s request tora Stay of Alaimo’s order. No election was held. =~ , When the regular county election rolled around again no blacks were candidates, illustrating clearly how for- midable an obstacle they viewed the at-large system. Whether the U.S. Supreme Court will agree with Alaimo and the 5th Circuit is not at all certain. That is what makes this case important to many more:than the 19,300 people scattered over Burke County, a vast political subdivision that rambles across 832 square miles of piney woods and farmland. “T hope the civil rights community is aware of just w_important the Burke County case is,” said Christo- Billy Hopper: 'We just don’t feel we're bad people’ her Coates, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties inion. Coates specializes in Southern voting rights suits and has consulted in this case, known as Lodge vs. Buxton. “This is the nuts and bolts of whether black people get an equal piece of the pie, whether or not you've got access to local government,” Coates said. . Lodge is a voting dilution case, the brand of litigation in which a racial or ethnic group claims the government in power has violated the constitution and acted to dilute the group’s political strength, Burke a sequel to Mobile case It comes as a sequel to a case out of Mobile, Ala., in which the Supreme Court held that the accuser must show the government purposely discriminated in enacting or maintaining the electoral system under attack. The Mobile case increased the burden of proof on minorities, since past victories have been achieved by simply proving that discrimination has kept minorities from full electoral participation. The civil rights community was shocked by the Mo- bile case because the ruling said, in effect, that proving the existence of discrimination is not sufficient — it must also be proved that the discrimination is intentional. However, the high court left room for interpretation, and the 5th Circuit has gambled in the Lodge case that in- vidious purpose can be shown through circumstantial, rather than only through direct evidence. What the Supreme Court decides will bear deeply on the future of voting rights litigation. The distinction be- tween circumstantial and direct evidence is so crucial that the 5th Circuit appears to have called an informal moratorium on deciding such cases, pending guidance from the court above. Lawyer Coates said a reversal could end voting dilu- tion cases... i “Defendants who enact or maintain at-large elections for racially discriminatory purposes will never admit the same,” he said. “So plaintiffs in cases of this kind almost never will be able to put on direct evidence or admission by local and state officials that they have acted with a discriminatory purpose.” Burke County officials hardly admit to it. “We just don’t feel we're bad people or that we dis- criminated_against anybody,” said Billy Hopper, the county administrator. “We sincerely feel it's in the best interest of all the people of Burke County that we main- tain an at-large voting system.” Hopper said county officials oppose the district sys- tem because it is divisive — harkening to the parochial- ism of big-city ward politics — and it limits the accountability of each commissioner. “In the district system you'd have a man setting a tax on you that you have no control over. In an area like we have, we feel the best form is for a man to be elected by all the people of the county and to be accountable to all the people,” said Hopper. His concern about the tax rate probably is well taken. Ray DeLaigle: District elections would be divisive Black community leaders envision an array of social serv- ices never before provided to the rural poor of Burke, where, according to trial evidence, the incomes of more than half the blacks were three-quarters or less of the poverty level and more than 70 percent of the black households lacked full plumbing. If blacks ever got on the commission, which none has managed to do since the form of government was adopted in 1911, they almost certainly would try to raise the property tax rate of 13 7/8 mills, a very low rate, to sup- port some of those services@ ting access at issue In its Lodge decision, the 5th Circuit said government ponsiveness to the group claiming injury is essential ina voting dilution case, although that alone may not be sufficient to prove discrimination. Hopper and Burke County Commission Chairman Ray igle argued in a recent interview that the issues shtuld be limited to very narrow grounds of participation inthe electoral process. “The defendants, we feel like it centers on voter refistration and denying the vote,” said DeLaigle. “The iffs never proved that.” The plaintiffs did not claim they had been refused registration or entry to the voting booths. Not lately, any- Ww jowever, they showed other things the courts found convincing, including the county's resistance to establish- ing voter registration sites outside the courthouse. After thesuit was filed, according to testimony, the commission didopen satellite sites in three other towns. Other factors impressive to the 5th Circuit were the pervasive influence of historical discrimination, the de- pressed socio-economic condition of Burke County blacks, and lack of access to the political process. Blocking access have been the county commission's failure to appoint blacks to boards and commissions, the (alt ce of the Democratic Party by whites (the subject of another suit), the “social reality” that whites will not relate to blacks on an interpersonal basis, and the size of Burke County, which makes campaigning a sport for the nd the court found ample proof of the critical fac- tor, unresponsiveness. “Where there is a Negro section we can’t get 2 paved jad,” said K.C. Childers, at age 78 the spokesman emeri- ‘ths for Burke County blacks, and a plaintiff in this case. “Our churches and graveyards — sometimes we can’t get to them on the dirt roads.” Dorothy Lattimore, who won a seat on the Waynes- boro City Council after a federal court ordered district elections, recalled repeated, unsuccessful trips to the county commission when she worked with a community action agency. For example, she proposed applying for a Matching grant to buy a bus to carry poor people to Augusta for job training. Negative. “They still don’t hire blacks unless they have to, both r : e* Staff Photos—Bil! Mahan Dorothy Lattimore: The county won't hire blacks in county jobs and private businesses,” she said. “They (the commissioners) represent the county. Others look to them for attitudes.” Sharing the wealth — equally When the suit was filed, 18 of 271 appointments to boards and commissions had gone to blacks. Officials said they have no idea what the count is now, but black leaders said it hasn’t crept much higher. The county has done nothing about housing, which former Waynesboro Mayor Roy Chalker finds regrettable. A white politician openly sympathetic to black needs, Chalker literally changed the face of Waynesboro in the mid-1970s by replacing scores of rickety, substandard shanties with affordable brick homes or public housing. “These people were living in the same shacks their great-grandfathers were slaves in,” said Chalker, who publishes the weekly paper, the True Citizen. “Seriously, they were living in houses that were plantation slave quarters in the 1800s.” Out in the county many still live in them. A survey published in mid-1979 showed more than 30 percent of the dwellings in the county’s incorperated areas were mar- ginal or dilapidated. “County governments have different philosophies.” Chalker admitted. “If I were a county commissioner I'd probably do it a little differently, although I’m not sure the (federal) money is there now.” Herman Lodge, the lead plaintiff whose name identi- fies the suit, complained that what money is availabie from the small property tax isn’t shared with those who need it most. “We need to have services distributed equally,” said Lodge. “Like in recreation. What do they have for the handicapped? What's here for people 60 years and older? What recreation programs are there for girls, besides soft- ball and cheerleading? Or for boys who can’t compete (well) in competitive athletics? “The county commissioners are interested in money for concrete and asphalt. They're not interested in human services.” When Commission Chairman DeLaigle was asked to imagine what he would do with a bottomless purse full of pubdic money, be was hard-pressed to find many uses “We've already gotten into so many areas since I've been on the board. I just don't know,” he said. “We do need a new courthouse. We need a new jail. We need roads.” Plaintiff Childers was distressed, but not surprised. when told that several county officials, questioned sepa- rately, had suggested a courthouse is a priority need. “Here are people without jobs. People can hardly eat. And they talk about a courthouse,” Childers said. “What they do for me at the courthouse is if I get in trouble they try me there and then send me to the chain gang or to rison. “That's the only service of the courthause.” August 19, 1981 \f"

The modest increase in releases hasn’t nearly kept pace with the leaps and bounds by which incarcerations have grown.

Not in Georgia, officials sq By MARCIA KUNSTEL Journal Staff Writer Have revolving doors peen installed in Georgia prisons? Since the Board of Pargons and Paroles revealed its early commytation policy — under which nearly 1,309 convicts were released last month — Critics have suggested that criminals are shuffleq in and out of prison with frightening ease, The commutations and other acts taken 239.6. With the rates constantly in flux, Georgia may not be leading the list today, but it surely is close to the top. The rate of incarceration for the na-_ tion as a whole was 138.6 inmates per 100,000 people. Not only did the state - vastly exceed that, but it also had a higher rate than did the two countries with the highest nationwide incarceration rates in the world — the Soviet Union and South Africa, Carr said. Georgia doesn’t have that much more crime than other states, according to the FBI's crime index. The 1979 figures show the state slightly below the national aver- age of crimes committed, and that wasn’t an aberration. “Georgia’s rate has uniformly been lower than that of the United States at every point in time from 1966 through 1979,” said- Carr. That means people get locked up in Georgia for committing acts that bring lesser punishment — such as fines, probation or restitution — in other states. Apparently, this severest sanction is what the voters of Georgia desire, and that is what the state has tried to provide. Some who have criticized the parole board’s early release plan, particularly Fulton County District Attorney Lewis Slaton, at the same time have chided the Department of Offender Rehabilitation for failing to build enough prisons to accom- modate more prisoners. However, DOR in fact has taken the bricks and mortar approach to corrections. Right now, the department is building a 402-bed prison in Dodge County and a 400-bed institution in Augusta, which will carry an additional 135-bed medical unit. Last month the new, 650-bed Coastal Correction Institute in Chatham County began hosting inmates. In January, the to reduce the vulnerable citizen simply to mak tions, they charge, been letting out priso tences are completed, parole supervision, alternative if the correcti vive rather than explode, Metro Correction Institute opened in Atlanta with 650 beds. In 1979, Lee Correction Institute was rebuilt and expanded from 200 to 400 beds. In 1977, Central Correction Institute opened with 600 beds. In 1976, Jack T. Rutledge Correction Institute opened another 600 beds. Also in 1977, the Middle Georgia Cor- rection Institute was created, by renovat- ing three buildings from Central State Hospital in Milledgeville for 1,062 youthful offenders. That complex also includes the women’s unit, built in 1975 and just funded for expansion. The General Assembly gave DOR $500,000 last session for renovation of the old Rivers Building at Centra] State Hospi- tal into yet another prison. However, En- glade said, lawmakers neglected to ante up any money to staff, equip ang operate the 600-bed institution. Also in the 1970s, she said, the state added six new transition centers and 12 diversion centers. Next year, the Legislature will get re- quests for money to build two more 600- bed prisons for men, she said, By 1985, the state will have poured $100 million into renovations at Georgia State Prison, but the money won't buy space for more prisoners. The plans to convert the Reidsville prison into single-man cells, which will make it truly maximum segurity, have been on the books since the late 1960s. But it took a series of court orders to get the work under way. : = Among those orders was qa mandate to keep the population at about 2,000 men, compared to the 3,000 jammed on top of one another at the volatile penitentiary in the mid-1970s.

It will get worse. Georgia State Prison’s population, now standing at about 1,700 prisoners, must drop below 1,000 soon because of construction problems. Those prisoners will have to be absorbed somewhere. The courts also are being called upon to set population limits and demand better conditions at other state prisons and local jails, which only can add to the crowding. The combination of a high incarcera- tion rate, low parole rate and court man- dates doesn’t appear ready to unravel any time soon. Relief is not imminent. Morris of the parole board said build- ing more prisons may be the only answer, but wonders whether even that will suf- “If there was more space, they'd probably just sentence more people,” he said. “Several judges have told me they are not sending some people to prison who probably ought to go to prison because they are conscious of the overcrowded conditions.” Ultimately, the criminal must be ad- dressed, he said. “Tf we're ever going to turn things around in any way, we're going to have to deal with those people who committed the offenses. We can’t exterminate them. We need to deal with these people, to try to turn them around and change them if we can,” Morris said. From Offender Rehabilitation, Carr holds the view that more prisons won't work. He espouses community-based pro- grams such as the diversion centers, which allow a convicted felon to work in the free world and pay restitution to his victim. August 20, 1981 \f"

Eaves said he recognized the hazards going into the he dual faces of Reginald Eaves’ public career may be the most complex political puzzle confronting voters in the Atlanta mayor’s race. Seen by some as a model public servant on the Fulton County Commission for the last 32 months, Eaves also is encumbered with a notoriety accumulated during three Previous, grueling years as Atlanta public safety commis- sioner. The candidate claims he ran the Atlanta Public Safety Department with efficiency and innovation, produc- ing an enviable record of achievement ranging from lower crime rates to new levels of professionalism on the police force. His detractors claim he kept the police bureau in a state of roiling upheaval that culminated in the promo- tional exam cheating scandal and that led to his forced resignation in March 1978. Few observers disagree that Eaves virtually stopped police brutality against blacks and generally improved relations between police and citizens. “One thing I have to give him a lot of credit for,” said a white politician openly hostile to Eaves on most issues, “he did improve the police image in the black com- munity better than anybody I ever knew.” And some of his harshest critics admit that Eaves walked into a social, political and racial snarl that had EAVES: Impressive to some, notorious to others This is the first of three articles providing a close look at the public records of the major Atlanta mayoral candidates who have previously held public office.- The record of Andrew Young will be examined Friday and the record of Sidney Marcus on Monday. “I knew that the first black person in charge of a po- lice force and fire (department), but in particular a police force, in any major city in the country, and in particular in the South, was going to catch pure hell,” Eaves said in a recent interview. “I was right.” He continued: “It was frightening for a lot of folks all of a sudden to see the institution, the one institution that they could always depend on to protect them, to put peo- ple in their place, now being held by a black.” The Atlanta Journal interviewed more than two dozen people who have either worked directly with Eaves or have observed him closely over the years. Some believe he was largely the victim of racism. Others contend that Eaves built his own isolation box, step by step, repeatedly falling victim to the whims of his ego until he blocked out even a trusted friend, the mayor who had to fire him. Eaves got the job because Mayor Maynard Jackson, then embarking on his first term as the city’s first black mayor, wanted someone he trusted implicitly in a sensi- tive post. Jackson was stuck with an uncooperative police chief, John Inman, whom he couldn’t legally dislodge, so he created a new boss’s job and appointed Eaves.

Inmates er The Georgia Department of Of- fender Rehabilitation refused to release any information about the altercation until families of the wounded prisoners are notified. The attack took place in a yard outside “M Building,” the high se- curity residence mostly holding what are called “special management” ae who have a history of trou- le. Inmates housed there include men being disciplined for rules in- fractions, prisoners on protective custody status and others who have been unable to mingle with the general population. One report from the prison said Deputy Warden Jerry Thomas and a guard received scratches when they went to the aid of an injured prisoner lying in the yard. The inmate report- edly already had been knifed by attackers who had fled and then dou- bled back to assault him again, Thomas, the guard and a prison counselor intervened to prevent the second attack, and the two were slightly injured. “Fights on that yard are not uncommon. What is uncommon is that a couple of them were able to get weapons,” said Vince Nathan, the special monitor appointed by a federal judge to assure court-ordered reforms are implemented. Nathan confirmed the incident did occur, but said it is too early to judge any potential impact. “This confirms my feeling that the new Classification system has isolated the most dangerous men in the. prison,” Nathan said. “I would be a whole lot more concerned if this had happened in a general dormitory or general cellblock.” The classification system keeps in- mates housed according to behavior patterns and other factors in an ef- fort to improve insitutional security and inmate safety. Nathan said the prisoners from “M uilding” normally are strip-searched before entering the recreation yard, so the armed inmates apparently could not have carried the weapons out with them. The homemade knives could have been tossed over a fence into the yard by other prisoners or they could have been hidden some- where in the yard earlier, _ Georgia State Prison has been rela- tively calm in recent months, after a Series of more than a dozen serious Stabbings earlier this year.

Yet issues that specifically address ‘the needs of black women hardly have been addressed by the major mayoral candidates, according to one expert. That is the case despite recognition that black women carry a vote worth capturing. “The candidates in the mayoral race tend to ignore women, period,” said Dr. Shelby Lewis, director of the Women’s Institute of the Southeast at the Atlanta University Complex. _ “They aren’t saying black women have certain problems and they in- tend to deal with these problems,” she said. “They lump blacks together, or women together.

And a completely separate Women for Young organization has been raising money and otherwise supporting the candidate. Holmes said the Eaves campaign has made no special move to win fe- male support, but Eaves perhaps has concentrated on the issues concerning - poor black women more than the others. -He has built support in the churches and_= throughout housing projects where women dominate the scene. Overall in Atlanta, 57.9 percent of the registered voters are women. Among. blacks, 61.5 percent of the registered voters are women, or 66,- 100 women compared to fewer than 41,500 men. Among whites, 53.3 per- cent of the registered voters are women, or 44,500 women compared to fewer than 38,900 men. ‘ The phenomenon of black women registering -in greater numbers than men is not unique to Atlanta, but cer- “Every issue is a woman’s issue,” said David Franklin, a chief strate gist for Andrew Young. “Our appeal has been to all the voters,” said Bob Holmes, the cam- paign chairman for Reginald Eaves. “The issues, how they have been defined, have very much come from black women,” said Sidney Marcus’ spokesman Larry Woods, who no- netheless listed the very general topics of crime, unemployment and inflation as those issues defined by the needs of black women. Dr. Lewis, who spends most of her professional and personal life dealing with women’s issues, was more specific. “You have to recognize there are differences among black women in the city, class as well as ideological differences,” she said. “Regardless of those, there are some common. con- gerne that all black women tend to ave.” SEE Women 13A _ tainly has a special impact in a majority-black city. The reasons for the numbers are several,. and not new. There are more black men killed or in prison or in the military, which removes them from the population pool that votes,” said Ms. Lewis, add- ing that women also simply outnum- ber men.

John Lewis, the former director of the Voter Education Project, agreed with that assessment, adding he be- lieves the traditional female values of compassion and sensitivity also ac- count for women’s involvement. “If they believe an organization or an individual or a -government can - bring about change that’s going to be good for everybody,” he said, “they’re _™more willing to go out on a limb, to take that leap of faith.” October 1, 1981 \f"

The most detailed, firsthand account of abuse obtained by The Journal came from Lee Feller, a former GRC attendant who now is with a touring Christian thea- ter troupe called Covenant Players. Ms. Feller described systematic negli- gence, physical violence and verbal abuse by the direct care staff with whom she worked. They are the lowest paid, least trained and least educated personnel at the institution, and the ones in most constant contact with the retarded residents. Ms. Feller first spoke in an interview with an official of the Georgia Association of Retarded Citizens in September. Reached in Birmingham, Ala., this week- end, Ms. Feller confirmed that a transcript of the interview was accurate, and she fur- ther described her experience at GRC. In the transcript, she cited abuse by a male staff member whom she helped to awaken the boys and dress them in a sec- ‘tion of the unit where she did not normally work. “This one little kid that was really kind of wild and bad, I remember. I don’t remember which student*it was, but I remember it was kind of a little guy. He (the staff member) picked him up and threw him against the wall,” she said. “And there’s a dent in the wall where it happened, where he hit his head.

And I think that’s about the time that I quit, because it just got to me, you know, that I would get into that.” Ms. Feller said she and a co-worker did report abusive conditions to a high- level supervisor who she characterized as the chief administrator of GRC, although She could not remember his name. since then, but produced little or no visible results. Staff suggestions for improvements, such as one-way mirrors that would reveal abusive incidents, also have been ignored by the center’s officials. © Staff members intimidate newcomers and even supervisors who question the treat- ment of residents, who range in age from newborns to young adults, although most mis- treatment is concealed from anyone who Might actively disapprove.

Among incidents related to her was the story of a student who could not con- trol his bowels. “For this reason, to prevent him from messing up his clothes, the staff wouldn't feed him,” said the former supervisor, who asked to remain anonymous. “The plate would be placed in front of him in case anybody came in. But every time he'd go to take a bite of food, a staff member would hit him on the head.” A student who lay on the floor in the morning routinely was kicked by a staff member to make him get up and get dressed, she said. Certain objects, such as hairbrushes and the metal hex keys used to open win- dows, which staff members kept on their key rings, were described as commonplace weapons by this supervisor and other per- sonnel. . Besides getting repeated and identical reports about abusive tactics, and besides finding the numerous, unexplained injuries, the supervisor saw other signs leading her to believe the stories. “You just pick up a hairbrush, and these students will cower,” she said. Others gave similar accounts. The former supervisor said she and two other professional employees told SEE Abuse 72 PAGES, 5 SECTIONS 25 CENTS workers threatened their lives. * Medical treatment is insufficient, wi doctors frequently making diagnoses over the telephone, rather than coming to the cottages or clinic areas if a student is injured at nigh or on weekends.

He denied ever re- ceiving a tape recording or any photographs of abused children, although other staff members said they did give photographs of badly battered students to superiors other than Ray. Ray said some staff members periodically have approached him with con- cerns about isolated inci- dents or about individual employees they fear may be abusers, but he said he never has heard allegations of systematic, widespread abuse at the institution. “I’m really proud of our facility,” he said, claiming less abuse goes on there than at many other institu- tions. The director did admit, however, that he has ex- perienced difficulty in removing staff members believed to be involved in irregular activities, be- cause of stringent merit system regulations. Ray also said abuse is difficult to prove since some of the stude _are extremely ‘and injure them- r children. : re more prone dents, he added. : FROM 8A have been dismissed for mistreatment since he has headed GRC, and he said the GBI has been called i to investigate isolated inci dents as.many as 15 to 20 times. £ Regarding the current GBI investigation, Ray said he has been told _ that agents so far have ‘found nothing to substantiate” the allegations of widespread abuse. Although Ms. Feller was at GRC in 1978, and the supervisor only a year be- yond that, current staff members said they believe little has changed. Many of the direct care personnel who were said to be abusers a couple years ago still are at the institu- tion. The first detailed charges to reach state gov- ernment offices this sum- mer came during an inves- tigation undertaken by the t has been alleged that racial discrimination at GRC is a lesser factor, if not a subterfuge to cover the actual reasons for the polarization of employees at the facility,” said an internal GOFEP memoran- dun obtained by The Jour- nal. “Tt is alleged: that stu- dent abuse is the central theme around which camps or factions haye formed as a means of protecting the abusers from _ prosecution or disciplinary actions,’ it said. Although most current employees were reluctant to discuss abuse, the memo added, mone denied its existence. Present and former supervisory personnel, who have attempted to break ‘the cycle of mistreatment, say they have been stymied lack of cooperatio from the top and by a re- tion can be taken against an abuser. “There is so much pres- “sure put on the staff not to talk (until) they literally fear for their lives,’ said one current supervisor who has worked at the institu- tion more than five years. “Plus they are friends. It’s a combination of fear- friendship pressure.”’ Stephen Goddard, for- merly the security supervi- sor placed at GRC by a contracted security company, said he arrived in September of 1980 to find several reports of abu- Sive incidents that never were investigated. One dealt with a student who was found in bed at 7:30 a.m. with a broken leg but did not receive any medical treatment until 11 a.m., Goddard said. “They just flat ignored him,” said Gceddard, who charged there was no explanation of what hap- pened to the boy or why it took so long for his injury to be tended. “In a second case, a child was found by the morning shift with blood | everywhere in the room,’ . he said. “Her head was) split open.

Center Superintendent David Ray and other senior administrators said in interviews Monday that some abuse of the nearly 400 retarded students there does exist, as in ny comparable facility. But they denied widespread mis- treatment, as alleged by a number of people associated with the institution. ‘+ Ray said tho accvsers must be lying. ‘I don't think there’s abuse out here, certainly not wholesale abuse,” Ray said. “I’d stake my life on it.” Even so, he admitted that seven employees have been dismissed in the last six months for abusing students. Joseph Edwards, commissioner of the Department of Human Resources, which runs the Chamblee treatment center, initiated a probe by the Georgia Bureau of Investi- gation into the range of conditions there, including allega- tions of staff abuse. The investigation, expected to be completed soon, in- cludes checking circumstances of 10 student deaths in a 13-week period late last year and early 1981. The deaths have not been related to any direct abuse. Center FROM 1A -* Any injury, accident or unusual occurrence must be written up in an incident report. Jim Masaschi, assistant superintendent for personnel and staff development, said 25 to 30 such reports are filed daily, ranging from de- scriptions of “a pin prick” suffered by an employee to a student’s broken arm. . The reports, however, do not always explain how an injury observed on a student got there. : Some are found by nurses or other workers who make periodic “body checks” of the students, a procedure that Ray said is encouraged by the administration to find signs of abuse. “If one reviews the incident reports, there are many instances of injury to the students which are unexplained,” said a current supervisor, interviewed late last week, who has been at the center more than five years and who asked not to be identified. “An example is John Smith (a pseudonym), who’s had a broken ankle twice in the last year and a half. Yet no oneseems to know the cause of these injuries. “We've had students hit in the head who’ve had large gashes in their heads. “Often, these have required multiple sutures. Overall, the frequency of instances which are actually reported is extremely high. “I strongly believe that they are occurring more often than happenchance or the normal operation of the unit would allow.” Other. employees have been outraged at media re- ports regarding the center. The employees say virtually no abuse exists there. > “ve been there a year and a half, and I’ve never seen evidence of abuse,” said Charlotte Mills, a registered ‘nurse. “I’ve seen kids hurt, but it’s because of the kind of kids they are.” ‘ Ms. Mills said she works nights in the infii routinely visits all the cottages te treat students. ies Lt. Don Alameda, a security guard at the center, said he seldom has seen signs of abuse, and he complained that media reports painted all the institution’s employees as child-beaters.

There are less incidences in the activity rooms because there are large windows, and one is able to see from section to section.” — on His comments were echoed by two other supervisors questioned by The Atlanta Journal and two: more former professional workers interviewed by an official of the Georgia Association of Retarded Citizens who made inter- view transcripts available. Superintendent Ray said that more than a year ago administrators at the center discussed putting glass in the heavy, locked doors so outsiders could detect problems with the students, emergencies, or abuse inside the rooms. But he said he was told it would be a difficult process. Be- sides, he said, he felt it was not really needed and would lend a “Gestapo” atmosphere to the institution. Lee Feller, a direct-care worker at the center in was several moni be s ust who might report it. “A lot of times there were people left alone, and it’s amazing, the minute that somebody uncool would come around, it was a change of personality,” she said. “All of a sudden it was, ‘Nice boy, good boy’ — affirmations and reinforcement and the correct command and gesture pat- tern... . And correct procedure all of a sudden, suddenly began being used. It was almost like you could smell them (supervisors) coming.” Many of the same staff cited by Ms. Feller and others as abusers in 1978 and 1979 still work at the center, they said. Ms. Feller and the others claiming abuse at the cen- ter said another prevalent form of abuse has been with- holding food from students. r A former professional staff member who left last year said she began noticing weight losses of as much as 20 pounds. She said she had been told by direct-care workers — the people who provide basic care and spend the most time with the students — of techniques to abuse and avoid detection. In the dining area, for example, food would be placed on the plate of a child, so if anyone questionable walked through the room it would appear the student was eating his meal normally. However, every time the student would go to take a bite of food, he would be hit on the head with a long metal hex key used for opening windows. The keys were said to be a frequent instrument of abuse, applied to the head so bruises or cuts would be hidden by the students’ hair. “Why did they do it?’ said the professional staff member. “It cuts down on BMs ‘(bowel movernents), and it cuts down on clothes changes, because so many kids are messy.” Some accusers have questioned the practice of paying direct-care staff so little and of hiring people with no ex- perience with retarded children or adults. Superintendent Ray said the basic requirement for an entry-level direct-care worker is having a high school diploma. No special training is required, although all incoming workers get a 40-hour in-service training course- Masaschi, the personnel director, said the course covers a range of topics including the signs and Sy eat of illness, beliavior ‘management, student rights, student abuse and employee rights. Retorendes oF applicants usually are cert, Ray said, but no background check is done to Pan a 5 i eg spective employee has a criminal background, inclu whether he ever has been an abuser. oo eetea Ray said the GBI has suggested that the administ?® tion conduct background investigations.

        "ocr_text": "Three former center workers claim staff mistreating retarded patients By Mercia Kunstel Journal Staff Writer yf Three recent employees have made new allegations of abuse at the Georgia Retardation Center, for the first time including charges of mistreatment in the skilled nursing care unit where the most seriously ill, bedridden patients reside. _ The former workers said they never would let their own children stay at the state institution where about 400 students and patients, most of whom are severely or pro- foundly retarded, are treated. However, two said they would like to return if the institution ever is cleaned up, because they feel a special satisfaction in helping retarded children. “Pve never worked with such mean people in all my life,” said Suzanne Hopper, a health services technician at the retardation center from November 1980 until mid-Sep- tember of this year, when she said she resigned. Ms. Hopper said she mostly saw verbal abuse of the patients, although she did recall one incident of physical aay at the therapy building of the institution in Cham- lee. “Janie (a pseudonym) had a hole in her chest and she grunted a lot, especially when she got excited,” Ms. Hop- per said, in describing the incident in which another direct care worker smacked a bedridden child. “One day she was grunting’and he hit her on the legs.” What was tke effect on the child? She stopped grunt- ‘ing, said Ms. Hopper, who now works in marketing re- search. ‘The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating allegations of widespread abuse, at the behest of Joseph Edwards, commissioner of the Department of Human Re- sources, which operates the facility. Most charges made public so far have involved units where the ambulatory, less severely impaired students, are housed. Ms. Hopper said nurses and direct care staff mem- bers in the skilled nursing units often neglected the more unpleasant procedures required to clean and care for the. seriously ill patients, although she said yelling at the pa- tients and calling them names were routine activities that most disturbed her. SEE Abuses 21A»> FROM 1A . “Many of the skilled care patients have ex-- tremely limited physical and mental capabilities, and are barely aware of their envi- ronment. =. But Ms. Hopper said they do respond to the tone of voice directed to them or the manner in which they are handled, “They can tell. They can pick up the nega- tive energy,” she said, “They can’t talk back. They can’t defend themselves. Verbal abuse of babies — there's no excuse for that, ~ “T would never put any child of mine out The state bill of rights governing facilities for the mentally retarded states: “The individ. ual dignity of clients shall be respected at all times and upon all occasions,” It prohibits mis- treatment, neglect or abuse in any form. Another former worker, who left the insti- tution last spring after receiving threats against herself and her child, said she saw wide-ranging abuse in a unit of the therapy building housing patients who were not bedridden, but still had serious medical problems. Many were wheel- chair bound, * One boy was physically abused almost every day, said the former worker, who asked not to be identified due to the threats and be- cause she one day would like to return to the retardation center. The boy would be punched and kicked, even atter he fell out of his wheelchair onto the floor, she ‘said. The staff would “fill out incident re- to suit themselves,” claiming the injuries resulted from accidents, Often they said he sim- ply fell out of the wheelchair. “He had lots of bruises and cuts, bloody mouth and nose,” she said. This particular boy was “safer” to abuse, she said, because he very seldom had any visi- tors checking his health or progress, This worker, who had been at the center for nearly eight years, said she did report the incidents to superiors once she realized what was going on. That, she said, is what prompted the threats, “T did tell the person above me,” she said, “Dut I guess that’s as far as it went,” It was the incidents in the therapy building and the letter threatening her child that finally convinced this woman to leave, she said, al- though she claimed abuse was even more fre- quent in the cottages. Another former worker, who left the early this year after spending three years at the insti. tution, reinforced accounts given by other present and former staff members, adding some new details concerning the form and extent of abuse, This woman asked not to be identified out of fear of reprisals, and said she was so fright- ened of her one-time co-workers that she would not talk to the GBI about incidents she wit- nessed there, A direct care worker, or health services technician, she was among the employees Spending the most time with the students who Were ambulatory and resided in cottages in dormitory-style settings, The health services sa at Relation are rege Es Sich as getting the students and fed and tang sone of them, She said the most revolting incidents she saw involved giving the students urine to drink.

Usually they were hit no bruise would be produced, which was a with the black students, she said, UP Pulling hair to control a student also Not unusual, she said, She said physical abuse was widespread in the unit in which she worked, although not all the staff members participated. Those who did not, she said, were intimidated by verbal threats or with actions such as having their automobile tires slit, She recalled one occasion on which she ap- proached a worker eating the students’ food and warned the worker that she had better leave enough for all the children in the unit. The co- worker grabbed her around the throat and started to choke her, byt then backed off, she said, Perhaps the most frequent form of mis- treatment was withholding food as punishment, she said, claiming it happened to one or another child virtually every day, The state law defining cruelty to children, which carries a penalty of one to five years in prison, states: “A parent, guardian or other per- Son supervising the welfare of or having im- mediate charge of or cystody of a child under the age of 18 commits cryelty to children when he willfully deprives the child of necessary sustenance or maliciously qguses the child cruel or excessive physical or mental pain.” The worker Said che was to0 frightened to make formal reports ahoyt such activities, al- though two supervisors and a professional worker, one of whom gti) js at the retardation center, did confirm that she spoke to them informally about abuse in the unit.

        "ocr_text": "By Marcia Kunste! Journal Staff Writer ee _ The Georgia Association for Retarded Citizens has concluded that “continuing and substantial abuse” has pervaded the Georgia Retardation Center in Chamblee The association, an advocac u with 13,000 members, also eel pie Human Resources Commissioner Joseph ‘Edwards to create a special commission to investigate all charges concerning deaths and the physical and psychological abuse of residents at the center. The report, which was to be submitted to Edwards today, grew from an investiga- tion conducted since last summer by the } association. “We are convinced that there is sub- stantial evidence that a pattern of abuse of residents exists in the facility,” the report said. “This abuse appears to have been made known to all levels of administrative | ] responsibility, up through and including Superintendent David Ray.” _., Ray has denied receiving reports of widespreac/abuse of residents. The group began receiving allegations of abuse months before the charges began appearing in the news media and before Edwards called in the Georiga Bureau of Investigation to conduct an inquiry at the facility for seriously retarded children and young adults. SEE GRC 10A FROM 1A The association said interviews with staff members, former employ- ees, parents of residents and others produced evidence of the following abuses at the center: © The systematic beating, kicking and hitting of residents with such items as belt buckles and hex keys. ® The encouragement of residents to fight with and abuse each other. © The failure to. provide appropri- ate treatment programs. ® The withholding of food from residents as punishment. © The improper use of psycho- tropic drugs. “One of the most disturbing facts we have encountered is that many of these abuses hve been made known to the entire chain of administrative personnel,” the report said. , The association cited several meet- ings that staff members reportedly had with Ray in which they said they presented him “documentary and. data-based information concerning the abuse.” Ray has denied any prior knowledge of allegations of extensive, systematic abuse at GRC, and he said the charges are lies. The association wants the immedi- ate suspension of all administrators who had prior knowledge of abusive incidents at GRC or who, by virtue of their position of responsibility, should have had such knowledge. An association spokeswoman said includes virtually the entire range of administrative personnel at the center. The association also questioned the investigations into the deaths of 10 GRC residents that occurred in a 13- week period in late 1980 and early this year. The report maintained there exists “huge gaps in the investi- gations conducted by Dr. Steven Shore into medical procedures applied to the patients and by the GBI into possible criminal activities contributing to the deaths.” Both the scrutinies resulted in no findings of irregular conduct. The report questions the GBI’s fail- ure to interview parents of residents who died, and more boardly critiqued the agency's overall investigation into conditions at GRC. For example, the GBI conducted interviews in the presonnel office at the institution, making it apparent which staff members were talking to agents. ‘ “We view this as an unfortunate practice which could serve to chill many persons who may have been willing to talk, and it could serve to facilitate targeting of staff for retali- ation,” the report said. Employees told members of the as- sociation that they believed the GBI investigation has been superficial, and they have expressed fear about talking to agents. The special investigatory commis- sion, as requested in the report, would include representatives from the Department of Human Resources, the Georgia General Assembly, the association, and outside experts field of mental retardation. The panel _ Should have a staff and full authority to review records, the report said. Earlier this summer Commissioner Edwards appointed a panel of mostly | professional personnel to investigate | conditions at GRC, but the commis- sioner then called in the GBI after learning the facility's staff was reluc- tant to cooperate with his panel. A final recommendation made by | the association, which has 70 chap- ters throughout Georgia, is a mora- torium on funding the expansion or: renovation of institutions for the mentally retarded, in favor of devel- oping alternative community facili- ties. A plan to move all mentally re- tarded persons from large institutions to community settings already is ana by state law, the report said. “We believe institutions, by their very nature, to be abusive and inhu- mane,” the report said, pointing out that the DHR recently identified 600 institutionalized persons in critical ee of alternate community place- ment. tutional abuse and to develop a com prehensive network of communit residential and service alternatives which will enable all persons wi ‘mental retardation to live lives which are as productive and enriching and normal as possible,” the association said.

        "ocr_text": "No malpractice in 10 deaths, prober reports By Marcia Kunstel Journal Staff Writer The care afforded to 10 students who died in 13 weeks at the Georgia Retarda- tion Center was “satisfactory medically,” according to the outside doctor who found foul play did not contribute to the deaths. Dr. Stephen Shore, who assessed conditions primarily on the basis of a brief on-site visit and by studying medical records provided to him by the institution, said he was impressed with the medical operation. He rated it “in the 90s” on a scale of 1 to 100. “ “The overall operation out there is ‘certainly satisfactory medically. The (medical) staff appears to care a great deal about the people they’re charged with,” said Shore, who specializes in infec- tious diseases and immunology and also has worked in pediatrics. ° “As to what goes on in the cottages between individual personnel and individ- ual students, that’s an entirely separate issue,” he said. “I think that’s where things should really be looked at.” He referred to allegations by present and former staff members that systematic abuse occurs in the cottages — the quar- ters holding ambulatory students, Dr. John Cooledge, the GRC medical director, asked Shore to check into medical practices and the histories of the patients who died at the center between Nov. 28, 1980, and Feb. 18, 1981. At the time of his study Shore was affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control, although his investiga- tion was not a CDC project. Shore said he found no sign of foul play, and Friday the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which has been investigating the deaths and the wide range of accusa- tions of mistreatment at the center, an- ————— $$$ SEE Deaths 108 > Deaths nounced agents had determined all 10 deaths were due to natural causes, Shore did find a number of what he called “deficien- cies” in the center’s medical operation, but he said they were not serious enough to constitute substandard prac- tices, . “They didn’t, in my opinion, commit medical mal- practice,” Shore said. “That would be the bottom line.” He was asked in March or April to look over the charts of the 10 who died and determine “if there were any problems or deficiencies in care, any acts attributable to the medical or paramedical personnel or see if there was any common cause (for the deaths) that I could iden- tify,” Shore said. Considering that the normal death rate at the center | had been about one per three-month period, Shore said he probably would have called for an outside opinion a month or two earlier, possibly by early February, after six of the 10 deaths occurred. Shore did not have autopsy reports on all the deaths, since only three autopsies were conducted and only two reports of them were available. One recommendation he made was for a state law requiring autopsies in all deaths at state institutions, both as a deterrent to abusive ac- tivity and as a defense for medical personnel should accu- sations of mistreatment be made, Among problems Shore cited were failures to treat the patients with large doses of antibiotics when infection was detected, to recognize infections quickly, to take appropriate bacteria samples, and to have complete pa- tient charts. At least six of the 10 died of probable pneumonia or other forms of infection, although the specific cause was not known in all cases. Most of the criticisms, however, could be applied to any average hospital or institution, Shore contended, and do not mean that the center runs a substandard medical operation, For example, he said, many hospitals or private physicians don’t give large dosages of antibiotics. “My position is that you treat with high doses, especially when there is a high chance of dying,” Shore said. A three-member panel of doctors at the center re- sponded to Shore's comments that antibiotics are not used routinely in massive quantity because it contributes to the’ creation of antibiotic-resistant strains of organisms. The panel did agree, however, that higher dosages could have been applied in some of the specific cases under study. In its only other major objection, the panel protested Shore's recommendation that nurses’ notes be placed on each patient's chart every shift. They called that “an impossible requirement” considering the high patient/ nurse ratio. November 9, 1981 \f"

Another administrator said staff thembers remain ridden with anxiety over who will go next, fearing past efforts to cooperate with the former superintendent make them unjustly suspect now. three trusted co-workers from the BHR central office, who apparently serve as extensions of his own eyes and ears.

The publicity, he suggested, has engendered fears that the public now will assume workers are employing brutality, regardless of the situation.

        "ocr_text": "Judge’s order forces prison to move 240 By Marcia Kunstel Journat Staff Writer A federal judge has ordered the state to shut down the Georgia State Prison building housing the most troubled, violen inmates because it is “unfit for huma habitation.” The order marks a stunning setback in progress documented at the Reidsville prison in recent years. U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimc acted on the findings of expert consultants who uncovered filthy, inhumane conditions including psychotic prisoners languishing in their own excrement, The Atlanta Jour nal has learned. Alaimo’s order has been sealed to the public, but two corrections personne knowledgeable about the Reidsville case confirmed that the judge has directed the closing of M-Building and the relocation o its nearly 240 prisoners. Alaimo's order came in the longstand- ing prison-conditions suit Guthrie vs. Evans, which has resulted in a broad range of court-ordered improvements at Reids- ville in the last few years. Both Bob Cul- len, the attorney for the prisoners, and Sata Englade, the public affairs director for the Department of Offender Rehabili- tation, refused to comment on or even ac- knowledge the sealed order. Corrections personnel knowledgeable about the order said it was issued in mid- February. It apparently has been sealed until the building has been fully evacuated, but one corrections system employee con- firmed that prisoners were being moved out shortly after the order was issued. “It’s got staff members pretty well stirred up,” he said, referring to conditions in M-Building. “None of them want to work in there. Any time they get near, (the prisoners) throw waste, human waste, on them, or hot water.” SEE Prison An indication of condi- tions is contained in a brief served on the state and sent for court filing this week by Cullen, who is ask- ing Alaimo to replace the state’s mental health treat-— ment system for prisoners at Reidsville. The brief says the cell block of M-Building hous- ing mentally disturbed prisoners already has been closed by the state “‘due to environmental conditions, for human habita- brief consultants conditions im one part of the building included ‘‘men who had been lying in their own urine for seven days completely unattended and unshowered; men who went unfed and unclean for days, men found who and on themselves.’’ Cullen said the state wolunteered to close that one cell biock, but he re- fused to comment when asked whether the remain- der of the building has been ordered abandoned. “<The main door of the cell block had huge clumps of feces on it, clumps as big as your fist,*” Cullen said.

        "ocr_text": " f : : Charles Montggmery By Marcia Kunstel Journal Staff Writer Warden Charles Montgomery is planning to leave Reidsville after leading Georgia State Prison through two years of remarkable reform that lately has begun to erode. Montgomery will return to the federal cor- rections system, which had “loaned” him to Georgia's Department of Offender Rehabilita- tlon, according to a federal official. The warden was not exactly under pressure to depart, but people close to the system said state officials have not made a strong move to keep him. Speculation centers on Lansom Newsome as a probable successor He has held several positions with DOR and is in charge of coordi- nating efforts to implement federal court orders at Reidsville. Montgomery became Reidsville’s sixth warden in 10 years when he took over the maximum-security prison, which haS suffered continual turmoil attributed to racial tensions and untenable living conditions. Montgomery, 44, has made considerable improvements. He had not been expected to fin- ish his career here, unless the state and federal governments could work a deal assuring him lucrative federal pension benefits, which he re- portedly will be eligible to receive in less than 10 years. However, it had been uncertain exactly ne long he would remain as warden. Mont- ee \"@ Warden planning to leave Reidsville prison gomery has worked under an annual contract, which expires June 30. Patricia Sledge, special assistant to the director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, said Montgomery will return as of June to the federal system, taking a position as associate warden at the Federal Correctional Institution at Petersburg, Va. “He would be getting a warden’s job if we had it,” Ms. Sledge said. Montgomery was the warden of a minimum-security federal work camp in Safford, Ariz. before coming to Geor- gia. Although Ms. Sledge said Montgomery had made a final decision to leave Georgia, princi- SEE Prison - 14A > te: nme ae Prison pal figures in corrections here said as late as Friday that they were uncertain whether he would stay or leave. DOR Commissioner David Evans, reached Friday before Ms, Sledge confirmed Montgom- ery’s move, said no decision had been made by either side — by Montgomery or by the state — on renewing his contract. “Tt will have to be (made) soon, to be fair to everybody,” Evans said. State Sen. Joseph Kennedy (D-Claxton), the chairman of a prisons subcommittee, has been openly hostile to Montgomery. His views are important to DOR, because Kennedy also repre- sents corrections interests on the budget-writin Senate Appropriations Committee. , When toid last week that the warden prob- ably was leaving, Kennedy responded: “Hal- Jelujah.” But Montgomery repeatedly has been praised for doing a remarkable job by Vincent Nathan, the Ohio lawyer appointed by a federal judge to assure the implementation of court orders for a wide range of prison reforms at Reidsville. FROM 1A About six months before Montgomery ar- rived, Nathan wrote a damning critique of the prison, citing blatant violations of U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimo’s orders for change there. Then-Warden Charles Balkom soon was fired after he said he would not carry out the orders. In a report issued six months after Mont- gomery took over, and in subsequent reviews as well, Nathan charted continued improvements and. expressed optimism that the warden would bring the prison into compliance with the orders. He also said he believed Montgomery was committed to reform. However, earlier projections that Georgia State Prison would be in compliance with court orders sometime this year have been abandoned as some remaining problems intensified and some progress was reversed. For example, one 240-bed unit for special management inmates, set up by Montgomery, recently was ordered closed by Judge Alaimo for conditions unfit for human habitation. Also, medical services at one point were thought to be nearing a status satisfactory to the court, but inspection by Nathan resulted in a negative report demanding extensive changes. - Some people close to the situation said the trouble stems in part from a clique of guards who remain opposed to court-ordered reforms and have attempted to thwart Montgomery's | success, and from a lack of cooperation from the central DOR office. Montgomery has been able to get rid of some guards found to have been involved in brutal treatment, but, more important, he has set up several systems designed to improve effi- ciency of operations and to extend fair treat- ment to. prisoners. These include new systems for discipline, grievances and classification of inmates, He has improved general living conditions in some parts of the prison and has overseen completion of the first phase of a massive construction-renovation project. Serious prob- lems persist in medical and psychiatric treat- ment, as well as in personal safety of inmates. Montgomery brought two chief aides with him from Arizona to help straighten out Geor- gia State Prison, but one already has left and the other will precede the warden in departing. Jerry Thomas, the former deputy warden for security, recently was made warden of Alto Industrial Institute. His departure was not en- tirely amicable. April 12, 1982 \f"

        "ocr_text": "while fleeing from house Shoot-out at Atlanta home leaves 1 dead, officer hurt By Marcia Kunstel Staff Writer Atlanta police shot a fleeing suspect Saturday after- noon who killed one man and then barricaded himself in- side a southwest Atlanta home, shooting at police officers with a high-powered rifle and wounding one slightly. The hour-long melee pitted police against Alfred Ber- nard Jessie, 36, 1433 Woodland Terrace S.W. Jessie was a suspect in the shooting death of Michael Ronald Bennett,.33, 1430 Woodland Terrace S.W. Author- ities said: Bennett was shot just-inside the door of his home across the\\street from the house where the suspect holed up later. _ Neighbors said: the suspected gunman was shot at least four times by police;who confirmed that they fired < the suspect as he fled from the rear of the barricade jouse. Municipal Court Judge Arthur Kaplan, who provided medical assistance at the scene, said Jessie was shot at Jeast three times in the chest and head. A spokesman at Grady Hospital said Jessie was in intensive care in criti- cal condition Saturday night. Police hoped to be able to talk to Jessie to discover a motive for the shooting. Charges in connection with the incident were still pending late Saturday night. Maj. W.W. Holley and Capt. Eugene Robinson gave this account of events that disrupted the hilly, wooded street Saturday: Police received a call about 3 p.m. that a person had been shot on Woodland Terrace. They arrived to find a man wearing sneakers and jogging pants, walking down the street, who was pointed out by residents as the assail- ant, When the young man saw the officers, he began shoot- ing at them and ran to barricade himself in the red brick house where the Jessie family lives. Police said they tried to make contact with the assail- ant, who sporadically shot at them with a high-powered rifle. They tried to call him on the telephone, but the line was busy and police said a Southern Bell spokesman told them the phone apparently was off the hook. Robinson said officers from the special operations unit also tried to make contact with him with a bullhorn, but they could not get close enough because of the gunfire. After about an hour, the suspect burst out the back door and across the wooded yard and was cut down by officers stationed around the house. He was resuscitated by Kaplan and other medical technicians and taken to Grady Hospital. : Police said Officer David Vinson received a minor leg injury from a shot fired from the house. He was in good condition at Grady Saturday night. Neighbors gathered in small clusters all along the road lined with neat and solid middle-class homes, after police gave the all-clear signal. Gunman FROM 1B Bill Culp of 1464°Dodson Drive saidhe  . was working in his garden when he heard a commotion. “I heard some gunshots and woman screaming,” minutes later he heard Another neighbor, Jesse Williamson, said he arrived at his home at 1415 Wood- land Terrace about 3 or 3:30 p.m. As he. emerged from his car, police told him to — get in his house and stay there. “You didn’t dare to come out of the house,” Williamson said. “With those bullets, you didn’t know homes. 2 gee E 3 Fi 5 ah a2de August 8, 1982 \f"

District Judge Anthony Alaimo and by his Special Monitor Vincent Nathan, according to agent Mullin, Both have intimate knowl- edge of Georgia State Prison through their work with the longstanding Gut- hrie vs, Evans suit over prison condi- tions. Nathan, the Ohio lawyer who monitors the state's compliance with Judge Alaimo’s orders-for widespread reforms at Georgia State Prison, fre- quently receives communications from prisoners alleging violations of ‘The court orders. Upon Nathan’s request, the judge temporarily removed the prisoners making these latest allegations from Georgia State Prison on Aug. 6 and placed them in federal custody, ac- cording to court records. Mullins said FBI agents inter- viewed the inmates at the Chatham ‘County jail, a federal holding facility. This apparently is the first time Alaimo has ordered state prisoners into federal custody in relation to a Guthrie suit investigation. This also marks the first formal involvement by the FBI. Nathan said only that the charges involve “alleged inappropriate staff conduct,” but would, not confirm or deny that the specific charges ob- ‘tained by the newspaper were topics of the FBI investigation.

The prisoners said they told FBI agents “much of this same informa- tion” revealed to the newspaper, add- ing they decided to talk now because recent developments make them fear a guard or guards have devised a scheme to kill them.

The Personnel Board ordered the 30-day suspensions for guards James Durrence, James Wells, Craig Tatro and Timothy Lundell, who had been fired for using excessive force against prisoner Edward Lee during a tense confrontation at the rison in department court order. “If the administration of GSP can- a Continued From.Page 1-A not terminate an officer for failing to file an accurate use-of-force report, then it has no way of policing itself and maintaining control,” said court Monitor Vincent Nathan, the Ohio attorney appointed to enforce US. District Judge Anthony Alaimo’s orders at Reidsville. Nathan called the incident “one of the most egregious I have seen down there,” and said the firings were appropriate. Commissioner Evans was not available to comment on whether he will appeal the decision to a Superior Court. In an interview earlier this week he described the case as impor- tant for establishing the authority of managers at the prison, which has been plagued with repeated problems of brutality, unsanitary conditions and other treatment found unconsti- tutional in federal court. In his brief letter appealing the hearing officer's ruling, Evans said the state is under court order to stop the excessive use of force at. Reids- ville. “As the responsible managers and the professionals dealing in this area every day, we investigated this occurrence and determined that the force used was clearly excessive, Evans wrote. “It seems necessary that the hearing officer confirm our decision unless there be clear and incontrovertible evidence of a capri- cious use of management's power. “To rule otherwise is to take over spires LOUIE FAVORITE/Statt Georgia is under court order to stop excessive use of force at Reidsville the management of the prison.” Evans has voiced quiet displeasure in the past with board rulings, af- firming the need for employee due process but questioning some specific decisions that he said required the DOR to keep unsuitable personnel: “You've got people who know noth- ing about the prison environment making these decisions,” Evans said this week. Nathan, too, supported the concept of an outside agency's reviewing per- sonnel actions but said that he be- lieves the facts of misconduct were established without doubt and that DOR must have the ability to deter- mine suitable punishment for the of- fense. The case in question involved an effort to move an inmate with a history of violent confrontations from one cell to quarters in another unit with tighter security. A lieutenant and at least eight offi- cers were at the scene when inmate Lee, described as standing 6-foot-6 and weighing 240 pounds, refused the ‘request to move voluntarily. With abusive language, he made clear his intention to resist. Then, Lee picked up a mattress as a shield and broke off a broom han- dle to use as a spear. He was sprayed with Mace, with no result. As the officers approached, Lee tried to Spear one guard and threw scalding water, obtained from a neighboring prisoner, on another. Lee was shot with a stun gun on the leg but charged the guards. A sec- ee shot . a stun gun hit his head, and, as the guards began grapplin with him, Lee managed is hit one officer in the head with the broom Stick and cut another in the arm with a razor blade he had concealed. Several officers hit Lee with their nightsticks and they wrestled him to the floor, where his legs were placed in shackles and his arms handcuffed behind him. The charges against the guards did not stem from that confrontation, which they fully reported to superi- ors, but from a beating shortly after- ward, as officers led Lee into an elevator en route to the hospital floor. Lee was still struggling somewhat, but testimony conflicted as to the ex- tent of his resistance at that point. Upon entering the elevator, one guard hit him in the mouth with his fist, another smashed him in the head with his stun gun, breaking the gun, a third guard hit him with a nightstick, and the fourth guard, when Lee fell to the floor, kicked him several times, according to Personnel Board records. A stun gun is a rifle that shoots plastic pellets with sufficient force to stun someone but is not lethal, . The hearing officer who overturned the firings found the force was justi- fied because Lee was not under full control until much later, after he was treated in the hospital and finally was placed in his new cell, The hearing officer also did not fault the men for failing to Teport all the force they used against Lee, be- Cause the lieutenant in charge told the men “it’s up to you” when they asked whether they should report the elevator incident. Department rules and federal court orders demand that even a modest use of force be reported, including incidents such as shoving a’ prisoner or grabbing his arm. . The guards themselves cited a variety of reasons for Striking Lee at the elevator, when they submitted re- vised reports upon being confronted by superiors with the fact that their a rc were incomplete. _ _» Was in a fit of anger, ai i inmate Lee still stru o i oe officers I ran up and hit inmate Lee in the head,” wrote Officer Durrence, who had been scalded on the neck and back with the hot water. In an earlier statement he said: “I was ina rage of anger and pain, in other words you could classify it as tempo- rary insanity.” Officer Tatro said he kicked Lee when the prisoner was on the eleva- tor floor because, “I was very mad and upset about what had happened in the cellhouse when he tried to kill all of us.” In his statement, Lundell said one Teason he did not report the full inci- dent was fear of losing his job, be- cause the guards “might could have restrained (Lee) without striking him.” Special monitor Nathan said the 30-day suspension is not a meaning- less sanction, but that the inability of the GSP management to fire employ- ees “is without question going to have a negative impact on their ability to control staff behavior.” Prison managers need the same latitude to control staff violence as they have to curb prisoner violence, Nathan said. C “The excessive use of force by offi- cers is one of the most dangerous phenomena that can occur in @ prison,” he said. “It introduces an element of lawlessness in which every action creates a reaction, a chain of events that can eventually culminate in a widespread disturb- ” Cr yaa 4 6, 1982 \f"

        "ocr_text": "4, FeorCS Voter Tumut of By Marcia Kunstel Staff Writer Less than 30 percent of the voting-age population in Georgia went to the polls this month, according to statistics compiled by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Voter turnout figures in Georgia and other Southern states showed increases from the midterm election four years ago, but turn- out across the South was less than in most other states, None of the Southern states studied even reached the 40 percent mark, while few states she said, Michael Binford, an assistant political science professor at Georgia State University, cited the same factors and added a few more. “The person with a low income and low education is less likely to vote,” Binford said, “You have more of that in the South.” Low voter turnout does not simply skew democracy but also tends to leave non-par- ticipating voter groups out in the cold when elected officials are carrying out their duties. “If you look at politicians and political campaigns,” Binford said, “they're not. con- cerned with the people, they're concerned with the voters — the likely voters. When outside the South fell below it For example, $5.2 percent of the eligible, voting-age population voted in Maine, 41 per- cent in California, 53.8 percent in Utah and 43 percent in Ohio, In contrast, Alabama registered one of the best turnouts in the South with $8.2 per: cent, while Mississippi tallied 36 perecnt and South Carolina 29.1 percent, Georgia's turnout was 28.8 percent. Political scientists attribute the disparity partly to historic factors: one-party polities and the disenfranchisement of blacks. “There has been no competition in general elections,” said Margaret Latimer, they pick an issue in a campaign they pick one attractive to the likely voters.” = That means the black, the poor and the uneducated, who vote in relatively small numbers, get less response from the govern: ment that their neighbors elect, he said. He agreed that one-party politics, domi- nated for more than a century by Democrats, discourages voter turnout, While the Republi- cans are making Southern inroads, especially in elections for national office, Binford said the Democratic traditon still holds strong in local elections such as those for state legisla- tures, A heated local race is a good drawing card for voters, he said. essor of political science at Au- burn University in Alabama. “The general population sort of gets turned off.” Ms. Latimer, who has specialized in the study of Southern voting patterns, said blacks around the nation generally do not vote as heavily as whites do, and the larger black population in the South affects the turnout figures, Although she says she does not believe voter registration is a stumbling block for blacks today, Ms, Latimer said blacks still do not vole as much as whites because they sel- - dom see their candidates win, And the tradi- tion of not voting in past years still lingers, November 14, 1982 \f"

Most involved spraying Mace or shooting stun guns at prisoners who were locked inside their cells, but ca’ some trouble. State officials admitted the incidents constituted contempt of court orders limiting the use of physical force against inmates. , The sanctions chosen by Offender Rehabilitation Evans included sus) g the salary of Warden Lanson Newsome for two weeks and firing three sergeants. Nathan concluded that Evans con- ducted a thorough review of the inci- dents in question, identified the staff members properly held responsible, and sanctions “that consti- tute a bona fide and reasonable at- tempt to punish past misconduct and prevent recurrence of these contuma- cious actions.” He gave only endorsement to the disciplinary moves, saying he “cannot conclude that the sanctions chosen by the com- missioner are unreasonable, although harsher sanctions clearly could have been justified in several cases.” Nathan did not identify which cases he meant, but he did describe the involvement of Warden Newsome at some le K He cited five cases in which New- some gave prior authorization to ive uses of force, and 19 occa- sions when the warden approved without question the reports describ- ing force guards used against trouble- some inmates. The commissioner later found the force used in those 19 cases to be “plainly excessive,” Na- than said. Although corrections officials have refused to release the names of the ioner David men disciplined, Nathan listed the following officers in his report: As- sistant Warden Barry Gaither, repri- manded; Unit Manager Charles Lynn, suspended for seven days, repri- manded and removed from the special management unit where the abuses occured; Capt.

        "ocr_text": "Wallace hopes son will keep dynasty alive By Marcia Kunstel Staff Writer MONTGOMERY — Victory in the Alabama gover- nor’s race last month gave George C. Wallace two opportunities seldom granted any man: To purge his political past and to nourish the first growth of a family political dynasty. He has not yet taken office, but he is well on his way to accomplishing ‘both. ‘ The election itself, one of the greatest political ironies of modern times, at least laid a veneer over the blight deposited on the Wallace record in the heyday of his segregationist ferver. He won with black support. Less widely known is the progress made during the campaign toward extending the Wallace political lineage.. His son George Wallace Jr., an apolitical off- spring until this past election, suddenly emerged as an out-front, key adviser ‘and scored an impressive array IN 4963: George, George Jr. and Lurleen of points among the most diverse elements of Ala- bama’s political community. _ The November success also allowed Walla¢e another opportunity, despite the magnitude of problems awaiting the next governor of the state with the na- tion’s highest unemployment rate. It renewed his will to live. SEE Wallace 22A »> ‘FROM 1A Wallace The decision to run was vital to this man who spent all his adult life in politics, then exited center stage four years ago in a wheel- chair, his scope of activity circumscribed by the paralysis left from a 1972 attempt on his life. “I don’t know why I want to be governor,” Wallace said last week in acknowledging the abysmal state of the state he will govern, ‘‘ex- cept I’d die just sitting in a wheelchair.” His appearance during an interview belied recent rumors that his health had been ravaged by rigors of the campaign. He seemed fit, al- most robust, still tanned from a post-election trip to Florida. . That Wallace was bored unto anguish out- side of politics is the prevalent view among those who talked with him in his interminable telephone calling. Those who heard the ram- bling talks about personal needs, political real- ities and the suffering of the people of Ala- bama, said they generally were convinced that Wallace wanted a last chance to tag an upbeat ending to his career story. : The telephone calls never really stopped after he left the governor’s office in 1978, but resumed the old intensity and picked up some unexpected, new targets at the start of this year, when the former three-term governor was calculating his odds at becoming an unprece- dented fourth-term chief executive. He talked to old friends and supporters, some from business and others from labor and many present and past local officeholders. “He didn’t see much usefulness laying there watching TV and reading books and maybe get- ting out Sunday afternoon riding around a little bit,” said Taylor Hardin, a banker and long- time associate who served Wallace as finance director and mental health commissioner. ‘‘He wanted to be back in the scene of activity and he thought he had something to offer.”’ Wallace also made some newer contacts among blacks and former opposition figures, re- sulting in a progressive coalition that looks a lot like old New Deal Democracy. It included one very important link with the leader of the powerful teachers’ lobby, Paul Hubbert. Hubbert, the executive secretary. of the Alabama Education Association who tangled bitterly with Wallace in his past administra- tions, said he finally told Wallace he would sup- port him after long phone talks that convinced him the 63-year-old former governor had changed. “Wallace can bring about the involvement of one-third of our population in a way they never have been before — people who have been politically and socially excluded,” said Hubbert, suggesting Wallace is poised to reach out to blacks much the way former President Richard Nixon was positioned to make over- tures to China. “This was his chance to be remembered not as the man who tossed the gauntlet or stood in the schoolhouse door. I was convinced he was serious about it.” Hubbert and others of the new coalition saw a rare chance to grab a spot in the power limelight early by supporting a Wallace still uncertain of his ability to win; he would owe them a voice in his administration. They remain wary, however. They say they finally will believe he has changed only when they see it through appointments, policies and legislation. : One other person Wallace talked to at length about his political future — and whether there even would be one — was his 31-year-old son, George Wallace Jr. “TI wanted him to do what he wanted to do. I told him that repeatedly over dinner and in our discussions,” the younger Wallace said in an interview last week. Maintaining he did not pressure his fathe to run, Wallace Jr. admitted he did. conve sentiments he said the students, especially the black students, pressed upon him as director o financial aid for Troy State University at Mont gomery. When travelling around the state, he said, he also sensed swelling support fo another Wallace administration. “I was overwhelmed at the number © black students who would urge me, adamantly to tell him to run,” he said. “I think he’s come as close as any man to being drafted to run for governor of Alabama.” The third of four children Wallace had wit! his first wife Lurleen, who died of cancer while she served as his surrogate in the governor’s chair back when a governor could not succeed himself, George Wallace Jr. never before had showed an interest in politics. In fact, he seemed actively to dissociate himself from his father’s world, seldom appear- ing at public events and never joining the cam- paigns, either for governor or for president. The few public glimpses of him were at- tached to his teenaged stint with a rock-and-roll band that quickly rocked out of sight. He made the news once as a college student, when he and a black coed knocked on the doors of Montgom- ery homes posing as a biracial couple seeking a place to live. It was a sociology class project. After Wallace left office, father and son for 3% years shared a ranch-style house in a subdi- vision skirting downtown. Young Wallace moved to an apartment complex when his fa- ther’s new, third wife moved in this year. Perhaps his new political bent’ was prompted by the closer association with his fa- ther, who was described by many as more mel- low, thoughtful and openly devout than in earlier years, SEE Wallace 23A > December 5, 1982 \faN SN A PI IT BT I EI SI Wallace He said he adopted the role because his father needed him more this time, then added he probably turned to politics “because it's in my blood.” For whatever reason, George Wallace Jr. did get involved, He was described as an effective cam- paigner, savvy and cool and capable of deliv- ering a mean stump speech. A slender young man with sandy-brown hair and moustache, he raps out the Wallace line like a pro, insisting, for example, that Gov, Wallace's strident segregationist posi- tions ‘were not synonymous to ill will or bad feeling to any people.” He has adopted, or perhaps simply inher- ited, the habits that attract popular support to a politician, listening carefully and locking eyes with whomever he speaks, freely touch- ing even strangers who come to call, He is credited in large measure with bringing a younger look to the campaign, call- ing on relative political neophytes in business and professional jobs to lend their hands, As a confidant to his father, he cracked a breach in the stratosphere of Alabama poli- tics, forcing an opening for men and women of his generation in political councils that had been fully occupied by the old Wallace crowd for 20 years, “One reason I've advocated having some young people who are aggressive and articu- late and innovative is because the problems (of the state) are so acute,” said Wallace Jr,, who talks quietly about Alabamians laboring under the worst economic duress in decades, “We need some innovative thought.” The new image has carried some friction, although neither the old-timers heading the FROM 22A Special to Journal-Con CONFERRING ON A NEW TERM: George Wallace and his son today. transition nor the “young Turks,” as they are called, would detail the hostilities, preferring to characterize the trouble as transitory and no longer extant, When young Wallace discussed it, he put aside the gentle manner he normally uses, bristling to show he is no pushover. “Anybody who's got a problem with the young people concept had better talk to me or my father,” he announced. “We're for it 100 percent,” The new, younger faggs — such as in- vestment counselor Thomag Harris, 34, touted as a potential director of tye Alabama Devel- opment Office ~ may have helped combat opposition charges that the Wallace camp was peopled with the same “old cronies” who made their living off ¢he influence they wielded with Gov, Wallage At the same time, they are forming the political network of the fyture. As young Wal- Jace joked when introqycing a friend who came to meet him for lunch: “Meet one of the second generation cronies.” Political figures who are not at the cen- ter of organizing the new administration, and thus are not suffering bruised egos in the struggle for power, said Wallace Jr. will be a force to reckon with in the future. They speculate he will try to become the third Wal- lace to occupy the governor's office, following his father and his mother. “We'll probably have eight years of George Corley Wallace and then George Jr. Will be ready to run,” said Bob Ingram, editor of the business-oriented Alabama Magazine and a respected political analyst. “If I could buy some stock in him I would.” All this newness in the Wallace entourage — youth, blacks, teachers and a strong labor presence — has given the governor-elect a chance to put an addendum on the Wallace chapter, if not to rewrite the book in toto, “He has a tremendous opportunity. He's sitting with a real mandate now,” said former Gov. John Patterson, the man who beat Wal- lace when he first ran for governor in 1958 by being an out-front segregationist. That was the election when Wallace is said to have pledged he would never be “out-niggered” again. “He's in a position now to do things that he couldn't do before, politically. He can in- clude minorities. The people expect it. There hasn't been a governor in a position like that in a long time,” said Patterson, who seems to have altered his own stand a bit, “He's a populist, and from an economic point of view he's a very attractive candidate to the black community. I don’t have any doubt that blacks will play a role in his administration. And they ought to.” The Wallace coalition has some observ- ers nervous, however. Analyst Ingram, as well as many others with strong connections to the financial community, said business Is scared. iv “The business community in Alabama is terrified of what's going to happen in the next four years,” Ingram said. “They don't think Alabama will have the climate to attract industry, especially not with this Legislature. The teachers, labor leaders and the trial lawyers association first merged their talents early this year in defeating legislation that would have prohibited co-worker damage suits, a development seen as anti-business. They were part of the coalition that backed Wallace in the general election against business-oriented, ultra-conservative Emory. Folmar, the Montgomery mayor, and they also made strong gains in the Alabama Legis lature. “Tt has created the impression that Ala- bama is anti-business,” said Ingram, whose comments Were repeated often among strong business interests, _ Wallace himself is quick to disavow any glimmer of anti-business sentiment, recalling the stiffest peg his campaign was hung updo, a promise to attract new business and indus- try to his economically ailing state. _, I've heard them talk that way,” Wallace Said in a brief interview last week. “But n0, there's nothing going to happen in my admin- istration, if 1 can help it, that’s adverse to business,” Wallace Jr. likewise discounted future troubles with business, promising that state’s development office would be a prime bas for an infusion of new blood, a place or his new generation to pool talents in a0 attack on Alabama's ecm woes, It also is — and has been for his father’s friends ~ a good place to make the politica contacts with individual business Jeaders tha pave the way for future good relationships come campaign days.

        "ocr_text": "Reidsville condi dramatically better, court monitor finds By Marcia Kunstel Staff Writer Conditions at Reidsville’s Georgia State Prison have improved dramatically, but progress still is marred by serious staff abuse of prisoners, according to a new assessment filed in federal court. Some of the worst conditions cited in the past by court monitor Vincent Nathan have been corrected or are in the process of being reversed, the monitor said in a three-volume report recently filed in U.S, District Court in Savannah. These include general sanitation, food and medical care. However, Nathan seldom found full. compliance in any area with U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimo’s broad sweep of orders for prison reform. It is in the same report that Nathan found that a majority of court orders on security measures had not been implemented. Nathan also claimed the state failed to acknowledge numerous areas of non- compliance in a self-audit officials were required to complete and said the state's contentions that it has fulfilled some orders were not properly substantiated. He was especially critical of staff misconduct, which. he called “perhaps the most volatile and sensitive issue” in the 1 anding class action lawsuit challeng- ing conditions at Reidsville. Use of force against prisoners has in- creased in the reporting period from Sep- tember 1981 through last August, he said, as has the rate of injuries sustained by in- mates subjected to force. During the period, 20 percent of them were injured, compared to 8 percent in the previous re- porting period. The monitor, appointed by Judge Alaimo to oversee compliance efforts, said state officials “still erect an almost insur- mountable presumption of innocence” when staff are accused of misconduct, often finding charges “unsubstantiated” simply because the staff member denied the allegations. Until the prison administration dis- lays a commitment to ending staff abuse, e said, “The longstanding phenomenon of physical and verbal abuse of inmates at Georgia State Prison will not end.” His detailed analysis, an audit of com- pliance with hundreds of specific orders, does not include all of the section on se- curity. Much of that has been filed under See REIDSVILLE, Page 3-E Reidsville— Continued From Page 1-E seal and is not public witli. One unusual notation in the audit concerns the section documenting sanitation conditions, It involves the order requiring the state to conduct a self-audit of compliance, which Nathan has submitted for comparison with his audit, Nathan said state officials did not give him an audit of sanitation, on the grounds that the state was in full compliance with court-ordered standards, However, Na- than said he did obtain a copy of a self-audit completed by the state, showing more than 100 findings of non-compli- ance, It prompted him to question what he called the state’s “lack of candor” in relating the results of its self- audit. Here is a synopsis of some of Nathan's findings: ¢ His investigation “reflects remarkable improve- ment in the overall state of sanitation” at the prison, al- though a number of long-term plans and procedures man- dated by the court and aimed at maintaining good conditions have not a undertaken, © There is no overcrowding, * Very recent changes in medical service administra- tors have brought substantive improvements in the last few months, including better security and cleanliness, The actual delivery of medical care still needs upgrading, - © Race discrimination has decreased, although Na: than said he detected probable bias in the way discipline is meted, with blacks getting harsher punishment, He also noted an ongoing state investigation into allegations that some guards attempted to foment racial strife, saying “substantial evidence” has been uncovered supporting the allegations. / © Disciplinary procedures are in compliance in large measure, although the monitor questioned some basic ele- ments of the system, including the apparent failure to find and interview witnesses to disciplinary infractions, He said insufficient evidence still is used in finding inmates guilty of alleged violations, The prison administration does adhere to the mandated conditions in disciplinary isolation, * Food service is in basic compliance with orders re- garding sanitation, food storage, preparation and clean-up procedures and outside inspections, This was one of the most criticized: areas in the past, with food preparation and storage areas described as filthy, vermin-infested and dangerous, December 17, 1982 \f"

But the battle with President Reagan has not been laid to rest, and his new board still could re- strict operations in other ways. The President has not changed his view that the program should be abolished. At least it is as- sured of a budget for 1983, unlike this year, when Con- gress bucked the adminis- tration by funding legal services a few months at a time. However, there appar- ently is no of girectors for the Legal Services Corp., the body that channels federal funds accruing high consulting fees and reim- while pursuing the presi- dent’s philosophy of paring services the program can offer to the poor. One board member is Georgian Bob Stubbs, a deputy attorney who has criticized some parts of the legal aid grams he was to oversee. Stubbs had the second-highest consulting fees on the $23,892 for his 11 months as a board member, ac- cording to congressional records. A _ congressional sight committee has casti- gated the board for its high charges and earlier this month asked the General Accounting Office to inves- tigate. Amid the upheaval, legal services lawyers are won- dering what to expect from the future and are warning that they would be hard pressed to absorb further money or program reduc- tions. In the Dublin office alone, for example, the average of 30 new cases a month last year has Jumped to 85 cases late this year. December 27, 1982 \f"
