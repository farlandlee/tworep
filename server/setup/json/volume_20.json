From the rise of Zionism to the 1948 war for Israel’s independence to the ongoing Pales- tinian uprisings, their ordeal and the history that crashed around them are brought to life by two eminent journalists, Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright. After the Semitic hill people called the Ca- naanites first settled the Sorek Valley in 2200 B.C., wave after wave of conquerors and nomads swept in and out of this place. ‘They left behind a genetic and cultural legacy, a people called the Palestinians populating this stony but cherished land. They were joined one hundred years ago by Bulgarian Jews, who came to hack their Biblical homestead out of Samson’ valley. Once lushly covered with forests, these Ju- dean hills were no longer the ancestral para- dise the Jewish settlers had envisioned. Still, through droughts, plagues of locusts, and Bedouin raids, the Arab and Jewish farmers (continued on back flap) Crown Publishers (Random House) - October 28, 1990 mostly lived peaceably, side by side, while the storm clouds of conflict gathered around them. The turning point was the 1948 war that established the state of Israel and shattered coexistence in the valley. The Israelis went on to build their country, while the Palestinians festered in refugee camps, longing for a na- tion of their own. A succession of wars and f- nally the protracted, unsettling Palestinian uprisings have led the families on both sides to think new thoughts about peace and land and promises. Marcia Kunster and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT have both won the Overseas Press Club award for foreign reporting. Ms. Kunstel has reported from Afghanistan, Lebanon, South Africa, and elsewhere for Newsday, the Miami Herald, the Dallas Morning News, and other newspapers.

        "ocr_text": "By WANDA R. YANCEY Associate Editor When Iraq invaded Kuwait this summer, Cox was one of the first media organizations in the Mideast. Washington bureau staffer Joe Al- bright was one of the first American reporters to arrive in Saudia Arabia and the Persian Gulf, where Ameri- can servicemen were being sent. On Aug. 23, Albright’s wife and Washington bureau staffer, Marcia Kunstel, arrived in Jordan. “T guess I was most struck by the soldiers that we have over there,” Al- bright recalled recently after return- ing to the United States. “Thad a different perception of what soldiers were like. I was in the Army but these soldiers were different. They are more proficient than I ever imagined. The whole situation was pretty amazing,’ he says. “We were cover- ae. Joe Albright, left, has been covering the Persian Gulf crisis for all Cox newspapers. Here, he is interviewing Gen. H. Norman Schwartzkopf, U.S. military commander in Saudi Arabia. Albright and Kunstel back for a break ing an evolving event. I guess the real challenge was keeping up with everything that was happening.” For Kunstel, who for the past tw« years has been writing a book with Albright on the conflict in the Mi- deast, said the challenge was con- veying to Americans that every one does not disagree with Iraq’s inva- sion of Kuwait. “Tt was important that we let Americans know that they have a different view of how the world spins,” says Kunstel. “It was impor- tant to tell people that the Jordani- ans feel that the Americans reacted too swiftly, and that if given a little time this crisis could have been re- solved.” Kunstel, one of the first America reporters allowed into Kuwait, said traveling from there to Iraq was a problem. “So much of being a reporter de- pends on luck and timing,” she says explaining that the Iraqi govern- ment issued few visas for American reporters to enter into Iraq. “Finally, one night about | a.m. I gota call from Andy Alexander in the Wash- ington Bureau. He told me my visa had been approved and for me to be at the [raqi Embassy in Jordan early the next morning.” COX ONE OF FIRST MEDIA IN MIDEAST Kunstel says although Iraq had approved visas for other reporters, “T was the first reporter at the Em- bassy and was able to get a ticket on the first plane into Baghdad, Iraq.” Asa result, she was one of three re- porters to accompany civil rights leader Jesse Jackson into Kuwait, where he negotiated to bring home nearly 30 Americans held hostage by the Iraqi government. “The greatest thing about being over there was that this was a world class story and we were reporting it,” Kunstel says. “This was the most important action in the world and we were there.” Albright and Kunstel, who just completed a tour for their recently published book, “Their Promised Land: Arab and Jew In History’s Cauldron-One Valley in the Jerusa- lem Hills,” a history of the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, will depart for the Mideast before year’s end. “T don’t know where we will be,” says Albright. “But we will be there.” Although Albright and Kunstel will be returning to the Mideast, they will be able to keep abreast of what’s going on at home. The At- lanta Journal and The Atlanta Con- stitution, The Yuma Daily Sun and The Austin American-Statesman are sending papers to American service- men stationed in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.

The impression left is that 1948 is just an episode in history with few lingering conse- quences and that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 is the only Israeli-Palestinian problem to be resolved. It is not often recognized that 1948 and 1967 are pieces of the same history and that Palestin- ians still live with the consequences of both. “Their Promised Land,” a brief encapsu- lation of the millennia-long history of the Sorek Valley just west of Jerusalem, corrects the imbalance. Journalists Marcia Kunstel and Jo- seph Albright carefully do not choose sides; they look at the issue unemotionally from both perspectives, treating the continuous Palestin- ian and the interrupted Jewish history in~ Palestine up to the present. But simply by demonstrating that there is indeed a long Palestinian history, traceable to the Canaanites of 3000 B.C., the authors give the Palestinian claim a kind of credibility that few histories do. _The Sorek Valley, extending west from Jerusalem in a series of rocky hillsides, was where Delilah betrayed Samson. During the first half, of this céntury it was home to five &rab settlements and a relatively new Jewish colony, established in 1895 by a group of Bulgarian Sephardim. Jews and Arabs coexist- ed uneasily for half a century, usually ignoring each other, occasionally fighting, often cooper- ating in the effort to eke out an existence. When Palestine was partitioned in 1947, the valley found itself inside the borders of the proposed Arab state, but Zionist military plan- ners saw it as a vital part of the corridor between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Kunstel and Albright demonstrate, through Israeli archival material and interviews with both the dispos- sessed and the dispossessors, that all five of the Sorek Valley’s Palestinian towns, as well as numerous others, were deliberately depopu- lated and destroyed in the effort to open the corridor. Throughout Palestine, they note, Israel “midwifed into being the Zionist dream. of a land without people.” The valley’s one Jewish settlement, Hartuv, had been evacuated early in the fighting in 1948 when it appeared in danger of capture by Arab forces, but following the war the town was rebuilt by Jewish immigrants. Most of the original Hartuv settlers returned only for a brief time, eventually resettling elsewhere. New Israeli towns and industries sprang up on the hillsides where Palestinian towns had stood. The destruction was so complete that most of the Jewish transplants had little aware- ness that this had been a Palestinian place. One kibbutznik tells the authors that when she arrived only months after the Palestinians had fled “there was not a sign anyone had lived here before.” By tracing the fate of anvenst Jewish and Palestinian families, the authors put a human face on history and give a sense of the stake both peoples have in this land. The Palestin- ians interviewed in this book, most now living m West Bank refugee camps, are willing to accept a small Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza alongside Israel, but the pain they have endured in arriving at this point is’ evident. There is in the authors’ interviews with Israeli families: no awareness of this continuity. Many of those interviewed criticize Israel’s occupation and believe the only feasi- ble solution is a separate Palestinian state, but they give no indication that they have any feel for what the creation of Israel meant for Palestinians, Many will not like this book. Uncompromis- ing readers on either side will resent its neutrality. But the book is honest in its choice of historical source material and its treatment of the facts of Jewish-Arab conflict in the Sorek Valley and throughout Palestine. Its smooth, often elegant prose and the clever interweav- ing of historical background with the human story make it pleasurable reading indeed. The reviewer is a former Middle East political analyst with the Central Intelligence Agency. ~ Washington Post - December 10, 1990 \f"

Edward Oliver has been trying to spread some Christmas spirit among the troops in this Muslim heartland, but he’s afraid it isn’t working. “There ain’t no spirit,” Pri- vate Oliver, 21, of Fort Mitchell, Ala., said Sunday. ‘‘We been sit- ting outside at night saying ‘Mer- ry Christmas’ and stuff like that, but a lot of guys answer, “There ain’t nothing to be merry about.’ The desert gets to everybody. I couldn’t make it without my friends.” For the last three months, the artilleryman has been staring at the same hill in the northern Sau- di desert. Then, a few days ago, his unit from Fort Bragg, N.C., was pulled back to a base in the rear for a few days of R and R. On Sunday morning, they finished their time off with a trip to the sand-colored warehouse that serves as the largest American PX in Saudi Arabia. Private Oliver and hundreds of other off-duty soldiers and Na- tional Guard reservists lined up -to buy last-minute Christmas presents for their foxhole bud- dies, their families or themselves. Little taste of Christmas The PX, tucked away on the edge of a Saudi air base, is one of the thousands of tiny oases where American soldiers are be+ ing allowed to partake in the trappings of Christmas. The sol- diers could walk down the super- market aisles and find Christmas cards that say “I like Christmas — it makes me feel all warm and happy inside” or “Joy to the World, the Lord Is Come. Let Earth Receive her King.” But for many of them, the symbols didn’t hack it. With com- bat looming, soldiers said it was hard to think jolly. “Some of us might not make it,” said Sgt. Hector Rodriguez, 25, of San Juan, Puerto Rico. “We don’t like to think about it.” His fellow artilleryman Pfc. Larry Kane, 20, of Houston said, “Nobody in my unit thinks it is Christmas. The other day when we got off the buses for R and R, we heard some guys in the com- pound singing carols. We couldn’t believe it.” The military-supervised PX had shelves full of warm clothes, cassette tapes and potato chips. But it had relatively few choices for gift shoppers: stuffed animals, Desert Shield T-shirts, a chance to send flowers back home by Florifax. A shipment of 1,000 Walkmans was snapped up in two days last week, and no more are expected before Christmas. Headdresses going fast To fill the Christmas gift de- mand, a Saudi company named Hassan Company Business was selling an assortment of knick- knacks in a Bedouin tent in the PX parking lot. The chief sales- man said about 200 American soldiers a day have been spend- , ing $14 to buy a Saudi men’s checkered headdress, making this the tent store’s biggest grosser. There was less demand, he said, for the store’s only real Sau- di rarity: a large turquoise ce- ramic Christmas ornament with the words “Merry Christmas” in raised letters. That cross-cultur- z curio was going begging at 14. Since the beginning of Opera- _ tion Desert Shield, the American Cpl. John Elicessor of San Francisco helps unload mail in Saudi Arabia on Saturday for the 1st Battalion, military has been planning a pro- gram of Christmas Day morale boosters to help propel the troops past the psychological cruncher of Christmas in Arabia. In hundreds of campsites south of the Kuwait border, U.S. soldiers and Marines will spend Christmas eating elaborate din- ners featuring shrimp, ham, roast beef, sweet potatoes and five kinds of pie; playing flag football; and — if they choose — worshiping with chaplains at de- sert Christmas services. Videotapes from home Some units, including Private Kane’s, have set up video view- ing tents to allow soldiers to en- joy in privacy the videocassettes sent over by their lovers, mates and moms. Other units are being bused into Saudi towns so they can place holiday phone calls. Despite their insistence on eae Saudi Arabia a Pager 3rd Marine Regiment. Tons of holiday packages have failed to instill the Christmas spirit in many troops. apparently chosen to tolerate Christian worship services by the troops — so long as the ser- vices are not broadcast to the world on television. Sergeant Rodriguez, Private Kane and Private Oliver belong to an elite Army airborne unit that can expect to be in the clutches of combat in the first days of any ground war. They are with the 1st Battalion of the 39th Field Artillery Infantry, and are trained to jump out of C-130s along with their hulking 155mm howitzers. Their attitudes about Christ- mas didn’t seem to differ much from their fellow PX shoppers from the Wisconsin National Guard, who will support the Army and Marine regulars from several hundred miles behind the front lines. “If I had my choice, I’d sleep all the way through Christmas,” said Spec. Doris Coyle, 29, of Ho- men, Wis. ‘‘I was hoping to spend the day on guard duty.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - December 24, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Deadline casts shadow over gulf Christmas Eve Joseph Albright Cox News Service NORTH STAR, Saudi Arabia — Marine mess hall supervisor Guy Beldo had two things to worry about on Christmas Eve. One was laying on a moving feast for nearly 20,000 Marines spread over thousands of acres of desert. The midday Christmas meal prom- ises to be a monumental caloric ex- plosion, heaping Marines’ mess kits with roast beef, turkey, and mincemeat pie. The other challenge, which pre- occupied Master Sgt. Beldo more, was how to serve ordinary hot meals on a hot battlefield inside Kuwait starting as early as next Beldo, 39, of Olympia, Wash., “but January 15 is the day we are wait- ing for.” — At the maintenance sheds a few hundred yards away, Lance Corpo- ral Robert Taylor Prescott, 20, of Ringgold, Ga., was working late Monday night sorting a flood of in- coming tank parts. His job is unpacking cardboard boxes of spare parts and making sure that each one gets checked off the computer printout and placed in the bin for the Marine combat unit that needs it. “To tell you the truth, Christmas Eve has been just another day,” said Prescott. “This all has to be done. You can’t leave it.” The Marines gave him his Christ- “Christmas is important,” said Master Sgt. Guy Beldo, 39, of Olympia, Wash., “‘but January 15 is the day we are waiting for.” month. “We are going to build two more forward mess sites, one halfway to the border and one right close to the border,” Beldo said. “From — there we will leapfrog forward into Kuwait. We should be able to go in with hot meals no later than three or four days after the first wave of Marines.” With war an ever more tangible prospect, Dec. 24 didn’t seem quite so stirring to many Marines as it mas present on Dec. 23 when his sergeants arranged for him to ride a bus to a rear base camp so he could telephone his wife, Buffie, 20, in Ringgold. To make up for that time, Prescott planned to work until nearly midnight Christmas Eve. “She’s doing pretty good, she’s hanging in there,” Prescott said. “She’s strong. And now I will try to have the best Christmas I can with my friends.” A Marine mechanic, Cpl. James Cuvar, 23, of Glen Carbon, IIl., said, “It doesn’t really seem like Christ- mas. It’s just like another day stuck in the middle of the desert.” The hardest part about Christ- mas, he said, is knowing that his had in years past. What was really transfixing them was Jan. 15, the date when the United Nations has authorized its member mations to use force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. Beldo felt this, and so did a lot of the other 1,800 Marines who repair trucks, supply water and distribute food at this forward-most Marine logistics hub nicknamed North Star. “Christmas is important,” said girlfrierfd is having trouble deal- ing with his unexpectedly long ab- sence. “It is really hard to keep a relationship going,” he said. In a corner of the mess kitchen, Lance Cpl. John Hubicki, 20, of Al- bany, N.Y., was seen hanging up a Christmas stocking “The sergeant said I should make this corner look C! because some photographers were coming and we want to send the pictures back home,” Hubicki ex- plained. In the medical section, two sing- ing medical corpsmen who call themselves “The Fried Brains” led a sundown sing along for the bene- fit of the visiting U.S. Ealesision crews.

        "ocr_text": "Hope chides White House after women are barred from stage for Saudi shows By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — A disappointed Bob Hope brought a nearly all-male come- dy act to the troops Christmas Day, saying he regretted having to leave behind his traditional cast of female sidekicks. “It’s hard for me because I depend on the girls,’”” Mr. Hope told reporters. “I’ve used them all my life, and now all I’ve got are these ... guys.” » In a press conference mono- logue, Mr. Hope used a light- hearted tone to chide the Bush administration for having misled him about the extent of the cul- tural restrictions that would be placed on his tour in the Saudi desert. “It’s a religious thing,’’ ex- plained the 87-year-old comedi- an, “and what bothers me is that they don’t want any entertain- ment, and they still invited me. I want to tell you, that hurt the hell out of me. “They (unnamed Americans] lied to me and said we could have all the girls in the world. When I went to the plane, they said there’d be no girls. And there I was, packed and everything. What could I do?” Mr. Hope said a U.S. Air Force press officer, ist Lt. John Kinneard, flew along with him to Saudi Arabia and reviewed the jokes he had prepared for the troops. Mr. Hope said he went over “all the material” with Lieu- tenant Kinneard and “just elimi- nated a lot of things.” Making the best of it, he took off like a trooper for a grueling itinerary to Army and Marine encampments across northern Saudi Arabia. At each stop he shook hands, signed autographs and tossed out one-liners on top- ics ranging from Baghdad Betty to Dan Quayle. In his previous USO shows for the troops during the Christ- mas holidays, he has shared the stage with such stars as Jayne Mansfield (1957), Gina Lollobri- gida (1958), Zsa Zsa Gabor (1960), Raquel Welch (1967), Ur- sula Andress (1970) and Brooke Shields (1983). Comedian Bob Hope (right) and former Cincinnati Reds baseball star Johnny Bench did Christmas Day shows at Marine and Army bases in Sau- di Arabia. Mr. Hope wasn’t allowed to take any female performers. This time Mr. Hope made do with his wife, Dolores, who sang “White Christmas,” as well as former Cincinnati Reds catcher - Johnny Bench and South Caroli- na-born country singer Aaron Tippon. The women Mr. Hope wanted for his 1990 Christmas act — the Pointer Sisters, Ann Jillian, Ma- rie Osmond and Khrystyne Haje — plan to join him on stage when he puts on a floating show for the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf sometime this week. , A Pentagon spokesman later said reporters are not allowed to cover Mr. Hope’s encounters with troops, partly because “‘it is felt that media coverage of his shows and visits, however well- intentioned, have a very great likelihood of being exploited by the Iraqis for propaganda purposes.” Another reason.is that press coverage of the Hope tour could jeopardize security, the state- ment said. For the past three months, U.S. and Saudi officials have been loath to allow any television footage showing American troops being entertained on Sau- di soil by females. ' This resulted in part from the considerable propaganda mile- age the Iraqis have gained in the Arab world by rebroadcasting a September CBS News report de- picting a comedy skit performed by several expatriate women for a few troops at the U.S. Consulate in Dhahran. Though the broadcast showed only the womens’ ankles, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s propagandists have used it to hammer home the theme among the Arab masses that the. Saudi royal family is no longer the le- gitimate custodian of the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Many strict Muslims in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere believe it | is the duty of men to keep women veiled and segregated to protect the moral purity of males and the chastity of females. The tradition goes back to one of the teachings of Mohammed in the 7th century that “it is better for a woman to offer her prayers in her closet than in the main room of the house.” Even today, many Muslims believe men gain more benefit by praying in mosques, while women’s prayer is of greater worth when per- formed in seclusion.

        "ocr_text": "Saddam still building Kuwait defences, JOSEPH ALBRIGHT COX NEWS SERVICE RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — The U.S. command yesterday portra‘ec Iraq’s military as a defensive pow: erhouse with a “formidable” pro tective barricade in Kuwait and a solid edge in ground troops and tanks over the U.S. and its allied | forces. “We see absolutely no indication that Saddam Hussein intends tc withdraw from Kuwait,” said Lt.- Col. Tom Coury, an air force intel: | ligence officer. “Rather, he contin. ues to pour both men and matériel into the country and along his flank to the west. Construction of defence continues unabated.” He said that Saddam’s willing. ness to funnel so much of his scarce resources into constructing a forti- fied static defence line within the country Iraqi forces have occupied for nearly five months is “an excel- lent indicator” of his intention to remain in Kuwait for a long time. He described a layered fortification just north of the Saudi border con- sisting of minefields, concrete bun- kers and trenches, and rolled barbed-wire barricades. Coury also said that the Iraqi air force has increased its flight sched- ules in recent weeks, with a notice- able increase in training flights for fighter planes. That would appear to indicate that the shipping embar- go has so far failed to cause a critical shortage in Iraq’s spare parts for planes, Coury pointed out two major hazards facing the United States as it approaches the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for the withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait. First, if Saddam Hussein feels war is inevitable, he could provoke a conflict with Israel in hopes of “decoupling” the unwritten alli- ance between the United States and its Arab partners. nd, if the United States does attack, it is “likely” that Iraqi de- fenders would use chemical weap- ons to stop them. His remarks tended to buttress the spate of recent reports that U.S. forces here will not be readv to eo on the offensive on Jan. 15, However, the motivation behind the appearance of these reports re- mained murky. One possibility is that U.S. com- manders are trying to keep Saddam Hussein off balance in hopes of achieving the maximum surprise in case President George Bush does give them an order to attack. An- other possibility is that the top U.S. generals really are more cautious about going to war than is Washing- ton. Coury said the Iraqis have more than 500,000 troops in and around Kuwait, equipped with 4,000 tanks, 2,500 armored personnel carriers, 2,700 artillery pieces, and 700 com- bat planes, To back up their massive de- fences in the Kuwait harbor. the Iraqis have deployed a number of missile sites that can fire Silkwood missiles at ships up to 50 nautical miles away, he said. Another briefer, Lt.-Col, Greg Pepin, said the United States now has 300,000 troops in the Persian Gulf area, including 230,000 from all services on the ground in Saudi Arabia. He said the United States has 1,000 heavy tanks, ; } ; I U.S. officers say At The Gazette (Montreal, Canada) - December 27, 1990 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Journalists sweat through test to determine stamina for battle PREPARING FOR WAR: Correspondents have mixed feelings about the tests, which could be used by the military to decide who covers the battlefield. By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — The first batch of American war correspondents-in-waiting huffed through their military physical training test Sunday af- ternoon while an Army colonel kept time on his stopwatch. On Tuesday the U.S. military will begin training a squad of correspondents, TV camera op- erators and news photographers from the major media organiza- tions. They are the ones who would cover the battlefield if war breaks out, as the eyes and ears of the rest of the world’s jour- nalists. It is part of the sometimes chummy, sometimes edgy rela- tionship that has developed be- tween the journalists and the military in this strange twilight period where the world is neither at peace nor at war. The journalists and their mil- itary minders have lived in the same hotel and shared the break- fast table for as long as four months. With no families around and no beer to drink, the Dhah- ran “hacks” and the military people have gotten to know one another much better than do most journalists and the sources they cover. Yet while some of them have become friends, they can’t help but remember that in the Viet- nam War, the media and the mili- tary generally ended up detest- ing each other. ‘ And so, with the United Na- tions deadline nearing, the press corps and the military know they live together like two scorpions in a bottle — each with the ability to harm the other if they sting. The American journalists in Dhahran have met and drawn up their own lists of who they feel Minimum physical standards U.S. ARMY Male/female sit-up (In two minutes) 27-31 42/40 32-36 38/35 37-41 33/30 42-46 + 29/27 Male/female push-up (in two minutes) 27-31 38/15 32-36 33/14 37-41 32/13 42-46 + 26/12 U.S. NAVY Male/female sit-up (In two minutes) 20-29 40/32 Age Number 30-39 32/27 40-49 29/24 50+ 27/22 Male/female push-up (in two minutes) 20-29 29/11 Age Number should get the ““combat pool” as- signments. But in the end, the military will have considerable discretion in choosing how to de- ploy the journalists on the lists submitted by the press corps. The combat pool training will include classes on how to don chemical protective suits and what to do in an air raid. Later in the week, the first journalists in the combat pools will be issued flak jackets, hel- mets and chemical protective gear. When they finish their pool assignments, they will turn in the equipment without having to pay the government. In addition, some news or- ganizations have purchased gas gear for their own journalists so they will have some protection when they are not on the pools. It was Army Col. Bill Mulvey, head of the U.S. Joint Informa- tion Bureau in Saudi Arabia, who got the idea of using physical training tests to make sure all the journalists had a _ reasonable chance of standing up to the physical rigors of keeping up ping fast-moving troops under re. Colonel Mulvey was on hand to encourage the first half-dozen male journalists, who ranged from mid-20s to early 50s, as 30-39 23/5 40-49 20/5 50+ 19/5 they labored through push-ups, sit-ups and a 1.5-mile run. Sepa- rate tests for female journalists begin today, in keeping with a Saudi requirement that males and females cannot use the hotel courtyard for exercise at the same time. Some journalists have mixed feelings about submitting to mili- tary tests. Was the military in- fringing on the First Amendment by imposing qualification tests for journalists? Or was this just a sensible precaution that en- hanced everyone’s chances of staying alive? At a meeting of some 25 pro- spective combat pool members several days ago, one pudgy wire service journalist asked his fel- low journalists to join him in pe- titioning the Joint Information Bureau to drop the physical tests. He was talked out of sub- mitting a protest when a corre- spondent from a rival wire ser- vice said he didn’t want to be ona pool with someone who couldn’t run a mile and a half. While the correspondents are joining physical training classes and taking the tests, at least a few of their editors are reportedly upset about the precedent of al- lowing the military to choose who covers a story.

Later, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein took an equally uncompro- mising stand in a New Year's mes- sage blasting President Bush and Saudi King Fahd as betrayers of their religions. Hussein’s 15-minute televised address did not mention the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, nor did it indicate any willingness to meet the U.N. deadline of Jan. 15 for withdrawing Iraqi troops. In talks with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar, who traveled to Baghdad representing the Non-aligned Movement, Hus- sein again said the only solution lies in his Aug. 12 proposal to address all the outsta conflicts of the region, including the Israeli occu- pation of Arab territories. That has been rejected by the United States and the other nations aligned against Iraq since its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq has called a Jan. 9 of 350 Islamic leaders in to talk about the crisis. They are expected to draft a Moslem re- sponse to any military action taken against Iraq.

        "ocr_text": "Iraqis welcome 1991 with cheery faces, uneasy hearts BAGHDAD — On New Year’s Eve, Iraq’s capital did not act like a city on the brink of war. Green, red and yellow lights dangling from lamp poles fes- tooned the roads, and hotels were dressed in blinking “Happy New Year 1991” signs. Firecrackers rocketed into the sky at midnight. Downtown streets were so filled with revelers that the main thoroughfare, Saadoun Street, sometimes was closed to honking cars by extra police deployed to keep order. “We're celebrating like all the world,” said a young mother walking her three small children toward the multiple parties just beginning at the Sheraton Hotel around 9 p.m. “We came to see the people and talk and go to the cabaret,” she said, chatting with a reporter while she waited for her husband to hunt down one of the rarest items in central Baghdad on New Year’s Eve, a parking space. Trade sanctions eating into the Iraqi economy did not deter the sequined crowds willing to spend 173 Iraqi dinars per per- son — more than $500 at the offi- cial exchange rate, but closer to $40 in black market currency — for a ticket to the party. And those who couldn’t afford it sim- ply drove the streets, milled on the sidewalks outside or made their parties at home. Even in the midst of celebra- tion, however, not everyone could shake off the weighty reali- ties that closed 1990 and will still be with them in 1991. The government had an- nounced earlier in the day that 17-year-olds will have to register for the draft. More and more re- servists already have been called up for service, since Iraq’s inva- sion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 drew in- ternational wrath and a multina- Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 1, 1991 pene Sent ee are oe Many of the young men saun- tering down Baghdad streets Monday night surely will be af- fected. And the economic embargo made its pinch felt. An owner of a kebob shack just off Saadoun Street was expecting business to boom till midnight, at least. But he had to haul his meat to the freezer, douse the grill’s fire and close the door early because he ran out of flat rounds of bread to wrap the kebobs in. Bread was one of the first.commodities to become scarce after the imposi- tion of the U.N. embargo on trade with Iraq. Sara, a 25-year-old college graduate who runs a clothing shop, said the celebrations hid a city of sadness. “Their faces are happy, but their hearts are closed,” she said, reflecting her own sentiments, if not those of the city at large. “I’m waiting for someone,” the pretty brunette said wistful- ly. “My boyfriend is in Kuwait. ... 1 will go to the party, but I will not be happy.” The future for Iraq is too un- certain, said Sara, who did not give her family name. The young mother of three, an Algerian who has lived here for 11 years, said there is little that people like her can do to steer the course of the future, to determine whether there will be peace or war. She hopes that Iraqi Presi- dent Saddam Hussein and Amer- ican President George Bush will find a meeting of minds. It is only two weeks until the U.N. dead- line for Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait or face the use of military force. “We have to leave everything in the hands of God,” she said. “We have to trust God to get Bush and Saddam together be- cause we're the innocents, the women and the children.” \f"

Billy Du Bose, 24, of Rock Hill, -S.C., was cleaning dust out of the nose cone of a cluster bomb on Monday when Vice President Dan Quayle dropped by to wish the troops a Happy New Year. Sergeant Du Bose and others in his sandbagged bomb storage pit were getting the bombs’ pre- cision guidance mechanisms all shined up so that Marine Harrier pilots could drop them north of the Saudi border if war breaks aut after Jan. 15S. “The vice president’s coming is pretty good,” said Sergeant Du Bose. ‘“‘That way we know the higher-ups care what we are doing.”’ ; Up at the front, the mood was too sober for much New Year’s Eve celebrating — and it wasn’t just because the soldiers lacked booze. “Merry Christmas, no New Year,” said.a graffiti message one Marine had inscribed, ap- parently to Iraq, on the casing of one cluster bomb. Another clus- ter bomb carried the inscription that began ‘“‘Rest in Peace,’ and ended with an .anatomical ex- pletive. After touring the bomb pit Mr. Quayle stopped near a head- quarters tent. He asked Marine Capt. Dino Peros, operations of- ficer of a Harrier jump jet squad- ron from. Yuma, Ariz., whether he had noticed much Iraqi air ac- tivity along the Saudi northern border. “We go up north [toward the border] to check them out,’”’ Cap- tain Peros replied. Mr. Quayle asked Captain Peros how the enemy fighters looked. *‘Not as good as we do,” Cap- tain Peros answered. “We are ready. We are here to do a job.”’ On his second day in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Quayle spent 12 hours visiting and giving pep talks to the troops in the Eastern Province. He was warmly received. He received enthusiastic cheers after he promised that the.

Mr. Quayle, who has obvious- ly played a good bit of volleyball over the years, seemed to have trouble catching his stride on the sandy surface. He muffed sever- al shots while his team was win- ning 15-3. After helicoptering south from some of the lead American troop positions, Mr. Quayle changed into a T-shirt and shorts | and joined headquarters staffers, including one two-star general, in a spirited game of basketball. The vice president held his own against taller, younger players, scoring seven baskets. One courtside spectator was Lt. Col. Sam Graves, Mr. Quayle’s former commander in the Indiana National Guard, who has been called up and sent to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Quayle spent 10 minutes chatting with Lieu- tenant Colonel Graves before the game. Following another change of clothes, the vice president joined troops for dinner at a military mess hall. He shook hands and thanked soldiers and reservists, calling them America’s heroes. Army Staff Sgt. Ronald Hair- son, who recently transferred to Saudi Arabia from the 244th Sup- port Center in Stuttgart, Germa- ny, was asked what he thought about eating New Year’s Eve din- ner in the presence of the vice president. ; “T think it’s great,’’ Sergeant Hairson answered. ‘He ain’t drinking, I ain’t drinking.’”’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 1, 1991 \f"

In a collection of tough com- ments by President Saddam Hussein, who was televised help- ing prepare a New Year’s meal for his troops, by the authorita- tive Baghdad Observer newspa- per and through the Iraqi News Agency, the Iraqi government sent a message that it is not offer- ing the world a sudden, easy res- olution of the gulf crisis. “At atime the U.S. awaits im- patiently for a sign indicating an Iraqi readiness to compromise, Iraq is getting more and more re- solved about not ceding any of its rights,” the newspaper warned in an editorial headlined ‘No Surprise Moves.” An unidentified Arab mili- tary analyst told The Associated Press in Baghdad that Saddam had added 130,000 men in five new divisions to his elite Repub- lican Guard, which spearheaded Iraq’s lightning Aug. 2 assault on Kuwait. It was unclear whether they would be sent into or near Ku- wait or instead toward Iraq’s border with Iran. Iran an- nounced Tuesday that it will con- duct extensive military maneu- vers near its border with Iraq from Jan. 11 to Jan. 20. In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Vice President Dan Quayle told U.S. sailors and Air Force per- sonnel that the United States re- mains insistent that Iraq meet the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for withdrawing from Kuwait. “Happy New Year,” Mr. Quayle told one group of pilots. “Last year, 1990, Saddam Hus- sein invaded Kuwait. This year, 1991, Saddam Hussein will leave Kuwait.” If force is needed, Mr. Quayle said just before a lunch of fried chicken and corn bread at a de- sert air base, ‘‘we are ready, will- ing and able to do what has to be done.” An official traveling with Mr. Quayle told reporters anony- mously that Secretary of State James A. Baker III is consider- ing another visit to allies in the Middle East and, possibly in Eu- rope. And in Washington, Presi- dent Bush arranged what White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called a “routine” meeting Tuesday evening in the _ White House with Mr. Baker and other senior gulf advisers: Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney; White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu; and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. In Brussels, European Com- munity bureaucrats prepared for a meeting Friday of representa- tives of EC countries. They are expected to agree to send an en- voy to Saddam in what is viewed as a last-ditch effort for a non-vi- olent solution to the impasse. A visit by Mr. Baker to the Middle East would put him in po- sition to make a quick trip to Baghdad for a meeting with Sad- dam if the diplomatic initiative expected from the EC bears any success. So far, the Iraqi and U.S. gov- ernments have been unable to agree to a date for talks, although both sides have agreed in princi- ple to hold them. Mr. Bush refused Iraq’s pro- posed date of Jan. 12, saying it would be too late. Saddam said Mr. Bush’s proposal that Mr. Baker meet with Saddam this Thursday would be too soon. A highly placed Iraqi official did say Tuesday that the issue of a date might be further discussed _if the United States would ac- knowledge the right of each country to set the date for meet- ings on its own soil. ‘In Cairo, meantime, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sent Saddam a warning laced with the same high rhetoric that Saddam has used in denouncing Mr. Mu- barak and Mr. Bush the leading Arab and non-Arab, respective- ly, in the multinational forces that moved into the gulf region to get Iraq out of Kuwait. Mr. Mubarak said that if Sad- dam blocks a peaceful solution, “heads will turn white, cities will collapse and the mutilated bod- ies of victims will be scattered in seas of blood.” Saddam told a group of Iraqi military officers Tuesday that he has no plans to give up Kuwait. He met with them during a trip to an undisclosed location, possibly in Kuwait, during which he helped cook a New Year din- ner for his troops. Baghdad tele- vision news Tuesday: showed Saddam tossing handfuls of salt into an outdoor cookpot, then di- recting subordinates to pour in bubbling liquids from other pots. Saddam also sent a strongly worded New Year’s Day message to PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who sympathizes with his cause. “Right is on our side. Let us fight the infidels and their agents wherever they are,” Saddam said to Mr. Arafat. In other gulf developments: #A US. soldier died after ap- parently shooting himself with his M-16 rifle, the U.S. Central Command reported Tuesday. He was the sixth serviceman to die since Saturday. = Many Western embassies in Baghdad have decided to cut back drastically on their staffs before Jan. 15, sources said Tuesday. Britain, the United States, France and Italy will leave only skeleton staffs. Atlanta Constitution - January 2, 1991 \f"

Embassies across Baghdad are sending more diplomats packing, while Iraqis are think- ing about whether, when and how to get out. Boxes of documents were piled behind a clerk feeding pa- pers into a shredding machine Wednesday at the U.S. Embassy, while a Japanese diplomat said his embassy’s sensitive docu- ~ ments already had been burned. “We are ready for the end,” he said. Iraqis also are making plans. “People are getting ready to leave Baghdad for the mountains and the villages,” said a middle- aged Iraqi intellectual who asked not to be identified. “I will take my family out. I may be a victim myself, but I must stay.” Through the gloom of cold and constant rain, a U.S. official still mustered some hope for dip- lomatic success, although Iraq and the United States have been unable to agree even on a date to talk peace. _ “T have not given up on the diplomatic process. I’m still here. I still have a role to play,” said the American official, short- ly after admitting that Dec. 17 was the last time he talked to his Iraqi jsperald about a date After the U.N. Security Coun- cil set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait or face ouster by force, President Bush offered to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to meet with President Saddam Hussein any time before that date. But when Iraq chose Jan. 12, Mr. Bush said that date would not give Iraq enough time after the talks to leave Kuwait before the deadline, Mr. Bush then of- fered talks any time within a 15- day period ending today, al- though the administration has shown some signs of flexibijity. The failure to schedule talks has left Baghdad residents in a curiously ambivalent mood. A surface layer of bravado, based on a belief that the United States and allied troops arrayed in the Persian Gulf will never attack, covers a deep-set fear that the worst may indeed happen. “Our people are not afraid,” said Dr. Khoshaba Abooma, a pe- diatrician who is director of Ahi- lyeh Children’s Hospital. “Even during the bombing [of the Iran- Iraq War], people were walking in the streets.” But his boast was undercut by an admission that neurosis has increased among children. ' “T think it is connected to this anxiety of war. We have a few boys from the age of 10 admitted for hysterical ‘attacks. We never used to see that,” Dr. Abooma | “We go to church every Sun- day and light candles and pray the politicians will make a settle- _ ment for peace,” he said.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — The staff of Operation Desert Shield sent Iraq’s military com- manders a not-very-subtle signal Wednesday that a growing West- ern air armada is practicing how to pulverize them. The U.S. Command in Saudi Arabia disclosed at a televised briefing that U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine warplanes optical systems. The plane earned a reputation for ven- geance throughout the Middle East in 1986, when it was used to pierce Libyan air defenses and drop bombs on the living quar- ters of Col. Moammar Gadhafi. The briefing officer, Lt. Col. Greg Pepin, said the United States now has 1,300 combat air- planes in the Persian Gulf the-. ater, up from last week’s official _ estimate of “over 1,000 planes.” Lieutenant Colonel Pepin have been holding training exer- cises on how to bomb enemy air bases. It was part of a series of warnings designed to increase psychological pressure on the Iraqis as the U.N. deadline nears for them to leave Kuwait. To reinforce the impression that an air war is coming soon, the U.S. military has invited sev- eral groups of American report- ers to visit a Saudi air base where U.S. fighter-bombers are. sta- tioned. The initial visit today will said the American pilots have been flying in practice exercises with the Saudi, British, French, Canadian and Italian air forces. In the U.S. Command’s most detailed appraisal of the Iraqi air - force, Lieutenant Colonel Pepin said Iraqi pilots know the funda- mentals of flying but have not shown an ability to “respond” in fast-moving aerial combat. He said the United States and its allies have far superior “com- mand and control” arrange- give the world its first close look at the U.S. Air Force attack planes that would rain destruc- tion on Iraqi targets if war breaks out. The warplanes, notably the swing-wing F-111 bomber, have been flying practice missions on gunnery ranges in Saudi Arabia, a U.S. Command spokesman said at the news briefing. The F-111 can skim below ra- . dar to drop bombs guided by la- sers, infrared beams and electro- _ments for air battles involving a large number of warplanes. “We practice that continual- ly,” he said. “We're capable of doing that. And we haven't yet seen the Iraqis capable of. per- forming operations of this na- ture.” He was referring in large part to the edge enjoyed by the U.S.-led alliance because of the airborne warning and control systems, or AWACS, planes.

        "ocr_text": "U.S. unveils air base in range of Baghdad By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE CENTRAL SAUDI ARABIA — The United States on Thursday disclosed the existence of anew U.S, Air Force fighter-bomber base which has been hacked out of the desert in 47 days. The wing commander said it is nearly ready to de- liver 1 million pounds of bombs a day on Iraqi targets. Wing Commander Col. Hal Hornburg, 45, of Dallas said that if war comes, his scores of fighter-bombers could make round-trip bombing runs to military tar- gets inside Iraq and Kuwait without the need for aeri- al refueling. At his previous base in the southern part ofthe Arabian peninsula that was impossible, “Tam twice as close to Baghdad as I was before, and that makes me feel good,” Hornburg said. He was comparing the new base — which some troops have nicknamed Camellot — to another secret site further to the south where his unit spent the first four months of the gulf crisis. He added: “We'll have a very, very lethal dose of ordnance to deliver on the targets we are tasked to hit, should we be tasked to hit targets.” The first journalists allowed onto the new desolate, windswept air base saw scores of the Air Force's mid- night penetrators, called F-15E Strike Eagles, parked in a neat geometrical pattern on the runway. Most were from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C. Next to the Strike Eagles sat several dozen F-16 air combat fighters with the emblems of the South Caro- lina National Guard painted across their tails. The Carolinians, who arrived several days ago after a 14- hour flight from Columbia, §.C., have been assigned here to help destroy the Iraqi fighter force in air-to-air combat if war breaks out. The seemingly endless gray line of warplanes in the desert was the most chilling advertisement of Ameri- ‘can offensive air power since the start of Operation Desert Shield. By publicizing the base now, the United States was transmitting a psychological message to Saddam Hussein's military — if not the Iraqi ruler himself — only 12 days before the U.N. deadline for evacuating m Kuwait. To heighten the unpleasant surprise of seeing on television that a fresh posse of American fighter- bombers is poised closer to the border, the U.S. com- mand allowed Hornburg to warn in the bluntest pos- sible language that war will mean catastrophe for the Iraqi air force. Hornburg went out of his way to compliment his potential enemies, saying Iraq has “an awfully good } air force and an awfully good military.” But he also ASSOCIATED PRESS made a flat prediction that the American and allied air forces would quickly achieve full control of the skies, perhaps in as little as six hours, One major edge, he said, is that the United States is far more proficient at attacking in total darkness through the use of advanced radar on the F-15E, which he called “a magic airplane.” His estimate that this base alone could land | mil- Dayton Daily News - lion pounds of ordnance on Iraqi targets implied that “Camelot” could theoretically attack something like 1,000 military targets — each with a pair of 500- -pound conventional bombs — on the first day of a war., practice, the actual number of targets that would be struck would depend on the size and type of bombs which war planners assign to each plane. In any event, Hornburg and his senior battle staff said the “Camelot” base is close enough to Iraq and Kuwait so that pilots would be able to fly two or three combat sorties every day and still get 12 hours ofrest. “We have in some regard at least doubled our com- bat capabilities due to the proximity to target,” said Col, David Eberly, deputy commander if operations. “Camellot” has risen from bare desert to a tent ty accommodating well more than 2,000 Air Force troops — 3 percent of them women — in less than seven weeks, Work is still going on around the clock, in part to finish installing the planned 55 miles of electrical wiring and high- voltage cable. ! One new arrival, Tech. Set. Russell Oswald, 31, df Lexington, S.C., an avionics specialist of the South Carolina Air National Guard, said, “You leave your sleeping tent to go to work, and when you come back that night there’s another row of tents. You go back to work the next day and the road that wasn’t baer has now been paved.” Pilots and other Air Force personnel from 71 U. g bases around the world have been assigned here to what has become a composite wing under the com- mand of Hornburg. Called the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional), the unit is an extension of the celebrated “Fourth But First” Air Force wing that was credited with destroying 1,016 enemy aircraft i in World War II. ‘ The Saudis remain the nominal owners of the base, but the Americans designed it, built it and are guard- ing it. The only Saudi official on the base is a a Saudi air force first lieutenant who works as a liaison officer, The air base has taken shape in short order partly because the Saudi government turned over to the Americans a Saudi airfield that was in early stages of construction. One 2-mile runway and extensive con; crete taxiways were completed, but the contractor had not begun to erect buildings or hangars. January 4, 1991 \f"

Both sides compromised enough to set a meeting Wednes- day between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. Iraq gave the final nod in a com- munique delivered Friday eve- ning in Baghdad to U.S. Charge d’ Affaires Joseph C. Wilson IV. President Bush’ greeted Iraq’s acceptance of his invita- tion for talks as a “useful step” toward resolving the Persian Gulf crisis. Mr. Bush pledged that if the Iraqis “totally comply” with the U.N. Security Council resolution demanding a complete pullout from Kuwait, then neither Iraq nor its withdrawing forces will be attacked. Diplomats in Baghdad said Iraq considers such a pledge critical to any agreement. Wednesday’s scheduled meeting in Geneva does not en- sure that Iraq and the U.S.-led al- liance opposing its Aug. 2 take- over of Kuwait will. be able to avoid military confrontation. But it provides a sliver of hope to ose who feared that war might egin by default, simply because dialogue had been suspended. Mr. Bush made his original proposal for talks on Nov. 30, but no ; agreement could be reached ona date. Urgency for diplomacy has heightened daily as the tense countdown continues toward the Jan. 15 deadline that the United Nations set for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face the use of miktary force. “The planned Geneva meeting raised hopes in Iraq that Mr. Baker might visit Baghdad and meet with Iraqi President Sad- darn Hussein — a move that ana- lysts in the Iraqi capital believe could be essential to securing any final peace. ‘In Washington, however, Mr. Bush cast doubts on a future mis- sion to Baghdad, since his earlier plan for meetings in both capitals fell ‘apart when he and Saddam disagreed over dates. ““I hope that [the Geneva meeting will] have the same re- sult,” Mr. Bush said just before boarding his helicopter for Camp David, where he planned to spénd \"the weekend working on a letter to Saddam to be delivered by-Mr. Baker to Mr. Aziz at the Geneva meeting. f Mr. Bush will make a radio address to the nation today on the Persian Gulf situation.

The Iraqi News Agen- said Mr. Bush’s offer came-ac- mpanied by ‘‘a series of arro- gant statements” that prove the U.S. government’s bad inten- tions. It said Iraq was accepting ‘spite of the bad style of the nerican administration.” Mr. Bush warned that there Swould be no negotiating at the meeting, which he said would be Baker “‘is prepared to work for the goal of peace in the whole re- gion on the basis of justice and fairness.” The 12-member European Community, meanwhile, launched what a German official _ described as a “parallel’’ peace bid by inviting Mr. Aziz to meet Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz (right) has been invited to meet EC leaders after meeting Secretary — of State James A.

The French plan was opposed by Britain and the Netherlands, according to British sources, and no mention of it was made ina statement issued by the foreign ministers after the meeting.

The South Carolina unit is one of the first reserve units to join the front combat ranks of the force confronting Iraq. Guard pilots join front ranks S.C. unit is thrust into combat role IN CENTRAL SAUDI ARA- BIA — One week after he left ci- vilian life in South Carolina, Air National Guardsman Jerry Risher gunned his F-16 jet off the runway of a secret air base in Saudi Arabia. “This is what we trained for all of our lives,” said Mr. Risher, 52, a pilot in one of the first U.S. reserve units to move into the - front combat ranks of the multi- national force confronting Iraq. Along with more than 300 col- leagues in the South Carolina Air National Guard, Mr. Risher has had to put his life on fast-forward to get ready for an air war should diplomacy fail. Rarely have U.S. civilians been thrust so abruptly into the front lines of a potential war. But Mr. Risher figures he will be ready to fly combat missions against Iraq on Jan. 15 if Presi- dent Bush gives the order. The South Carolina Air Na- tional Guard was the first Air Force Guard unit summoned to service, and its members are convinced it was because the Air Force rates them as the most proficient Air Guard unit among all 50 states. Mr. Risher has been flying fighter jets for 26 years. He was on leave from his engineering job at the Savannah River nuclear plant last month when the call-up came. Now a squadron commander who flies as much as any of his younger pilots, Mr. Risher is the same age as Air Force four-star generals who are bound to desks. “In the Guard, we practice operational readiness all the time, and this is very similar,” he said. “Of course, unless the shooting starts, no one really knows how it is going to affect them. But we are ready.” The Air Guard was mobilized Dec. 26. The next day members said goodbye to their families and took off to join the Air Force’s 4th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional) at the new air base deep in the Saudi desert. Like the several thousand other Air Force personnel at the fighter-bomber base, the South Carolinians are sleeping in insu- lated tents and watching as the base is built from scratch. Capt. David Seawell, 31, one of the younger F-16 pilots in the Air Guard, is taking a $12,000 pay cut from his job as a cockpit first officer with American Air- lines to be there. He says the money doesn’t matter. “T think there is a lot of pride, I really do,” he said when asked to sum up his feelings. “I think you are proud of your country, I think you are proud of yourself. There is something to being the No. 1 Guard unit to be activated.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 6, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Surrounded by troops, Fahd offers olive branch By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent NEAR THE KUWAIT BOR- DER, Saudi Arabia — Standing among allied forces from 17 na- tions, Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd on Sunday made a gesture of peace to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein by saying Iraq may be able to gain access to some Ku- waiti territory if it first withdraws. “T hope that Saddam Hussein will take this bold step and with- draw from Kuwait and avoid the bloodshed and the catastrophe of war,” King Fahd said. A 60-car motorcade sped the monarch at 70 miles an hour from a military airport to a de- sert encampment. There, he re- viewed an unlikely assembly of 5,000 troops, including Syrians, French, Britons, Czechs, Senega- lese, Bangladeshis, Saudis and a sole Japanese medic carrying the Japanese flag. The king re- viewed American troops earlier in the day. Despite the military setting, some 60 miles from the Iraqi bor- der, King Fahd took a soft line, refraining from threats of war in the event Saddam fails to comply with the U.N. demand to with- draw by Jan. 15. The king there- by appeared to be projecting himself to Saddam as the “good cop,” while allowing President Bush to play the role of the tough-talking “bad cop.” The Saudi ruler’s remarks seemed fashioned as possible face-savers in advance of talks between Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Swit- zerland. The king said that if Saddam pulls his troops voluntarily out of Kuwait, that factor will be con- sidered “in his favor” when the world community gets around to discussing whether Iraq should be punished for invading Ku- wait. “That will make matters easy for him to accomplish things without any further pun- ishment,” King Fahd added. The monarch thus openly suggested for the first time that Saddam could collect some kind of diplomatic prize if he agrees to pull out without a fight. This soft- er line is at odds with the position taken by the United States, Egypt and even some Saudi diplomats ~ in Washington, that Saddam’s ag- gression must not be “rewarded” in any way. Furthermore, King Fahd in- dicated that he did not oppose Iraq’s recurrent demands that all American troops be withdrawn. “We have an understanding with all countries that sent their troops that once the crisis is ‘over, all the troops will go back to their homes,” the king said. And when asked whether Saudi Arabia would be willing to see Iraq gain access to disputed Kuwaiti islands through diplo- matic talks after the former Ku- waiti government is restored to power, he said, “First they with- on) aot al ate Ready for war RAS TANURA, Saudi Arabia — A Saudi Arabian worker with Aram- co, the government-run oil company, wears his gas mask along with an Arab headdress after being issued the protective gear Sunday. The Associated Press draw, and then if there is any de- mand by Iraq toward Kuwait, the two countries should sit together and discuss the matter between. themselves. And whatever they. agree upon, we will support.” For the first time in the five- month Persian Gulf crisis, the king answered questions from foreign journalists. It was also the first time he had visited the front-line troops sent to his king- dom to defend it against an Iraqi onslaught. 1 Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 7, 1991 \f"

Baker ITI holds a face-to-face meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. In a televised speech Sunday, Saddam betrayed no sign of re- treat when he told his million- strong armed forces that they must bear any sacrifice to keep Kuwait, which Iraq occupied Aug. 2 and then annexed as its 19th province. Behind the scenes, however, a different picture emerged. “They want to have profound, serious discussions with the Americans,” said a Western dip- lomat, who was one of many questioning the utility of Mr. Baker’s Wednesday in Geneva with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. “By my experience, we ex- pect nothing from this meeting,” the diplomat said. “If anything is going to be changed in their posi- tion, it can happen only in talks with the Iraqi president. Major events could happen only here in Baghdad.” Clad in battle fatigues and black beret, Saddam spoke on Army Day, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Iraqi army. He praised his soldiers for “the return of Kuwait to its Iraqi motherland,” where he said it scheduled meeting will remain “for the present and future times.” He said the up- coming battle may turn into a historic fight for the liberation of Palestine and place the soldiers “at the forefront of a battle or- dained by God” — once again raising the possibility that Israel would be drawn into the struggle and could lose the Arab territo- ries it now holds. But most diplomats in Bagh- dad quickly dismissed the speech as typical patriotic boil- erplate. “On a day like today, he cannot say anything else but to glorify the army,” a Western dip- lomat said. The diplomatic community in Baghdad has. been moving toward the view that the Iraqi re- gime’s primary interest is sur- vival, not keeping Kuwait. Ana- lysts widely agree that the Pales- tinian issue has taken on a secondary role and that the re- gime no longer directly links it to Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait. “I think Saddam Hussein might be looking for some things: assurances he will be safe if he pulls out, that economic sanc- tions won’t continue,” another Western diplomat said. ‘“He probably wants some assurance about what he claims has been the distortion of the oil market.” The security at issue includes Saddam’s personal safety, as ’ well as the political and econom- ic stability of Iraq, one ex- plained. Fears that withdrawal from Kuwait would be followed by a continued economic embar- go or even assassination at- tempts have risen in Baghdad. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 7, 1991 \f"

Jan. 15, after which the U.N. Se- curity Council has authorized the ‘use of military force to drive the future economic relations with the international community. Iraq’s demands for a strong hand in pricing oil, along with tough penalties for those who overproduce and drive prices down, have led to some concerns that Saddam could gain a dan- gerous degree of control over what may be the world econo- my’s most important commodity. “Saddam doesn’t need more oil fields,” said one diplomat in explaining Iraq’s anxiety. ‘“‘What worries him is whether the price of oil is $18 or $25 [a barrel].

Bak- er III is already so negatively charged that some diplomats think the meeting may dissolve after half an hour of ultimatums delivered by each side. Saddam is said to be unwill- ing to make significant compro- mises because he still does not believe the United States will mount a war that could take tens of thousands of American lives.

Marcia Kunstel - Joumal-Constitution correspondent .+BAGHDAD, Iraq — Ardith -Miller has worked on every con- tinent for the U.S. State Depart- ment, but this is the first time in -more than 30 years that she has sat and waited for war to explode ~omher doorstep.

Virtually all the embassies al- ready have drawn down staff, but they will consider closing if there is no movement toward a peace- ful settlement of the gulf crisis.

Miss Miller is one of five or six American employees still running the U.S. Embassy, a two- building complex in a residential section just off one of Baghdad’s premier shopping boulevards.

With most of the staff gone, _ those remaining are not overbur- dened, because duties have been reduced. There’s no entertaining, and hardly any Americans come to the embassy with consular prob- lems — lost passports, emergen- cies at home, trouble with Iraqi authorities. “Since we shred everything now, there are no files to main- ‘ain. I keep no copies anymore,” siitl Miss Miller, who is secre- tary to the chief of staff. That when the gulf crisis started, Sit- ting in the ambassador’s office these days is Joseph C. Wilson IV, the charge d’affaires. Cabinets full of classified documents were shredded back in August, just after Iraq invaded Kuwait and then took thousands of Westerners and Japanese as hostages. More recently the em- bassy crew has been shredding boxes of documents that are not sensitive but merely outdated now that the year has ended. Communications officer Wal- ly Eustis has more work than be- fore. He not only keeps the tele- type, phones and diplomatic pouch service running, but he also spends one night a week lis- tening for the alarm that rings when an urgent message comes in from Washington. Mr. Eustis, another 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, got home to Bremerton, Wash., in November, then was asked to come back here in mid-De- cember. He was not pleased, he said in an interview, but felt it his duty to return. “Since I’ve gotten back it’s kind of bleak. Living out of cans, that kind of thing,” Mr. Eustis said. “Before November I went out in the market and got vegeta- bles and did my own cooking, but not anymore. It just doesn’t seem to matter. It’s not living here. It’s surviving. I don’t enjoy being here.” Anyone who drives in Bagh- dad now will face another prob- lem. Suddenly Tuesday night, long lines appeared at gas sta- tions with no immediate explana- tion, except that people were fearing the worst from the Gene- va talks and wanted to be ready to drive out of town should the war threat heighten. Mr. Eustis’s wife is worried but not frantic, being an experi- enced State Department hand herself. She was a secretary here at the embassy till she was evac- uated with the rest of the staff. Miss Miller, a native of Drap- er, §.D., said her two brothers and a sister are worried, too, but respect her decision and her job. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 9, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Foreign diplomats, journalists desert Baghdad Perez de Cuellar’s peace bid given little chance of success By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondent BAGHDAD — Diplomats began aban- doning their posts in Baghdad and Iraqis prepared for flight to safer ground Thursday, reflecting scant hope for the success of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar’s peace mission here this weekend. The White House urged all Americans, including journalists, to leave Iraq. There was little optimism here that Mr, Perez de Cuellar would be able to halt the slide toward war as Tuesday’s deadline ap- proaches for Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait or face U.N.-sanctioned use of mili- tary might. ' “Now the percentage is more for war,” a senior Arab diplomat said Thursday. Several others said they give the secre- tary-general little chance of finding a formu- la that will meet the U.N. requirement for withdrawal and still give Iraqi President Saddam Hussein some face-saving means of pulling out. “If you expect much from such initia- tives, you are wrong. But at least it is better to talk to Saddam than to isolate him as the Americans did,” said another diplomat with experience here. The departure of key Western diplomatic staffs, which continued when the British am- bassador and all but one British consular of- ficial drove away from their embassy in Land Rovers around 6:30 a.m. Thursday, was seen partially as a pressure tactic designed to con- vince Saddam that war is at hand. There also are real concerns that diplo- mats from countries of the U.S.-led alliance might be interned if war breaks out. The remaining six Americans from the U.S. Embassy staff are expected to fly out on a charter plane at 11 a.m. Saturday, and en- voys from other nations likely will accompa- ny them, Departure.of the diplomats probably will not seriously impair the chances of resum- ing a dialogue if the Iraqis have any mes- sages to deliver or proposals to make. Iraq is maintaining its embassies abroad, through which communication can take place, and several nations have indicated they will not abandon Baghdad. These include the Soviet Union. One possibly unexpected impact here of the diplomats’ departure is that many for- eign journalists are planning to leave in their wake. Some news organizations are afraid for their employees’ safety, but there are more tangible reasons as well. Journalists often have been able to use their embassies’ direct telephone lines to file stories home, a communication link that is being cut with the departure of diplomatic staff. Diplomats also have been an important source of information in a country where Ken Mowry, Dale E, Dodson/Staff journalists have extremely limited access to public officials and must rely on strictly con- trolled domestic media for information. The realization that so many journalists are planning to leave has prompted the Iraqi Information Ministry to ease access to visas — reporters normally have been granted only 10-day visits here — and to make plans to install direct telephone lines for reporters’ use at hotels and at the ministry. é Iraqi officials have said the departure of journalists will fulfill the aims of the U.S. government by preventing Iraq's point of a from being transmitted to the American public. Long gasoline lines continued Thursday. Some apparently are stockpiling gasoline in the event they decide to leave for rural areas considered more safe than tle city.

        "ocr_text": "American soldiers rely on training, fear itself By Joseph Albright Cox News Service ' WITH THE TROOPS, Saudi Arabia — These days, fear is almost everyone's bedfellow. * Commanders spt their best people to go through long stretches of being afraid. That's how it is even in elite bunches like the para- troopers and the fighter pilots. Take Army Staff Sgt. David Shaffer, 26, of Burlington, Iowa, who belongs to a unit that can parachute at night and capture an enemy air base. He believes his training will pull him through. But he doesn’t claim to be fearless. “Tt is the apprehension of dying and not be- ing able to see your family again,” Shaffer said. “I'm divorced, and we had to leave so fast that I didn’t get a chance to see my two kids. T'd like to see them again.” Air Force Capt. Nick Sandwick, 30, of Salt Lake City, has been training for nine years to jockey his F-15E fighter-bomber through a for- est of antiaircraft projectiles. Ask him how he feels about combat and he says, “There is a little bit of fear. But at the same time, we've got a great airplane and a lot of well-trained people.” Even certified heroes say they used to get scared when the shooting starts. Former Army Col. David Hackworth, one of the most deco- rated living American soldier, says, “Yes, I was frightened, but my training took over. It is not unlike what happens when a prizefighter gets in the ring.” Hackworth, who won eight Purple Hearts and nine Silver Stars, is in Saudi Arabia cover- ing Operation Desert Shield for Newsweek magazine. “Anybody in a combat situation would have fear,” he said. “Fear is great be- cause it gives you adrenalin that fuels you into accomplishing impossible things.” When it was 120 degrees last August, Ma- rine Staff Sgt. Eddie Hughes, 27, of Forsythe, Ga., said his biggest fear was running out of water in the desert. That fear passed when the Army’s logistics machine proved that it could distribute water by the hundreds of thousands of gallons. Then in September, people feared each full moon. Saddam Hussein attacked Kuwait by moonlight, and that is when they thought he would send his tanks into Saudi Arabia. Iraqi chemical weapons scared many troops back in the fall, and it continues to upset the hordes of arriving soldiers. “That blister gas that they use is particular- ly nasty,” said a newcomer from Germany, Spec. Jeffrey Roberts, 24, of Pittsburgh. “A lut of people are going to die, that’s for sure,” But for most soldiers who have been in the desert for months, gas has come to be just an- other hazard of war. They have practiced put- ting on their anti-chemical suits so many times that the strangeness of gas has receded. Now, antipersonnel mines and incoming tank shells seem just as threatening. Fear of getting shot receded in November when the United Nations gave Saddam a grace period to pull out. But now that the grace peri- od is down to five days, bullet fear is making a comeback. Paratrooper commander, Lt. Col. John Vines, 41, of Bessemer, Ala., says a good bat tlefield leader has to act unafraid in front of his troops even when he feels scared himself. “Everyone wants to believe that their lead- ers are invincible, that they have a magic shield around them,” said Vines. In addition to the commanders, the best fighting units usually have some foxhole pro- fessor of survival who knows what it is like to be scared. In one front-line battalion of Marine scouts, this unofficial combat counsellor has been Gunnery Sgt. LeRoy Ford, 38, who fought in Vietnam as an 18-year-old private. “Tam getting them ready,” said “Gunny” Ford some weeks ago. ‘I tell them how it was as a private. I was a private, 18 years old, scared. Didn't know nothing. Just finished boot camp, had 10 days leave, and I was gone to Vietnam, My squad leader took me aside and told me, ‘When I say something, do it, don’t question me, just do it.’ at you, you have to just do things when they tell you. You don’t have time to sit down and say, well I might want to do that.” Pittsburgh Post - January 11, 1991 \f"

Wayne Ret- tig, 40, of Haven, Kan. ‘‘The ex- tremely big guy or the extremely small guy, he may have a problem.’’ He told a group of journalists that armor vests already have been issued to the U.S. soldiers assigned to outfits classified by the military as combat units. The deficit of armor vests is concen- trated in combat support units, which serve behind the front lines, he said. “‘For the most part, the sol- diers already have their flak jackets,’’ he said. ‘‘We are doing everything we can to obtain the others we need.’’ The armor vest is one of three Pieces of protective gear that is supposed to be issued to every U.S. serviceman and woman in the Saudi theater.

Col. Wayne Ret- tig, 40, of Haven, Kan. ‘‘The ex- tremely big guy or the extremely small guy, he may have a problem.’’ He told a group of journalists that armor vests already have been issued to the U.S. soldiers assigned to outfits classified by the military as combat units.

        "ocr_text": " ‘Pools’ may standardize war coverage By Joseph Albright © 1991 Cox News Service HAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — Don’t be surprised if D you start finding 50 newspaper correspondents quoting the same obscure grunt in the desert as uttering precisely the same quip on the same day. It doesn’t mean they all piled into the same foxhole. With combat as little as two days off, the military has put into effect its plan to restrict the battlefield to coverage by a small group of “pool” journalists. Sixty-nine poolers from the print media, radio and TV will be given front-row seats to witness a war, if it happens, on behalf of the rest of the world. They will ride in tanks and helicopters, watch from the bridge of aircraft carriers and spend the nights in foxholes. Whatever they see or record will be shared with the roughly 400 non-pool journalists waiting in a Saudi hotel pressroom hundreds of miles from the front-line troops. One 18-member pool covers the 200,000 U.S. troops in the U.S. Army. Another 18-member pool covers the 60,000 Marines. Smaller pools are chosen by the military to cover the Air Force and the Navy. And there are “quick-reaction” pools to handle something unexpected, such as a terrorist incident. The correspondents now based in Dhahran have formed themselves into a pool rotation, with preference going to those organizations that have covered Saudi Arabia from the first days of the gulf crisis. Once the press corps submits a list of eligible journalists, the military decides who it will assign to what pool. Last Thursday was an example of how it works. Dozens of journalists were clamoring fer a story on how the troops feel as the war deadline nears. But it takes a military escort to get inside a troop camp. And the only escorts the military provided were for the pools. Ee etait. surrogate quote-giver for hundreds of supposedly competing newspapers around the world. Pool journalist Larry Jolidon of USA Today happened to encountez Jones at an airbase and asked her how she felt. “Before we could at least look toward a peaceful resolution,” she said. “Now, it's basically back to square one.” Jolidon included her quote as the last paragraph of his two-page typed “pool report” on his airbase visit. It was likely to get quoted in dozens of newspapers, inasmuch as it was one of the few snippets on what the soldiers were feeling. If Jolidon had omitted the quotation from his pool report, neither he nor anyone else would have been permitted under the pool rules to report it. Many officers are hoping the “pool” system will help break down the “us vs. them” barrier that they believe separated the press and the soldiers during the Vietnam War. They are hoping to re-create something of the camaraderie under fire that existed between commanders and the war correspondents during World War IL. “Your lives are going to be at stake just as much as our lives,” said Baxter Ennis, public affairs officer of the 82nd Airborne Division. “And we feel that a bond and a trust is going to develop between the units and the journalists. That will only work if the journalists are brought out to us and stay with us for long periods of time.” And indeed, the four journalists assigned to the 82nd Airborne found the soldiers more inclined to talk than usual. The reason, it seemed, was that the troops felt they could open up to someone who was ready to follow them north if the fighting starts. Some officers in the 82nd were dubious about the value of combat pools during the fighting. Capt. Mark White, 32, of Pensacola, Fla., said, “I think a lot of officers question whether we need the press over here. They are pretty concerned about operational security.” During the first five months of the military buildup, most coverage of the troops was “unilateral.” That means every journalist who managed to get permission from the Saudis to enter the kingdom has been free to interview any soldier he could find and write the story based on first-hand material. When the military takes a busload of journalists out for “unilateral” coverage, it would be considered plagiarism for one correspondent to lift a quotation from another correspondent’s raw copy. But from now on, the imminence of war and the logistical difficulties of transporting large groups of journalists around a potential battlefield have caused the military to cut out most “unilateral” coverage.

Secretary-General Ja- vier Perez de Cuellar arrived Saturday night in Baghdad on an 1lth-hour peace mission, but President Bush said he is in- clined to go to war “sooner rath- er than later” to drive Iraq from Kuwait. Mr. Bush, in a White House news conference, said war can be averted if Iraq begins a “mas- sive, rapid withdrawal” before Tuesday’s U.N. deadline for Sad- dam Hussein to leave Kuwait or face possible military action. Mr. Bush, interrupting a weekend at Camp David, also warned Saddam that he would be held “directly responsible for any terrorist action” in response to the U.S.-led forces arrayed against him. Speaking just minutes after Congress voted to give him the authority to go to war after Tues- day, Mr. Bush held out little hope that Mr. Perez de Cuellar would be able to defuse the crisis when he meets with Saddam today. Iraqi leaders were equally pessimistic and defiant. “Kuwait is the 19th province of Traq. There can be no compro- mise on that,” said Information Minister Latif Nassif Jassem. Shortly before Mr. Perez de Cuellar arrived in Baghdad, Iraq’s state-run media an- nounced that Saddam’s rubber- stamp Parliament would meet in emergency session Monday, the day before the deadline. There was no indication of what would be discussed. Before departing Amman, Jordan, for Baghdad, the U.N. secretary-general vowed to ne- gotiate with an open mind and good will. But his discussions must be held within the confines of 12 U.N. Security Council reso- lutions that denounce Iraq’s in- vasion and demand withdrawal. Meanwhile, the final six U.S. Embassy workers in Baghdad flew to Frankfurt, Germany, tak- ing with them diplomats from other nations who also were evacuating. Within hours, Baghdad’s am- bassador to Washington, Mo- hamed Mashat, was summoned to the State Department and told he must reduce his diplomatic staff to four by Tuesday. This is necessary, a State Department statement said, “to reduce Iraq’s capability to orchestrate terror- ternational conference to deal. with other regional issues, most” importantly the Israeli occupa- tion of Arab territory. Saddam has tried to link Is- raeli withdrawal from Palestin- ian lands to Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, but the United States adamantly has refused to accept any connection, On Saturday in Cairo, U.S. Secretary of State James A.

Secretary-Gen- eral Javier Perez de Cuellar left his talks in Baghdad saying “only God knows” whether there will ‘be a military conflict. After more than two hours of talks with Iraqi President Sad- dam Hussein, the U.N. envoy de- parted Baghdad refusing to an- swer substantive questions or characterize the tone of the nego- tiations. “That is a question almost im- possible to answer. It is some- thing ... only God knows,” Mr. Perez de Cuellar said when asked whether there would be war or peace.

His eleventh-hour meetings with Iraqi leaders came just two days before the Tuesday dead- line the U.N. Security Council has placed on Iraq to withdraw its. troops from Kuwait or face possible military action. Replying to a plea from Syri- van President Hafez Assad to withdraw his troops from Ku- -wait, Saddam called on Syria to join him in battling the Western- ‘dominated alliance opposing Iraq. Syria is a partner in that al- _liance, having committed nearly ~'20,000 soldiers to the 600,000- ng allied force lined’ up ‘against Iraq. .Saddam said Kuwait would become the great battlefield be- tween true Muslim believers and the the interloping infidels.

But Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens vowed that his country would respond if at- tacked. “We are prepared to de- fend ourselves and will give a good account of ourselves,” he told reporters. Still, foreigners crammed into Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv on Sunday, trying to board flights out of the region. The U.S. State Department on Friday had warned Americans to leave. Exactly what happened in the Baghdad talks remained a mys- tery, with Mr. Perez de Cuellar divulging little and the Iraqi leadership saying even less. The U.N. leader met for about three hours with Iraqi Foreign Minis- ter Tariq Aziz before his session with Saddam. The Iraqi president kept Mr. Perez de Cuellar waiting for more than six hours Sunday be- fore he ushered him into the presidential chambers for talks. Earlier in the day, Mr. Perez de Cuellar met with former Nica- raguan President Daniel Ortega, who was in Baghdad on a peace mission, and with Palestine Lib- eration Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat. In a press conference, Mr. Arafat said he believed there re- mains a chance for peace but that Mr. Perez de Cuellar would need more than 24 or 48 hours to work out the right formula. Mr. Arafat said a door remains open for peace, but that the start of war would unleash violence through- out the region. In Turkey, Secretary of State James A. Baker III made another stop on his trip to shore up the anti-Iraqi alliance. He did not comment on his discussions with Turkish leaders, but it was wide- ly believed that Mr. Baker was asking Turkey for permission to use an air base at Incerlik to de- ploy fighter planes for possible use against Iraq. U.S. Ambassador Mort Abramowitz did not comment ex- plicitly on Mr. Baker’s talks in Turkey, but said the secretary had “very satisfactory” meetings.

They portray themselves as crafts- men. They say matter-of-factly ,that they are getting ready to » begin what could be a fatal en- counter with war. : The phrase ‘do our job” Pops up over and over. But few realize how much ‘our job” varies from one soldier to an- other. They are not all trigger- pullers. b A daily grind : Army Staff Sgt. Norman Caldwell, 47, who lives in Fort Hood, Tex., pulled triggers for ‘a living in Vietnam.

As the last gasps of diploma- cy sounded this past week when Secretary of State James A. Baker III was engaged in meet- — ings to avert a war, Sergeant Caldwell said he hoped Mr. Baker ‘‘doesn’t get pushed around.’’ Still, he says senior non- coms like himself wouldn’t mind pulling out without war “as long as we don’t feel we turned around and ran.’’ A ne- gotiated deal would be OK ‘‘as long as we feel it gives respect to the soldier.’’ He says the military should have moved faster to get ready for Jan. 15. ‘‘We are not as ready as we should be.

So the Air Force sent her back to study weather fore- casting at Florida State Univer- sity. - The photos flow into her windowless office over a high- security military fax machine, where she prepares weather briefings for pilots. Every six hours, she also gives an update to the teams that keep track of when the atmospheric condi- tions would favor an Iraqi chemical attack. What could interfere with a U.S. attack is a big cold front developing over the Mediterra- nean, she said. It could sweep south over Baghdad, causing higher and higher winds as it drifted over the desert toward Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The winds could kick up dust clouds that could make everything, in- cluding flight operations, more dangerous. If these winds from the north are strong enough, they could prompt a ‘‘shemal’’ sandstorm that could cause zero visibility everywhere in eastern Saudi Arabia. She keeps her predictions up to the minute by talking on the radio to F-15 pilots, who re-. port from the sky on cloud pat- terns and temperatures.

He said: “*‘From the forward edge of the battle area to the battalion aid station, there should not be too much of a problem.

        "ocr_text": "As war looms, pilot makes peace with death By Joseph Albright Joumal-Constitution correspondent EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA — Now that the air battle seemed to be drawing nigh, jet pilot Lt. Col. Don Kline needed some “pri- vate time” to sort out his thoughts about dying. He had checked all his paperwork as commander of his F-15 squadron. He had watched some of the young lieutenants and captains playing cards in the ready bunker. He stopped to say hello to the pilots who were writing last letters to their wives. Then Lieutenant Colonel Kline, 42, of Dallas walked away from the other pilots. The squadron commander strolled outside the bunker, past the line of combat-loaded F- 15s, and stood alone under the ink called night. That was Monday night. By Tuesday morning, Lieutenant Colonel Kline said, he had gotten his mind straight. It was the last guaranteed day of peace. “Your quiet time is mainly dealing with your mortality,” Lieutenant Colonel Kline said in an interview. He sat in the equipment room where fighter pilots hang their green- ‘gray survival vests. “You make sure you got yourself straight with whatever you can get yourself straight with, however you view it, your God or what- ever. Get yourself straight with everyone else you can. Then you’ve got to go to it.” There wasn’t a place in Saudi Arabia where American fighting men and women were living closer to the margin than in the concrete blast shelters where members of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing from Langley, Va., were revving themselves up for combat. One of these pilots could shoot down five Iraqi fighters and become the only ace on ac- tive duty in the U.S. Air Force. Another one may take a missile up the tailpipe, helping to make some Iraqi pilot an ace. Lieutenant Colonel Kline’s job, if Presi- dent Bush orders an attack, could well be to fly a “sweep” mission into Iraq or Kuwait. That would mean his covey of four F-15s would dart out ahead of bomb-laden attack planes, trying to open a furrow in the sky by shooting down any Iraqi jets in their path. The Americans would first rely on AIM-7 radar-guided Sparrow missiles, each of which can plant 86 pounds of explosives into a MiG from a range of more than 25 miles. If the Iraqis get closer than that, the Americans would rely on AIM-9 infrared- guided Sidewinder missiles — or, as a last re- sort, their short-range six-barrel cannons. The idea is to win a dogfight before the other pilot can spot the F-15 on his radar. “There are no rules in war,” Lieutenant Colonel Kline said. “The rules are gone. The game is over with.” On Monday night, Lieutenant Colonel Kline had given what he self-deprecatingly calls his “Do It for the Gipper” speech. He told the several dozen pilots under his com- mand that they had to get a little angry. Not so enraged, mind you, that they jerk back on the throttle and pull the wings off their F-15s, But they would fly better if they go out feeling just a little bit teed-off. The young pilots listened. When your squadron leader has flown 2,700 hours in the F-15 and is the most experienced F-15 pilot in the Air Force, it pays to listen. Capt. Steve Olds, 26, of Hampton Roads, © Va., got the message. “You've got to divorce yourselves from everything at home to get eager to do it,” he said, “You've got to get angry, to get angry at the son of a gun and what he has done to all those people in Kuwait.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 16, 1991 \f"

Down! Down!’’ As reporters stumbled out of their rooms into the hallways, they saw U.S. military officers running down flights of stairs to an old kitchen on the bottom floor that had been converted toa fallout shelter. We wondered if this was real- ly serious. But given the repeat- ed warnings about missiles and gas attacks, coupled with the fact that our hotel is next to the mas- sive Dhahran air base, we decid- ed to take no chances. We joined the parade down the stairs. We were ushered into a white-tiled room. A Saudi air raid marshal soon joined us and told the U.S. military officers there was a threat of poison gas. The journalists were also asked to put on their gas masks, which the reporters had either been is- sued in advance by the military or purchased themselves. There, for a seemingly end- less period, we sat. We were joined by the U.S. military offi- cers and British soldiers. Inter- _spersed were hotel employees. There we all sat, with our backs against the wall and our gas masks securely over our heads. A few troops wore flak jackets. Some of the Brits were best pre- pared, with full chemical suits. As we waited, someone Played a portable radio on which we could hear the U.S. Armed Forces Radio announcing that President Bush would soon be addressing the nation about the war that had just begun.

It is one sign of the difficult relations America will face in this region after the fighting is finished. Protesters tum violent Large demonstrations against the allied assault were reported in at least seven other Arab or Islamic states Thursday. In Tunisia, two people were reportedly killed and 16 injured when a car was driven into a crowd of protesters. In Yemen, which has backed Iraq since the crisis began, tens of thousands of people marched to the U.S., British, Egyptian and Syrian embassies in the capital of Sanaa. Large protest marches also took place in Sudan, Algeria, Pakistan, Mauritania and Morocco, The streets in Amman were so volatile Thursday that six foreign journalists were assaulted by mobs or individuals in three separate incidents, At least one Italian journalist required hospital treatment for a cracked rib. Jordan's Information Ministry strongly advised reporters not to leave their hotels “as their safety cannot be guaranteed,” Youth eager to sign up In downtown Amman Thursday, dozens of agitated young men waited outside a civil defense office to reactivate them- selves from reserve to active duty status in the army or to sign up for the Popular gi! bog “They think they're going to finish us with the first strike, but they instill in us more power and more prestige,” said Mo- hammad Kamal, 27, a civil engineer who was about to reactivate from reserves. “They have started the war, but we're going to finish it.” Such confident statements were heard throughout the city, in spite of news reports that the forces of Iraq’s President Saddam Hussein were being savaged by allied air strikes. Jordanians said they believed the news accounts were American propaganda. “Everybody will join (the fight). there is no chance for the Americans or for Europe to win. I think the countdown has started for them,” said another young man who re- fused to give his name, “Forget about the name,” he said, “We are all Arab, We are one people, one family, one nation.” Despite the criticism of the allied at- tack, there was no hint that Jordan was about to abandon its neutral stance in favor of aiding Iraq's defense.

Steve Tate, 28, of Watersmeet, Mich., “It contin- ued to burn all the way to the ground and then just blew up into a thousand pieces.” Giving the first report of a dogfight in Operation Desert Storm, Tate said a single Sparrow air-to-air missile from his F-15 hit the Iraqi fighter around 3:15 a.m., Baghdad time, yesterday. He and other of- ficers at the airbase said they believed it was a French-made Mirage F-1. It may have been the first air-to-air hit, of the war, in which many pilots reported that they saw no Iraqi planes in the air. Tate said he didn’t see anyone bail out: “It was night.” Tate led a flight of four F-15s escorting bombers to Baghdad, and was among the first pilots to reach the iraqi capital. He described the scene slightly northeast of Baghdad as “like a huge blanket of Christ- mas lights. It was just sparkling all over.” “The entire city was just sparkling at us,” Tate said. “With them shooting triple A [antiaircraft artillery) at us, you saw the concussions going off, the bombs going off, some fires.” Tate and his companions learned Wednesday afternoon from Col, John Broom, Ist Tactical Fighter Wing com- mander, that they would be in the first wave of air attacks in Operation Desert Storm. Tate's flight took off from this airbase in Eastern Saudi Arabia at 1:30 a.m. yes- terday, knowing that drills had ended and that they were flying their first combat mission. Tate's four-plane flight was on a “sweep” mission several minutes ahead of his ~fackaee, the bombers heading to- ward targets deep inside Iraq. After in- flight refueling, the fighters arrived on the outskirts of Baghdad about an hour and a half after take-off.

It’s pretty exciting,” he said. Tate landed at his home airbase at 5:30 a.m., refueled and taxied to a stop, with maintenance crew members cheering him along the way. “T feel good.

Should Israel respond by overflying Jordan with bombers headed toward Iraq, Jordan almost ' certainly would feel compelled to ' strike at the air space violators and become embroiled in the conflict. |” In Tunis, Tunisia, people danced * in the streets upon hearing the- news, and buoyant demonstrations - were held in Algeria and Yemen. between Isra-_ Egypt held no open demonstra- tions of delight over the assault on Israel. Egypt is the only Arab na- tion that has signed a peace treaty with Israel and is viewed as a more solid partner in the anti-Iraq alli- ance. In fact, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, Abdel El-Reedy, said Friday in Washington that his country would remain in the anti- Iraq coalition even if Israel retali-- ates against Iraq. “Our stand is very clear. Our position is very solid. We are part , of the coalition,” he said. But Syria’s information minis- ter, Mohammed Salman, said that “if Israel attacked Jordan and it. was the first to launch the attack, or if it attacked Iraq in the same way, Syria would stand with any’ Arab country subjected to aggres~’ sion.” In Amman, there was no large- ° scale public celebration at the Fri- ° day noon prayers in the mosques, ' but much of the country’s majority © Palestinian population was elated.

As the battery commander, it was Spangler’s job to make a split-sec- ond decision on whether to over- ride the computer and cancel the launch. It was something a com- mander would be expected to do if aor was reason to suspect a false alarm. _ Spangler decided the blip on the monitor was a real Scud. And he was right.

Paul Johnson, 32, the A-10 Thunderbolt II pilot from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, wing. A “Sandy Mission” is Viet- nam-era slang for a search and rescue operation. For the A-10 Thunderbolts, stubby, ugly little green jets known as “Wart eas” or “tank killers,” it ord an anachronistic mission. The A-10, able to carry every- thing from \"cluster bombs to de- leted uranium bullets, is a deadly unter, a pure offensive aircraft. But Johnson said he and Goff are among several A-10 pilots in his squadron trained specifically in search and rescue operations, able to work with different kinds of air- craft from different services in a coordinated, complex and often dangerous operation. The pair scrambled into the air and headed north, radioing ahead to arrange in- -flight refueling and advise helicopters in the area to be alert for a pickup.

The pilot’s name was not released. kesmen said the Navy pilot ha ee after being hit by ground fire and had parachuted into a featureless stretch of Iraqi desert. In such circumstances, a spokes- man explained, a downed pilot has flares, smoke grenades and a small radio to help him communicate with rescuers. It wasn’t until midday that the two A-10 pilots, talking with the downed pilot by radio, finally located where the plane had fallen. Then came the painstaking pro- cess of lining up a rescue helicop- ter and bringing it deep into Iraqi territory. The idea, said Johnson, is to get “all the key players in place,” then “go in and pick up the survivor Air Force s Minutes before the rescue hel- icopter flew in , a large Iraqi truck drove up a dirt road, apparently headed straight for the rescue site. The two Thunderbolts dived down and blasted it with their 30 mm Gatling guns, setting it afire. “Unfortunately the truck was in the wrong place at the wrong time,” said Goff, 26, of Jackson, Ohio. “We couldn’t afford to have him be there.” Johnson, of Dresden, Tenn., who was a preacher before joining the Air Force, said with some re- job, Goff had to fly over the downed ilot, never actually secing him, ut talking with him to get his help in arranging the least er- ous possible rescue. “M heart was pum pretty quickly,” Goff said. “ me Peal exciting, the fact that you hin the guy is going to get f rescued, My mind was just rushing.” By midday, Goff said, everything was in place.

Some said they have not bathed since war broke out in before dawn Thursday, and others told of eating only canned food for days. “We die four times every night,” said Egyptian evacuee Said Ali Mohammad. Several described their neighborhoods as abandoned, the city of Baghdad as a ghost town. Iraqis have fled to the, . countryside, and the exodus of RUWEISHED, Jordan Harried evacuees arriving Tues- day from Iraq and Kuwait de- scribed flashpoints of disaster where corpses lie in Baghdad streets, buildings are collapsed in rubble and food and water are increasingly scarce. “People are- dying in the street. I saw corpses in the street,” said Majid Mohammad, an Egyptian car mechanic. “We took some wounded and dead to the hospital. There were many children, 5- and 6-year-old kids.” Everyone interviewed at this border crossing and a nearby transit camp said water and elec- tricity are critical problems. But their varied accounts of damage and injury suggest that some parts of Iraq are suffering dra- matically, while others escaped serious damage from five days of heavy allied bombardment. The range of conditions was reflected in the state of refugees fleeing to what they hope will be safer ground. Some were calmly rational, while others wept, ap- peared dazed and confused or were emotionally agitated and angry. They spoke of nightly trips to bomb shelters — when there was others is beginning. More than 2,000 went through Jordan’s bor- der crossing Monday, the highest number since war began. Zuhair Adib, a Palestinian who works for the National Oil Co. of Kuwait, said there had been no work in Kuwait City for days and that people were afraid to leave their houses under daily air strikes. Mr. Adib, a bulky man who worked at lashing a precarious load of luggage and cartons to the top of his big jeep in the cold, sunny desert morning, stopped and fell silent when asked about food supplies. He began weeping as he spoke. “There is no bread,” he said quietly as tears fell down his cheeks. “If you have flour at home you can bake. There are no bakeries. They are closed down.” Nor is there meat. Before the air strikes started, he used to cross from occupied Kuwait to the Iraqi city of Basra to buy food and fresh vegetables, Mr. Adib said. No longer. “If you have something at home, you will eat. Otherwise, it is nothing.” His children Sat in the Cé [ played on the pavement, but Mr. Adib’s wife showed the split be- tween Arab people who are will- ing to talk of disaster befalling Iraq and Kuwait and those who maintain a brave front of invul- nerability. “We have all that we need!” she screamed to counter her hus- band’s emotional response. “The Arabs have what they want. God will give us victory [over] the people of the West coming to kill us now.” Despite the reports of devas- tation and death, Iraq on Tues- day claimed that the number of casualties from the bombing was relatively small. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Tuesday, Iraq’s U.N. envoy, Abdul Amir Anbari, said 41 Iraqis had been killed and 191 wounded from the U.S.-led attacks Thursday through Tuesday. These includ- ed eight dead and 46 wounded in Baghdad, the letter said. Many evacuees said they did not see casualties or extensive ci- vilian damage, but enough re- ports of victims filtered over the border to confirm that pockets of devastation dot the country. “Wounded and dead were on the street,” said Muthar Abu Ah- med, an Iraqi taxi driver. “We weren't expecting this.” \" He described a congested residential area where three bombs seemed to have damaged houses, including one that col- lapsed over the entire family. He said seven or eight people were Student Abdel Khalim Amer from the town of Irbil said he helped remove women and chil- dren from the rubble of a bomb- ing target.

Some of the wounds were critical,” he said, mentioning pa- tients from a house that col- lapsed on them in the Karada section of Baghdad. “Their bones were broken.” . Among the evacuees Tuesday were about two dozen activists who had been in Iraq to populate a peace camp set up in the desert near the border with Saudi Ara- bia. The group left the camp be- fore the war began, but 50 others, including 14 Americans, were reported to have left only two days ago and to still be some- where en route to Baghdad. “Definitely yesterday there were some ruins,” said Joseph Parsons, 27, of Philadelphia, who said some of the group toured part of the city Monday. “We had to be very careful we weren't seen because we’re Westerners.” He said he did not see any casu- alties, only collapsed buildings. He said he felt it important to leave Iraq now partly because of the worsening food and water sit- uation. “The more people we get out, the more: is left for Kyaqis,” he said. prod r Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 23, 1991 \f"

Fhe move is expected to slow the exit of refugees from Iraq to a trickle, making departure pos- sible only for those who have stockpiled fuel. IRAQI PROBLEMS “The movement of refugees into Jordan, however, may be a moot point. Jordanian officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Iraqi officials had closed the border from their side at midnight without formal notification. Interior Ministry Undersec- retary Salameh Hammad said 7,336 people passed into Jordan through the city of Ruweished, an immigration station SO miles from the border with Iraq, be- tween midnight Tuesday and moon Wednesday. They appar- ently were people who had crossed through Iraq’s border post shortly before the closure and spent the night at camps en route to Ruweished. That number was nearly three times greater than on any other day since the U.S.-led co- alition launched its attack on Iraq. A police official, who could mot be named under Jordanian regulations, said Iraqi officials told him of casualties from an al- lied bombing iO miles inside Iraq from the Jordanian border. A Jordanian who crossed the border shortly before midnight: with his wife and five children told the AP that he was the last to do so. ““There were about 420 or SO other cars waiting in line behind me at the Iraqi border post, in- cluding some friends with whom we were traveling in convoy, but they have not been allowed to cross,’”’ said the man, who asked mot to be identified. <“There must be about 3, ooo to 5,000 people waiting to cross,”’”’ he said.

By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent - WITH THE AIR FORCE, Saudi Arabia — The war had kicked off 12 hours before, and now the seven journalists in Combat Correspondents Pool 5 were out on the tarmac, wait-. ing their chance to see the firm-jawed wing commander who was just back from Iraq. The military was giving us a glimpse ofa successful, confi- dent warrior telling us that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein didn’t have a chance of win- ning. This theme would become part of a pattern of what the military is allowing the media to cover. Over the first seven days of the war, we of Pool 5 would talk with dozens of other con- fident warriors. But not once were we introduced to an air- man who thinks war is no picnic. So far, critiques of the me- dia’s war coverage have usually zeroed in on the guidelines that require that all film and dis- patches be cleared befo publication. . But, in practice, the sys- tem of prior review has not put much of a damper on the news so far. The realcurbon . coverage has been the mili- tary’s control of what journalists ee. 7 This week, we have had access to two of the iargest U.S.- run air bases, fro hich scores of pilots have flown hun- GROUND RULES dreds of missions over Ku- wait and Iraq. ‘Reading back over the first week of our pool dispatch- es, I am struck by how many of our stories have tended to make war look nicer than it really is. The biggest stories. we were allowed to cover were all “positive” from the military’s. perspective: @ An interview with the first Air Force pilot who shot down an Iraqi plane. @ The rescue of a downed Navy pilot by two Air Force fighter pilots and a helicopter deep inside Iraq. | w Interviews with the first Patriot missile crew after it knocked down the first in- coming Iraqi Scud missile. We members of Combat Pool 5 have lobbied daily with the military’s Joint Informa- tion Bureau to get other assign- ments. That is all we can do — ask. And most of the time our re- quests haven’t been granted. Yet it is also clear that our presence has given the public some candor that it would never get if the press had to get all its information from spokesmen at podiums. Our interview with Air Force Col. John McBroom was the first one in which a senior battle commander expressed puzzlement about why the Iraqis weren’t joining the fight. “It could mean that they want to wait us out,’’ Colonel McBroom said six days be- fore any Pentagon\\official was named as saying that. © Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 24, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "The Associated Press Female troop 9s dodge Scuds Non-combat role doesn’t take them out of harm’s way “ By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent WITH THE AIR FORCE, Saudi Arabia — For Sandra Folino, going to war has meant learning how to sound calm as she tells the men and women who work for her that Scud missiles are plummeting toward the runway where they service F-15 fighters. ' ““«They ‘can’t see you shaking while you put on your gear,” she said Thursday. “Just as long as you can holler and let everyone know it is ‘Condition Red’ and everyone is moving toward the shelter, then you have done what you have to do.” While the males in the front lines are still waiting for their war to start, Sergeant Folino, 34, of Dayton, Ohio, is already lead- ing troops in what could be described as combat. 6 percent of U.S. force is female Throughout the war zone, she is one of thousands of female troops who have al- ready had to face Iraq’s Scud attacks. And she is one of an estimated 28,000 American women who now find themselves at war. They make up about 6._percent of the total U.S. force of 475,000 personnel. Although U.S. military policy bars women from serving on warships, attack planes or in ground combat units, women are serving in support units attached to combat forces. ; . Sergeant Folino joined the Air Force to tinker with jets, but she never figured it would be in Saudi Arabia. ‘‘When I finished school,” she said, “jobs in Dayton were kind of maxed out, and I had scored high in mechanics. Also, I always tinkered with my ___WOMEN WARRIORS brothers on cars. And so I said if I like cars, I'd like jets.” Nearly every day, the air ‘base where she works is targeted by at least one Lraqi missile. Protecting crew is part of job One of her jobs is to make sure all 15 mechanics in her crew — 12 men and three women — get the word within seconds ofa missile alert. As the senior jet mechanic for four F-15s, Sergeant Felino is the only one in the maintenance crew with a walkie- talkie strapped to her belt. What scares her most now is terrorism and what she might have to do to stop it. Since she is the crew’s senior mechanic, she is assigned one of its few M-16 rifles. If a terrorist attacked the base, Sergeant Fo- lino would be the last line of defense for her four. F-15s. Some male subordinates have asked her if she could really pull the trigger. “I can sit here and tell you that I can shoot someone,” she said. ‘But if the situa- tion came, I might freeze. That is one of the unknowns.” Women fill all kinds of roles Another soldier who has to project calm during the Scud attacks is vehicle dispatch- er Sgt. Lauren Long, 27, of Sandusky, Ohio. Her job during a ‘“‘Red Alert” is to put on her gas mask, then radio messages to a dozen air base trucks, directing them to any Scud crater to pick up wounded in case the Scud eludes the air defense system of Patfiot missiles. “You have to be very precise and speak loudly and clearly,” Sergeant Long said. “It’s kind of hard. Once you get the hang of it, people can understand you, as long as the planes aren’t going over and there aren’t any explosions.” Capt. Lisa Christian, the day shift oper- ations officer of a Security Police unit, has a broader turf. She commands more than 100 security policemen, all but a few_of them males. The 30-year-old:officer from East Lansing, Mich., said her job is pre- venting a terrorist attack. “Our enemy right now is the unknown,” she said. “‘So we are going to check every- - body, a lot, until we can positively identify them. We know where [Iraq’s President Saddam Hussein] is right now, but terror- ism is a big problem. We are not going to let him overcome us.” A forklift operator, Sgt. Carla Barbour- Clark, 30, of Madison, Va., said Saddam’s. “wake-up calls’ are still uncomfortable even though the Scud alerts are getting eas- ier. “Even now my heart stops every time,” she said. “That rush of adrenalin comes and there’s a moment of panic. My reaction is don my chem gear and if we see someone who is having trouble with theirs, we help them.” The Scuds have caused some troops to wonder whether they made a mistake in signing up for the military. Air Force Re- serve Technical Sgt. Deborah Knight, 26, of. Charleston, S.C., is one of them. “In civilian life, I work Monday through Friday,” she said. ‘‘I work in an office and I don’t have Scuds fired at me. I’m scared, oe of what’s going on here. I want to go iome.”” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - January 25, 1991 \f"

By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondent AMMAN, Jordan — Iraq, at- tempting to minimize allied claims of their first tangible vic- tory in the Persian Gulf war, said Friday that it already had with- drawn its forces from the Ku- waiti island the allies captured this week. Radio Baghdad also an- nounced that Iraq was stopping its televised interviews with cap- tured allied pilots. It gave no ex- planation for changing a policy that has drawn worldwide criti- cism and anger. The radio broadcast said Iraq wanted to “clarify” what hap- pened at the island of Qaruh, about 22 miles east of Kuwait, which British and American forces captured in a battle with Iraqi troops. Allied military spokesmen said 29 Iraqis were captured on the island after they fired on an allied helicopter embroiled in battle with nearby Iraqi ships.’ The island was among sever- al used as monitoring stations where units were only temporar- ily deployed, the radio said. “These units’ sole task is communication, or communica- tion and short-term engagement with the aim of hampering for- ward maritime forces,” Iraq COUNTERCLAIM Island of Qaruh Allies captured Thursd The Associated Press * said. It claimed the decision to withdraw its troops was “the re-: sult of military considerations and not of any alleged Victory”: by the enemy. \\ The decision to stop showing captured pilots on Iraqi televi- sion broadcasts was not ex- plained. Baghdad radio said the interviews would be resumed “‘at the appropriate time” but did not indicate when that might be.

A map of old Palestine — without Israel — hung on one wall. A symbol of the Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion was on another. Beaming down from behind the couch was a photo- graph of PLO leader Yasser Arafat. The politicized face of emotion reared up when Hamidi talked about American support for Israel and about the Arab territories it occupies. “With all my respect to you both as Americans,” she said, “we don’t hesi- tate to kill you or burn you, because we think Americans are the cause of all our problems.” She had similar sentiments about Israelis, promising over tea to slit the throat of any Jew she encounters if she ever gets back to occupied Jerusalem.

They must cross the center of a storm of violence. Flaming oil tankers and charred hulks of buses lit- ter the main route out of Iraq. Gaping craters — some 12 feet deep — pock the highway, swallowing cars of unwary drivers, Harried travelers who reached Jordan yesterday also told of near misses in air raids that have thun- dered over the road for days. One family described panicky stops to dash from their car and flatten them- selves beside the road till the bombers passed. “Only a crazy person would leave at this time,” said a Palestinian woman who declined to give her name. “It’s a risk. All the time you could see the rockets. We stopped and waited until everything became calm.” Her family was among an estimated 1,000 evacuees who made it across the Jordanian border yesterday. Many had run the gauntlet of allied bombing, only to find themselves stranded on the Iraqi side of the bor- der in bitter wind and rain until exit restrictions began easing Monday. One load of Indians survived a ride of nearly 600 miles, which began in Basra in southeastern Iraq, in an open truck that had no protection from the biting cold, rain and snow. “No food. No water, It was very, very cold,” said one of the Indian workers. They spoke of seeing beached on the roadside an oil tanker truck, three trailers and two buses that had been rocketed. While Indians, Yemenis, Lebanese and others were allowed across the border into Jordan, the Iraqis did not permit 500 Egyptians to leave yesterday, apparent- ly to punish them for the pro-U. S. policies of their president, Hosni Mubarak. A Sudanese journalist, who identified herself only as Mary, said the Egyptians waiting to cross “were not well treated.” “Always they were the last to get food,” she said. The account that most clearly dramatized the hazards of driving the last, dangerous leg of the trip out of Iraq came from Syrian Abdel Nasser Mansour, 33, who aban- doned his clothing shop in Kuwait. Mansour said he left Kuwait at 8:30 a.m. on Monday. He carried extra supplies of gasoline, so was spared the constant fuel searches that delayed many travelers hin- dered by gasoline rationing. And yet his trip to the Jordan bor- der, which normally took Mansour 11 hours, stretched into 18 hours this time, he said. Most of the extra hours were consumed in the largely deserted 75-mile stretch from the town of Rutbah to the Iraq-Jordani- an border. Mansour said he drove his white sedan at 100 miles an hour or faster over long segments of the trip. The real trouble began on the fi- nal leg of the journey. By the time he and a friend reached Rutbah, with only 75 miles left to travel, it was dark and the payloads from warplanes were rum- bling out of the sky. “I didn’t see it with my eyes, but I heard it, especially in Rutbah,” he said of the bombing. Easing down the road, which may be a target as a potential military air strip or route for mobile missile launchers, Mansour had to drive without headlights or risk being a moving target himself. Mansour drove a deadly route in the dark, avoiding other moving ve- hicles, the wrecks of more unlucky travelers, and two big trucks still burning from hits just taken before he passed. The condition of the road itself was the biggest hazard. At least five times, Mansour said, he had to backtrack when finding the passage blocked by buckled pavement or ASSOCIATED PRESS A family of Palestinians who survived the trip to the Iraqi border reacted In despair after finding themselves fouled In ee te denied entrance to Jordan despite having Syrian travel papers.

        "ocr_text": "Jordan says allies aimed bombs at civilian cars on highway in [rag By Marcia Kunstel Cox News Service AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan on Wednesday accused the U.S.-led Persian Gulf alliance of deliberate- ly bombing civilian cars and tanker trucks on the main artery linking Iraq and Jordan, causing at least five deaths. “The brutal planes knew exactly what they were doing,” Foreign Minister Taher al-Masri told a ses- sion of the Jordanian Parliament. Masri said he had called in U.S. Ambassador Roger Harrison and the ambassadors of the four other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and de- livered “a strong protest.” The other council members are Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China. The United States has insisted its military has sought to limit ci- vilian casualties when attacking Iraq. The foreign minister said four Jordanians and an Egyptian had “been martyred” in the highway raids over the past two days, and nine oil tankers destroyed. Masri did not say how many ci- vilians had been injured while traveling the highway, but Jorda- nian television reported Wednes- day night that Jordan’s King Hussein had visited victims of the bombing being treated at the Al Hussein Medical Center. Evacuees fleeing Iraq in recent days have told of repeated allied attacks that have left the highway in tatters between the Jordanian border and the Iraqi town of Rut- bah, about 75 miles inside Iraq. Allied sources said that highway has been the target of intensive bombing by aircraft trying to de- stroy military bases and mobile launchers used for firing Scud mis- siles at Israel. Since the war began Jan. 17, the road mostly has been traveled by evacuees coming out of Iraq and by Jordanian oil tanker trucks going into Iraq empty and returning filled with oil. Despite the embargo against trade with Iraq, Jordan has been allowed to continue receiving oil from Iraq. Austin American-Statesman - January 31, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Saudis help rescue 24 Marines Joseph Albright Cox News Service NEAR KHAFYJI, Saudi Arabia — Under cover of a Saudi tank attack, some 24 U.S. Marine scouts broke through a ring of Iraq tanks near here today and drove to safety about 36 hours after their front- line positions were overrun. “They got out, they got out,” said a voice on a backpack radio at the forwardmost Marine battalion headquarters. Minutés later, cor- respondents saw the first 12-man Marine team barreling up the two- lane road from Khafji, jammed into the back of one jeep-like Hum- vee four-wheel vehicle. One of the dirty, tired-looking Marines told his buddies that for a good part of the last day and a half, he was pinned down by machine gun fire: “I was making out a re- port, and all of a sudden the 50 caliber came in. I heard boom, boom, boom.” Later in the day, the Iraqi ar- mored unit which occupied Khafji for more than a day eventually left with the help of a rescue column from Kuwait, Brig. Gen. Pat Ste- vene TV id jeter is ivadh, He said they were driven out of Khafji by troops from Saudi Arabia and Qatar who had support from Ma- rines in Cobra helicopters and captured at least 160 Iraqis. In Baghdad, however, the Iraqi information office told foreign re- porters that its troops still held the coastal town in northeastern Saudi Arabia, 12 miles south of its border with Kuwait. Stevens said fighting continued in the afternoon, but it was north _ of Khaffji. The U.S. Army general also re- ported that a search was under way for two American soldiers — one of them a woman — who ac- cording to an “initial” report dis- appeared “on a_ transportation mission” that had nothing to do with fighting “in Khafji or else- where.” The Iraqis had previously con- tended in Baghdad that they had captured an unspecified number of allied soldiers, including male and female Americans, in the town: South of Khafji, an hour after re- porters saw Marines break out of a circle of Iraqi tanks, a column of Qatari tanks was seen rumbling north on the road, preparing for another assault on the approxi- mately 50 Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers that invaded and held the northernmost Iraqi oil town in the first ground battle of the war. Earlier, Marines fired heavy ar- tillery into Khafji around dgwn Thursday, and they were later told by their commanders that they had knocked out 17 Iraqi tanks and ar- mored personnel carriers. In Riyadh, Stevens said “no Ma- rine ground units were engaged in Khafji” itself, and the official ‘“vic- tory” announcement of the liber- ation of Khafji was issued by the Saudi government. In Baghdad, a contradictory Ira- qi “victory” announcement said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein personally planned the three- pronged assault that included the raid on Khafji, and reported that “the corpses of American soldiers are littering the battlefield” out- side the town. Marines in the front-line posi- tions remained concerned about a much larger Iraqi buildup report- ed to be about 60,0000 troops north of the border, near Kuwait’s Wafra oil field — about 30 miles west and 15 miles north of Khafiji. It was near the border area where a revised casualty count is- sued by the U.S. military. said 11 Marines died in ground combat Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Officers said air strikes have been ordered against the Iraq troop concentration, said by some sources to be as much as five to sia Iraqi armored divisions. American officers continued te argue that the brief Iraqi takeovei of Khafji was insignificant because it was not a military target. But some officers acknowledged thal Saddam may well derive political and psychological benefits from having bloodied the American ground forces and grabbed a Saudi city. “How could this happen?” asked Marine Lt. Col. John Garrett, in a rhetorical aside while waiting for the 24 Marine scouts to be rescued. “It is a great political victory — ¢ month from now you may say ‘Sc “It is a great political victory — a month from now you may say ‘So what.’ It (the temporary loss of Khafji) may be a risk we were pre- pared to take, I don’t know.” . ‘Marines said the Saudi armored. forces abandoned one counterat- tack around midnight Wednesday, in part because their troops came under “friendly fire” from Qatari tanks rushing to back them up.

The two American scout teams were apparently trapped in or near Khafji from the first hours of the Iraqi takeover. Marines on the outskirts of town could hear them on tactical radios and arranged for heavy covering fire by the Saudi tanks to facilitate their escape, From a sandy hillock five miles outside Khafji, correspondents could see occasional U.S. Cobra antitank helicopters whizzing in toward the center of town. ; Grand Junction Daily Sentinel - January 31, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Confusion an emeny in Khafji Snags in communication, friendly fire stalled fight By Joseph Albright COX NEWS SERVICE OUTSIDE KHAFJI, Saudi Ara- bia — In the end, the United ‘States and its allies won The Bat- tle of Khafji. But not until after 36 hours of helter-skelter confusion that at one point saw the Saudi tanks careening in a chaotic mid- night retreat because brother Azab forces were accidentally blasting their position. You have to hand it to Saddam: the Iraqi tanks clearly caught the American-led alliance unprepared. After rumbling into this northern- most Saudi oil hamlet Tuesday night, they managed to keep fight- ing inside the town for long enough to claim victory in the first ground combat of the war. Then an Iraqi relief column fought in from the north and successfully extracted some Iraqis still holding out inside Khafii. “It could be a great political:vic- _. tory,” acknowledged the U.S. Ma- rines artillery commander, Lt. Col. John Garrett, who helped the Sau- dis pound the Iraqi tank invaders into retreating back into Kuwait. “If what he wants to do is convince everyone on his side of his man- hood, look, there is the evidence that he did it.” Besides exposing some of the vulnerabilities of the alliance’s complex multinational command setup, the Battle of Khafji also pro- vided a telling bit of evidence of how truth can be tailored at official military briefings to present a posi- tive spin on how the allies performed. Correspondents visiting two for- ward Marine outposts without military escort Thursday got an unvarnished account of the battle that did not always comport with the version offered up at the daily military briefing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. From the opening moments of the Iraqi raid into Khafji, the Unit- ed States and its allies were in hot- ter water than they disclosed at the time. The reason was that two ~Six-man Marine reconnaissance teams were stuck in the middle of » Khafji while the Iraqi tanks were shooting all around them. With the Marine scouts pinned down in buildings by 50 caliber machine gun fire, the allied com- manders on the scene decided they could not afford merely to surround the Iraqis and await their surrender. They had to go on the attack — even if that meant destroying mil- lions of dollars worth of recently constructed office buildings and homes in and around the Port of Khafji. After dark Wednesday, the Sau- dis — accompanied by an Ameri- can military adviser — decided to mount an Arab counterattack to help relieve pressure on the stranded American Marine scouts. The Saudi tanks were to take the lead. Their allies from the neighboring Persian Gulf country of Qatar were supposed to provide covering fire from their tanks. The trouble was the Qataris didn’t know exactly where the “Saudis were heading. This was a formula for failure. “Some Saudi units moved in there at night,” said Marine Capt. Kevin Monahan of Redwood City, Calif. “Obviously this was their -first attack, the first fire fight of the _ war. It was at night and there was ' some friendly fire.” The Saudis had punched their way back into the fringes of Khafji by late Wednesday, at which time they started taking “incoming” ‘from their own allies. The Saudi commanders ordered an immedi- ‘ate retreat that left the Iraqis in | full control overnight of the center of Khafii. * By the account of several U.S. Marine officers who spent the night outside Khafji, the ‘friendly fire’? came from the Qatari ar- mored unit assigned to protect the Saudis from the rear. Though it is officially known as the army of Qa- tar, some of its front line troops said they are contract soldiers from Pakistan, India or Somalia. It is unknown whether any Sau- dis were killed by the “friendly fire,’ but British prime minister John Major told reporters in Lon- don that Saudi losses in the Khafji fighting have been fairly heavy. Peter Dejong, an Associated Press photographer, told of driv- ing into Khafji on the heels of a Saudi convoy. Suddenly the Sau- dis pivoted straight toward him and began rumbling back out of town. “The Saudis pulled back real fast,” Dejong said. “They started firing out at random. We got out of there.” Reason to attack Marine battalion commander Lt. Col. John Garrett said the whole Saudi-Qatari attack was a direct result of the two U.S. scout teams stranded since the first day of the Iraqi attack. “As far as I am concerned, the decisive reason for the Saudis making the (first) attack was be- cause those two teams were there,” said Garrett, 43, com- mander of the Third Battalion of the Third Marines from Hawaii. Col. John Admire, who oversees the reconnaissance units, said they had been in Khafji on a rou- tine intelligence-gathering mission when Iraqi troops and tanks rolled in late Tuesday. Admire said the reconnaissance teams initially stayed in town on their own voli- tion to transmit by radio informa- tion on the Iraqi troops back to al- lied forces. “By the time they determined that they were sur- rounded (by the Iraqis) it was too re to pull out, the Marine officer Another rescue attempt With the first Saudi attack a fail- ure, and the Marines still stuck in the town, allied front-line com- manders met in the dark outside Khafji to plan another rescue at- tempt before the American scouts could be taken prisoner. One planning session under the sky yielded a warning to forward- deployed Marine units that the Iraqis might be pushing south with many more tanks. Col. Gar- rett recalled: ‘‘All the Saudis were there and everyone was figuring out everyone’s language when all of a sudden there was an order that we should go to MOPP Level Two (an alert status).... We were putting on these (chemical) suits like the Michelin Man and having to do all this (prepare for battle) at the same time.” Hitting targets One consequence of the failed Saudi attack is that U.S. Marines got an assignment from the Saudis to lay howitzer shells on the Iraqi tanks. Around dawn, the Marines out- side Khafji fired a salvo of eight heavy artillery shells at Iraqi tank positions. “It was highly accu- rate,” said Capt. Monahan, who commands part of the front-line Marine artillery. “It was hitting targets. Since it was working, we were called on to fire another salvo.” Forward spotters later told Monahan’s unit that it had played a big part in destroying 17 Iraqi tanks during the Battle of Khafiji. However, when the daily U.S. briefers in Riyadh told the story, they omitted all mention of the role of American ground troops in retaking the port town. “No Marine ground units were involved,” Brig. Gen. Pat Stevens told reporters. Pressed on the question, he added: “We were not engaged. U.S. forces were not en- gaged in that action.” 36 long hours The 12 Marines were subse- quently rescued. Once safe, they told of a harrowing 36 hours in which they hid in buildings and called in allied artillery strikes to drive off the Iraqis when they got too close. In two instances, Iraqis entered the ground floors of buildings where the men were hiding. “The Marines could hear the footsteps. They could hear them enter — and then leave,” Admire said, adding that the soldiers had burned secret codes and messages to protect themselves, and used coded radio messages to signal their locations and call in U.S. strikes. Compared to the snafus sur- rounding the first Saudi attack, the second Saudi attack in day- light Thursday found the Saudis, Qataris and Americans cooperat- ing with few difficulties. The earlier communications gaps had been filled, there was no “friendly fire,” and the coalition forces were finally able to evict the Iraqis. Col. Monahan said some confu- sion was probably inevitable, given that the Iraqis had managed to force the Saudis to fight a street battle. “It is just very difficult to take a city,’”’ said Monahan. “Combat in an urban terrain is one of the most difficult assignments.” Dayton Daily News - February 1, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Ceasefire talks begin in Iran By MARCIA KUNSTEL Cox News Service AMMAN, Jordan — Senior officials of Iraq and France are among a group that arrived in Iran on Thursday for what is viewed as the first significant effort to stop the increasingly bloody gulf war sitice hostilities broke out 15 days ago, “The delegations are to hold separate talks with high-ranking Iranian officials on ways to end the war,” the Iranian news agency IRNA said in a report monitored here. Iran, which so far has remained neutral in the war, has figured in some speculation re- cently as a possible peacemaker, if only to as- sure that its own troops do not get embroiled in the conflict. Heading the Iraqi delegation was Saddoun Hammadi, the minister of state for foreign af: fairs, who arrived in Tehran via Iran's western border city of Bakhtaran, apparently over land. In Iraq's first diplomatic foray since the war began, Hammadi carried a message from Presi- dent Saddam Hussein for President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran. . Francois Scheer, secretary general of the French Foreign Ministry, led the group from Paris, A Foreign Ministry statement issued late Thursday emphasized that Scheer would not meet directly with any Iraqi officials, The state- ment may have been intended to deflect oriti- cism that France is breaking from the alliance mounting war against Iraq to enforce United Nations sanctions, Foreign Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali of Alge- ria and Yemen's deputy foreign minister also were expected in Tehran, The Algerians often have been quiet brokers of settlements to Mid: dle East crises, from hijackings to kidnappings. In this case Algeria and Yemen both have tilted toward Iraq’s side, although they have criti: cized Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. Saddam’s message to the Iranian president was described by Radio Baghdad as regarding relations between [ran and Iraq as affected by the war. It may relate to the Iraqi military planes that have swooped into the safety of Iranian air space without any explanation in recent days. Iran said it has allowed a dozen to land on its territory, while western sources say more then 100 Iraqi planes have landed or crashed on Ira- me soil, ran has said any aircraft landing from either side of the conflict would be impounded and not permitted to take off again, in keeping with Iran’s declared policy of neutrality. Rafsanjani, who has said getting involved in the war would be suicidal for Iran, has con- demned both sides in the battle. He has chas- tised Iraq for invading Kuwait and the allied forces for intervening in the region. But popular sentiment in Iran weighs emo- tionally against the American-led alliance, and fear that this sentiment could sweep Iran into the war is a strong incentive for Rafsanjani to work at arranging a cease-fire. Saddam has given no reason to believe he is ready to give up Kuwait and thus end the war, but the Arab delegates to the Tehran talks could argue that Iraq has accomplished enough to declare victory even if it loses Kuwait. Already, Iraq has stood up against the most: powerful nations of the world and survived, which has won Saddam respect throughout much of the Arab world. He has become the first Arab leader to land bombs inside Israel, which also elicited acclaim in the region, and his troops fought tenaciously in the first phase of a ground war that he initiated on his own terms at the Saudi town of Khafji. If the war ends soon, Saddam would emerge with the cream of his air force intact, a symbol of Iraq's continuing power. Santa Cruz (California) Sentinel - February 1, 1991 \f"

A Saudi officer on the scene said, “We have cleared 90 to 95 percent of the city. There are a few sharpshooters hiding in one building to the north of the city.” Their descriptions of last- ditch Iraqi resistance came one — day after the Saudi government reported total victory in the bat- tle for Khafji.

Another mile north, the Saudis set up their own tents, and some brought along their chickens. One Saudi officer said he drove through Khafji on Friday and counted 30 tanks that had been destroyed in the 36 hours of fighting. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 2, 1991 \f"

But don’t try to get U.S. Marine Cpl. Thomas Franco, 24, to buy that. “Tt wasn’t the Saudis,” said Corpo- ral Franco of Las Vegas, Nev. “We man- aged to get them out of there after they got stuck.

From all 7 accounts so far, the Battle of Khafji is one of those instances, + It is becoming clearer now that the American-led coalition came close to a humiliating defeat before the Iraqis * were forced to give up. In the toughest hours, a few Marines were the unsung heroes of the allied ef- fort. An artillery spotter, Cpl. Jeff Brown, 21, was one of them. On Tuesday night, the Iraqis at- tacked in four places along a 100-mile front, confusing the Americans and Saudis about their true intentions. Only one prong of the attack seemed to matter to Iraqi President Saddam ,z- Hussein. That was the easternmost |24eld the center of town and were ¢ thrust in which Iraqi tanks and ar- mored personnel carriers knifed south some 10 miles south from the Kuwaiti where before the war truckers + stopped to have coffee. _ Soldiers, Marines in trouble At the outset, two U.S. Army soldiers — a man and a woman — apparently fell into Iraqi hands when their truck took a wrong turn during the battle and’ rammed into a cinder block wall. When the allies recaptured the town two days later, they found the truck — but no sign of the soldiers. A dozen Marine artillery spotters spent 36 hours sur- ‘rounded by Iraqis who were so close to their hideout that the Marines could hear them laugh- ing and joking. Corporal Brown was one of the 12 Marine forward observers ‘who moved into Khafji before the invasion in order to watch from tall buildings as the Iraqis crossed the border. He and the others were stunned Tuesday evening as the Iraqi tanks suddenly rolled south under a full moon. The Marines reported what they saw to higher headquarters | and were given a choice about whether they wanted to leave. - ‘No, said Corporal Brown and his | teammates, they would stay in~ Khafji to call in artillery fire. “Artillery trained on town Corporal Brown’s team were thiding in a stairwell of an apart- “ment building when they saw aa helmets on the ground floor low. Thinking they were about ‘to be captured, team leader Cpl. Chuck Ingraham burned his per- sonal address book and other documents he considered sen- sitive. If the Saudis had managed to retake Khafji on their first try Wednesday night, the Marine spotters wouldn’t have been needed. But the Saudi night at- tack collapsed into a chaotic re- treat because their Arab allies | from Qatar were accidentally raining ‘friendly fire” on them. By dawn Thursday, the Iraqis Yaris at bay. That’s when Corporal “Brown’s spotter team inside the city started. calling in rounds from Corporal Franco’s how- itzer. Corporal Franco and his bud- ‘dies, five miles west of the spot- ter team, told how they waited all Wednesday night on a small ex- posed hill, waiting. They had been sent to the farthest-forward Marine position and now thought they wouldn’t get a chance to fight. ; Then, on Thursday morning, they got the order: “Gun Five Fire Mission, 8 Rounds HE.” It ‘was what Corporal Franco, an as- sistant gunner on a 15S mm how- ‘itzer, had been practicing for since the Marines sent him from Hawaii five months ago. One HE (high explosive) round stands as tall as Corporal Franco’s thigh. Each round is ‘packed with 88 exploding base- balls, each one capable of taking .out an armored personnel car- rier. ? He and his crew locked one _round into the breech. So did the gun crews on seven other howit- »zers in Charley Battery. On an of- /ficer’s command, they unloosed .@ thunderous salvo that rained exploding baseballs in the direc- tion of the Iraqi armored ve- hicles. Artillerymen usually figure that if they have a good forward observer and good communica- tions, they ought to be able to drop an artillery round down someone’s chimney at a range of 10 miles. All it takes is three rounds per target — two to adjust the .aim and the third to make the “hill. ” ‘It had to be done’ « That morning, the situation in ‘was so desperate that the take out 30 targets with a few rounds to spare. Charley Battery didn’t do quite that well. But when the hideouts that 17 tanks and ar- mored vehicles had been smoked. It was enough to change the tide of battle. Corporal Brown was wound- ed in the thigh by shrapnel from a U.S. artillery strike that he called in on an Iraqi vehicle right next to his position. “It had to be done,” Corporal Brown later told a pool correspondent.

This wasn't a dispute between the military and the media over numbers but over the whole interpretation of a battle and its outcome It's easy to understand the mili- tary’s reason for wanting the bad news to come out after we've won. CNN's 24- hour-a-day coverage tries to make his- tory of the most innocuous comment. There's an argument that Saddam Hussein could oil his own propaganda machine with stories like Mr. Al- bright’s that detail allied problems. Some “war correspondents” are over their heads in briefings — as their questions show — much less in battles. But the best reporters will always seek their own level of information, and the Pentagon's argument that unre- strained journalists will bother the troops is preposterous. A jammed M- 16 is bothersome; a question isn’t. Fighting the propaganda war may be part of the Persian Gulf campaign, but most Americans — especially those with sons or daughters on the front line — want to know what’s happening. Propaganda is for the enemy. Palm Beach Post February 3, 1991 The media’s war ‘facts’ The war in the Persian Gulf is being covered by the media in a way no other conflict involving the United States has. Never has “‘on-time’’ coverage of events been more possible, What bothers me about the cov- erage is what appears to be an insatiable demand on the part of TV and the news services to report the “unvarnished facts\" no matter what the conse- quences are to the war effort. Reporters get absolutely rude to the military in news confer- ences when they persistently de- mand to know and make public war facts that are declared sen- sitive to that effort. They have to have the sensational \"scoop\" on what went awry in battle or oth- er events conducted by the coali- tion. The prime example that moti- vated this letter is the story by Joseph Albright of Cox News Service in the Khafji battle, car- ried in front page headlines by The Indianapolis Star Feb. 1. It seems to me and many of my friends that the Persian Gulf conflict is being operated on three sides; The United States and allies, the madman Saddam Hussein, and the media with its demands to report it ‘as it really is.” Whose side are the media on? Obviously it's the dollars and cents side that they think will sell the most magazines or news- papers or time. The coverage of the battle for Khafji by Albright accomplished several things, all rale-building for his troops and people. It does a good job toward de- Letters The Star welcomes short, concise letters signed with name, address and telephone number, All are subject to editing.

And it shows that ‘making a buck\" is more important to the media with Albright’s “unvar- nished reporting’’ than support- ing the allied effort to defeat a despicable tyrant. It's disappointing that The Star or other major news media think that ridicule of our mili- tary during a time of war is in the best interests of our country. Battle victories and defeats should both be reported, but negative criticism is dead wrong. To report how confused and un- coordinated the allied forces were in a battle is of no value to America, We shouldn't have “head in the sand\" reporting. | only hope we limit our reporting of events in a fashion that does not pro- vide propaganda fodder for the likes of Saddam Hussein.

        "ocr_text": "pact also felt in Jordan By Marcia Kunstel Jourmal-Constitution correspondent AMMAN, Jordan — The Iraqi government on Tuesday an- nounced it was halting the sale of all petroleum products — from gasoline to heating oil to cooking gas — adding to the misery of a nation that already is enduring around-the-clock allied bombing attacks. ENERGY CRUNCH Se ——————————_—_—————————————— Baghdad Radio said that for “organizational purposes” the fuel sales are suspended “until further notice.”’ The decision is expected to severely impact the civilian pop- ulation and appears to be an ef- fort to reserve crucial petroleum supplies for military purposes. It comes at a time when winter temperatures in Baghdad have been dipping into the low 30s. Meanwhile, in neighboring Jordan, strict new measures to reduce oil consumption went into effect Tuesday. The Jordanian public over- whelmingly supports Irag in the war, and animosity toward the United States has steadily risen. On Tuesday, unidentified sabo- teurs set fire to a car belonging to a military attache at the U.S. Em- bassy while the vehicle was parked in an Amman neighbor- hood. There were no injuries. U.S. Ambassador Roger G. Harrison was called in Tuesday for the second time in less than a week to meet with Foreign Min- ister Taher Masri to explain al- lied bombing of Jordanian oil tankers traveling through Iraq. As*many as 31 Jordanian tankers and other vehicles have been destroyed by the bombi attacks, while six Jordanian ci- villians have been killed and about 20 others injured, accord- ing to updated figures released Tuesday by Information Minis- ter Ibrahim Izzedin. Mr. Izzedin, who described U.S.-Jordanian relations as worse than at any previous time, said Jordan wants clarifications of U.S. State Department charges. The United States al- leges that Jordanian tanker driv- ers travel in nighttime convoys with Iraqi military vehicles and even may carry military parts in the empty tankers they haul into Iraq. The tankers carry petro- leum out of Iraq, Jordan’s sole source. “We can deny categorically that our nationals involve them- - selves in any military activity,” Mr. Izzedin said at a news briefing. — Since the war began Jan. 17, _he said, trucking companies have warned their drivers to avoid convoy travel and not to drive at night. Some drivers interviewed, however, have said they some- . times inadvertently have to cross the sensitive final 75 miles to the Jordanian border at night, trav- .eling slowly and with lights out. A Jordanian purchasing team was in Syria on Tuesday trying to buy oil there to replace part of the losses from reduced tanker traffic in and out of Iraq. Mr: Iz- zedin said Jordan also will try to buy oil on the open market. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 6, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Slick may cut Saudi production Water desalination plants, fishing grounds threatened By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent SAFANIYA BASE CAMP, Saudi Arabia — Oil from slicks in the Persian Gulf began lap- ping ashore Wednesday near a critical Saudi petroleum processing plant, threatening to shut down the world’s largest offshore oil field. Three separate slicks, one of them the larg- est ever recorded, were once again moving southward in the gulf after being held back by southerly winds last week. The slicks were also reportedly threatening fishing grounds and wa-' ter desalination plants. An official of the giant Aramco oil company said the seashore at Safaniya, 50 miles south of — the Kuwait border and a few miles north of this — camp, was “all full of oil.” But company spokesman Joe Kenney said the huge Safaniya field off northern Saudi Ara- bia — one of the largest sources of oil used to make military jet fuel for Operation Desert Storm — continued in full operation. Oil was visible onshore near a seawater in- take lagoon that supplies a desalination plant needed to process oil from Safaniya. Segundo Fernandez, an operating superin- tendent for Aramco, said that if oil enters the water intake at Safaniya, the onshore process- ing plant would be crippled. “Tt would mess up the wash-water capabili- ty,” he said. “If we don’t have any wash water, we cannot desalt the crude and then we can’t handle it.” A company spokesman said crews of oil workers, flown in from India, are working around the clock to install multiple layers of floating plastic barriers to keep oil away from the intake lagoon. Offshore, a small fleet of ming boats, tried to suck up oil before it uld reach shore. OIL SPILLS At Tanajib, an Aramco site 10 miles south of Safaniya, two water birds flopped along the shore, their feathers so coated with black petro- leum that they couldn’t furl their wings. Anoth- er bird, its back glistening with oil, lay dead ona sand bar. “Look at the poor bird, look at the poor thing,” said Suleiman Abdulaziz Fasad, the maintenance director at the scene. “All of this comes from Saddam [Hussein]. This says a lot more than any words I could give you.” _ _ Workers lay booms to protect the water in- take of a mothballed processing plant that could _ be used if Safaniya is contaminated. The Safaniya field, the fourth-largest oil field in the world, can produce 1.5 million to 2 million barrels of oil a day — one-fourth the ca- pacity of all the oil wells in the United States. Two of the three big oil slicks in the Persian Gulf were started by Saddam’s forces. The biggest of the three slicks, released by _ Traqi forces from a Kuwaiti oil terminal, is esti- mated at about 460 million gallons of oil, the biggest in history. Asmaller oil spill was caused by Iraqi shell- ing of a Saudi refinery near the border town of Khafji. That spill earlier hit beaches and man- grove swamps between Khafji and the huge Saudi Arabian port of Jubail and was lapping at protective booms around a desalination plant, Saudi oil sources said. Officials have questioned Saudi assurances that booms will keep some of the crude oil's tox- _ ie components out of the desalination plant at Jubail, 100 miles south of the border. The plant provides most of the fresh water for the 4 mil- lion residents of Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Allied military spokesmen have said it is _ possible that their bombing of an Jraqi port led 1 to the third slick, which is farthe®north. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 7, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "~ SAVING SOLDIERS Guardsmen become heroes in truck blast _ By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent DODGE ROAD, Saudi Arabia — Two California National Guardsmen risked getting blown up to save the lives of at least eight people when an ammunition truck caught fire and sent explosive charges popping like Ro- ~ man candles, eyewitnesses said Friday. Sgt. ist Class Claude Rhey, a 49-year- old Vietnam veteran from Sacramento, pre- ‘vented one almost certain casualty when he wheeled his unarmored panel truck to within 20 yards of the burning ammo truck. The guardsman warned a regular Army'soldier hiding behind a sand dune that he had to move farther back. A minute or so before the explosives began detonating, Sergeant Rhey gunned his motor and made his own escape. When the truckload of artillery explo- sives blew up, the position vacated by the young soldier was showered with hot shrapnel. Asecond California guardsman, Spec. Glenn Jones, a 23-year-old savings and loan lending counselor from Roseville, stood just down the road from the burning truck and for- cibly stopped a carload of seven Saudis who were insisting on passing just before the ex- plosion. ' Specialist Jones said the Saudis refused to turn back until he cocked his M-16 rifle, a aloud click as he chambered the ~ bullet. “He kept trying to drive through and I told him about 10 times that the truck is blow- ing up,” said Specialist Jones. “I pulled back the Charley handle [the cocking mecha- - aig his M-16] and he understood real ne.” The story of the explosion was pieced to- gether by two correspondents who drove to the scene without military escort after learning about it from a convoy driver at a truck stop. As of late Friday — 36 hours af-. ter the blast on one of the main military con- voy routes to the front lines — the military’s . information bureau said it didn’t know any- thing about an ammunition explosion. A day after the accident, dunes on both sides of the two-lane blacktop were dotted with about 100 charred, twisted metal cyl- inders that used to contain explosive charges for the Army’s biggest artillery gun. Sever- al of the cylinders were found 175 yards from Atlanta Constitution BRAVERY the burned-out hulk of the truck. An acrid gunpowder smell hung on the - inner walls of the 25-pound cylinders, which measured 8 inches in diameter and about 30 inches tall. A military label stenciled on the | side of one charred canister said it had con- tained an M110A2 solid explosive propellant . ay charge that drives an 8-inch howitzer shell, One witness, truck driver Sgt. Charles Hicks, 39, of the District of Columbia National Guard, told what he saw from 500 feet away: “‘The whole truck was on fire. Then it - started exploding. The canisters were pop- ping like fireworks, flying 100 feet into the: The regular Army commander of the - ammunition convoy, Capt. Larry Pruitt, 29, of Berwick, Pa., said the two California guardsmen may well have averted a chain re- action blast involving other trucks in his convoy, which was hauling war supplies to the. Army’s VII Corps near the front lines. “There were all kinds of fuel trucks and other ammunition haulers on the road just be- hind the burning truck,” said Captain _ Pruitt. “Stopping traffic made all the differ- ence. These guys did good work.” He said the driver of the ammo truck, whom he identified as Sgt. Richard Arnold of » . Fort Lewis, Wash., also deserves credit for realizing the problem in time and getting him- self and assistant driver Spc. Edward Ward ‘out of the cab. The two rescuers were part of the Sacra- mento-based 224th Army Transportation De- tachment. Their job in Saudi Arabia is to control traffic along the rolling nightmare of a two- lane highway that the military calls Dodge MSR (for main supply route). Military drivers call it Dodge Road because they have to duck and weave onto the sand shoulder to avoid head-ons with extra-wide tank trans- porters. ; One rescuer, Sergeant Rhey, said the ac- cident happened when gasoline started leak- ing from the ammo truck’s fuel tank. “Fuel was dripping onto the exhaust,” he said. “The driver saw the smoke and pulled over. He saw a pool of gasoline under the truck. We happened to come by and stopped the traf- fic at both ends, Specialist Jones and me.” - February 9, 1991 \f"

In fact, residents of Baghdad who fled to what they believed would be safer quarters out in the coulitryside are said to be return- ing ‘to the capital, where some stores and offices are reopening. Evacuees reported water runs through the taps every two or three days in most parts of the city, and electricity often is available for a couple of hours a day.

Meanwhile, comments from Traq and Iran indicated the Irani- an peace initiative calling for “Ifaq to withdraw from Kuwait had met no success. Baghdad Radio said Sunday that the decision to fight “‘is ir- revocable,” and the army news- paper Al-Qadissiyah vowed there would be no compromise on Kuwait, which Iraq invaded and annexed as its 19th province last August. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani denounced Iraq’s leaders as responsible for ignit- ing the gulf war because they “carried out an unacceptable at- tack on an independent country and created all these problems for the region.” Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the Iranian’ initiative is stymied by Iraq’s inflexible position, but still he promised to make the gulf war the primary topic at a meet- ing of the Non-Aligned Move- ment this week in Yugoslavia.

Mr. Hammadi had carried to Tehran a response from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to the Iranian peace proposal, but by Sunday night neither side had re- vealed the contents of the reply. Mr. Hammadi told reporters only that Iran had been informed that “what is currently taking place is unrelated to Kuwait.” — Rather than back down, Iraq clearly is trying to exploit the volatile mood in the streets of many Arab cities. Mr. Hammadi is traveling to countries exhibit- ing the most vociferous pro-Iraq sentiment, urging the govern- ments to abandon the neutrality they so far have observed at least technically and to boycott the al- lied nations. “Neutrality in this battle means indifference, particularly when the battle is between right and wrong, between Islam and disbelief, between revolutionar- ies and reactionaries,’”’ Mr. Ham- madi said.

Glass COX NEWS SERVICE AMMAN, Jordan — In what might be a possible peace feeler, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he is ready to seek a peaceful end to the ‘gulf war if the U.S.-led allies stop bombing his country, ve Radio reported early to- ay. “Traq is prepared to extend co- operation to the Soviet Union and other nations and agencies in the interest of finding a peaceful, polit- ical, equitable and honorable solu- tion to the region’s central issues, including the situation in the gulf,” Saddam told Soviet envoy Yev- geny Primakov, according to the radio report monitored here. “What is required now is for res- olute action to stop these savage crimes and to keep the United States from using the United Na- tions as a vehicle for attaining its ae objectives,” Saddam The radio r port e hs} air, sea ani artillery anined their fire in aren a po i U.S. mili- tary official said was the biggest al- lied battlefield action yet in the 27- day-old war. The White House reacted cau- tiously to Saddam’s reported com- ments, with spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saying, ‘It’s just too pre- mature to make ajudgment.” “The deciding factor is what he has to say about getting out of Ku- wait,” Fitzwater said, referring to UN. poy Counei rece drawal. The radio 1 report did not address that issue. Primakov, a Middle East expert who before the war began at- tempted twice to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, delivered a verbal message to Saddam giving Soviet President Mikhail Gorba- chev’s views on the war, Baghdad Radio said. The seemingly conciliatory tone of Saddam’s response to Primakov was a sudden contrast to the belli- cose language used in recent offi- cial statements, which have vowed a fight to final victory and ruled out any cease-fire. However, the wording still seemed to link withdrawal from Kuwait to Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, which has been unaccepiable to the U.S.-led allied forces at war with Iraq. Nor did Saddam suggest that he is ready to give up the battle, say- ing that Iraq has “firmly resolved to tackle aggression with all that | the national and pan-Arab respon- sibility entails in the way of honor, pride and courage, regardless of the sacrifices needed, until aggres- cy and the aggressors are beaten ac ” The new interest in talking also might be another in a series of at- tempts to crack the wall of inter- national opposition lined up against Iraq. The Soviets may be seen in Baghdad as a potential soft target, having recently questioned whether the relentless air raids on Iraqi territory are exceeding the U.N. resolutions authorizing the use of military force to pry Iraq out. of Kuwait. . The response to Primakov fol- lows a speech Saddam gave over Baghdad Radio late Sunday night, in which he spoke in sometimes mystical terms and seemed to be preparing his people for an end less than fully victorious. The mention of peace came’ as allied forces mounted a thunder- ous land, sea and air barrage against Iraqi tanks and artillery massed in southern Kuwait on Tuesday amid reports that Iraq was using “execution squads” to prevent desertions from its rave aged front lines, Salvos from the battleship Mis: souri, bombing runs by Marine Harrier jump jets and Marine how- itzer fire bombarded entrenched Iraqi positions across the strongly fortified border from Saudi Arabia. en Daily News - February 13, 1991 \f"

While families and friends mourned the dead in a furiously emotional funeral march in Baghdad, Mother of Battles Radio prom- | ised that “only a few days separate us from the final victory.” It said widespread bombardment had “increased Iraq’s strength and firmness” and directed its warning of military sur- prises to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. “We tell Cheney that Iraq’s surprises will continue, and we promise him that these sur- prises will multiply and grow. They will be devastating surprises,” the radio commen- tary said. It did not further detail plans for the al- lied forces at war with Iraq since Jan. 17. In the past, howgver, Iraq has threatened to launch missiles with chemical and biological warheads. “In defending our country, we are al- lowed to use any appropriate weapon,” Ra- shid Rifai, Iraq’s ambassador to Japan, said at a news conference in Tokyo. He also said the bombing brought the Ira- qi civilian death toll up to more than 7,000. An Iraqi military communique said 228 bodies had been recovered by Thursday eve- ning from the Baghdad structure bombed Wednesday. Rescue work is continuing. Dr. Faiq Bakr, director of a government mortu- ary, said 91 of the dead were children. A number of injured also had been taken from the wreckage, a building that allied mil- itary authorities said housed a military com- mand and control center. The United States blamed President Sad- dam Hussein and the rest of the Iraqi leage ship for the situation, saying they deliberate- ly put civilians “in harm’s way.” Residents of the western Baghdad suburb said they had not seen uniformed men inthe area and that the building had been used ag a major air raid shelter since the Iran- a War. “Such places are not usually targeted by any military action,” said the Iraqi military communique, which charged the raid violat- ed “legal, ethical and humanitarian norms.” The funeral procession was filled’ with tearful, anguished men and women. Thou- sands of relatives followed a pickup truck that carried the flag-draped coffins of 20.0f the victims. The cortege turned into an anti- Ameetéjn tirade, with mourners carrying placards de- nouncing the United States and President Bush. Men from the volunteer Popular Army fired guns in the air and women beat their chests in grief. “Bush, Bush, you will pay!” the crowd chanted. ines Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 15, 1991 \f"

THE TROOPS For all he knows, he is only days away from the biggest al- lied invasion since Normandy. The 21-year-old army specialist from Zanesville, Ohio, is getting his mind and body ready for an assault on an enemy he doesn’t even hate. **I try to pray for them,’ Spe- . - Cialist, Clapper said. ‘‘It’s kind of dumb. I don’t think they want this war any more than we do.’’ _That’s what he thinks in half of his mind. The other half thinks time’s a-wasting, and that the ground troops should begin their work. These are the sort of split feelings that many front- line troops seem to be experi- encing as they wait for what in- creasingly appears to be an im- minent ground offensive. : Like a lot of soldiers in this sector, Specialist Clapper has watched in awe on recent nights as U.S. Air Force bombers blast- ed Iraqi targets 10 to 20 miles over the border. “*\"Made me think about going home,” said Specialist Clapper. “I just wish the guy would give up so I can go home.” Unlike many of his front- line comrades, Specialist Clap- per feels the Air Force has done enough and that it is now time for the Army to move. “The longer we wait, the more casualties we will take,”’ he said. “You got a guy down, you don’t want to let him up.” Life on the border The American front-line sol- diers are well-fed, well-rested -and well-equipped. Many of the Iraqi troops they face are none of the above. What remains to be seen is whether the Iraqis will collapse or fight on with the mixture of desperation and patriotism that | saved Stalin’s Red Army against Hitler’s technologically superi- or military machine in World War II.\" But if front-line quality of life can win a war, Specialist ' Clapper and his comrades in the 18th Field Artillery Brigade ry. - The 2nd Marine Division moves north in the Saudi | desert over the weekend as Marine units get ready for The Associated Press IN THE PERSIAN GULF — Thirty-one amphibious as- sault ships with thousands of U.S. soldiers on board have gathered in a small area of the Persian Gulf in prepara- tion for a possible ground as- sault into Kuwait. | Capt. Mike Falkey, com- mander of the landing ship USS Portland, said it was the largest gathering of such ves- sels since the Korean War battle at Inchon :in September 1950. *“‘We represent the cutting edge of the U.S. Navy,’’ Cap- tain Falkey said. ‘‘We are the only means the president has to project sea power onto land. We can make a political difference.”’ The task force includes Amphibious units pre to hit beach in groun TASK FORCE = war four helicopter and jet assault ships — the Iwo Jima, Tara- wa, Nassau and Guam — car- rying 30,000 sailors and U.S. Marines and their support equipment. On Friday, the task force completed its fifth intensive landing exercise, perhaps its last before the actual landing as part of a possible ground war. Captain Falkey said only he and two other officers aboard the Portland had been in combat before but the crew’s mood was good. ““Since the war began, mo- rale has actually gone up,”’ he said. ‘‘People realize it is like- ly to be a short war.’’ (Airborne) are going to make it. The milk in the cartons on his shoulder — American soldiers are drinking milk three meals a day at the front — are something World War II soldiers did without. As the ground war almost surely approaches, command- ers are leaving their troops alone for several hours at a time. At the camouflaged cannon po- sitions, soldiers can be seen washing clothes, writing letters, giving each other haircuts. On this day some, including Spe-' cialist Clapper, were greasing up their vehicles, while others were playing Beatles tapes on their Walkman stereos. Not that they were laid back. Every soldier in Specialist Clap- per’s firing battery is pulling two hours of guard duty every night. “It’s a lot more tense than at the rearxr,’”’ said Pvt. Sean West- fall, 18, of Los Angeles, who was carrying cases of orange juice cartons alongside Specialist DOD Pool/AP a possible ground assault against Iraq. Allied troops are preparing physically and mentally for combat. Clapper. “Everything you do out here on the front lines matters more.’’ A surge of enthusiasm Before dawn several days ago, soldiers fixing a command radio at one artillery headquar- ters near the front lines were surprised by the smell of bacon cooking: Hurrying to the mess tent, they found that for the first time since deploying to the front | several weeks ago, the army was serving cooked-to-order eggs, hot pancakes with syrup and jel- ly, and cream of wheat. And offi- cials passed the word that the main course the next night would be steak. The American bombing just across the frontier has given many of the troops and their of- ficers a surge of enthusiasm. “We used to complain about the Air Force,’”’ said Sgt. John Holman, 27, of Ambridge, Pa. ‘“Times like this, it’s different. Next time I see an Air Force guy, I’m going to buy him a beer. They have been doing their job, and now it’s my turn.” The operations officer of the - 18th Airborne Corps Artillery, Lt. Col. Patrick C. Sweeney, said: ‘“‘There is nothing that sounds. any better than the sounds of freedom with the B- 52s going overhead and pound- ing the hell out of them.” But like Specialist Clapper, Lieutenant Colonel Sweeney pauses when he thinks about the people on the receiving end. “It’s really unfortunate,’’- he said, referring to the Iraqis. “Thousands and thousands of people are going to die.”’ Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 18, 1991 \f"

U.S. military briefers said rudder damage had to be repaired. The USS Tripoli, a helicopter assault ship that serves as flagship for the U.S. part of the minesweeping fleet, was less seriously damaged, though a hole five metres by eight metres was blown in her starboard side three metres below the water line, and she wallowed aimlessly for seven hours before partial power could be restored, The Tripoli's repairs were being conducted at sea, while her helicopters continued to per- ae minesweeping missions, military briefers said, In the original announcements, military briefers said both ships had continued to move ahead under their own power aller each hit a mine, Military sources at U.S, Command Central said their analysts were becoming increas- ingly convinced that the mine which cracked the Princeton was an “influence” mine lying on the seabed, rather than a magnetic or con- ae mine floating on or just under the sur- ace, That presented a tactical challenge for the combined American and British task force try- ing to create a safe path toward amphibious landing points in Kuwait. Minesweeping ships with plastic and wooden hulls aren't necessar- ily any safer than steel ships if they come near “influence” mines, That type of mine can be triggered by sound or motion or a sweep of a ship's sonar, as well as by a direct hit or the proximity of large masses of metal. “It concentrates all its energy and force in a small area, in this case straight up — and it will throw a stream of water from the bottom up with such velocity that it can lift a ship out of the water,” one officer said. Since August, 162 floating mines — some designed to float and others tethered mines which have broken loose from their positions just under the surface — have been spotted by allies, Some were new and others sown by both sides during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq which ended in 1988.

By Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondent ITH U.S. FORCES IN NORTHERN SAUDI ARABIA — The barrage broke the stillness of the moonless early morning hours, forcing the Iraqi military com- mand to estimate on short notice whether this was an allied feint or a prelude to an ARTILLERY US. artillery officers said Iragi ob- servers near the border would have no trouble figuring out from muzzle flashes on the horizon that this was an artillery strike, not another air raid. In the firm de- sert sand, the shells dig angular furrows that are unmistakable signatures of ground-fired weapons. Hundreds of artillery rounds fell into a zone of targets west of the triangular junc- tion of the Kuwaiti, Iragi and Saudi bor- ders. For months, Iraq has concentrated virtually all its more than 500,000 troops confronting the allies into a ring of tanks, minefields and artillery guns in and around Kuwait. For reasons that have puzzled allied military planners, Iraq has left its own border to the south of its capital relatively undefended. U.S. Army artillery crews said min- utes after firing their 155mm howitzer- sinto Iraq that they hoped their shots would hasten the end of their service in. Saudi Arabia. ‘We are finally doing our job’ Spec. Jason Wilson, 20, of Ringgold, Ga., said, “We are finally doing our job. We are finally firing on the enemy.” Asked how he would feel if his unit were ordered to go into Iraq as part of a ground offensive, Specialist Wilson said, “If it happens, we got to go in and do our job and hope there are no casualties.” ‘The artillery strikes fell into an almost uninhabited stretch of Iraqi desert. The terrain is gently rolling, with a surface hard enough for rapid movement by tanks, trucks and even four-wheel-drive A row of self-propelled 155mm howit- zers from the U.S. ist Armored Division civilian station wagons. In some places there are ridge lines resembling low buttes in eastern Wyoming. The artillery rounds rained on or near Iraqi air defense positions to facilitate a concentrated air strike by U.S. helicopter gunships. The helicopters were thought to moves across the Saudi desert during bat- tle exercises earlier this week. be hitting scattered armored units de- ployed in relatively small numbers 30 miles back from the Iraqi-Saudi border. Given the overall scale of the allied air campaigns, Monday’s air attack was a pin- prick. The significance is that Iraqi mili- tary commanders now have painful con- firmation of their suspicions that the al- lies moved some significant ground forces at least temporarily to a possible jumping- off point far to the west of Iraq’s massed tanks and minefields in Kuwait. U.S. shelling puts Iraqis in quandary The artillery rounds landed south of Baghdad and south-southwest of the Iraqi highway that runs along the Euphrates River and has been used to carry supplies from factories near Baghdad to front-line Iraqi troops in Kuwait. The nearest Ku- waiti border post is nearly 200 miles east- southeast. , Army Capt. Bill Vockery, 29, of Rich- mond, Ky., the commander of one of the USS. artillery batteries that fired 155mm howitzers, said the artillery barrage into this part of Iraq is likely to put Iraqi mili- tary commanders in a quandary. | “He’s got to-be getting kind of wor- ried,” said Captain Vockery. “‘He’s got to be looking at it and saying, ‘I’ve got all my armored forces down in Kuwait.’ Because of our air superiority, he can’t get much forces over here right now.” Captain Vockery said he understands ' that the Iraqi positions in the region where the shells fell are manned mainly __ by “retirees and youngsters.” There was no return fire from the Ira- qi side of the border, an indication that the Iraqi forces lacked the guns or the counter battery radars in this sector to find the spots from which the Americans fired. The dilemma confronting senior Iraqi commanders is presumably compounded by the realization that, by daylight, the Americans could have moved their can- nons 50 miles in any direction, making their exact position a continuing mystery. Rockets follow howitzer barrage The sandy ground seemed to quiver underfoot as the howitzer crew’s “No. 1 Man” yanked the rope called a lanyard and triggered an ear-punishing explosion. Off to the northwest, a line of flashes appeared along the horizon, as if travelers decided to flick on powerful lights in uni- son. Seconds later, the noises of the sepa- rate explosions arrived in rapid suc- cession. The first bursts of howitzer fire were followed by hundreds of slow, arcing rockets from the Army’s short-range mul- tiple launching rocket system units. The shots looked like flaming arrows rising slowly at roughly a 45-degree angle, then disappearing from sight. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 20, 1991 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Troops in desert — are not expecting a walkover war By Marcia Kunstel Journal-Constitution correspondent RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — High optimism that a ground war will be quick and easy has bub- bled out of the allied command here and the Pentagon in Wash- ington, but reports from the front lines are a potent dampening agent... In the last few days alone, sol- diers and officers poised at the border have expressed certainty that Iraq will target them with chemical weapons, suspicions that terro lied lines, fears of being blasted by friendly fire and expectations of being bloodied in hand-to- hand combat. And in the broader picture, some commanders clearly are _perplexed at what to expect from Iraqi President Saddam Hus- sein’s Republican Guard, the hardened, battle-tested troops that one officer described Thurs- day as the “center of gravity” of Iraqi forces. Elite troops sit out combat Until ndWw those elite troops have sat out'the conflict, leaving allied forces to pick off the often- isolated forward forces, com- posed of what are believed to be the worst-supplied and least- trained bits of the Iraqi popula- tion, grudgingly stuffed into uniform. What may seem to be spec- tacular allied successes so far — have infiltrated al- including a month of air attacks that has drawn slight response and two mass surrenders — leaves the appearance that Iraqi forces are bewildered, incompe- tent and frightened, And they face an allied enemy believed to be better trained and bolstered by weapons that are technologi- cally smart — maybe even brilliant. Such assessments grow from legitimate confidence based on fact, but also out of military hype that has been standard operating procedure from Hannibal to U.S. briefers at the daily “Five O'clock Follies” in Vietnam. Commanding Gen. H. Nor- man Schwarzkopf recently de- scribed the Iraqi army as “on the verge of collapse,” and Lt. Gen. Thomas Kelly said at the Penta- gon this week that he expects quick victory if the ground war is launched. Marines train for fighting But Marines near the Kuwaiti border are practicing for the most intimate, personal style of fighting in war: hand-to-hand combat. That may be necessary if air strikes fail to dislodge the heavy guns arrayed in border pe- rimeters around Kuwait, and the only solution left is battling in trenches. “Everybody is aware of what U.S. military police bind the hands of an Iraqi sol- fortifications were overrun by helicopter gunships. dier taken into custody early Thursday after Iraqi desert The prisoner was tumed over to the Saudis. could happen. You could be killed or see your best friend get blown up, but that’s our job,” said Marine Lance Cpl. Jeff Con- ner, 21, of Monroe, Ga. Military intelligence has pro- vided discomfiting reports from the front that Iraqi special forces or Palestinian commandoes have infiltrated the Saudi city of Hafar al Batin and are prepared to raise terrorist attacks against al- lied troops when the ground war begins. A terrorist slipping into a tent and slitting a soldier’s throat may not alter the war’s direction, but it would have a powerful psy- chological effect on the neigh- borhood. Friendly fire always a danger - In the confusion of war, sol- diers also have to worry about being hit by their own side. Al- ready, more U.S. troops have been killed by friendly fire than by Iraqi attacks, and border skir- mishing that began this week un- derscored the problem. Attack helicopters found it hard to distinguish troops below them, and in one reported inci- dent, unloaded a powerful Hell- fire missile at what they failed to recognize was a U.S. fighting ve- hicle. Officers at the front said two soldiers were killed and six others wounded. Repeat inci- dents will be hard to.avoid, a pi- lot commander said, if helicop- ters are used as support in a close-in fight during ground war. Some Iraqi battlefield units “are clearly just a joke,” said the officer, pointing to the 421 troops who surrendered Wednesday af- ter two U.S. AH-64A helicopters attacked a bunker complex north of the border. “On the other hand, there are some veteran units out there that if you don’t go about it just right, they’re going to kick your butt,” he said. The Republican Guard has remained dug into bunkers to preserve them from allied air at- tacks over the past month, but the coalition does not expect what is considered to be a key strategic reserve to remain out of sight forever. “No matter how much dam- age you do to his [Saddam's] re- cently organized units, to his less experienced, his non-veteran units, it’s the one capability he has that remains a distinct threat to us if a ground war is launched,” the officer said.

        "ocr_text": "Wells burn; guns fire across desert By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Al- lied fighter-bombers pounded ene- my troop emplacements in every corner of Kuwait Friday, flying a record number of missions over the emirate despite clouds of inky smoke from oil-well fires, believed to have been set by Iraqi forces, that covered a quarter of the na- tion. Iraq’s “scorched earth” policy in Kuwait hampered some allied military operations, but command- ers said the billowing smoke of oil fires would not seriously impede either continued softening of the enemy or a full-blown ground war. Scores of oil-well fires raged in the Kuwaiti desert as President Bush said Iraqi forces “are de- stroying the entire oil production system” of the country. It was not clear how much damage was done or what its effect would be on world markets. US., British and Saudi military spokesmen all said Friday night that they were ready to press the land battle if diplomacy fails and the-erder to fight comes from their politseal leaders. The rising tempo of allied groti operations, including ag- ive probes into Iraq and Ku- waity also indicated that a land assault was imminent unless the Iraqfs quickly pull back. he U.S. forces are fully pre- pared to execute any action or any order given by the president of the United States,” Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the chief allied com- mander, said in a statement. By late Friday night, American pilots and listening posts had de- tected ‘not a shred of evidence”’ that“the Iraqis were preparing to leave Kuwait, an officer at Schwarzkopf’s headquarters in Ri- yadh said. He said there was “no radio traffic, no movement of tanks, trucks, nothing.” Air and artillery barrages of Iraqi positions continued amid the flurf'y of diplomacy in Washington, Mostow and Baghdad. More than 1,000 air sorties were flown in the eg heey eae of operations despite the newly ignit- ed oil wells spewiig thick smoke and possibly toxic gases. But many strikes missed. “Smoke is a major problem,” id British Group Capt. Niall Ir- ing, describing aborted Jaguar mber raids against Iraqi artil- ery positions in Kuwait Thursday ight and Friday. A’ Pentagon official said the ells were spewing hydrogen sul- ide,-a poisonous gas that the offi- ial insisted was for now more of a hreat to Iraqi forces than ground roops belonging tg the U.S.-led coalition. In recent days, officers have shown growing anxiety over weath- er conditions and the effect they are having on air strikes. Friday was the second day in a row in which fog and sandstorms forced the cancellation of some bombing missions and affected flights by helicopters. “We've got another month of acceptable weather,” a senior offi- cer said, noting that temperatures, as well as the frequency of sand- storms, are beginning to rise. Successful missions were flying again by Friday afternoon, howev- er, after a wind shift cleared the skies enough for pilots to lock onto ground targets. Allies use ‘work-arounds’ U.S. Marine Brig. Gen. Richard Neal said the allied command had anticipated the Iraqi “scorched earth” tactics, and that “our forces are prepared to operate in that environment.” Just as Iraq has thrown up pon- toon bridges to allow crossings where permanent bridges have been bombed out, so have coalition forces readied what he called “work-arounds . . . to make sure we still can maintain the momentum and still meet the mission require- ments.” He did not describe them. “We don’t feel like it seriously degrades any activity or operation that we may want to do either now or in the future,” Neal said. Neal estimated 140 to 150 oil wells and some refinery facilities were burning, although dozens of thuse were ignited in an earlier phase of Iraqi operations. A Penta- gon spokesman estimated that 20 percent of Kuwait’s 950 oil wells have been destroyed, including some no longer aflame. Iraqi forces are “wantonly set- ting fires to and destroying the oil wells, the oil tanks, the export terminals, and other installations,” President Bush said at the White House. “Indeed, they are destroy- ing the entire oil production system of Kuwait.” Neal agreed that “there seems to be an orchestrated, systematic destruction of the oil-producing ca- pability of Kuwait. It looks like the commencement of a _ scorched earth policy by Iraqi forces.” Expensive rebuilding Before the invasion, Kuwait was producing up to 2 million bar- rels of oil a day, with most of it going to the Far East. But the overall effect on world markets has been minimized by increased daily production by Saudi Arabia. Oil experts said Friday that it was difficult to assess the cost o rebuilding Kuwait's oil production facilities until the extent of dam- age is known. But they agreed it will be expensive. “First you have the lost reve- nue. And second, you’ve got the bills for repairs,” said Ken Miller, editorial director for OPEC Listen- er, an oil analysis service sent electronically each day to compa- nies around the world. Miller said oil field engineers he has spoken with estimate that the total replacement cost from the “cumulative wrecking of Kuwait's whole oil infrastructure could run in the $25 (billion) to $40 billion range. The variant is the extent of damage.” But the monetary cost is only one of the problems, he said. Anoth- er will be finding enough workers to rebuild and operate the oil facili- ties. Before Iraq’s Aug. 2 invasion, roughly two-thirds of the oil work- ers were foreigners. “It’s going to take a lot to get people to go back in there, especial- ly if Saddam is sitting across the border swearing at you,” Miller said, Neal said the destruction of oil wells and associated refining facili- ties is not a surprise to the allies, who had predicted such tactics by Hussein “if in fact he felt really threatened and may have been en- tertaining ideas of withdrawal.” He estimated that smoke covers 25 percent of Kuwait, and parts of eastern Saudi Arabia also have black skies. Some of the oil fires were visi- ble 40 miles away in Saudi Arabia, their orange flames boldly outlined against the horizon. At Khafji, the border town where the war’s big- gest battle was fought three weeks ago, the sky was almost dark at midday. Palm Beach Post-February 23, 1991 \f"

Michael Rapp of Columbus, Ohio, was cud- dling his M- -16 in a sandbagged lookout post in the darkness before dawn when we learned that he and 500,000 other American troops were suspended between peace and war. “Sounds like [Soviet President il S.] Gor- bachev is saying two things at once,” said Private Rapp, who pulls down base pay of $870 a month to shoot cannons and hope the other guy doesn’t shoot back. “First he says the Iraqis have made a positive response. But then he says they don’t agree with the plan in total.” The story of this 22-year-old front-line soldier illustrates the anguish of first-time warriors who have just been told they have to take a timeout be- fore they run the gantlet. _ The timeout lasted only hours. By sunrise, his unit had gotten orders to move out to what would be its position for the ground war. Private Rapp’s story, told in interviews while he was on guard duty Thursday evening and Fri- day morning, somehow is more than average. As an artilleryman, he was among relatively few soldiers who knew what it is like to shoot at real people.

When he was a small boy, his family moved northeast to Columbus, where he grew up to be more than 6 feet tall and played basketball at Liberty Christian Academy, When he was about 13, one of his relatives who had fought in Vietnam let him fire a souvenir M-16 rifle and M-60 machine gun. After that, he always liked guns. But he also likes books and basketballs He was a good enough guard in high school to get a tryout when he entered Ohio State. He im- pressed the coaches enough to make it through three squad cuts, But on the fourth he was dropped from the team. He was commuting from Columbus to Ohio State for hight classes and working days as the mainte- nance manager of a furniture reupholstering busi- ness, Somehow, things didn’t seem to be clicking in his life. He decided to make some changes. In December 1989, he and his girlfriend, Lori, 20, who had a 2 -year-old son from a previous mar: riage, got married.

        "ocr_text": "U.S, gunners excited to he part of history By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau WITH THE U.S, ARMY INSIDE SOUTHERN IRAQ — A fast-moving column of U.S. and French soldiers drove northeastward Sunday, threatening to cut Saddam Hussein's military off from the northern two-thirds of Iraq, -“T think I’m doing something good,” said artillery: man Spec, Sandy Adkins, 21, of Fayetteville, N.C. “I really believe that. I believe I am part of history.” For Army troops such as Adkins of the 18h Corps artillery, the start of the ground war did not come soon enough, Adkins was part of a heavy howitzer battalion that had rumbled into Iraq in a cloud of dust just before noon EST (8 p.m Saudi time) Saturday, Four hours later, they were ordered to don their chemical protec- tive suits as a precaution, They also were told to begin taking pills to enhance their recovery if they were hit by nerve gas, At that point, there seemed little doubt in any of the soldiers’ minds that the historic ground assault to liberate Kuwait was about to begin. Just getting inside Iraq had been enough to excite the young American gunners. Spec. Michael Barnes, 22, of Battle Creek, Mich., looked out over the rock-strewn flat dust patch at sunrise Sunday and said: “I see a lot of artillery pieces. I think it is beautiful, and we are ready to fire.” Then, just before 7 am., cheers went up from howitzer gun crews when word came over the field radio that their guns had been assigned a target, Moments later, the dusty ground heaved under a single 155mm howitzer, A flash of light shot out of the muzzle, There was a heavy thud, and the ground responded to a shock wave, The gun crew was coated with a dust puff kicked w by the 65-inch recoil of the cannon, The ground shoo 25 yards away, This and dozens of other cannons fired toward the northeast, part of a coordinated air and ground barrage aimed at clearing a path through Iraqi forces. After firing, the artillerymen packed their trucks and prepared to move forward, pushing farther into Iraqi territory, It was a scene played out along the expansive Saudi border with Iraq and Kuwait, Brig, Gen, Nick Halley, 51, of Koskiusko, Miss, whose 18th Corps from Fort Bragg, N.C., was among the first units into Iraq, said before Sunday's opening attack that the United States rapidly and secretly had moved a large portion of its combat forces to the west, starting in late January, to make the flanking move possible, “T think it will probably go down in history as one of the most amazing logistical moves there's ever been,” Halley said, “We moved a whole corps of over 100,000 people over 300 miles, mostly along one road, the Tapline Road. And we did that in 16 days, with all the combat service support, all the logistics, all the ammunition,” As the Americans and French moved forward Sunday, only a few scattered towns and police posts punctuated their path as they stopped occasionally to fire more artillery, and in the process make history. This report was subjected to military review. Palm Beach Post - February 25, 1991 \f"

More than 30,000 Iraqi soldiers were in custody, and some allied units said they were running short of plastic handcuffs. In fierce battles throughout Kuwait, allied forces had knocked out 26 Iraqi army divi- sions — roughly 260,000 men — by early today, U.S. military offi- cials in Riyadh said. The officials, requesting ano- nymity, said American recon- naissance teams and other “lead elements” of U.S. forces were in Kuwait City, but the U.S. com- mand did not regard the city as liberated, et “I’m sure we'll run into some pockets of resistance, but we ful- ly expect it to belong to coalition forces at the end of today,” one official said. He said some Iraqis probably remained in Kuwait ‘West of Kuwait, American and French forces reportedly . reached the Euphrates River on Tuesday, the third day of the ground war. The allies were be- lieved moving east toward Basra, vee could block any ene- my ps hoping to flee to safety in the Iraqi interior. | The main target of the encir- cling maneuver was the Republi- can Guard, eight well-equipped and experienced divisions that form the core of Iraq’s army. A senior Pentagon official told The Associated Press that units from the U.S. Army’s VII Corps had attacked and defeated one Republican Guard division west of Kuwait and was attacking a second division. The Guard units were offer- ing “stiff resistance” to ‘the largest armored attack since World War IT” by U.S. forces, the official said. With 2 French tank division cutting off escape to the west and two U.S. armored cavalry regi- ments adding movilit; to the awesome firepower and air su- ‘premacy of the allied force, U.S. strategists said late Tuesday that they expect to trap and crush the Republican Guard’s remaining five divisions. The Pentagon official also said that elements of the 24th In- fantry Division captured 50 of the Republican Guard’s T-72 tanks as they attempted to flee northward near the Euphrates. The Soviet-made T-72s are the most advanced tanks in Iraq’s ar- senal. Some officials predicted that the battle could be concluded in as little as 48 hours. “This is a beaten army, utterly devastat- ed,” a senior Pentagon official said. Others cautioned, however, that the Republican Guard — Saddam’s best-trained, best- equipped and most loyal force — would fight to the death. Meanwhile, outside Kuwait City, Marines apparently reached a standoff in a tank bat- tle at the international airport, according to a Pentagon briefing ‘in Washington. Other allied troops, led by a Kuwaiti contin- gent, were poised to move into the capital. About a dozen U.S. Special Forces and Saudi soldiers en- tered the capital and were met by Kuwaiti resistance fighters who claimed to control the city, The Associated Press reported. Marine Brig. Gen. Richard I. Neal acknowledged receiving re- ports that the fleeing Iraqis were taking Kuwaitis with them as hostages, but said he did not have independent confirmation. Iraqi troops were reported earlier to have committed atrocities and vast destruction in Kuwait City. Saddam ordered all of Iraq’s troops to leave Kuwait, but Pres- ident Bush and other coalition leaders said the fighting would not stop until the Iraqi leader agrees to comply with all U.N. resolutions imposed after Iraq’s Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. “The war is not over. And we're going to continue to attack and attack and attack,” General Neal said Tuesday night. “We cut them off, we isolate them, then we destroy those pockets that continue to resist. And the other ones will get the word and will in fact drop their weapons and be- come enemy prisoners of war,”” General Neal said military of- ficials do not consider the Iraqis whom Saddam ordered out of Kuwait to be withdrawing, be- cause that means pulling back forces that are not under attack. Instead, “the Iraqi army is in full retreat,” he said. British and American offi- cers said Iraqis will be free from attack only if they are'seen walk- ing without their armor or weapons, “So long as Iraqi troops re- main in their tanks or other ar- mored vehicles, said British Col. Barry Stevens, “we will engage them.” The Los Angeles Times con- tributed to this . Atlanta Journal-Constitution - February 27, 1991 \f"

Their enemy seemed to be buckling. The Ira- qi airfield was within their grasp and now all they could do was wait. The men of Gun Five awoke Tuesday to a chilling 25-mph wind slicing across the rock- strewn, uninhabited landscape near a southern Iraqi town. They heard on the Voice of America that Baghdad Radio had ordered Iraqi troops to pull out of Kuwait, nearly 200 miles east of this flanking attack into the midsection of Iraq. They didn’t know what to make of the news. They didn’t know why their cannons weren’t firing, nor why they weren’t moving forward the way they had the first two mornings of the allied ground offensive. For a COMBAT brief period, as the battle eased, they dared to ponder the end of the war. “It’s finally over,” said the optimist of Gun Five, Spec. Mi- chael Barnes, 22, of Battle Creek, Mich. ‘‘We’ve been here six months and now we can fi- nally see the light at the end of the tunnel.” But Spec. Joseph Young, 20, of Winchendon, Mass., who drives Gun Five’s ammunition truck, said, “Even if he [Saddam Hussein] does pull out, I think there will still be a war. He hasn’t given himself up. “We'll still have to go after him like in Panama,” he contin- ued. Spec. Bobby Raines, 23, of Spring Lake, N. C., thought about what all this was going to mean for the Iraqi soldiers. The troops of Gun Five have had to | confront the human face of their | enemy in the last 24 hours be-° cause pleasant-faced Iraqi sol- | diers, some of them with no- shoes, have been turning up | near their guns to surrender. | “T feel sorry for them. If they | get out of their holes and get out © of Kuwait, the Air Force will have a field day with them,” Specialist Raines said. The senior non-com who | runs the 11 member crew of the cannon, Staff Sgt. Freddy Rive- ra, 21, was focusing on the fate of the Kuwaitis. They had heard on the radio about the Iraqi Scud missile that killed more than two dozen U.S. servicemen in Dhahran just hours earlier. They didn’t talk about it, but they did talk a lot about ‘their desire to get their hands on Saddam. | For one day, at least, it re- | placed passions they have felt | about going home.

        "ocr_text": "Sa2zadadarma mraow stares — Amato deserted streets Posters, towns bullet-pocked by battie By Joseph Albright Joural-Constitution correspondent AS SALMAN, Allied-Occu- pied Iraq — Saddam Hussein took a beating here Wednesday in more ways than one. Like so many Iraqi towns in the path of the allied jugger- naut, As Salman was taken with virtually no resistance. Its sev- eral thousand residents headed out before French and Ameri- can forces headed in, sending Saddam’s soldiers scampering to avoid certain capture. Inside the police station overlooking As Salman, Sad- dam himself — more accurate- ly, portraits of the Iraqi leader staring down at the deserted streets — were pockmarked from shrapnel or bullets. In the grand scheme of Op- eration Desert Storm, As Sal- man is a small footnote. The al- lies pushed into town Tuesday, and by Wednesday it became the first Iraqi town to be cap- tured and fully secured. Gas station destroyed And at a gasoline station a few miles from As Salman, ei- ther a bomb or an artillery shell had collapsed the concrete structure and blown in half the big illuminated Saddam poster that used to decorate the inter- section, which is almost pre- cisely 200 miles south of Bagh- dad and 60 miles from the Saudi Arabian border. Staff Sgt. Herman Brown, 32, of Austin, Texas., looked out, of his armored vehicle and said, “He’s got to go.” What happened in As Sal- man is typical of what has hap- pened to every city, town and village within the broad scope of the allies’ flanking move- ment from Saudi Arabia into Iraq, effectively preventing fleeing Iraqi forces from escap- ing north out of Kuwait. So wide was the military sweep that, by Wednesday, hours before President Bush told the world he was prepared to cease coalition combat oper-. ations, the allies had taken at least 10,000 square miles of southern Iraq, including As Sal- man, a once-thriving trading town. All told, the parallelo- gram-shaped expanse of cap- tured territory is larger than Kuwait. Town pounded by air, guns — By all appearances, whatev- er Iraqi military forces that” were here hurriedly fled ahead ™ of the advancing allied troops,” who had pounded the town’ from the air and with artillery. © At the police station, jour- - nalists accompanying US. forces found military maps still . on the wall, with green thumb- | tacks representing Iraqi defen- ses and red tacks standing for ° those of forces of the U.S.-led_ coalition. Out in the parking lot, spent cluster grenades littered the gravel like olive drab orange peels. They were the leftovers from a CBU-58 cluster bomb whose casing rested on the curb’ across the highway. Two unexploded cluster bomblets of the kind that shat-. tered the police post’s window still lay in the parking lot, a haz- ard to French and American- soldiers. Surrender demanded - The town of As Salman, which has a pre-1991 popula- tion of abou rade ed- ouins and low level Iraqi civil- ian officials and their families, was captured without a fight. It had been softened up with bombing, then French and. American forces surrounded the town and broadcast de-| mands for its surrender from a microphone-equipped truck. Army Capt. Scott Halasz, 32, of Ohatchee, Ala., a civil affairs officer, said the allies would: probably place the town in the hands of a temporary military governor because all of the” town’s Iraqi civil authorities had fled north. A tour through the aban- doned town and its outskirts was a lesson in how much Iraq . has depended on imported products. <i 9o A brand new generator at the destroyed gasoline station was a Lister diesel from Great Britain. The mechanism for the gas pump was made by Toshiba in Japan.

The sight of human car: nage was proof again that there is no such thing as a nice, clean conflict, The allies had to capture the highway to end it quickly, When the 101st Airborne Division and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) pushed north from Saudi Arabia to the Euphrates, they severed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s capital, Bagh- dad, from his front-line troops. By carrying out this sweeping flanking strike from west of Ku- wait, they shortened the land war _ by,weeks. _By the time the first journal- ists reached the highway on Thursday morning, the blood of battle had scarcely dried. At that point, the highway be- longed to the Americans from An Nasiriyah — 200 miles down- stream from Baghdad — to a highway overpass an additional 50: miles down the Euphrates. That accounted for enough land under allied control to box Sad- dam's Republican Guard in an impossible position between al- lied forces positioned around them. “This highway is theirs no more,” exclaimed Spec. James Miller, a 20-year-old infantry- man from Wichita, Kan. He was one of the many thousands of American soldiers who were Ce in hours after the Thurs- day 8 a.m. (Iraqi time) cease-fire to consolidate allied control of a Iraq. The six-lane highway was’ vilguelly empty except for Amer- icans in desert khaki along with their grunting lines of fuel hare conclaves of M1-A1 tanks gal ising up to fight again if neces- sary and flocks of helicopters mming 15 feet off the ground. Every few minutes, bands of Iraqi soldiers would straggle Atlanta Journal-Constitution - past, usually carrying a white flag and a plastic sack full of American meals-ready-to-eat (MREs) given them by passing allied troops. One Iraqi soldier walking down the road in stocking feet said, “I’m going home.” He lived 75 miles down the superhighway in Basra and seemed patient enough to walk the whole way. A reporter asked him what he thought of Saddam. “Saddam?” he asked, point- ing down at his feet. “Saddam? No, right now I am worrying about me.” Oddly, at least 10 clusters of disarmed Iraqis smiled and waved at American forces who had just pounded their army to bits. Curiously, the Iraqis wore no sullen or hateful looks. Dead and wounded Iraqi sol- diers were strewn across the southbound lane when a truckful of medics from Ft. Benning pulled up with orders to help “police up” the highway by as- sisting the Iraqis who were still living. The Iraqis had been hit the day before when they tried to shoot back at an American plane conducting an air strike. Spec. Michael Aragon, 25, of Albuquerque, N.M., saw all this and yet spoke of the war in the way outsiders do — as a contest between the allies and a man called Saddam Hussein... But in that framework, Spe- cialist Aragon said he wished President Bush hadn’t declared a cease-fire. “I wish we could have continued to go in,” he said. “It is the only way there is to get this guy out.” His teammate on the medical unit, Capt. Miles McCarthy, 30, of Columbus, Ga., looked at an Iraqi body on a sidewalk and said: “War is a travesty. It’s a travesty.” Viewing it from up close, the.. war didn’t seem to begin or end- with the precision that military: | briefers like to suggest. Artillery guns that were part. of a U.S. tank division boomed, out an encore of long range, 155mm cannon shots down the highway at a suspected Republi; ', can Guard artillery outpost a full | three hours after the cease- rien: was ordered to begin. - , Col.

        "ocr_text": "ning U.S. embassy Kuwaitis cheer reope By MARCIA KUNSTEL Palm Beach Post Washington Bureau KUWAIT CITY — Thousands of Ku- waitis streamed between the British and U.S. embassies Friday, celebrating their liberation with guns, horns and flags and thanking allied forces for driving out the Iraqi occupying army. “We've come to celebrate our liber- ty,” said Wafa al-Hashem, who carried a small U.S. flag and led six children in tow. “We want to send a big hug for Bush for what he did for us.” “Thank you for our liberty,” the mid- dle-aged woman said. ‘‘We hope for America more success. They are the most civilized people in the world. They § deserve to be number one.” The celebration focused on the arriv- al of U.S. Ambassador Edward Gnehm, 46, of Albany, Ga. He flew into the embassy compound in a helicopter and immediately replaced the U.S. flag fly- ing there with the flag lowered by for- mer Ambassador Nathaniel when he left in December after being held hostage for four months. “This is an exciting day in my life,” Howell } Gnehm said. “I was ready to come here in August, but the Iraqis got here first.” Gnehm said Bush had told him: “ ‘Skip, you’re going to Kuwait.’ I never doubted him for a minute.” Throughout the cool, sunny day, cars drove along the beachfront road past the embassy, horns honking. Kuwaitis yelled and danced on the sidewalks, shot off firecrackers, and fired guns in flurries of cracking shots. What they saw was shocking to some. Hotels had been ravaged and burned, the hulks of tanks sat immobile on streets, and casings from cluster bombs and spent bullets littered roads. The Al Salam Hotel, an old luxury cruise ship permanently docked in the harbor, was blackened and still smoking from fires that gutted it. “We used to come here to the restau- rant. There was a place for the children to play,” said Fatima Huseen, 34, who was taking a driving tour of the city with her husband and 8-year-old daughter. “This is too sad, what has happened to our country,” she said. The couple told of Kuwaiti govern- ry of Bee Ly ee Kuwaitis parade at the reopened U.S. ment subsidies secretly carried into the country and doled out to Kuwaitis who needed help. Most, like Fatima Huseen’s husband, Fadel Hamza, a geography teacher at a military school, have been out of work since the invasion or soon afterward.

The money came to this family every month or two. Sometimes 600 Iraqi dinar, sometimes 500 Iraqi dinar, they said. In the last two months, they got 1,000 dinar each month — more than many Iraqis make in several months. Another woman, Shurouk al-Shattr, told of young men being hauled in for questioning by the Iraqis over the months of occupation and, in the last week of the Iraqi presence, being ab- ducted and not yet resurfacing.

        "ocr_text": "Natural gas on again in Kuwait after GIs risk death to save well By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright Journal-Constitution correspondents - KUWAIT CITY — The Ku- wait Oil Co. began production from a rescued well Saturday, sending natural gas to some crip- pled bakeries and to one commu- nity in southern Kuwait. The well was rescued by a team of six U.S. Marines and Army Special Forces soldiers who entered a burning oil field late Friday with Kuwaiti resis- ‘tance workers and removed 5 tons of blasting cord that Iraqis had packed around the wellhead and a nearby control panel. ' The production offered the first tangible evidence that Ku- waitis and their international supporters have begun to roll back the massive devastation carried out by Iraqi forces. Within the boundaries of the ravaged capital, street security remained the only visible public service. Most Kuwaitis scav- enged during daylight for water and food and huddled Saturday night in darkened homes, won- -dering when their ex‘led govern- ment would reassert control. _. Near the Burgan oil field, one Marine told how he had helped unwrap yards of a military ex- PRODUCTION plosive cord which had somehow failed to ignite when the Iraqis blew up dozens of nearby wells. “Tt was a matter of luck that this well didn’t go up,” said 1st Lt. Andy Hewitt, 28, of San Die- go. Though heat and smoke from a blazing wellhead about 50 yards away swirled around the rescuers, “We figured it wasn’t that hazardous, taking the det [detonation] cord out,” he said. “That particular well wasn’t on fire.” Ali Qabandi, a Kuwaiti resis- tance leader who worked for the state oil company, said that with- in a few days the rescued well will be sending its full prewar flow of about 12 million cubic feet of natural gas a day to homes and bakeries in southern Kuwait. But there was little progress elsewhere. “Everything’s a mess. Every- thing is chaos,” said Abdul Rah- man Wadi, Kuwait’s minister of state for Cabinet affairs. He said that as Iraq’s troops retreated — Tuesday night, “they took every- thing but the heart of the people.” Mr. Wadi said nine Cabinet ministers had returned to their country, but the top leadership, which fled to Saudi Arabia in Au- gust, has not returned to Kuwait. He said the crown prince was expected back within a week. “Tt will be at least three or four days before electricity is working,” Mr. Wadi said. But he said some water service could be restored by today if electric gen- erators to run the pumps arrive from abroad. Kuwaitis crowded a small im- promptu street market on the edge of the city’s Palestinian quarter, where vendors offered a few staples such as powdered milk, rice and beans, and lots of luxuries, including girls’ frilly dresses and perfume. Food was not an immediate problem for most Kuwaitis, who had hidden large supplies during the seven-month occupation. But water was another story. “We need water; it’s getting silly,” said Farid Moosa, 39, a fa- ther of eight who has an extend- ed family of 18 relatives living in his house. . “It’s a miserable thing,” he said. “People are washing all the time. It’s a difficult thing to teach them how to ration and not to splash so much.” Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 3, 1991 \f"

Oa fought a two-hour rifle battle Sunday with street guerrillas they took to be Palestinians, Tt was a glimpse at a coming chapter in Ku- wait's liberation: what will happen to the roughly 400,000 Palestinians who have lived for years in Kuwait as pampered second-class citizens — and who became a hated elite under Iraqi occupation. “We will deal with the Palestinians as they deal with us, either peacefully or harmfully,” one of the Kuwaiti troops, Sgt. Ali Rashidi, said after the | shootout on the grounds of one of the city’s major hospitals. A Kuwaiti police spokesman said the gunmen, who escaped, apparently had been trying to free some of the 33 wounded Iraqi prisoners of war the Kawaitis have been holding in the hospital. Correspondents who arrived at the hospital’s emergency room later saw five corpses in blood- stained clothes stacked unattended in the back of a pickup truck. ~ Kuwaiti soldiers and hospital nurses said two of the dead men were Palestinians and three were Iraqis. No one knew how or why they had died. “They were killed by the Kuwaiti resistance, but not in this incident,” said an administrator, “We don't know where they came from.” Kuwaitis feel hatred _ Over the past six months, many Kuwaitis in ex- ile have vowed to drive out every Palestinian who collaborated with President Saddam Hussein’s Ira- qi troops. Some would like to drive out all Palestinians. ~ “Some of them are very good,” said Fatima Husseen, 34, a Kuwaiti mother and housewife. “But I hope they don’t stay.” _. Ms, Husseen said Palestinians secured food and supplies from Basra, just over the border in U.S. troops search an Iraqi soldier Sunday in Kuwait City. The Gls said the Iraqi surrendered to them be- Iraq, and provided it free to Iraqi occupiers while they charged high prices to Kuwaitis. The hatred many Kuwaitis feel toward follow- ers of the Palestine Liberation Organization could be seen in inscriptions written by Kuwaitis over the past week on the walls of the white stone PLO head- quarters on the edge of the sprawling Palestinian quarter. Two defaced pro-Saddam posters were still stuck to the front wall of the a Some- one had written in Arabic: “Here {s the traitors’ on Palestinian collaborators hood roadblocks and interrogate passing Palestin- ians at gunpoint. “Some were not good, but not all of us,” said Sa- mir Mohammad Redwan, 23, a Palestinian who had just been held with his back toa wal, a rifle pointed | athis chest, because he didn’t have the proper auto registration. “Twas born here.

They feel be- trayed that the Palestinians, that the PLO, sided with Saddam,” said U.S. Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm Jr. “Then there were a small number of Palestinians who collaborated.” While Kuwaitis intellectually agree that not all Palestinians should bear the brunt of punishment for the few who collaborated, that may not be the emotional reaction, he said, Kuwaiti leaders are talking about changing the demographics of their country so that Kuwaiti peo- ple no longer are a minority, which means a lot of foreign nationals would have to leave, Mr. Gnehm said. Palestinians surely would be among them. Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 4, 1991 \f"

Hours later, soldiers had to shoot in the air to drive the people back. They were not starving war victims, but Kuwaitis after an- other necessity. They wanted to reach newly installed AT&T tele- phones. They wanted to make contact with families and friends whom they had not been able to reach throughout the Iraqi occu- pation. “The cream of this job came last night when these Kuwaitis came in and called their families. Some of the ladies were crying. Some of them haven’t talked to their families in seven months,” said Gary Gearheart of Dayton, Ohio, the project manager for AT&T International Federal Systems. The first calls were made Sat- urday night from Kuwait, offered free by the Kuwaiti government, which brought in AT&T to install the equipment as it did for U.S. ‘troops in Saudi Arabia earlier. Walid Hasawy called his brother and sister-in-law in Seat- tle, but most importantly he got to talk to his 7-year-old daughter, Aisha, who has been staying there. It was the first call since the invasion, he said. COMMUNICATION “It’s been seven months, and even her voice seems strange to me,” Mr. Hasawy said. To get the equipment here, Mr. Gearheart and his crew of six drove from a city in eastern Saudi Arabia until 3 a.m. Satur- day in a convoy of seven vehicles carrying the phones, a 23-foot-di- ameter satellite dish and other technical equipment to connect a country emerging from war to the rest of civilization. The link is possible, Mr. Gearheart said, because of the new integrated access terminal that permits 120 circuits to be connected in the space normally taken up by 24. The arrangement is similar to the system AT&T set up for U.S. troops deployed since August in the Saudi desert. Also available to U.S. forces is a Desert Fax sys- tem, which Mr. Gearheart said has received an average of 8,000 to 9,000 faxes every day to the troops. The telephones in Kuwait City will be available 24 hours a day, and calls to anywhere from Cairo, Egypt, to Cairo, IIl., will be free. Judging from the first day’s business, which drew crowds well into the night, it will be one of the most popular attractions in Kuwait. ie / Atlanta Journal-Constitution - March 5, 1991 \f"
