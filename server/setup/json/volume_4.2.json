        "ocr_text": "40 Inmates Indicted. Legislature Ranped By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer An Escambia County grand jury has indicted 40 in. mates charged in criminal incidents at Atmore Prison Farm and Holman Prison in the past six months, but ju- rors saved their most stinging, unofficial indictment for the Alabama Legislature. Court officials said some indictments stem from re- cent disorders at the two institutions, and include charges ranging from murder to rioting, escape and grand larceny. A list of those indicted and the charges was not made available, but officials did release a copy of the grand jury report forwarded to Gov. George Wallace earlier this week. cambia County ‘certainly did not seek out or in any way ask these prisons be located in our midst,” and charged that the community's “‘pieas and demands have been met by idle promises and ineffective studies by appar- ently in indifferent or ineffective study committees.” Jurors also questioned the end result of widely-her- alded plans to tear down the old Kilby Prison and create a model prison system in Alabama. “Was this all forgotten after the valuable land at Kib- ly was gobbled up by the realtors in Montgomery?” the report asked. The report continued that ‘‘ridiculously over- crowded’’ prisons manned by almost skeletal, under- Also made public with the highly critical jury report was an equally scathing cover letter from Escambia County Circuit Judge Douglas $. Webb. Both the report and letter charged the Alabama Leg- islature with failing to respond to numerous pleas for improvements at the two prisons, and essentially held the lawmakers responsible for violence within the in- stitutions. The indictments and reports came after the jurors heard testimony relating to prison uprisings on Jan. 18 at Atmore and March 12 at Holman, uprisings which left two correctional officers and two prisoners dead, and scores injured. All 40 indictments apparently are not connected to the , disturbances, but also resulted from other, minor in- paid crews means correctional officers cannot properly monitor the inmate population to prevent. violence. Judge Webb said in his cover letter to Gov. Wallace that similar grand jury reports “‘have been presented to this court and forwarded to Montgomery since 1970 without remedial action of any kind being taken to alle- viate the critical need for additional officers and guards,” ‘ _ ‘We live and attempt to raise our children on the per- imeter of a boiling, seething cauldren that can explode at any moment into tragedy for our community that has witnessed all too much tragedy in recent months,” Webb wrote, While local residents don't want to ‘coddle” prison- ers, Webb continued, they do feel law violators ‘should cidents within the prison walls since last November. The jurors said they found the riots were caused by “so-called revolutionaries’’ who seek to bring ‘‘com- plete chaos within the entire prison system.” “The so-called revolutionries never pretended to be revolting on account of a sound or practical reason,” the report said, “but only for the sake of revolt itself.” The jurors said proper correctional funding ‘‘is the only practical solution” to prison problems, and sug- gested the legislature should reinstate the death penal- ty, at least for murders committed in prisons. The report is signed by Miss Alma Dailey, the first woman to serve as foreman of an Escambia County grand jury. * The jury report also noted that the residents of Es- not be perverted, raped and reviled while under the eet control and domination of our state govern- ment.” He added that it is time for the lawmakers ‘‘to cease studying a problem they have now been studying with- out result for 15 years.” Although the legislature bore the ‘brunt of criticism, the grand jury report did cite the State Board of Correc- tions for ‘‘untiring efforts in making unbiased in- \"vestigations of recent riots, disturbances and killings” at the two prisons. The governor's office has received the report, but nei- ther Wallace nor a spokesman could be reached for comment since he and aides contined touring north Ala- bama counties ravaged by tornadoes this week, April 6, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "“Cormmunity Action’ Backed by Wallace By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A federal program that has been characterized as the epitome of bureaucratic boondoggling by many crit- ics has drawn support from one of the most outspoken foes of U.S. bureau- cracy—Gov. George C. Wal- lace. While Wallace continues talking against ‘‘bureau- crats who tote briefcases with peanut butter sandwi ches in ‘em\"’ during his pub- lic campaign speeches, the governor quietly has writte a letter supporting congres sional efforts to extend the life of Community Actio Agencies (CAA’s). The CAA’s, which have come under fire in the pas not only for their bureau cratic complexity but alsa because of one-time ardent activism on behalf of the poor, will die with their par ent Office of Economic Op portunity (OFO) this sum mer unless action is taken preserve them. Those who do want to save some OEO pro -grams--notably the CAA's—face continued op- position from the Nixon Ad- ministration, including threats of a presidential veto against any bill which sus- tains their life. Along with numerous oth- er former OEO opponents, Wallace has written the chairman of a congressional subcommittee expressing strong support and the hope that federal funding of CAA’s will continue. In a Feb. 26 letter to U.S. Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Subcommittee on Equal Opportunity Employ- ment, Wallace said: “There is strong support in Alabama, from all segments of the local community for the continued federal fund- ing of CAA’s. I am informed that many of these agencies have developed service de- livery systems which are recognized as very effective resources for reaching low- income and disadvantaged people, particularly the el- derly who are often iso- lated.”’ Wallace said in the letter he has received many letters and personal visits from mayors and other local offi- cials who fear abolition of the agencies, and he went on to urge passage of legislation to continue federal funding. Lloyd Johnson, staff direc- tor of the subcommittee, in a recent telephone interview expressed some surprise and pleasure over the Wal- ace missive and the support oming from other southern povernors who have not ap- peared overly fond of OEO in the past. Johnson said it is hoped such broad-based support ill prompt favorable con- gressional action, although it apparently has not yet re- duced administration oppo- sition.

Friday Morning, May 3, 1974 - ‘NEWS FLASHES By Telephone Dial 265-8246 52 Pages AU Officials Solicited Wallace Funds By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Highly placed Auburn University administrators have solicited faculty donations to Gov. George Wal- lace’s re-election campaign, The Advertiser has learned, The campaign solicitation efforts were squelched by protests from department chairmen that academic freedom was being violated, and the Auburn chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has initiated an investigation. The fund drive emanated from the office of Dr. Taylor Littleton, University vice president for academic af- fairs, who maintains he asked “several deans” to in- form their faculty members “‘of their right and oppor- tunity to contribute” to the local Wallace organization in Lee County. What resulted, at least in the School of Arts and Scien- ces, was outright solicitation. Dr. Wesley Newton, president of the local AAUP chapter, confirmed Thursday that his group ‘“‘has found some basis of solicitation” and has met with University President Harry Philpott about the situation. “We have made our stand clear,” Newton said. ‘As far as the AAUP is concerned,” he said, ‘we view any attempt to bring any pressure from an institutional standpoint on any member of the faculty as a grave vio- lation of academic freedom.” Newton would not relate what transpired in the meet- ing with Philpott, and the president, in Atlanta Thurs- day, could not be reached for comment. Philpott did publish a recent article in an in-house bul- letin reminding all faculty and administrators that Au- burn regulations prohibit partisan political activity in the name of the university. Newton refused to name the administrators involved, but other sources said the solicitation scheme started at the top and wound down the chain of command in vari- ous schools, with each lower level administrator placed in an embarrassing position if he failed to cooperate with his superior. This was at least partially true in the School of Arts and Sciences. Associate Dean Leslie Campbell told The Advertiser he was asked to solicit contributions for the Wallace campaign by Dean Edward H. Hobbs. “And I volunteered,” Dr. Campbell said, Campbell said he went to faculty people who he thought would like to support the Wallace campaign, asked them for donations, and then requested that they, in turn, contact other faculty members they felt would be interested in contributing, “There was not any intention to seem to be coercing people,” Campbell said. He said no money actually was collected—he himself did not contribute—because objections immediately ar- ose and the solicitation effort was stopped shortly after it began. Campbell said he did not feel pressured to solicit, al- though when asked whether his acitivity was based on personal support of George Wallace, Campbeli refused to answer. When asked again if he is a Wallace supporter, Camp- © bell said: ‘‘I’m not active in political campaigns in a regular way. I simply chose in this particular campaign to be active because I was requested to.”’ asked that contributions be solicited. Dr. Hobbs, dean of the school, said he, too, was in- volved ‘‘to a certain extent.” Hobbs said Vice President Littleton «asked him ‘‘to provide information to the faculty as to how they might make a contribution.” “After a day or two - I decided this was inappropriate, to provide even this kind of information,” Hobbs said. “The departments were informed that this was not to be pursued, because certainly it was in violation of Auburn board (of trustees) policy.” Hobbs said the matter is ‘a dead issue” now. ; “Largely this was an effort, as I understand it, on the part of the iocal campaign headquarters to commu- nicate with the campus and it was probably felt that sup- porters of a candidate had a right to communicate with the faculty and staff members,” Hobbs said. Hobbs, who said he felt under no pressure to partici- pate in the solicitation, also refused to say whether he personally is a Wallace supporter. Littleton, the vice president, said he never actually He said a representative of the Wallace organization in Lee County asked him “to participate in this (cam- paign) in whatever way we could,” “Our response,” Littleton said, “has been that we have a policy that oe any institutional in- volvement in any political campaign, and the most we could do was inform the faculty of their rights and op- portunities to contribute to any campaign through the county organization,” Littleton admitted that the oniy campaign about which information was disseminated was that of Gov. Wallace, Littleton said he did not discuss the matter with Presi- dent Philpott before asking ‘‘several deans’ to partici- pate, nor did he ever discuss the matter with any mem: bers of the board of trustees~all of whom are appointed by the governor, May 3, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Fred Jones. Wins For Senate By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Confusion and apathy reigned at the polls in Mont- gomery County Tuesday, but Democratic voters here did manage to nominate State Rep. Fred Jones for a seat in the Alabama Senate, and assured runoff contests in at least two Alabama House races. According to complete but unofficial returns tabulated by The Advertiser, Jones topped opponent Tom _ Jones, the incumbent senator, by a vote of 10,696 to 9,887 in Sen- ate District 27. This is the only senate dis- trict lying completely within Montgomery County bound- aries, and takes in most of the city. It includes House Districts 79,80 and 81. No Republican or indepen- dent candidates have quali- fied for this district, so Fred Jones is virtually assured of victory in the November election. In House Districts 78 and 81, the Democratic nominee will be determined in the June 4 runoff election. The two top vote-getters in the crowded field of seven candidates in District 78 were Cecil Wyatt, with 1,741 votes, and Alfred Gold- thwaite, who garnered 1,350 ballots. Candidates Joe Hall, Gene | Elrod, Jim Herr, Suggs Bos- ; well and J.C. Snowden trail- ed far behind, in that order, with none winning as many as 1,000 votes. Race The district covers most of Montgomery County, except two western portions, and the northern sector of Cren- shaw County—for which no vote totals were available late Tuesday. In House District 81, the central and south-central portions of the city, Mrs. Jane Katz and incumbent State Rep. James Harris apparently will face each other in the runoff. Standing third in line close to Mrs. Katz, however, is Charles Smith, who may emerge in the second spot when official results are available, or who may chal- lenge the tabulation if the scores remain close. Harris won 3,258 votes, Mrs. Katz got 2,580, and Smith carried 2,528 votes. No Republicans or inde- pendents are running in House District 81, but GOP candidate Mrs. Pat McDaniel will face the win- ner of the runoff in House District 78. In House District 80, the western end of the city, Alvin Holmes stood head and shoulders above T.C. “‘Thad’? McClammy, gain- ing 2,718 votes to McClammy’s 950. Both can- didates are black. With complete returns from Montgomery. Autauga and Lowndes counties, James Plaster appeared to have barely escaped a runoff in House District 82. Trailing Plaster’s 3,145 votes was Leon ie Pearson with 2,386. Mrs. Clara Monfee lagged behind with just 710 votes—not quite enough to force the two into a runoff contest. Plaster won just over 50 per cent of the vote in the dis- trict that covers two western . portions of Montgomery . County, most of Autauga County and Highland Home in Lowndes County, but he will face Republican Mal- colm Hall in the November general _ election. An incomplete tally was seen in the Senate District 28 race, although ‘‘Walking’’ Wendal! Mitchell outpolled Robert Austin by a vast ma- jority in three counties. Mitchell scored 5,013 votes to Austin’s 1,892 in Montgom- ery, Autauga and Lowndes counties. However. no vote counts were available for Butler Crenshaw, Wilcox and Dal las counties, all or portion of which lie in Senate Dis trict 28. In Senate District 26 Jerry Powell scored a victory ovel Oscar David Cook, accord ing to complete but unoffi cial returns from both Mont gomery and Elmore coun. ties. Powell registered 9,55 votes to Cook’s 5,051. The district covers the north-central portion o! Montgomery city, most 0} the county, and the more populated sectors of Elmore ‘County—including We. tumpka, Tallassee and Ecl. ectic. | in the November election Powell will face two indepen dent candidates—J.D *‘Dan”’ ‘Hogan and Bill Hob bie, the brother of incumbent State Rep. Walker Hobbie, who was disqualified whe Powell challenged his can didacy. The primary election was marred this year by vote apathy—less than 45 per cent of the registered voters turned out—and by con- OT} O § 0 qaered which reapportionment resulted in, many county voters being placed in new precincts for the first time in their lives. The unofficial returns showed that fewer than 37,000 of the county's 86,000 registered voters bothered to cast a ballot. And the county Board of Voter Registrars reported confusion from the moment the polls opened at 8 a.m. The registrars were pla- gued with calls from would- be voters who didn’t know where to vote, what their precinct is, or which candi- dates were running in their districts—because they didn’t know in which district they live. Some voters also reported list of registered voters, though they had in fact regis- tered long ago. These voters were forced to cast a challenged ballot, which means their votes will not be recorded until offi- cials verify they have regis- tered. The names of candidates Rufus Lewis, running in House District 77, and in- cumbent State Rep. Bishop Barron, in House District 79, did not appear on the ballot because they are unopposed. Neither do they face GOP challengers in the general election, so both virtually were elected before the i election. May 8, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "A Short Decree With Long Intent By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer White, official Alabama’ began bracing for May, 1954, months—perhaps dec- ades—in advance, and tried for years afterward to ne-. gate a single action taken that ‘‘Biack Monday” in spring. Twenty years later it has not been totally unsuccessful, that resistance to the com- ‘bined. massive efforts of the black minority and of feder- al executive. legislative and judicial forces attempting to transform the 1954 decree into a drastically altered way of life. The decree that brought anguish to more than it gave hope in Alabama was a com- paratively short message from the highest court in the mation, saying black and white children cannot be taught in separate class- rooms without violating the Constitution. It said separate cannot be equal, and it was herald- ed—or decried—as the be- ginning of the end of dual so- cieties, not just dual schools. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case popu- larly known as Brown vv. Board of Education (of To- peka, Kan.), came May 17, 1954. One day later The Montgomery Advertiser fu- tilely editorialized: ‘*Miay it come to pass that, in the period of adjustment to the law of the land, Ala- bama will be spared the im- potent wheezing and hoarse croaking of its windbags and demagogs. Let's give ear to the cool and matter-of-fact among our leadership.” Such a plea was knowingly futile. because official Ala- bama nearly a year earlier had begun laying the ground- work for defiance with the creation of a state legislative committee whose avowed Purpose was plotting a course to circumvent any Su- preme Court desegregatior ruling. Sam Engelhardt, author of the Senate placement act and one of the state’s most strident, vocal segprega- tionists, later serwed as high- way department director un- der Gov. John Patterson, amd now works in public rela- ions for Alabama Power Co. By the time the Alabama Legislature convened early in 1955—Gov. Gordon Per- sons the year before had re- fused the angry. urgent call of Black Belt legislators to activate his lame duck ad- ministration with a special session—the rhetoric spouted hot and heavy and the lawmakers began rush- ing along that charted course. There were resolutions calling for impeachment of the Supreme Court justices. demanding a federal in- vestigation of whether com- munists had a Nnhand in the court’s decision. asking con- g@ress virtually to rermove the sovereign state of Alabama from the oppressive jurisdic-. tion of all federal courts. The height of disdain for. those nine jurists who . trampled Southern tradition, came in the 1956 ‘‘in-. terposition resolution,”’’, which boldly declared the Supreme Court’s desegrega- tion orders to be ‘‘null, void and of no effect,”\"”\" and said Alabama would not be bound by them until the state sur- rendered its right and power to maintain public schools. There were more serious efforts then and later that did, for a while anyway, help keep the racial status quo in Alabama for nearly a decade after the court spoke. The school placement bill was a major one that gave lo- cal school boards authority to assign students to what- ever school they wished. Without mentioning race as a placement criteria, which spared the law from being ruled unconstitutional two years later, lawmakers gave the schoolmen sufficient lee- way to keep whites in white schools and Negroes in their Place for years. The freedom of choice law essentially would have re- Placed dual school systems with triple by giving parents the choice of sending their children to white. black or mixed schools—if they could find any. Other actions were directly aimed at stifling black initiatives toward desegregation. Some levied heavy license fees on activi- ty of local NAACP chapters. others empowered school boards to fire any teacher advocating integration. By 1963 the legislature had fattened the state’s law- books with measures to fi- mance private segregated schools with public money. to let school boards close down a school threatened with integration, to give pri- vate school tuition grants to individual students, and, as a last line of defense, to seg- regate by sex the classrooms in racially integrated schools. And the legislature had taken one law off the books: the requirement that all pub- lic schools -be segregated. Over those nine years while the lawmakers. gover- nors (except Jim Folsom), attorneys general, school su- perintendents and other offi- cial spokesmen of the white two-thirds of Alabama were crying ‘‘foul’’ and attempt- ing to reinstate the old rules of the game with the wording shuffled, the blacks were not all sitting idly. As early as 1955 a young black woman began chipp- ing at the wall that separated black from white in Ala- bama education. . But Autherine Lucy’s court-room victory of that year turned to ashes by the next, when she integrated the University of Alabama for just days before being ex- pelled. Miss Lucy and~- her court order for entry were greeted by rioting at the campus, and when she charged the university ad- ministration had conspired with the mobsters. Miss Lucy was out.

She said she never wanted trouble, just an education. case against the act to ‘the U.S. Supreme Court, he again met defeat. Thus for nine years the schools, with few exceptions such as these, were not the battlegrounds in the war against segregation. But there were battle- grounds. They were found in buses, at voter registration offices and lunch counters, and the soldiers were spurred by the knowledge that once nine white men in black robes sanctioned their fight, and by the hope that it might hap- pen again. It wasn’t till 1963 that schools became the focal point for the racial struggle, and then, with a series of wrenching crashes, the wall finally came tumbling down in Alabama. Early that year George Wallace was inaugurated governor to the cry of ‘‘seg- regation forever, and in succeeding months he was to leave the unmistakeable On June 11 of that year : Wallace made good his cam- paign pledge to stand in the door of any school threat- ened with integration. This particular school was the University of Alabama, and Wallace did block the door- way of Foster Auditorium when Vivian Malone and James Hood at 10:30 a.m. at- tempted to become the sec- ond and third blacks to crack that bastion of cavalier white Alabama. Vivian Malone Jones did graduate from the univer- sity in 1965 and she now is the regional director of equal op- portunity for the U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency in Atlanta. Her hus- band, Mack Jones, attends Emory University Medical School. The stand was but a ges- ture. however. and when Alabama national guards- men federalized by Presi- dent John F. Kennedy asked Wallace to step aside that af- ternoon, the governor bowed to federal superiority. But not for long. By that fall Wallace and Alabama again faced what had been a nagging threat for nine years, this time at public schools in Tuskegee. Birmingham, Mobile and Huntsville. At each of these places during the first scheduled week of school. Wallace him- self did not stand in the schoolhouse door. but he did send powerful proxies—armed state troop- ers. The troopers. criss-crossed the state from one city to the next, despite pleas from city councils and lawmen that Wallace keep his hands and his guns 2°’ %£ local school problems. By .the second week in Sep- tember, President Kennedy personally had ordered the governor to end his obstruct- ionist tactics, three federal judges had slapped restrain- ing orders on him, and the National guardsmen called up by Wallace to ‘‘guard’’ the schools, once again, had been federalized. And 20 black children walked into white schools, a few days and a hundred years late. There are some who still say George Wallace's con- spicuous disregard for the law of the land is what spurred the bombings, the violent mob scenes at schools, and the deaths. Oth- ers contend the police pres- ence contained the dis- orders, and that Wallace's public defiance even defused some malcontents who were satisfied with a vicarious thumbing at the feds. Regardless of Wallace's role, there was violence, and its tragedy peaked on a tense Sunday morning in Septem- ber when four small girls perished in the still unsolved bombing of a black Birming- ham church George Wallace's collision course with a federal gov- ernment then bent on ending dual societies was well-es- tablished by the end of 1963, Chris McNair, the father of one of those girls, was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in a special election last year, becoming the third black to serve since Reconstruction. He faces a runoff election June 4 in Birmingham for the Democratic nomination for a full term in the House. and by early 1964 it resulted in actions that ultimately would become the undoing of white defiance. In February, 1964, the State Board of Education, under direction of the gover- nor, ordered the Macon Co. Board of Education to close Tuskegee High School and to make tuition grants to mi- nority white students who had fled the public schools with the appearance of the first black face. Too late, state officials re- alized they had erred—they had given the federal courts a peg where judges could hang a statewide order to de- segregate. The governor and his board of education became parties to the suit Lee v. Ma- con through their in- terference at Tuskegee, and on March 22, 1967. a three- judge federal panel in Mont- gomery delivered its land- mark decree that the state must enforce desegregation in 99 Alabama school sys- tems. The court admonished the state for providing black children with ‘‘markedly in- ferior educational opportu- nities,\" citing per pupil valu- ation of buildings and sup- plies of more than $600 for whites, less than $300 for blacks, at the segregated schools.

In 1966 the U.S. Depart- ment of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) had dropped its own bombshell on the South, in the in- nocuous wrapping of new school compliance forms. In these forms, local school boards were told their federal funding well run dry if they failed to pledge adherence to provi- sions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibited dis- erimination in federally-fi- nanced programs.

Taking the next logical step, Wallace called the Ala- bama Legislature into spe- cial session to deal with this new federal tyranny. The willing lawmakers did a better job than even Wal- would lace requested, enacting a measure declaring Foy signed compliance forms null and void, and prohipit- ing local school boards f;9m signing them in the future Not to leave the school boards floundering, the leg- islature added the stipula- tion that any school hit with a funding cutback would be eligible for at least ‘‘partial”’ reimbursement from _ state monies. Many, perhaps most school officials, decided not to disregard HEW, but to flout the legislative man- date. The others lost money. Even some who agreed to comply with the federal rules were blackballed by HEW, after federal in- vestigators found they were Practicing paper com- pliance only. There was no freedom and no choice in some school sys- tems, the HEW examiners found. Their reports and testi- mony’ before the U.S. Civil Rights Commission showed that blacks who chose to send their children to white schools often lost their jobs, or were told by principals the safety of their children could not be guaranteed. In Elmore County, chil- dren of the Roosevelt Bracy family were among the first to desegregate public schools. The Bracy home was destroyed by a bomb. Against this background, the three-judge federal pan- in Montgomery made its momentos ‘decision to order statewide desegregation. Despite the known prob- lems with freedom of choice—5.4 per cent of Ala- bama’'s black children at- tended desegregated schools by that fall—the judges op- ted to try it one more time, adding the warning that oth- er steps would be taken if school officials - persisted in their old ways. The court did go one step further, spotlighting not only pupil attendance but segregation in faculty and transportation practices, and ordered remedial steps in those areas, too. Once again Gov. Wal- lace—by now it was Lurleen Wallace, not George—reared back in ang- er at the federal action, promising to stand between the court and the state school board in defying the order. The Wallace case, how- ever, this time was taken to the courts instead of the streets and schools them- selves, where it eventually was tossed out on its merits by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Carter issued a temporary restraining order blocking the commission from delay- ing the effective date of all ethics regulations applying to county and municipal offi- cials and employes, at least until a Friday hearing when he will consider a motion for a preliminary injunction in the case. Earlier in the day, Carter issued a temporary in- junction barring the ethics commission from forcing the state bar’s governing body to file financial disclosure statements or meet other re- quirements of the ethics law. attorney general who han- dles ethics commission cases, said later he will con- tinue to fight the board of bar commissioners exemption in a hearing for a permanent injunction. Carter’s action came two days before the effective date of a regulation demand- ing that all local officials and some employes file the con- troversial financial dis- closure statement. Any  offi- cial who had not resigned his position by Wednesday would have been required to file the statement within 10 days. His order came in a class action suit filed just hours earlier in Montgomery Cir- cuit Court by the Alabama League of Municipalities, the Alabama Association of County Commissioners, and a number of individual cities, local officials and lo- cal government employe or- ganizations. sections in the ethics law granting the Alabama Eth- ics Commission power ta regulate county and munici- pal governments. The main provision being contested requires the ethics commission to promulgate rules governing county and municipal governments which are no less stringent than regulations governing state officials and employ- es—which are spelled out in the law. Local mayors executive officers have pro- tested that the requirement for financial disclosure will result in the mass resigna- tions of local board and agency members who serve their communities without pay.

Only employes earning $12,000 a year or more come under the law. The board of bar commis- Sioners case does not effect such large numbers of people, a point which state bar president Roland Nach- man called a press confer- ence to ‘‘clarify’’ Monday af- ternoon, not long after Car- ter issued the temporary in- junction. Nachman said his intent was to ‘‘expel at the outset” any notion that the bar asso- ciation was attempting in its suit to have all Alabama at- torneys exempted from the law. What the bar asked, and what the court ruled, he said, was that the 38 members and two ex officio members of issue a assistant declare the board ef bar commis- sioners not be covered by the law, since they are not state officials, but officers of a pri- vate arganization. The Ethics Commission had not formally stated the board would be asked to comply with the ethics law, Nachman said, but had giv- en an “‘informal indication’ that compliance would be re- quired. ; Upon questioning,! Nach- man said some board mem- bers had indicated they would resign their positions if forced to comply, not due to the financial disclosure rule, but because of other provisions. For example, he said, the law prohibits state officials from representing any state, county or municipal agency for a fee, and also prohibits a person2 from serving on an agency that regulates his profession. The suit asks the court to unconstitutional all ‘*The board of sioners would have to be composed of laymen,’’ he said. The ethics act, however, prohibits a person from. serving on a board regu- lating his profession, otherwise provided by the law. In this case another law does stipulate that lawyers sit on the board of bar com- missioners, so application of ‘the ethics law to the board would not require that board members be non-lawyers.. Nachman contended, as did the bar’s counsel in court Monday morning, that .the bar association has its own code of professional conduct that is ‘‘more rigorous’’ than provisions of the ethics law.. There is no systematic mechanism for enforcement of the code, however, and Royer said in: the courtroom that ~ law enforcement has been evidenced b > unless .

Wallace spent more than $500,000 campaigning for the May primary, while his most serious opponent in the race, Huntsville State Sen. Gene McLain, put out about $63,000.

For example. Baker In- dustrial Cleaners was listed as making two $100 dona- tions. Other contributors includ- ed a wide array of incumbent legislators, as well as some newcomers seeking legisla- tive seats, and a number of appointed state officials who owe their jobs to Wallace. Other interesting dona- tions were listed Athletic De-- partment, JSU, Food Service Personnel, JSU, $182. These apparently came from Jacksonville State University, whose president, Ernest Stone, is a long-time Wallace crony and appointee, and who himself gave $1,000.

        "ocr_text": "Where Has the 1954 School Ruling Led? (Last in a. Series) By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer So where has it led, May 17, 1954 In Alabama the State Department of Education says 79 per cent of all public schools are integrated. The state has no figures on how integrated, and some schools are less than 1 per cent black, while others are more than 99 per cent, Kimbrough estimates more than 1,000 schools have been closed in Alabama since the desegregation process got underway in 1964. Most of those were black schools, shut down because the courts ordered it, or because white school boards re- fused to teach white students in such pathetic facilities when forced to integrate. Where are the black teachers, and principals, and coaches and band directors whose schools were pulled out from under them? Joe Reed, assistant executive director of the Ala- But school officials stepped in to demand an equal number of blacks and whites on the council—despite a student enrollment 60 per cent black. In Montgomery's Lee High School, two black attend- ants were elected to the Homecoming Court. The stu- dent newspaper published a picture of the queen and two white attendants on the front page, ignoring the black girls. . And what about improvement in the educational stat- us of blacks, which was, after all, a goal of the plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education and of the Supreme bama Education Association (AEA) and a black politi- Court justices who declared segregated schools denied If there’s one white, or one black, it’s called in- tegrated by state officials. Dr. William H. “Zeke” Kimbrough, financial officer for the state department and the man who keeps the cal activist, says they're not where they should be. When black closings hit in Gadsden, Reed illustrates, one principal ‘‘was sent to an ernpty building with noth- ing to do for a year.\"’ black children equal education opportunities? Perhaps it is too early to tell, especially in a state like Alabam withstood efforts to which integrate until the late 1960's, but the figures are not spectacular. In other cases, he adds, black principals forced by the courts into formerly all-white schools typically have been assigned to jobs like ‘assistant to the assistant to the vice assistant with nothing to do.” According to a report on black educators compiled for the Alabama League for the Advancement of Educa- tion, the number of black principals dropped drastically from about 650 in 1966, to 300 in 1970. The number of white principals declined, too, in that period, but the drop was from slightly under 1,200 to slightly under 1,100. The same report shows black teachers suffered some- what less in those four years, decreasing by 620 from the 10,685 who were teaching in 1966. The number of white teachers, however, increased by 1,017, leaving 23,520 of them in public schools in 1970. The federal appeals court decision in Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District in 1970 did more than anything else to halt blatant discrimination in assignment of supervisors, teachers and staff by de- manding ratios and specific procedures for dismissals and demotions. But Reed says blacks have been able to do little more than “‘contain” the situation since then. Corrective ac- tion must come from the courts, he says, and the courts are slow. Consider, too, student life in integrated schools. In some places, such as Wilcox County, the court or- der resulted in almost total white abandonment of pub- lic schools, and brought a sharp cutback to extra- curricular activities for the blacks who remained. In school systems holding significant numbers of both blacks and whites, whichever race is in the minority Not all these private schools are accredited, many ee one student offices and promi- having been thrown up in panic when startled local nui; was the case at Selma. when desegregati ; ; ; i ‘ ' gregation put whites finally realized, yes, they are going to do this to blacks in the majority and then in every student council US. chair. numbers, says perhaps not much more can be expected. Consider the north Alabama white sectors that have few if any black students to integrate, Kimbrough says, and the Private schools that especially have prolife- rated in Black Belt counties, where the Negro popu- ae is high and the white anti-integration sentiment igher. Consider the private schools, There are no exact num- bers on where and how many, because the state can’t or won't keep track of their mercurial rise and fall. State figures show about 53,500 students were in pri- vate schools during school year 1971-72, compared to public school enrollment that year of some 820,600 pu- pils. With 542,500 of those public students white, that means less than 10 per cent of Alabama white children were in private schools then (Some of those 53,500 pri- vate students were black, but not many.) That's what the official figures show, but some sources say the percentage of students pulled out of pub- lic as in “white flight” may be closer to 30 per cent, Ken Mitchell, executive director of the Alabama Pri- vate School Association, a creature of the all-white Citi- zens Council, said his group has 60 member schools in this state holding some 20,000 students this year. Mitchell is confident there are at least 280 private and parochial schools in Alabama. which would place the to- tal private enrollment well over 10 per cent of the white, public school population. For the most part, it appears blacks have progressed at about the same rate as whites, while failing to catch up, failing to close the education gap between the races. U.S. Census statistics show, for example, that 12.8 per cent of the blacks in Alabama had four years of high school or more in 1960, while 21.6 per cent of the state's black population had achieved that level by 1970. The jump is significant, but the percentage of whites with at least a high school degree rose from 36.5 per cent in 1960 to 47 per cent in 1970, a slightly greater per- centage point rise. The census also reported the median years of school completed by whites in Alabama was 10.2 years in 1960, compared to 11.6 years a decade later. The median for blacks was 6.5 years in 1960, rising to 8.1 years in 1970. These were increases of 1.4 years for whites, 1.6 years for blacks. Who can say whether the improvement would have been less without desegregation? Or whether even more significant change will corne when and if the shuffling of students and teachers and the other disrupting effects of integration have subsided? Who can say whether a young girl like Georgia Bracy is better educated because she switched from an all- black Elmore County elementary school to what had been a school for whites only? Georgia Bracy can’t. But Miss Bracy, editor of the yearbook at her integrated high school and a gradu- ating senior this spring, says she knows the opportunity to meet and mingle with ‘‘different people” will serve her well when she enters Troy State University this fall, and for the rest of her life. “It was rough at first,\"’ Miss Bracy says. ‘It just wasn’t pleasant. But it’s changed greatly from when I first went to school there. “We all communicate now.” May 23, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Latham Found Guilty Im 2nd Fraud Trial By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Ruby Lee Latham was found guilty of grand larceny and false pretense Tuesday in her second highway de- partment fraud trial and sentenced to another 10-year term in prison, despite last minute defense efforts to win a mistrial. The jury deliberated 27 minutes before returning the guilty verdict, and Mont- gomery Circuit Judge Rich- ard Emmet immediately handed down the maximum 10-year sentence, setting a $10,000 appeal bond. “Not guilty,” Miss Lath- am said when asked if she had any comment before sentencing. Emmet reiterated the of- fer he made at the close of her first case on the same charges in February, that if she at any time is “inclined to make a complete and ac- curate accounting of the dis- position of this money,” she Should contact him for a possible sentence reduction. Her defense counsel gave notice of intent to appeal the verdict, and of intent to ap- peal in pauperis, which, if granted, means the state would pay appeal costs. A Ppauper’s petition in con- nection with the apppeal in her first case was denied by Circuit Judge Dave Cros- land. Emmet denied a request that Miss Latham be allowed to remain free on her first appeal bond for 24 hours, un- til the new bond could be posted, and she was led to the county jail. The actual sen- tence was suspended pend- ing appeal. During a lunch recess at 2 p.m., one half hour before the jury was scheduled to be- gin deliberation after the morning’s closing argu- ments, attorneys for both the defense and prosecution met in a highly unusual session with a panel of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. Heard was the request of defense attorneys J. Paul Lowery and William Lath- am, the defendant’s cousin, that the jurists force Emmet to step down from the case due to bias and prejudice to- ward Miss Latham, and de- clare a mistrial. The defense petitioned the appeals court for action Monday, after Emmet de- nied their motion that he re- cuse himself. Within half an hour the hearing was completed and the court had denied the peti- tion, indicating they again would consider the charge of judicial prejudice if a later appeal were made. Prosecutors indicated in their closing argument that the state will not drop any of the remaining 21 in- dictments against Miss Latham, .which together ac- cuse her of defrauding the state of more than $90,000 through a complex scheme involving the Alabama High- way Department. “We are going to prose- cute over and over and over,” said Asst. Atty. Gen. William McKnight. The state has won con- victions on two indictments against Miss Latham by out- lining a scheme in which the State says Robert O. Wilson, a suspended department su- pervisor indicted with her, forged orders for equipment parts from the Montgomery Machinery and Supplies Inc., of which she was secre- tary-treasurer. The state thus far has presented testimony that Wilson also forged docu- ments saying the ordered parts were received from the company, while actually they were not, and author- ized payment for the parts. The state further has presented testimony tracing the checks to the company’s account, then to Miss Lath- am’s hands, either through a money order or her personal checking account. After the alleged plot was summarized by the state, the defense closing arguments pivoted mainly around the contention that Miss Latham was being persecuted, rath- er than prosecuted, as ‘‘the weakest link in the chain,” and that she had not com- mitted fraud because state officials—specifically Wil- son—directed her not to de- liver the equipment listed on the orders but other parts. Testimony showed that some parts bearing com- pany identification were lo- cated at highway depart- ment divisions around the state, and witnesses testified at least two truckloads of equipment came from the company after investigation of the scandal began. “*To commit fraud you must take away from some- body something they don’t want to give,’’ Lowery ar- gued. ‘““You can’t commit fraud if something is given by the owner’s consent,’’ he said, referring to Wilson’s alleged role in authorization of the payments. - Throughout, the defense attempted to pin the scandal on Wilson, to characterize the highway department as a bungling bureaucracy, and to paint Miss Latham as a victim of circumstance. McKnight called the entire defense ‘‘a smoke screen,’’ saying Miss Latham willing- ly participated by accepting money for no merchandise in more than 200 transactions. ‘“‘It was only after the fraud was discovered,’’ he Said, ‘“‘that this lady gladly turned over everything she had.”’ May 29, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Democratic Runoff Tuesday By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer To Jere Beasley and Charles Woods—and other ambitious state politi- cians—the governor’s office in 1978 is as much at stake in Tuesday’s runoff as is the lieutenant governor’s chair for the next four years. Whichever wins the Demo- cratic nom i - nation—provided he elimi- nates Republican Don Col- lins in November—will be poised as a front-runner in the race for the state’s top executive job four years hence. And he’11 probably be run- ning for the duration of those four years. Even more — than basking in the limelight as the state’s No. 2 elected offi- cial between now and 1978 is the possibility of actually taking over the governor’s job should George Wallace not complete another four- year term. For whatever reason, and there are several, however JERE BEASLEY remote, Wallace could, create a vacancy that would be filled under the law by the, lieutenant governor, making that man the incumbent gov- ernor in 1978 and the one with the edge on a full four-year term. Wallace not only figures heavily in the future of who- ever is elected lieutenant governor, he holds the key to the election itself. Wallace, however, has not chosen to publically utilize that key, much to the cha- grin of both Woods and Beas- ley. Both candidates have been claiming their allegiance to the governor, who won the Democratic nomination for a third term by perhaps the largest margin in state his- tory, in hopes that the Wal- lace votes will be theirs on Tuesday. This devotion ‘to Wallace by Woods and Beasley is a new found or redeiscovered love at best, sinée neither has a record of pure faithfull- ness. Woods ran for governor unsuccessfully against Wal- lace and against his late wife Lurleen, and Beasley’s hos- tility to the Wallace adminis- tration was clearly evident over long stretches of his tenure as presiding officer of the Alabama Senate.

Despite the directive, some in the Wallace camp have taken up the banner of one or the other a bringing a sharp split in the ranks of the governor's al- lies. Over-all, the race has been essentially a quiet one, with Woods calling for a change that will give the common man a break and dilute the power of special interest groups, and Beasley saying his experience and accom- plishments in the past four years have earned him a sec- ond term. In fact, the lieutenant gov- ernor’s office should be one of the less influential of state government, in terms of pol- icy-making and directing the course of the state. The Alabama Constitution charges the lieutenant gov- ernor only with keeping the State Senate running in a parliamentary fashion as the presiding officer of that body, and with taking over for the governor should he be CHARLES WOODS June 2, 1974 > \fJACK OWEN absent or incapacitated. Also appearing on Tues- day's runoff ballot will be statewide races for the nomi- naticn for state auditor, commissioner of agriculture and industries and place one on the Public Service Com- mission (PSC), In the auditor's election Mrs. Bettye Frink of Leeds faces Mrs. Martha Adams of Montgomery. Mrs. Frink, who polled 303,000 votes in the primary, is no newcomer to the politi- cal scramble. She was elected secretary of state in 1958 at the age of 25, and then became state auditor in 1962. Her race for State treasurer was unsuc- cessful in 1966, but in 1970 ; Mrs. Frink again appeared on the ccene when she won a | pointed incumbent, seat on the State Board of Education. The 1966 loss was due in part to bad relations with the Wallace administration, but Mrs. Frink has changed her “JIM ZEIGLER BETTYE FRINK style since, being a Wallace loyalist while serving on the school board. Mrs. Adams came in sec- ond in the primary balloting, but her 121,000 votes num- bered fewer than half those received by Mrs. Frink. Mrs. Adams hasn't held statewide elective office, but she has been associated with Alabama j;olitical life as a former assistant to Howard Hendrix, Wallace’s labor di- rector. Now the owner of a florist shop, she also was once the ookkeeper-treasurer for a local of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and has won the en- dorsement of the Alabama Labor Council, AFL-CIO, The agriculture commis- sioner’s race pits the ap- McMillan Lane, against for. mer commissioner A.W. Todd. Todd led the field of four primary candidates with 264,000 votes, and Lane was s MARTHA ADAMS No. 2 at 238,000 votes. Todd has been familiar in government circles as a Rus- selville state senator who first won tie commissioner's job in 1954, then unsucces- sfully sought a term as gov- ernor in 1958, and became head of the agriculture de- partment again in 1962. Lane’s name has been less of a household word. He rose from a political unknown last year when appointed by’ Wallace to the commission- er’'s post upon the death of Commissioner M.D. ‘‘Pete’’ Gilmer. The main issue in this race has been the Alabama Dairy Commission, which Todd says should be eliminated, and Lane moderately de- fends, saying some control of milk prices is needed. In the PSC race incumbent C.C. ‘Jack’? Owen, who won about 213,000 primary votes, faces Jim Zeigler, who came in second with some 133,000 ballots.

        "ocr_text": "Proposed Port Troubled; Commission Seeks Aid By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama's proposed Ameraport is floundering in deep water, and the major oil companies, knowingly or not, may sink it. Members of the Ameraport Offshore Harbor and Ter- minal Commission are working strenuously in Wash- ington, D.C., attempting to bail out the project aimed at locating a deep water oil terminal off the Alabama-Mis- sissippi coast. The terminal or harbor would be a dropping-off point for imported oil carried to this country in the huge tank- ets unable to dock in most U.S. ports due to shallow wa- ter. Necessary to this and similar projects is a federal law detailing 4icensing and construction procedures, and the bill recently passed by the U.S. House dealt a blow to the Alabama effort. The bill backed by superport advocates here would set up a new federal agency charged With overseeing such facilities would give public bodies first option on obtaining licenses, demand that oil companies establish a contingency fund for cleaning up oil spills, and author- ize bistate compacts so more than one state—like Mis: sissippi and Alabama—could join to supervise super- port operations from the state level. The bill passed by the House with the support of the oil industry contains none of these provisions. The industry bill is especially accommodating to two consortiums of oil companies seeking superports off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, “The commission and its director, however, are hoping to change that in the U.S, Senate. Perhaps the most damaging aspect of the House- passed bill is the lack of authorization for bi-state com: pacts, Bill Moore, assistant to the commission director, said Monday that current federal law governing such com- pacls requires time-consuming procedures that would place Alabama and Mississippi at a disadvantage in re: lation to the efforts of the private industry superport groups in Texas and Louisiana, “Time is of the essence,” Moore said, ‘Could we go it alone (without Mississippi)? We've looked at that cons tingency, but we don't want to do it.” From the start Ameraport was a joint effort of the two states, both hoping to reap substantial economic benefit {rom the location of new industries and the creation of new jobs tangential to a superport, Governments of the two states also want some local control of any deep water facility, which would be as- sured if the states obtain a superport license for which they could apply to the federal government only under lerms of a bi-state compact, The two-state agency formed through such a compact Ihen would supervise construction and operation of the port by private industry, In Texas and Louisiana the oil companies themselves plan to get the licenses and run the ports, not the governments, Moore characterized the fight for an amenable Senate bill as an up-hill battle, considering the strength of the national oil lobby, Even if the desired legislation is lost, he said, the com mission is unlikely to drop the Ameraport project, but instead will attempt to alter plans that have been in the making for the last several years, June 18, 1974 \f"

The company recently received a federal drilling per- mit to begin oil exploration on a tract of submerged land that may hold the biggest oil find of the eastern Gulf. Exxon leased the nine square mile tract from the U.S, Interior Department in December along with Mobil Oil Co. and two smaller firms for a total of more than $211 million, Exxon paid the lion’s share of the bid and will conduct drilling operations. This bid was the highest of those offered for more than 80 tracts off the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi and Florida, bringing a premium price because company tests indicated that it holds the greatest potential for a major oil discovery. Conservation groups, however, are especially pro- testing oil drilling on this and area tracts due to their ii to some of the loveliest coastline along the ulf. Led by the Sierra Club, these groups filed suit in U.S. District Court in Tampa, hoping first to stop the sale of leases, then to halt the approval of drilling permits by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Judge W. Terrell Hodges of the Tampa court denied the plea to prohibit the sale, and has refused to delay awarding of permits pending a decision on the merits of the case—whether the government should be ordered kkk 1k II not to grant permission to drill. Lack of a restraining order against the granting of permits or against drilling has placed Exxon in a pecu- liar position: the company was awarded a permit last week and is not prohibited from drilling, but if the costly exploration does begin, the court could later demand the permit be revoked. Exxon officials say they are hoping for an early deci- sion, and have indicated they expect to begin drilling within weeks. The company is expected to wait at least that long for a decision from Judge Hodges, and not to delay action further if he rules in their favor and the decision is ap- pealed by the environmentalists to a higher court. An Exxon spokesman said a drilling exploration ship now is available in New Orleans, La., and can be at the site off Destin within a week. He said the ship and later the permanent drilling rigs, which will be raised if oil is discovered, will not be vis- ible from the shore, which is populated by numerous Alabamians throughout the summer months, Exxon's is the second permit granted by the USGS for drilling in-the eastern Gulf. The first went to Gulf Oil Co., which already has made an oil discovery during exploratory drilling on a tract off the Mississippi coast. .

        "ocr_text": "’way Case Judges May Face Recuse By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley said Wednesday he may ask members of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals to step down from a case in which the appellate judges are asked: to force Judge Richard Emmet off a High- way Department fraud trial. In a brief filed on Emmet’s behalf with the court, Baxley and Asst. Atty. Gen. William McKnight said that if the five judges take certain actions in determining Emmet’s case, they will be guilty of ‘conflict of interest,’’ and: will themselves be asked to, recuse. The brief was filed in prep- aration for a Thursday hear- ing in the appeals court, dur- ing which the state's attor-. neys will attempt to show cause why Emmet should not be removed as presiding judge from the Montgomery Circuit Court case of Howard White, state purchasing agent. Attorneys for White, in- dicted along with Montgom- ery businesswoman Ruby Lee Latham and other state officials in a $94,000 highway fraud case, asked the ap- peals court to order Emmet off the case for showing ‘bias and prejudice” toward defendant White. The appellate judges did temporarily prohibit Em- met from sitting in White's case, pending Thursday's hearing and their final deci- sion. In a strongly-worded docu- ment of 37 pages, the attor- ney general said he has no particular desire that Em- met preside over White's trial, but that he is defending all five Montgomery circuit judges and all the law-abid- , ing citizens of Alabama from ‘the ballyhoo, confusion of issues, distortion of facts, in- neundo and vicious attacks on the trial court which have existed so far.” Baxley attacked the argu- ments made by White's law- yers, and threatened to ask for the appellate judges’ dis- qualification in connection with al controversial etter written by Emmet to these same jurists. In that letter, Emmet told why he set high bonds for the highway case defend- ants—White’s bond $50,000—and asked the Court of Criminal Appeals not to lower the bonds because the defendants might flee and because their testimony could lead to the exposure of vast corruption within state government. The appeals judges filed a complaint against Emmet for the letter, and he sub- sequently was censured for misconduct by the new Ala- bama Court of the Judiciary, mainly because he did not in- form the defendants of the letter. Baxley said that ‘‘if in fact’ the appellate judges filed the complaint, and if they base a decision against Emmet upon the resulting misconduct censure, there would exist a “‘personal in- terest’’ and a ‘‘conflict of in- terest’’ on the part of the ap- peals court. He also claimed the pro- ceedings of the Court of the Judiciary, and its censure against Emmet, made no mention of ‘‘prejudice, bias or unfitness’ of Emmet in regard to the highway case defendants. Other sections of the brief cite earlier decisions of vari- ous courts that charges of prejudice and bias alone, without charges that a judge had pecuniary or personal interest in a case, are not suf- ficient to disqualify that judge. ‘At issue here, specific- ally, is whether or not a trial judge can publicly condemn the commission of crimes in a community (and) con- demn the imposition of fraud on the people of the commu- nity,” Baxley said in refer- ence to Emmet’s comments before a departing grand jury which also have been pi- votal in White's arguments. Emmet said then that judges should be ‘‘fearless in looking into political graft,’’ and pledged to ‘‘continue to vigorously pursue the truth and the complete truth in any case that is presented before me.” Baxley also claimed that many rulings made by Em- met have been distorted by the defendants, taken out of context, or ‘‘linked to some alleged dispute’? between the appeals court and Em- met. “It seems to me,” Baxley said, “that this is the type conduct that we should ap- plaud in a trial judge rather than condemn.” June 20, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Object: New Senate Rules Beasley Calls for Reform “By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Recalling how the filibus- ter has stymied untold legis- lative sessions, Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley announced Friday he is creating a committee to propose reform of the State Senate rules. Beasley revealed his plan at the first convention of the Alabama Joint Council of Laborers and Operating En: gineers, AFL-CIlO—the State Highway Department union. ‘‘Labor had a hard time getting some of their bills through the legislature in the last four years,’’ Beasley said, oftentimes due to long- winded senators whoa blocked all action by filibus- tering. Beasley said he expects the new committee to tackle the filibuster rule, as well as others, and to report its rec- ommended changes to the December organizational session of the legislature. The incumbent lieutenant governor, who just won a tough race for renomination but still faces Republican Don Collins in November, said later that he will appoint nine Senate nominees, some incumbents and others new- comers, to study rules re- form. Incumbent State Sen. L.D. ‘“*‘Dick’’ Owen of Bay Minette will be chairman, and State Rep. Fred Jones of Mont- gomery, who won a Senate nomination in May, will be vice chairman. Beasley said other mem- bers will be announced next week, but gave assurances that the committee will be in- dependent, not ‘‘weighted’’ toward either himself or Gov. George Wallace. Their work will be funded through the Commission on Intergovernmental Cooper- ation. Beasley said he'll keep hands off the group, giving members free rein to pro- pose whatever changes they feel necessary. He did say, however, that he personally could support proposals to have all com- mittee meetings open, to re- quire recorded committee votes, and to restrict the fili- buster rule without eliminat- ing it entirely. ‘‘But that will be up to the committee,’’ he said. In outlining his plan to the union members, Beasley said that while campaigning ie “heard more people cus- ing the fitibuster than any- hing else.”’ “I didn’t filibuster a single ninute in the last four ‘ears,’ he said, ‘‘because he lieutenant governor ant filibuster.’ He noted that there does exist a means of cutting off debate—by invoking clo- ture—but that senators at- tempted to use the difficult maneuver only once, and were successful. “I’m asking this com- mittee to take a close look at the filibuster rule, to make it workable,’’ Beasley said. ‘‘It shouldn't be abolished all to- gether, but used with dis- cretion.”’ ; State Auditor Melba Till Allen, the Democratic nomi- nee for state treasurer, also spoke to the Highway De- partment workers, noting that as of January she will be on the state employes retire- ment board and urging the men to ‘‘come and tell me any problem, any com- plaint.”’ She said that as auditor she at times has had to meet state employes on the sly, so their bosses wouldn't know they were tipping her off to inside information. Dr. Higdon C. Roberts, di- rector of the Center for La- bor Education and Re- search, later told the work- ers that with a union, they ‘‘don't have to sneak around to see state officials any more. Remember, govern- ment is management,’’ he said. ‘‘You can’t get any- thing done unless you do it collectively.” June 22, 1974 \f"

Top officials ~ or their spokesmen — from Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas all lodged protests at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hearing, call to gather testimony on whether the DuPont Company should be allowed to throw thousands of tons of chemical wastes into Gulf waters about 20 miles south of here. The hearing as ordered by a federal court, where Florida Atty, Gen, Robert Shevin had filed suit seeking to block the dumping already approved by a regional EPA office. The court also has temporarily halted DuPont from using the Gulf site, where the company eventually hopes to deposit chemical waste matter ftom a West Virginia plant. Whether that waste, especially one of its components, antimony, would have a toxic effect on Gulf marine life was the major question of the hearing, and a question not answered decisively Monday. DuPont witnesses held antimony is biodegradable and will dispurse to a nontoxic level in the water, while opponents claim the substance could cause serious damage to lish and even to humans. Two spokesmen for Alabama Atty, Gen, Bill Baxley, who has joined Shevin’s suit, were among about two doz- en witnesses testifying during the first day of the hear- ing that could extend through Wednesday, David Dunn, a research aid to Baxley, cited studies showing small amount of antimony cause chromisome breakage in the human body, and also may produce can- cer if ingested, for example, by a person eating a fish containing antimony. This information Dunn said, came from the few stud- ies ever made regarding how less than leathal doses of antimony affect people. “In ‘light of all the unanswered questions, lack of in- formation and hazardous indications,” Dunn said, “we a it is not in the public interest to issue this per- mit,” Henry Caddell, chief of Baxley's environmental pro- tection division, said the people of Alabama “view is as a Strong imposition to be settled with the toxic waste of a company 1,000 miles away” and charged that DuPont has failed to “adequately explore” alternative disposal methods. State Rep. H. L. “Sonny” Callahan of Mobile, speak- ing for Gov. George Wallace, said the proposed dump- ing threatens Alabama's commercial and recreational fisheries, and that the state's request the DuPont per- mit be rescended. Also testifying against Dupont was Wayne Swingall, a marine biologist with the Alabama Department of Con- servation, Swingall said, in contradiction to later testimony from a DuPont witness, that the proposed disposal area is heavily populated by plankton, which would retain the antimony in the waste, He then traced the antimony through the food chain, from the first fish who eats the « plankton, through the final step of human consumption, Atty, Gen.

        "ocr_text": "Supreme Court Rewerses Clenmnsure of Judge Emamet By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Supreme Court reversed Thursday a lower court ruling that cen- sured Montgomery Circuit Judge Richard Emmet for , misconduct in his handling of a highway fraud case. The decision likely will be cited by Emmet’s attorneys in a petition asking the Ala- bama Court of Criminal . Ap- peals to reconsider another case involving the circuit court judge, a case in which the appeals court last week found Emmet guilty of bias and disqualified him as judge in one of the highway fraud trials. Asst. Atty. Gen. William McKnight said he will file the petition for rehearing by Fri- day. If the appeals court re- fuses, McKnight plans to ap- peal the decision to the Su- preme Court in an effort to have Emmet reinstated as presiding judge in the bribe- ry trial of Howard White Jr., the state purchasing agent on voluntary leave. The criminal appeals court decision removing Emmet from White’s tria was based in large part or his earlier censure for mis: conduct by the Alabama Court of the Judiciary. It was this censure that the Supreme Court overturned The censure was the first decision rendered by the new Court of the Judiciary, which found Emmet guilty of mis- conduct for writing a letter to the Court of Criminal Ap- peals, asking the appellate judges not to reduce the bonds Emmet set for White and other defendants in the highway fraud cases. Emmet did not inform de- fense lawyers of the letter, in which he said the high bonds should not be reduced be- cause he had received an anonymous call that one of the defendants might flee and because all the defend- ants, according to prose- cutors, could give evidence leading ‘‘to the very core of a great deal of corruption’’ - State government. . The high court said the let- ' ter “was clearly an act of ju- ' dicial impropriety’’ in at- _ tempting to influence the ap- pellate judges, but was not sufficient grounds for a find- ing of misconduct. The decision, written by Justice James H. Faulkner, said misconduct is ‘defined as any unlawful behavior by a public officer in relation to the duties of his office,”’ and the letter could not be consid- ered unlawful behavior. The court in no way in- - dicated, however, whether in . the letter would be sufficient grounds to find Emmet biased against the defend- ants, and thus justification for removing him from their trials. Also, the appeals court that removed Emmet from White’s case cited evidence of bias other than the letter. The Supreme Court opin- ion, which dealt briefly with the offense of misconduct it- self; may give some future direction to actions of the Court of the Judiciary, created to hear complaints against judges charged with misconduct or with failure or inability to perform duties. “Any time a judge of any court is charged with mis- conduct in office,” the opin- ion reads, “‘it shivers the timbers of the judicial sys- tem. ‘Public confidence in the courts is shaken and the ad- ministration of justice is ren- dered suspect in the eyes of the citizens; the impartiality of the judges is questioned.” A judge should not be - found guilty of misconduct, the court said, unless his ac- tion ‘involves intentional wrongdoing or total lack of concern for one’s conduct.”’ The letter Emmet wrote involved the bonds he set for. White, Montgomery busi- nesswoman Ruby Lee Lath- am, and Robert Wilson, a suspended highway depart- ment supervisor. Miss Latham and Wilson were charged with defraud- ing the state of nearly $94.000 through a scheme in which the highway department or- dered and paid for machine- ry parts that never were de- livered by her company, Miss Latham is appealing convictions on two of 23 in- dictments, each conviction carrying a 10-year prison sentence. White was charged with il- legally accepting gifts from Miss Latham or her com- pany. Supreme Court Justice Hugh Maddox said in a con- curring opinion that he agrees Emmet is not guilty of misconduct, but added he thinks the Court of the Judiciary had no jurisdiction to hear the charge against him becuase the letter was written one day before the Court of the Judiciary was created through passage of the judicial article to the Ala- bama Constitution. The judicial article was approved in a Dec. 17, 1978, referendum. aT are Ce \f"

The needed money—about $125 ,000—w ill come from the Governor’s Emergency Fund and a State Building Commission fund used for repair and upkeep of state buildings, according to Men- tal Health Commissioner Taylor Hardin, aA member of the board subcommittee charged with finding the ecash. 0 i The money hunt became mecessary when the towest bid for the project, which in- eludes rewiring and in- stallation of new air condi- tioning and heating systems, came to about $300,000, con- siderably above the total left in the board's budget. The Governor’s Emergen- ey Fund, reserved for unex- pected costs that can’t be covered by the budgets of State departments, is con- trolled by the governor and his finance director, in- dicating Gov. George Wal- lace finally did comsent to aid the renovation project. Earlier, Wallace had re- fused the money, saying sim-- Ply that it wasn’t available. | Most observers speculated | that Wallace, like his pre- decessors. was reluctant to spend the public’s money on his own behalf, regardless of the fact that the mansion’s electrical wiring had been condemned by fire officials. When asked how much would come from each of the. two funds, Hardin hedged the. answer, saying details hadn’t ,. been worked out yet. The mansion board has un- til Aug. 10 to sign the con- tract for repair work, but the commissioner did cast some doubt over when and if the work will begin. ‘“‘Having reached this point,’ he said, ‘‘the next matter the committee will have to consider is the time this could be done with the least inconvenience and dis- ruption to the governor and his family.”’ Hardin said the board chairman, -State Sen. Jimmy Clark of Eufaula, plans to meet with Gov. and Mrs. Wallace soon, probably next week, to ‘‘get a timetable on when this (work) will be least disruptive.’’ The first family ‘‘should have a strong voice in when it should be done,’’ Hardin said. At a board meeting earlier this menth Mrs. Cornelia Wallace said construction work in the fall of the year is especially inconvenient, since the calendar of social and civic functions is most crowded then. There also is concern over where the Wallaces will re- side for the duration, having been warned that living in the Perry Street mansion . will be virtually impossible while work is underway, at’ least throughout September and October. Hardin said that if the gov- ernor and his wife find Present plans too inconven- ient, he hopes the board. can ““execute some sort of bind- ing contract at this time’’ for the work to be done in the fu- ture. ” August 1, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Comm ends Actions of (Nixon By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama’s') political lead- ers—whether friend or foe of Richard Nixon in the past—expressed almost unanimous endorsement of the President's resignation Thursday night and the hope for nationwide support of his successor. Gov. George C. Wallace, an unusual press conference held in the lobby of the Bir- mingham hospital where he is recovering from minor surgery, said immediately after Nixon’s announcement that he feels the President ‘“‘did the proper thing.’’ Terming Nixon’s talk graceful speech,’’ Wallace noted he was ‘‘never a sup- porter of Mr. Nixon political- at ‘<Q Wallace and Nixon at Huntsville, Freedom Day, 19074. ly and we had our differ- ences, but he was the Presi- dent, and I have prayed for his success. “‘Congress is now relieved of an awesome responsi- bility,’ the governor said, adding that most Americans ‘“‘are glad this phase of Wa- tergate is concluded, and that we can go on to other things.*” When asked how Nixon’s resignation would affect him politically, Wallace respond- ed: ‘‘The trauma that our na- tion has suffered transcends other things, such as George Wallace.’’ Montgomery industrialist Winton M. ‘‘Red’*’ Blount, who served as Nixon’s post- master general during the President’s first term of of- fice, said the public ‘‘is gen- erally united in Knowing that it was in the best interest of the nation that he resign,’ considering Nixon’s dis- closure Monday that he with- held certain Watergate evi- dence. Blount cited Nixon accom- plishments during office in- cluding the ending of the Vietnam War, ‘‘dramatic changes in our relations with Russia and China,** new do- mestic programs, and ‘‘sig- nificant changes in the makeup of the Supreme Court.”” Saying he is ‘‘deeply sad- dened’’ by Thursday's ac- tion, Blount added that he knows ‘‘firsthand what a courageous leader (Nixon) has been.”’ August 9, 1974 > \fBlount said he believes “the shabby events of Water- gate’’ eventually will pale when compared to ‘‘the great accomplishments of the Nixon years.\" State Democratic Chair- man Robert Vance said he is not ‘too suprised at this in- evitable result of a shocking sequence of events,’’ al- though Democrats “‘take no partisan pleasure at this con- clusion.\" Vance suggested that events of the past months may ‘‘awaken a determina- tion that we demand a new and higher standard of all in government in every level,” and expressed the hope that *‘we can unify in addressing the nation’s attentions and energies toward the crises which seem to be all about us. His GOP counterpart, Richard Bennett of Green- ville, called Nixon's lead- ership ‘‘inspired,\"” and ex- pressed confidence ‘‘that history will write him as one of our greatest presidents.” Bennett called Vice Presi- dent Gerald Ford a man “‘of unquestioned integrity with unsurpassed knowledge of government,”’ as well as ‘‘an old friend of this state.” “One of President Nixon's actions for which we are greatly indebted,\"’ Bennett said, ‘‘was his selection of Gerald Ford to be vice presi- dent.\" : Elvin McCary, the Annis- ton realtor and former state senator who is the Republi- can candidate against Wal- lace in the November guber- natorial race, called Thurs- day ‘‘a real sad day for the country.\" Alabama “For the long range wel- fare of the country it might be better if we had gone through the constitutional process (of impeachment),”’ he said, adding the hope that Nixon's resignation won't set a precedent. McCary called on his party and the entire nation to ‘'ral- ly around’ Gerald Ford, and further urged Congress to Pass campaign reform legis- lation ‘‘with some teeth in it to prevent this situation from occurring in the fu- ture.” He also chastised Con- gress for being ‘‘too long... . occupied with Watergate-re- lated problems,”’ to the det- riment of the nation's eco- nomic situation. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley also called on the American pub- lic to give Ford bipartisan support ‘‘as he attempts to put the national government back in order.\" “I personally feel deeply for the Nixon family,\"’ Beas- ley said, although he ex- pressed the belief that Nix- on’s decision to quit ‘‘was the only decision he could have made under the circum- stances,’’ and is one that ‘will be in the best interests of the President, his family and the American people.” The GOP candidate oppos- ing Beasley in the November election, Donald Collins, could not be reached. Johnny Ford, the black Tuskegee mayor who openly supported Nixon in 1972 des- pite the fact that the mayor is a Democrat, said the Wa- tergate evidence recently re- vealed by Nixon ‘‘has clearly indicated his involvement in the obstruction of justice’ and makes the President's resignation ‘‘in the best in- terests of the country.” Concerning Gerald Ford's elevation to the presidency, Mayor Ford noted he and several other black leaders recently met with the vice president and were assured he has ‘'a genuine interest in the problems of blacks and other minorities and poor people in the country.” “IT think he will be very re- sponsive,’’ the Tuskegee mayor said of the vice presi- dent. '‘He said he would have an open door policy for blacks.\"’ GOP State Com- mitteewoman Jean Sullivan of Selma said that although she is ‘‘deeply distressed\" that Nixon felt he must re- sign, she still agrees with his decision. Mrs. Sullivan, who has been publicly critical of Nix- on's Watergate in- volvement, said under ques- tioning that the resignation now ‘‘will have a strength- ening effect’’ on the party's position in November. “The cloud we have all been under for the last year and a half has now di- mished,\"’ she said. Montgomery Probate Judge Perry Hooper, the state's GOP national com- mitteeman and a candidate for circuit judge this fall, cited Nixon's accom- plishments in office and sug- gested his decision to leave was ‘“‘not made because of guilt or innocence, but be- cause he felt it would be in the best interest of the coun- try if we had a smooth transi- tion into a new adminis- ‘tration.”’ Hooper said he ‘‘can’t hon- estly evaluate’’ whether Nix- on should have resigned, since he doesn’t ‘‘have all the facts.\"’ He said he does not feel the President's action will hurt the party nationally or in this State, or effect Hooper’s own candidacy for office. “The only benefit I see is the possible unity among Re- publicans,’’ Hooper said, ‘‘a feeling that while the Re- publicans have been cleansed of their sins, have the Democrats?\" On the municipal level, Montgomery Mayor Jim Robinson would not com- ment. and Public Works Commissioner Cliff Evans said he would not have a statement because he hadn't ‘listened to the tapes yet. Public Affairs Commis- sioner Jack Rucker, how- ever, said that under the cir- cumstances he feels it is best for the country that Nixon has stepped down. ‘Now that Watergate is behind us,’’ Rucker said, ‘*‘we can get on with our country’s progress and try to re-establish the confidence other countries had in us.”’ A long-time leader of Montgomery's black com- munity, E.D. Nixon, said he believes the President's de- cision is ‘‘best for the coun- try.” ‘*He admits he has done wrong,’ said E.D. Nixon, ‘and if he can get away with resigning it would be better for him and better for the country if he is out.” August 9, 1974 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "AlabamiansGreeted Nixon With Warmth, Enthusiasm By MARCIA KUNSTEL - Advertiser Staff Writer “The American people are not a nation of quitters,”’ President Richard Nixon said in Alabama six months ago. Six months before his political and personal world shattered. Six months before Richard Nixon quit. The comment came at the Feb. 18 Honor America Day in Huntsville, the kind of pa- triotic rally Nixon especially relished, and it was in- terpreted then as an in- dication that the President . was standing stalwart be- fore the Watergate revela- , tions that at that time had - implicated © only indirectly himasapartyto wrongdoing. And the people of Alabama responded with applause | and cheers and the kind of warmth Nixon had travelled to the South to find. ‘“‘We meet here today as Americans first, honoring America, which surmounts any differences we might have,’ Nixon said, eliciting broad-based support that hadn't been seen on a nation- al scale since his over- whelming victory at polls in 1972. He appeared in good spir- its and good health, and the crowd of some 50,000 people was pleased to see that. They were especially pleased when Nixon said: “Here in the heart of Dixie we find that the heart of America is good, the heart of America is strong, and we're going to continue to be a great nation. That event, Nixon’s sec- _ond.visit to Alabama as the nation's chief executive and his third trip here in his polit- ical career, perhaps marked the closing days of his most popular period among Ala- bamians. That popularity had been enjoyed since the Alabama electorate gave him nearly 729,000 votes in 1972 over the 219,000 cast for an opponent unpalatable to most Ala- bama voters, but it was a ' popularity that did erode as more became known about the private politics of the Oval Office. On May 26, 1971, Nix- on also won a warm recep- tion from Alabama residents ' during his first trip here as ' President. It was far from total sup- port that he found, however, since the majority of the people still owed their . first allegiance to Gov. George Wallace, the man expected to run against this President the following year. Back in the 1968 election the public showed its prefer- ence clearly, giving 643,518 votes to Wallace, 191,687 to Democratic U.S. Sen. Hu- bert Humphrey, and 138.064 to Nixon. Even given the Wallace factor, Nixon was more wel- come in Alabama in 1971 than he would have been in many other sectors of the na- tion due to one issue: the Vietnam War. Greeted by some 20,000 people at the waterfront in Mobile, the President of fi- ciated at ceremonies mark- ing the beginning phases of construction of the Ten- nessee-Tombigbee water- way, then passed tens of thousands more during a motorcade through the Port City. Another 80,000 people lined the streets of Birmingham later that same day, where Nixon travelled to brief about 100 news executives from the South on his reve- nue sharing proposals. American policy in Viet- nam is succeeding in a way that will ‘‘give us a chance to have a more peaceful South- east Asia, a more peaceful Pacific,’ Nixon also told the newsmen. Making a bid for political support that was to evolve into the ‘‘southern strate- gy.’ Nixon also proclaimed his “utter contempt for the double hypocritical stan- dard of those northerners” who berate the South for ra- cial problems, yet do little to enhance their own race rela- tions. That strategy apparently worked, though its success undoubtedly would have been less had Goy. Wallace not been knocked out of the 1972 race by five bullets. There certainly was no winning strategy in 1960, the year Vice President Nixon paid his first call on Alaba- mians during his_ unsuccess- ful campaign for president. At a Birmingham appear- ance before some 30,000 people, Nixon said his cam- Ppaigning in the South ‘is a tribute to Alabama, which has been long ignored by Democrats. ‘“‘That situation is wrong for Alabama, and it isn’t good for the United States,” he said, adding it’s time the Democrats stopped ‘‘taking the South for granted.”’ Later that year Alabama voters cast 324,000 votes for John F. Kennedy, and 238,000 for Richard Nixon. Outside. those three visits, Nixon has not had tre- mendous personal contact with the people of Alabama. He did choose a native son, Winton M. Blount, to be his postmaster general, and made his presence as Presi- dent felt through the usual appointments to federal po- sitions. For example, Nixon ap- pointed U.S. Attys. Ira De- ment in Montgomery, Way- man Sherrer in Birmingham and Charles White-Spunner in Mobile. Appointed federal judges were Robert Varner in the Middle District, Brevard Hand in the Southern Dis- trict, and Sam Pointer, Foy Guin, Frank McFadden and James Hancock in the North- ern District. He declared disaster areas after devasting tornadoes swept through Alabama, and found wide acceptance here of his revenue sharing plan. And regardless of how many times he trekked to the state, and how many local residents he elevated to high federal positions, Nixon probably enjoyed a greater ideological rapport with Ala- bamians than with the people of many. if not most, other states.

        "ocr_text": "Tuskegee Plant Becomes Official By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer It wasn’t your run-of-the-mill industrial announce- ment. Alabama’s once segregationist governor sat at center Stage Monday in the building where the Confederacy was born, flanked by the young black mayor of Tus- kegee and the black industrialist promising to bring multi-millions to that city. News of the proposed oil refinery they jointly were an- nouncing had leaked nearly a week earlier, but that didn’t dull the edge of the event for the participants. Nor did it dim the excitement of the mixed audience whose members came not only from Alabama, but from New York and Mississippi and Georgia, as well. Hundreds of pairs of clapping black and white hands sporadically interrupted the principal speakers—Gov. George Wallace, Mayor Johnny Ford and industrialist Charles Wallace. The latter was formalizing his intention to build a $250 million oil refinery in Tuskegee, an undertaking that some state officials guessed would be the largest ‘black capital’ project in the nation. The prospect of such a major industry, with its new jobs and general boost to the local and state economy would be given a red carpet welcome, by state officials under any circumstances. But the fact that this is a black operation being located in a predominantly black work force was cause for addi- tional note. as Gov. Wallace recalled that it was a black man and a Photo by Jerry Smith white man—a slave and a former slaveholder—that Gov. Wallace Flanked by Mayor Ford (Left), Charles Wallace for Announcement founded Tuskegee Institute, and went on to predict greater opportunities for Tuskegee and Alabama. “We're going to work to make Alabama a place where you can realize the American dream,” he said. “The American dream is peace’ and prosperity. This an- nouncement is another step in the direction of that dream.” Mayor Ford, who said he first began working to bring the refinery to Tuskegee two years ago when he heard Charles Wallace wanted to build one ‘in the Western Hemisphere,” also predicted progress. This event, he said, shows that ‘Alabama and the South have the ability to meet the problems facing her people. Some of us are black, some of us are white, but in the final analysis, all of us are Alabamians . . . working together for the good of the state.” Charles Wallace said a refinery ‘is something not particularly welcome in many states,’’ but praised the governor and industrial officials for keeping the door open here. It isn't money that builds refineries,’ he said, ‘but people.” After the announcement, the group travelled to Tus- kegee for the ‘ceremonial’ groundbreaking, an event ‘ that won't be followed by the real thing unless the Wal- lace and Wallace Chemical and Oil Corp. wins approval from the Public Service Commission to condemn for pipeline rights-of-way a 214-mile strip of land con- necting the proposed refinery to oil supplies in Mobile.

        "ocr_text": "Train Shed Recorded for Posterity By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A team of federal archi- tects and engineers is here this week on an emergency mission—to record for American posterity ‘‘an en- dangered engineering spe- cies.\" The three men are mea- suring every joint, recording every detail of the train shed behind Union Station, which is one of 10 large-span trussed train sheds left Standing in the nation. They came here at the request of State Archivist Milo Howard, who at least wants an accurate recording of the Montgomery shed in the event it goes the way of perhaps hundreds of similar structures that have been casually leveled in recent years. That is a likely event, un- less the city or private pre- servation groups come for- ward with enough hard cash to maintain the shed in safe condition. The recorders form the: ’ Eric DeLoney, chief archi- , tect for HAER, said How- ard's inquiry first interested the federal agency in the status of such sheds, leading researchers to discover theB Structures are gered engineering species.” For example, the record- ing team's visit to Montgom- ery follows an earlier trip by associate Jack Boucher, who took the official photographs of the 1897 shed back in March. When Boucher was here, 13 sheds existed in the na- tion. Now there are 10. Also in the intervening months the city’s Land- marks Foundation has not been idly waiting for the steel to come crashing down. James Loeb, Landmarks president, said Tuesday that the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which owns the shed, has agreed after some pressure to donate the build- ing to the city, provided the - city maintain it. Originally, when the city Emergency Recording Unit! purchased Union Station of the Historic American En-| gineering Record (HAER),| from the L.

During the four days of travel, Wallace also will speak to the Greater New Or- leans Chamber of Com- merce and the annual con- ventions of the National Leg- islative Conference and the Young Democrats of Amer- ica. Monday was the gover- ‘nor’s first day back on the job after his Birmingham hospital stay, and he has made just one formal ap- pearance since then. Wal- lace had a light schedule with no appointments Tues- day, although Wednesday was filled with office visits. Elvin Stanton, the gover- states Over two have been consumed nor’s assistant press secre- tary, said no major speeches are anticipated during Wal- lace’s travels. : New Orleans likely will be the site of a talk on the growth potential of the South, one of Wallace’s fa- vorite topics that also should be a hit with the local cham- ber there.

Countering the past billing that this appearance will be a ‘‘testimonial,’’ Stanton said only that the governor will ‘‘speak five or six minutes to the  congrega- tion.’’ forts to get Wallace to the Lynchburg service, with the congregation even offerring to send an airplane to the 1972 Democratic Convention to pick up the governor. Conflicting engagements have prevented his accept- ing the invitation until now, Stanton said. Keeping in line with recent descriptions of Wallace’s ac- tivities, aides have called the upcoming speeches ‘‘non-po- litical’’ in nature, despite the fact that Wallace is a candi- date for reelection in No- vember and likely a presi- dential candidate in 1976.

        "ocr_text": "Will Ethics Law Be Broken Before lt Can Be Used? By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Agnew, Connally, Kalmbach. ITT, the milk industry, the Maryland construction trade, All have the uncommon distinction of in- volvement—or alleged involvement—in the old-fashion- ed political payoff, the kind of thing most Americans thought probably existed in some few and scattered | quarters like the bowels of Chicago, but the kind of thing they wanted to believe was, for the most part, a closed Chapter on isolated, rather distasteful period of the American political saga, It is obvious now that the chapter wasn't ended in the era of the robber barons or when the lid was blown off Teapot Dome. It is obvious now that the faith was misplaced and that Closer to the truth was the lingering suspicion usually - ot voiced except in the quiet of the home as Mr, Aver- age Joe read or watched the news that some special in- terest again had triumphed at his expense, ; Those who did yell and scream about the back room: buying and selling of the American Dream -were heard by few, or, if they made enough noise to be heard by many, were branded as radicals of one sort or another, more picturesquely referred to as “nattering nabobs of negativism.”” And the practice of the payoff has not been limited to the Nixon inner circle, At least juries in New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, Cali- fornia and Alabama, to mention a few locales, have been led to believe otherwise. The optimistic dream of a New World where the parts work together for the good of the whole has been be- trayed. Or perhaps the dreamer has simply come of age. It's appropriate that as the nation approaches its 200th birthday its people are wondering whether what used to be contemptuously labelled the “decadence” of he Old World is me nin it is, it might not be so bad, as long as the people re- spond in a mature, realistic manner, and don't bury their heads in the dream again. Distasteful as it may be, it is time to realize that not all seekers and holders of ‘public @ffice are good, virtuous men and women whose major interest is the public in- terest. More than realizing it, it is time to do something about it, In Alabama something has been done, something called the ethics law. It is too soon to tell whether the law will have the desir- ed effect of eliminating conflicts of interest or the old payola routine, such as apparently has been practiced by public servants across the nation, judging from the material surfacing in courtrooms these days. After all, what the stalute prohibits has been forbid den in a broader sense by laws that have been on the books for years. The ethics law's basic addition is a requirement that public figures swear they have no compromising en- tanglements—and that they show where their financial interests do lie, just to make sure. Maybe it will work, Maybe it won't, The problem is that this law might be scratched from the books before it has-been fully tested. On Monday is the hearing in the first of several suits \"filed against the law by various groups of government officials and employes who question whether the ethics law can be constitutionally applied to them. Whatever the outcome of the circuit court case, it un-” doubledly will be appealed by the losing side as high as it can be appealed, Once the courts have finished with the law, the mon- key then reverts to the back of the body that created it in the first place—the Alabama Legislature. If the judicial system finds the law contrary to con- stitutional dictates, it will be up to the legislators to write a replacement. Even if the law emerges from the judicial system in- lact, several lawmakers, in an election season effort to curry favor with the local chieftans who most bitterly oppose it, have pledged to dilute the ethics law in 1975. How the legislature reacts depends in large part on how their constituents react. Some brief, but concentrated contact with that august body leads to the conclusion that the folks at home can swing a mean club, They just don’t do it often. The 1975 legislative session should show whether the humerous smoking guns of the past year are quickly for- gotten, and the heads again are buried in the dream. August 18, 1974 \f"

But he did ex- tend that activism into the area of social reform and helped generate a new en- thusiasm for change in the group that until recent years has epitomized the estab- lishment. Calling his predecessor ‘‘a very effective president,’’ Lee cited passage of the Ju- dicial Article to the Alabama Constitution and creation of a prison study committee as the two outstanding accom- Plishments of Nachman'‘s year in office. Nachman and Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Howell Heflin have been credited as prime movers behind the judicial reform measure that’ will standard- ize the court system through- out the state, provide a means of reining in errant judges, and generally make Alabama courtroom proce- dures more efficient and modern. The twio men were in- timately involved in writing the new article, in making the compromises necessary to secure its legislative pas- sage, and in convincing the electorate it should cast bal- lots in its favor last Decem- ber. Heflin, who along with Nachman was presented an award for meritorious serv- ice at the bar’s annual meet- ing last month, readily agreed with Lee’s asséss- ment that the judicial article would have been lost without the active support of law- yers, support generated in large degree by Nachman's leadership. The chief justice also noted that Nachman helped steer the bar into areas of so- cial reform not previously addressed by the organiza- tion of Alabama attorneys. The primary exantple of this was the prison study committee, a group of both. ‘attorneys and. non-lawyers, wiich will continue delving into problems of, the correc- tional‘ system for the next two years. The first year report was issued just before the annual meeting, recommending nu- merous changes that can be accomplished both on the ad- ministrative level and through legislative action. The report spared no punc- hes in laying the blame for failures of the state’s pris- ons, and, as Nachman said, it hopefully will ‘‘jar those responsible for adminis- tration of the corrections system.”’ Another new study group created by Nachman is the task force to, analyze Ala- for conflicts of interest that beset other elected officials. Nachman says he still hopes to see in Alabama a method combining merit se- lection with a check by the elec- torate, and that he does plan to pursue a de-politicized judicjary from the ranks of the bar membership. As for his own assessment of the year gs president of the bar, Nachman says his greatest pleasure is derived from the fact that the pro- grams he began ‘‘were able to generate the kind of en- thusiasm and hard work at the bar that they did.\"’ “It convinced me that law- yers do want these changes, if they have the right kind of motivation,’ he said. “The spirit of the whole en- deavor was the thing I'm most proud of.”’ August 25, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Ethics Law To Take On Utilities ? By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama utilities could be the next group hard hit by the state ethics law, The utilities, such as Alabama Power Co. and South Central Bell Telephone Co., may be required to obtain all contracts with state agencies through the com- petitive bid process) and also to file with the Alabama Ethics Commission copies of each state contract. There are thousands of contracts between the utilities and the state each year, mainly because state depart: ments, and even department subdivisions, sign sepa- rate contracts for the services each needs. And none of (!:\"1\" is competitively bid. The problem i part revolves around the fact that huge, bureaucratic utilities somewhere in their ranks hold employes or officers related to state officials, who are regulated by the ethics law. Also, with a company such as Alabama Power which has 12,00) preferred stock holders, some of those in- vestors undoubtedly are state officials. The company thus becomes a business with which an official is associ- ated, and, as such, must meet certain provisions of the ethics law. The provisions in question are sections 9 and 16, The former forbids state officials, members of their families, and businesses with which they are associated to enter into contracts with the state except through competitive bid, and requires that copies of those con- tracts be filed with the Ethics Commission, Section 15 applies to any citizen who has an adult child, spouse, parent, brother or sister who is a state of- ficial. Such citizens are required to notify the commis- sion whenever they sign a state contract exceeding $1,000 and when they represent anyone for a fee before an arm of the state government. Frank Hawthorne, attorney for Alabama Power, con- tended before the Ethics Commission recently that the State's competitive bid law, which excludes utilities, should take precedence over section 9 of the ethics law, Utilities, he said, originally were excluded from the bid requirement because there is no competition for service in a given geographic area, and because utility rates already are regulated by a state agency—the Pubs lic Service Commission. To demonstrate the problem that would arise if the company were forced. to file copies of contracts. Haw: thorne unraveled a lengthy computer print-out showing the principals of thousands of contracts now in effect be- tween the power company and state government. The commission already has received an attorney general's opinion regarding the relationship of the eth: ‘ies law to the bid law, an opinion sought to clarify a sepa- rate question not related to the utilities, That opinion. said the ethics law supercedes the bid law, ‘a Hawthorne. however, has filed a brief with the com- mission detailing previdus court rulings that held the bid law supreme under similar circumstances in volving utilities, The commission agreed to ask the attorney general s office to reconsider the first opinion. partly in light ot the power company brief. and to provide legal preced- ence for the original opinion. The commissioners also indicated they will outline the problem in their report to the legislature. in which they’ are expected to recommend various changes they feel should be made in the law to ease its application.

        "ocr_text": "Interest Ruling Gives Builders Little Relief By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Representatives of the homebuilding and financing industries found little relief in Thursday’s court decision removing an 8 per cent ceil- ing from mortgage interest rates, saying the situation remains ‘‘cloudy’’ at best, -and could reach ‘‘crisis’’ -proportions by year’s end. Conventional mortgage lending, they predict, likely will remain close to the standstill that hit lending in- stitutions when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled July 25 that mortgage loans could not carry more than 8 per cent simple interest. Such a standstill would re- duce homebuilding activi-. ties—already hard hit by the traumas of inflation and tight money—to two-thirds of that experienced in Ala- bama last year, according to Don Slatton, executive vice president of the Home Buil- ders Association of Ala- bama. : ‘*‘The real damage is the people who won’t have a job,’’ Slatton said, ‘‘mostly blue collar workers like plumbers and electricians, the people who can least af- ford to miss a payday or two.’’ The problem lies in the Su- preme Court’s failure to de- cide whether mortgages should be governed by a 1940s statute setting max- imum simple interest rates at 8 per cent, or by the 1971 Mini-code, which allows 8 per cent add-on interest— about 11.6 per cent simple in- terest on the average 30-year home loan. The court originally ruled last month that the older law has precedence, but, after granting a petition for a re- hearing, decided Thursday to dismiss the case on a tech- nicality. ‘*This leaves us under an- other cloud, although not quite as black and bleak as the July 25 ruling,’’ said W. Douglas Amos, executive vice president of the Ala- bama Savings and Loan League. The court essentially said its dismissal has nothing to do with the merits of the case itself, for another suit and giving no indication of how it would rule at a later time. ‘‘We still have no legal guide on interest rates,’’ Amos said, adding that the league is making no sugges- tions as to what rates indi- vidual savings and loan asso- ciations should set. He did say no conventional mortgages have been pro- cessed by associations since the July 25 ruling, and that he expects ‘‘no appreciable change with this decision.’’ “The S&L’s will be much more cautious,\"” Amos said, because the Supreme Court did rule once against us and mever addressed the merits of that ruling.’’ What the associations like- ly will do is continue in- vesting in government secu- rities, putting their money in the housing markets of neighboring states that al- low higher interest rates, and keeping some money in short-term investments so, cash will be available should the situation here change, Amos said. - As for the homebuilding in- dustry, Slatton was not bubbling with optimism. Already, housing starts in Alabama are down nearly one-third from last year’s 24,000, and with the expected demise of conventional mortgages the situation could worsen. leaving the way open~ { Although conventional mortgages support only about 40 per cent of the hous- ing starts—with the rest fi- nanced by government-as- sured loans not affected by the interest con- troversy—the conventional home loan does account for about 60 per cent of the in- dustry’s dollar volume. ‘‘There's mio way govern- ment-guaranteed programs can take up the gap,’” Amos said. ‘‘They’re too limited, involve too much red tape and too many people can’t qualify.’’ Slatton predicts the great- est percentage of homes built in the near future will be through FHA and VA loans. “*It will be a disastrous year. This is a crisis situ- ation,’’ Slatton said. ‘*We’re going to make it but there will be a lot of people out of work, and possibly a few builders will go out of busi- ness.”’ He suggested much con- ventional mortgage money from Alabama will go to states such as Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi and Florida, which all permit 10 per cent simple interest, and to Georgia, which allows 9 per cent. Until the July 25 court rul- ing, most conventional mort- gages here were made at the rate of about 9.5 per cent simple interest. Both men said their organ- izations will continue press- ing for a special legislative session to clarify the lan- guage of the Mini-Code and legally reinforce their con- tention that the 1971 law does cover mortgages.

        "ocr_text": "—_— ikers Try to Save Old Bartram Trail By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The serious hiker who lives in Alabama is out of luck. He or she can jaunt through national forests or state parks or private lands if the owner offers access, but there is no major trail especially marked for and limit- ed to the ambitious walker. A number of Alabamians, however, are trying to change the scene, The state’s garden clubs, environmental groups, and, most importantly, its congressiomal delegation, are rallying around the cause first espoused by a Fairhope biology teacher who several years ago proposed crea- tion of the Bartram Trail. What Mrs. Verda Horne has been promoting since the National Trails Act was signed in 1968 is a national scen- ic and historic trail stretching through the southeast, following the route explored and documented by Wil- liam Bartram in the 1770s. What she has accomplished to date—with the help of those who hitched up to her bandwagon—is legislation now being considered in both houses of Congress which is the first concrete step toward the Bartram Trail. The bill, co-sponsored by delegations from Alabama, Florida and Georgia, would authorize a feasibility study to determine whether the Bartram route could in fact be transformed into a haven for hikers. If it is found suitable, Bartram's line of travel would be designated a national scenic and historic trail, the state be able to develop s in which it lies would it for the exclusive use, of backpackers. The historic significance of the trail lies in the fact that William Bartram was the first man to record in de- tail his findings of the South’s natural habitat in the 1770s before it was altered by the settlers who drove out the nation’s original occupants—the Indians, “Bartram described most of the plants and trees and flowers,” Mrs Horne said “He was the first truly scien- And many of those same species exist in the same spots in which Bartram found them 200 years ago. “Some of the flowers are extremely rare and are toufid only in Alabama,” Mrs Horne said, which is all the more reason naturalists from across the nation should have access to a trail in Alabama. It the route 1s designated a scenic and historic trail, many ot those plants documented by Bartram in his “Travels,\"’ published in 1791, would be marked with identitying signs The trail also crisscrosses through historic spots and natural attractions that presently can't be reached by the hiker, unless he's willing to walk down super high- ways For example, in about 1776 Bartram visited Fort Tou- louse in Elmore County, the object of another historical resurrection effort which would lie on the path of the na- tional hiking trail “It just seems almost too good to be true that we could velebrate the American bicentennial and the Bartram bicentennial at the same time,” Mrs. Horne said, ex- pressing optimism that the trail will be designated by the 1976 festivities, Already the effort has been endorsed and is being ac- tively supported by groups such as the Alabama Con- servancy, the Alabama Environmental Quality Council and the Federated Garden Clubs of Alabama. Mrs. Rosalie Durden of Montgomery, who heads the garden clubs work on behalf of the Bartram Trail, cred- its the general environmental movement with spurring interest . in this particular project. “Some of us have been working on thisfor years,” Mrs, Durden said, but it is only recently that en- thusiasm has become widespread. As Mrs. Horne noted, some rather negative devel- opments on the national scene also have awakened in- terest in a hiking trail, developments such as inflation and the energy crisis. After all, she said, “there's no better way to save energy and money than hiking.”” September 2, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Promising Oil Location Produces ‘Dry Well’ By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer An Exxon Corp. exploratory drill ship is moving to a new location off the coast of Destin, Fla., this week, after drilling a dry well on what has been de- scribed as the most promising tract of land in the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling on the tract about 40 miles south of the Florida fishing and resort village was stopped late last week af- ter Exxon drilled to a depth of 10,930 feet—at a cost of some $2 million. The drill ship began moving Tues- day to a new site ‘about three miles north of the unsuccessful well, accord- ing to Bleu Beathard, public relations manager of Exxon’s southeastern di- vision. The location of the dry well was a nine square mile tract of land leased by Exxon, Mobil Oil Corp. and Cham- plin Petroleum Co. for nearly $212 mil- lion, the highest amount ever paid for drilling rights in the Gulf. Exxon is conducting drilling oper- ations, as the company paid the great- est share for the lease that was pur- chased from the U.S. Department of the Interior last December in the first sale of leases in the eastern gulf. ‘We were disappointed,’’ Beathard said, ‘‘but often you don’t hit it on the first well.” Exxon originally received a federal permit to drill the first well to a depth of 7,000 feet, but later obtained a re- vised permit for 12,000 feet in hopes of striking oil at the greater depth. Beathard said the drillers found only “‘non-commercial indications of oil and natural gas,\" which means not enough to make production financially feasible. He said the company plans to drill again on this same tract to a depth of between 17,000 and 19,000 feet, after. it has completed five more shallow wells in the same general vicinity, but on dif- ferent tracts. Exxon already has 7,000-foot drilling permits for four shallow wells in the area known as the Destin dome or anti- cline. It is this geological formation that brought high hopes to the oil in- dustry—and drew extraordinarily high leasing bids—with some industry representatives predicting the dome could hold the biggest oil find in the gulf. The tract where the next well will be drilled was leased by the same three companies for $81.8 million. Beathard said each of the shallow wells will take a month or two to drill, depending on how deep they are drilled and whether any difficulties are encountered, so it will be six months to a year before Exxon returns to the original tract that brought such high expectations. Drilling off Destin was delayed for a short period by a law suit filed by sev- eral environmental groups hoping to stop all drilling in the area on the grounds that adequate environmental studies had not been conducted prior to the leasing. The suit eventually was dismissed by a federal judge in Tampa, Fla., al- though Exxon did begin drilling on the first tract in early July, shortly before the judge’s decision was made.

        "ocr_text": "Young Demos to Choose President at Convention By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The main attraction at the Alabama Young Democrats convention this weekend will be a political bout between Jim Zeigler and the core group currently in control of the organization. The clash is over who will be elected president, with Zeigler offering cumberland law student Tommy Chap- man, and the ‘‘party loyal- ists’’ supporting Allen Mont- gomery, the state adminis- trative assistant to U.S. Sen. John Sparkman. Chapman, who hails from Evergreen, was state chair- man of the campaign that won Zeigler the Democratic nomination for a seat on the Public Service Commission. The prize of presidency is especially desirable since the Young Democrats leader holds a seat on the party's State Executive Committee by virtue of his office. Charges and counter- charges of questionable po- litical practices have been flying across the state for the past few weeks, and un- doubtedly are a preview of hot battles to be staged when the group’s credentials com- mittee gets down to seating delegates. The loyalist faction, which has controlled the group in recent years, claims Zeigler is attempting to grasp the reins to further his personal political ambitions. Zeigler, in turn, charges his opponents have such to- tal control of the organiza- tion’s machinery that they will ‘‘stack’’ the convention to prevent the seating of delegates favoring Chap- man. Both sides have been scurrying around the state attempting to form new Young Democrats chapters on college campuses and in the counties. Both are expected to chal- lenge the delegations from these new clubs—and from existing ones—on the basis that they were formed or elected their delegates in violation of the organiza- tion’s rules. Other group officers also will be elected, including a state committeeman and committeewoman, who are voting members of the State Executive Committee along with the Young Dems presi- dent. So far the only announced candidate for com- mitteeman is Alvin Holmes of Montgomery, director of the black caucus of the par- ty—the Alabama Democrat- ic Conference—and a Demo- cratic nominee for the State House of Representatives from Montgomery. Holmes is seeking reelec- tion to the committeeman’s spot. Along with Holmes, other Montgomery convention delegates will be John Knight, the black adminis- trative assistant to PSC member Kenneth Ham- mond; Donald Dodd, a pro- fessor at Auburn University at Montgomery; and Daphne Dwyer, who works with the Southern Poverty Law Center and has been ac- tive in Democratic politics here. Friday night the con- vention banquet will feature an address by Sargent Shriv- er, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1972, and U.S. Rep.

        "ocr_text": "Young Demos Move To Smooth Haggles By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer BIRMINGHAM — Alabama Young Democrats followed the lead of their parent organizat- ion during weekend con- vention here, resolving per- sonal political haggles in the name of party unity. The anticipated presiden- tial battle between loyalist forces closely tied to State Democratic Chairman Rob- ert Vance and convention delegates identified with Public Service Commission candidate Jim Zeigler hard- ly materialized in the open sessions Saturday, since the loyalists from the start showed overwhelming strength in most delega- tions. Their candidate, Allen , Montgomery, the state ad-’ ministrative assistant to U.S. Sen. John Sparkman, handily overcame Tommy Chapman of Conecuh Coun- ty, who was Zeigler’s cam- paign manager and who con- ceded defeat before the bal- loting was finished. Chapman subsequently was elected vice president for national affairs on the nomination of a loyalist, as paft of a compromise reached with delegates who thus were persuaded to sup- port Montgomery for the presidency. The president’s post swings considerably more weight than the vice presi- dential slot handed to Chap- man, since the organiza- tion's leader holds a_ voting position on the Democratic State Executive Committee. The Young Dems’ state’ committeeman and com- mitteewoman aiso vote on . the executive committee. The vice presidential job like most other offices, has been relatively unimportant in the past since the group has been almost totally in- active except at convention time. _ The only open clash came when two delegations from Mobile County asked to be seated by the credentials committee. Although committee chairman A] LaPierre as- sumed a compromise had been reached Fridav night giving each delegation half the county’s seven votes, Chapman delegates de- manded four votes once the committee session began. Neither side would back off, so the committee finally gave each delegation three votes, taking one ballot away from the county. With the presidency as- ‘ sured before voting began, the most lively contest was a three-candidate race for the office of state com- mitteewoman. Helen Jernigan of Mobile led the field, but Marilyn Williams of Birmingham and Elza Jason of Tusca- loosa garnered enough votes together to force a runoff. Elza Jason, who came in number two more than 30 votes behlnd Miss Jernigan, conceded in the name of un- ity, eliminating the need for a second ballot. Miss Jernigan was Vance’s_ favorite. The Young Democrats, whose membership includes party faithful between the ages of 18 and 35, also ap- proved 11 resolutions rang- ing from support of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to adop- tion of an affirmative action plan for extending member- ship to underrepresented groups. The only resolution gener- ating any debate was a call for conditional amnesty for Vietnam War draft evaders and deserters. A minority report handed in by the resolutions com- mittee supported uncon- ditional amnesty, but it was soundly defeated in the gen- eral session. Other resolutions sup- ported an 18-year-old adult jaw, annual legislative ses- sions, an election law requir- ing political party registra- tion, and federal strip min- ing legislation. At a luncheon meeting U.S. Rep. Walter Flowers of Alabama’s 7th District, the featured speaker, talked of his experiences as a House Judiciary Committee mem- ber during impeachment SS & Holmes, Montgomery and Dunn in the Winner’s Circle proceedings, expressing confidence in the strength of the American government and Constitution. In other Young Democrat elections, Alvin Holmes of Montgomery was reelected state committeeman with- out opposition. Holmes is :ex- ecutive director of the Ala- bama Democratic Confer- ence, the party’s black caucus. Another Montgomerian elected without opposition was David Dunn, a _ Univer- sity of Alabama law student who becomes the group’s ex- ecutive vice president. Alonzetta Ladrian, also of Montgomery, was elected al- ternate state com- mitteewoman, John Harri- son of Tuscaloosa was Sse- lected organizational vice president, and William Nolls, a student at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, was tapped for administrative vice president. Also elected were Char- lene Beverly of Jefferson County, national com- mitteewoman; Betty Smith of Huntsville, alternate na- tional committeewoman,; John Robinson, the outgoing B president from. Huntsville, national committeeman, and Seymour West of Gad- sden, alternate to Robinson. September 8, 1974 \f"

The unanimous decision confirmed the Alabama: Court of Criminal Appeals’ ruling that Emmet is biased and should not preside over the trial of State Purchasing Agent Howard White, charged with illegally ac- cepting gifts from a com- pany doing business with the state. There was no opinion ac- companying the decision, al- though Associate Justices Pelham Merrill and Hugh Maddox did write separate, concurring opinions. Merrill noted in his opinion that any other action would have broken a precedent fol- lowed since 1913 that the Su- preme Court does not review an appellate court's con- clusion of fact. It does rule whether a low- er court has applied the law properly. and apparently that was not in question in this appeal. Aside from that precedent. Merrill said. a **stronger reason” for upholding the appeals judges is the ‘wide- ly publicized and continuing controversy between Judge Emmet and the Court of Ap- peals.\"* That controversy was in- itiated when Emmet wrote the appellate court a letter requesting the judges not re- duce high bonds he set for White and other defendants involved in the highway cases. since the accused might reveal deep-seated corruption in state govern- ment. _derif.. ™ cases in order that not even a - small segment of the cir- cuit's population might won- .

Use of the cooking equipment at Gulf State Park Re- sort in Gulf Shores was nixed during the first health in- spection of the newly-constructed units last spring, ac: cording to Jim Bolen The stoves cannot be used unless they are properly vented with hood fans, said Bolen of Alabama State Park Resorts, the arm of ARA Food Service Co. which runs several new parks under a contract with the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The 18 units in suites at the Gulf Shores park were dis- connected, as were six more installed at Joe Wheeler State Park Resort near Florence in north Alabama. “All. that bright, shiny new equipment is just sittin’ there,” said a state legislator just returned from a visit to the Gulf Shores facility. “The people will be glad to know their tax money 1s being spent so well.” The lawmaker said a sign in each suite relates the problem with local health authorities, noting the stoves are disconnected. ; Once the lack of venting was pointed out, Bolen said ARA became concerned that cooking smoke and odors would damage the rooms and furniture anyway. He said officials of the conservation department are hoping for an appropriation from the next legislature to add the necessary hood fans. Al Alford, architect with the department, said each compact stove-refrigerator unit cost $500, which means the state spent a total of $12,000 for the 24 units. The refrigerator portion, however, still can be and is used, according to Bolen, and the rooms containing them are quite popular. Alford said that at the time plans were being drawn for the new parks this type of compact kitchen unit couldn't be purchased with a hood vent, although vented units did come out last year. Alford added that although he was not with the depart: ment when the parks were being planned, he is certain all the appropriate state agencies, such as the health de- partment and building commission, did review and ap- prove various plans.” He suggested the lack of venting simply was over: looked. The object of having kitchen suites was mainly so families would be able to vacation at the gulf and not have to purchase all their meals at resort restaurants, Now the $50 a night, two-room suites usually are ren- ted as two separate rooms at the in-season rate of $28 for a single, $32 for a double. The room with cooking facilities also holds a hide-a- - bed, so it can be rented as a complete unit, and the occu: pants can keep their soda cold to boot. September 20, 1974 \f"

The other two law schools so favored are Jones Law In- stitute, now owned and oper- ated by the University of Alabama, and the Birming- ham School of Law. These had been the only two law schools in Alabama not accredited by the Ameri- cam Bar Association or by the Association of American Law Schools until the pre- dominantly black Miles Col- lege opened a law school this month. The two-hour session re- portedly was spent in heated debate over a2 committee's recommendation that all .ap- plicants to fhe bar be gradu- ates of accredited law schools, although the unaccredited (schools have had until accreditation. The recommendation thus would have forced the three schools to come up with con- siderable funding to expand libraries and faculties and make other improvements necessary for accreditation, or would have forced them out of business Sjnce nene of their graduates would have been eligible to practice law in this state. Proponents of the recom- mendation already had come under considerable criticism around the state for trying to close the legal profession to all but the wealthy and for attempting to hold down competition by limiting the mumber of law school graduates here. Advocates, however, said there must be some limited standards for lawyers other than merely passage of the bar examination to insure all Alabamians adequate legal representation by com- petant attorneys. One angered bar commis- sioper said Friday's action was tantamount to writing a ‘“*blank check** for anyone to become a lawyer here.

Friday’s action came at a specially-called meeting, made necessary by the start of classes at Miles. Officials there wanted to Know defi- its graduates would be ineligible to take the bar exam, or whether the school would be granted the same status as the other tw unaccredited ones. . David Barnes, director and coordinator of Miles law school, said plans call for the school to be accredited as soon as economically pos- sible, but said the uncer- tainty of the school’s present status had put a damper on fund-raising efforts. That uncertainty also has caused a ‘‘massive drop- out,’’ he said, with 20 of the original 57 students quitting upon learning they might not be admitted to the bar. ‘‘We intend’ to produce qual- ity attorneys,’’ Barnes said before the commissioners went into closed session, ‘“‘people with sufficient skill that this board and this bar will be proud to be represent- ed by them.’’ Barnes, who is black, said he was ‘‘forced to go out of state to (law) school, be- cause there was not suf- ficient space in Alabama schools.’’ The rule on accreditation apparently is hoped to dis- courage establishment of more unaccredited law schools in Alabama, and pro- hibit graduates of unaccre- dited schools in other states from taking the Alabama bar exam.

Cast in the main adversa- ry roles were representa- tives of the petroleum in- dustry and members of envi- ronmental groups, who came from eight south- eastern states to testify at the first day of a week-long Federal Energy Adminis- tration (FEA) hearing.

        "ocr_text": "—No More Junkets for State Officials— By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Ethics Commission ruled out a time-honored, well-tested - tradition Wednes- day—the junket for state officials. The opinion on junkets sponsored by private in- dustries or organizations came in response to an in- ‘ quiry from attorneys for Degussa Alabama, Inc., a company headquarted in Frankfurt, West Germa- ny, which has announced plans to build a $200 mil- lion petrochemical plant near Mobile. The lawyers asked whether the ethics law would be broken if the fol- lowing officials were tak- en, at Degussa expense, to visit the company's plants in Germany and Bel- gium: Ray Bass, state highway director; James Warr, administrator of the Alabama Water Im- provement Commission; Mobile State Rep. Bill Roberts, the Democratic nominee for the Alabama Senate; Bob Glass, Demo- - cratic nominee for the Alabama House from Mo- bile, and Randy Butler, Mobile County district at- torney who also is presi- dent-elect of the county Wildlife Association. Degussa officials said the trip would inform the Alabama officials of how various pollution prob- lems have been resolved, problems likely to arise in connection with the firm’s Mobile plant. The draft opinion presented by commission Executive Director Mel- vin Cooper was approved by a split vote. It said the officials would be prohib- ited from accepting the of- fer due to a section of the ethics law saying an offi- cial cannot accept gifts or anything of value, if it “could be reasonably in- ferred’’ that officiaé would be influenced in the discharge of his duties. The law does permit of- ficials to participate in so- cial occasions sponsored by a private industry or association, provided the entertainment cost doesn’t exceed $100 per year per official. The law also prohibits anyone from offering such gifts to officials. Another section of the law specifically would have applied to Warr, who comes under a provision prohibiting one from of- fering a gift to a°member or employe of a state agency that regulates a business with which the donor is associated. The water commission will be regulating De- gussa. The only dissenting vote was cast by Commission Donald Comer, who said such an opinion applied to foreign trips also would have to apply to Alabama companies that want to show legislators or other Officials their in-state fa- cilities. The other commission- ers agreed the ruling might be detrimental to the business ccmmunity, but approved it anyway. “This is a tremendous company and would be a tremendous asset to the state,’ said Commission- er Alto Lee. But, he noted, a conflict of interest easily could ar- ise if Degussa someday wanted a special road built or became a defend- ant in a suit the local dis- trict attorney would be re- quired to prosecute. Connie Entrekin, the Gadsden labot leader who became commission chairman Wedesday un- der a yearly rotation plan, said the state has agencies charged with looking into industrial matters such as the ones Degussa wants to bring to light. “If they (the officials) want to go, the state should pay for it,’’ Entre- kin said. Degussa also has planned to take several lo- cal officials on the trip, but the commission has no jurisdiction over them due to a pending law suit. September 26, 1974 \f"

Moving to Explain Adjustments By MARCIA: KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama Power Co. is act: ing to quiet protests that it has been hiding the exact amount of the controversial fuel. adjustment factor that allows the utility to pass higher fuel costs to the con- sumer, The, company now is pre- paring an information pack- et, which officials hope will be ready in time to mail out with October bills, telling what the factor ‘is and how the individual customer can calculate how much it costs him, ) Alabama Power recently came under fire from the Public Service Commission (PSC) for failing to ade- quately explain fuel adjust: ment costs, and some critics have claimed the com: plicated bills are a deliber- ate effort to keep consumers from learning how much ex tra they pay for the com- pany’s fuel each month, The company is permitted to pass along higher fuel costs without first obtaining PSC approval, as it must for a rate increase, A survey of Power Com- pany advertisements, con ducted by PSC Public Rela- tions Officer Richard Proc- ctor, recently concluded that the company has made no efs fort to explain the fuel factor to the public, Not only is this not spelled out in the advertise. ments, . but, in addition, there was no warning that electric bills would be drast: ically increased in the future due to the rising costs of “coal,” Proctor said in a memorandum to the com- missioners, A draft of the Power Com: pany's information sheet notes the factor ‘‘has trig- gered many questions,” and goes on to explain how it works—that the company re- ~ alizes no profit by adding its fuel costs to the customer's bill, and that bills will de- crease if the cost of fuel does. The sheet further explains that any customer can calcu: late how much he pays for higher fuel costs by mul- tiplying the number of kilo- watts (KWH) he used by the fuel factor. Both figures ap- pear on the bill. Dividing the result of that multiplication by 1,000 will show the fuel adjustment factor cost, Two sample bills included in the packet show that a cus: tomer who used 2,000 KWH in Seplember of 1979 paid a fuel adjustment of $9.97, while the same usage last month resulted in a fuel ad: justment cost of $13.11 While Alabama Power Customers are paying more for the fuel, especially coal, that runs the generating plants, at least company offi. Clals say they don't need to worry about a lack of fuel.

Contributions totalling $3,250, made in the last minute push for money just days before the May 7 primary, are listed on Beasley's campaign report as coming from persons with the same names as the power company’s top executives. } The Corrupt Practices Act does’not require that cam- paign expense reports identify donors by address or oc- cupation, only by name. The Advertiser incorrectly stated on Friday that com- pany President Joseph M. Farley gave $2,000 to Beas- ley, and four company vice presidents contributed $1,000 each. R.T. Garlington, $100; R.A.

Farley made two $500 donations and persons bearing the same names as Alabama Power’s secretary and 13 of its 19 vice presidents gaye between $75 and $250 each from May 2 to May 6. After it was revealed last week that Farley and at least four vice presidents contributed to Beasley’s re- election campaign, the president maintained the dona- tions were coincidental anq “personal,” and “were not contributions by the company.” It is a violation of state jaw for a corporation to give “directly or indirectly” to g political campaign, or for officers to furnish “directly or indirectly’ any compan money for a campaign.

        "ocr_text": " ommission Debates Women’s Rights By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer “We are not changing social relationships, we are reaffirming the prin- ciple of equality under the law.” ; ‘*Most people I’ve talked to are afraid of what the courts will do to the Equal Rights Amend- ment, and they're espe- cially afraid of the draft.” So it went, pro and con, the testimony Saturday about the relationship of women to the law, about how the ERA would alter that relationship. The numbers who ex- pressed high hopes that the controversial amend- ment would raise the stat- us of women were about equal to those citing fears over rights and privileges that would be lost should the ERA be ratified. They spoke with equal conviction to the Alabama Women’s 'Commission, an advisory body holding hearings across the state on women's needs and problems, in preparation for a report to the gover- nor and legislature. The most often re- peated objections were to the subjection of women to the draft, and to the vagueness of the amend- ment, which simply states: ‘‘Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.”” Supporters rattled off statistics showing women now hold mostly the low- paying, low-prestige jobs, offered examples from personal experience that existing laws do allow sex discrimination, and held that personal relation- ships between men and women would not be de- stroyed by the ERA. Olive Spann, represent- ing the National Associ- ation of Pro America, con- tended no one ‘‘can say with certainty what the ERA will mean,” suggest- ing it ‘twill mean exactly what the Supreme Court wants it to mean.” Citing the Fourteenth Amendment as the most vague addition to the U.S. Constitution now, Miss Spann said its authors ‘‘didn't foresee the due process clause would pro- hibit prayer in schools or do away with the death penalty,’’ or that it would “mandate the destruction of neighborhood school systems.”’ State Auditor Melba Till Allen, who said most people she knows are af- raid of the ERA, said that while she agrees with many of the same goals as ERA proponents, she doesn’t believe the ent would help them. “Passing laws will not help,’’ she said, noting that despite laws against crime, it still is on the rise. Sara Sansom, repre- senting Women for Con- stitutional Government, concentrated her opposi- tion on the draft question, saying men and women in the service ‘‘will have to sleep in the same quarters and use the same bath- rooms.” Several proponents countered the views on military service, saying the question is moot since there isn't a draft. If a na- tional emergency reinsti- tuted the draft, they said, women should be just as willing to serve their country as men. ‘Less than 1 per cent of the males drafted ever saw war,’ said Loretta Bacon of American Wom- en in Radio and Tele- vision. ‘‘What makes you opponents think all wom- en would face combat?”’ Vi Pitts of the Business and Professional Wom- en's League responded to arguments that women’s rights already are guar- anteed under the Con- stitution. “If women are covered by the Constitution,’’ she asked, ‘‘why did it take special action to allow us to vote or to serve on juries?” Specific discriminatory laws could be tackled one bD ep. she said. but “without the impetus of the ERA, it will take much too long.’’ “Our education costs no less, neither do our cars, nor do we get a discount at the gas station,’’ said Doris Owens of the Insur- ance Women of Montgom- ery. In speaking of sex discrimination in the pro- fessional world, she charged it is ‘‘short- sighted, outmoded and a bad business practice.\" Departing from the ERA, Dee Coleman made a plea for changes at Tut- wiler Prison for women. She asked the commis- sion to recommend more vocational courses in the prison, which now has programs in sewing, cos- metology, food service and flowor arranging, and to support the phasing out of Tutwiler in favor of community programs where offenders would be closer to their families and to local social serv- ices. After the hearing, the Alabama Chapter of the National Organization for Women issued a State- ment and a copy of a reso- lution commending the commission for holding the hearings, but asking that the body be granted more money to do its work, that commission vacancies be filled, and that the commission go on record in favor of the ERA.

        "ocr_text": "Public Service Commission Race Is Hot Spot in Mild Campaigns By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer One of the few moderately hot spots in the lukewarm general election campaigns has been the contest over Place I on the Alabama Pub- lic Service Commission. Although the race between Democrat Jim Zeigler and Conservative Clift Gilliland hasn’t exactly reached the kindling point, it has sent out a few sparks to the public more than ever before con- cerned about utilities and their rates—which are regu- lated by the PSC. Each has been trying to. paint the other as a potential tool of the utilities, although neither has gone beyond making. unsubstantiated charges. Since the campaign lead- ing to Zeigler’s upset of in- cumbent Commissioner C.C. “‘Jack’’ Owen in the runoff, the Democrat has been open- ly anti-utility, calling for a year’s Woods. Although this is Zeigler’s first try at elective office, he has been around as a utility opponent before PSC rate procedings, led an attempt to unseat Gov. George Wal- lace’s Alabama delegates to the Democratic National Convention as_ unrepresenta- tive of youth, blacks and women, and was student government president at the University of Alabama. He was impeached while holding that latter office—a fact Gilliland has repeatedly pointed out, failing to men- tion a student court later ex- onerated Zeigler and said the impeachment charges ‘were illegal. Gilliland worked with the Advertiser-Journal circula- tion department before his primary—Charles JUANITA MCDANIEL moratorium on all PSC rate action until lame duck Owen is officially unseated in January. Zeigler has indicated his primary concern will be the consumers’ pocketbooks, though he has made a few foray into politics in 1970, was manager of the Ala- bama Garage Owners Asso number of years, ciation, and now is associ- ated with a miattress com- pany. Zeigler, at age 26 a decade younger than his opponent, has been a reporter for a newspaper in his native Syl- acauga and an insurance salesman, and now is a stu- dent at Jones Law School. He does not currently hold a job, saying he has been supported by loans and aid from his family while cam- Paigning. A third candidate in the race, Prohibition Party nominee Rosamon Hender- son of Birmingham, is not actively campaigning. The other PSC seat up for grabs has incumbent Juan- ita McDaniel facing little active opposition from two _ splinter party candidates. ae ZEIGLER quiet noises about assuring the utilities enough cash to keep running. Gilliland, who unsucces- sfully ran for the Democrat- ic nomination to a PSC spot 4n 1972, has campaigned on a pledge to be ‘‘fair’’ to both Mrs. McDaniel has been a Democratic stalwart for a winning her first crack at statewide office in the 1970 PSC race. Although one of the first commissioners to _ seriously question utility requests for rate hikes, Mrs. McDaniel has had her ‘‘consumer ad- vocate’’ pedestal yanked out from under her by changing circumstances. The change mostly has been in the other faces on the PSC. As a neophyte commis- sioner, she was teamed with—or more frequently against—Owen and then PSC President Eugene ‘*Bull’’ Conner, both of whom were willing to grant most utility requests. Conner, however was re- placed with President Ken- neth Hammond, who may b CLIFTON GILLILAND utilities and their customers. Before switching to the Conservative Party banner this year, Gilliland was ac- tive as a Democrat in Lt.. Gov. Jere Beasley’s 1970: campaign and as an aide to: Beasley’s opponent in this: more ardently anti-utility than hopeful Zeigler. If Zeigler wins, and Mrs. McDaniel succeeds over her token opposition, she likely again will find herself in the minority on the commission. Opposing Mrs. McDaniel are Whig candidate Virginia Davis and Prohibitionist Daisy Williams. Neither has campaigned for the general election, al- though Mrs. Davis has been active as a Democrat in the past. She once ran a losing race for a Birmingham City Coun- ci] seat and helped in ‘‘Bull’’ Conner’s PSC campaign. She has had some govern- ment experience as super- visor with Birmingham's parks board and the juvenile court there. November 4, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Strike Shuts Down Coal Production Statewide UMW Pickets Close Alabama Coal Mines By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama coal mines shut- down at midnight as some 7,000 United Mine Workers here joined a national strike - that could cripple the econo-, my within weeks if a union contract is not signed. Outside of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), ready hit by a coal shortage, no major utilities or in- dustries in Alabama are ex-. pected to feel the Seal crunch immediately. Unlike UMW members in most parts of the nation, Ala- bama’s District 20 for the most part was on the job till the close of the 3-11 p.m. shift Monday. In other areas miners were off in observance of Veteran’s Day, but district Secretary-Treasurer Lloyd Baker said the holiday was celebrated im Alabama in conjunction with the govern- ment observance last month. With no union strike ben-_ efits, Baker said the 7,000 workers mostly in Walker and Jefferson counties ‘‘will be seriously hurt. But this is eee Ss. they know what to For the first time, a UMW st#ike will not be settled through simple agreement by negotiators for the union and mine operators, since the institution of rank and file approval. The negotiated package must be accepted by a bar- Baining council, then ae dis- trict conference in Pitts- burgh, and finally by a ~se- cret ballot vote of the mem- bership in each UMW dis- trict, which Baker said should take about 10 days. If the proposed contract is turned down at any phase. it’s back to the bargaining table. ._ would result al-. As in most parts of the na- tion, the first imdustries ex- pected to be affected by the absence of coal here are re- lated to transportation. A railroad industry spokesman said a strike of two to three weeks likely in curtailment of activities and resulting manpower layoffs. Carroll Ashby, division su- perintendent of the Louis- ville and Nashville Railroad in Birmingham, said a short- age of cars and resulting backlog in other industrial orders is expected to take up the immediate slack result- ing from the strike. Echoing the words of other railway officials, Ashby said his railroad will ‘‘play it by ear,”” with cutbacks depend- ing on the duration of the strike and its effect on other rail-transporting industries. He noted United States Steel Corp. in Jefferson County reportedly has pre- dicted production cutbacks with worker reductions if the strike continues two weeks, which in turn would affect the railroads and industries dependent on steel. Although the Alabama State Docks in Mobile has handled about 60,000 tons of coal a week recently, James Ward of the bulk materials handling plant there said other bulk commodities are expected to keep docks workers busy and revenue steady for at least the next month, even without coal ex- ports. Alabama docks have lost bulk cargo to other ports due to lack of facilities in Mobile, and Ward said he expects to get some of that business back. Barge and tug operators which transport coal from Birmingham and north Ala- bama to the docks may feel the pinch, he said. Alabama Power Co. has maintained about a 70-day November 12, UMW President Arnold Miller stockpile of coal to fire its electric generating plants, so should have no trouble servicing customers if the strike is settled as early as expected. But TVA supplies have dwindled to a 20-day stockpile or less, which could mean trouble for the 13 Ala- bamrma counties dependent on that utility for power. Mine operators, especially strip miners, are worried about more than just the UMW strike. Bill Kelce, executive di- rector of the Alabama Sur- face Mining Reclamation Council headquarted in Bir- mingham, said a surface mining bill due before a con- ference cormmittee in con- gress Nov. 19 could deal the industry a more serious blow. The council, representing 80 per cent of Alabama’s sur- face mine operators, con- ducted a survey that shows “*mmost surface mines in Ala- bama will have to close down within 180 days’’ if the bill Passes as presently written, Kelce said. He later amended that es- timate by saying most oper- ators would have to shut down at least a portion of their mines due to proposed slope requirements prohibit- ing strip mining on slopes over 20 degrees. hye \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Invited to Oil Talks By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C, Wallace and 22 other coast- al state governors have been invited to meet with President Gerald Ford Wednesday to dis- cuss expansion of offshore oil drilling activity. It was not known Monday night how Wallace would respond to the invitation, received that day while the governor was in Birmingham for Veteran's Day ceremonies. The New York Times News Service said Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Trea- sury Secretary William Simon are to head the team of cabinet officials presenting argu- ments at the White House meeting in favor of more oil exploration in U.S. coastal waters. Elvin Stanton, assistant press secretary to Wallace, said the invitation did not mention Kissinger or Simon as participants, although Stanton did confirm a dinner hosted by Interi- or Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton is planned outside the White House for the governors. ‘The meeting with Ford and his top adminis- tration officials is to begin at 5 p.m., Stanton said, and a technical meeting on drilling and environmental requirements is scheduled Thursday, Along with Wallace, the governors of states on the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts have been invited to the session where diplomatic, economic and energy-related ar- guments for a stepped-up domestic oil drilling program will be outlined. Actually the governors or the states have little say in whether their coastal waters will become dotted with drilling rigs, since the U.S. Interior Department decides if the sub- merged lands will be leased to oil companies for drilling. , The states only control off-shore activities within their three-mile jurisdictional limits. What the administration likely is hoping to gain is acceptance of drilling by the state offi- cials, who in turn could promote exploration in their nome states. Environmental groups and some state gov- ernments have threatened or already have filed suits against the Interior Department in efforts to stop leasing of drilling rights. Such suits were unsuccessful in Florida, but did cause some delay of drilling in the virgin waters off that state earlier this year. Top Alabama officials, including Wallace, hardly need convincing of the need for off- shore drilling, already having supported the sale of leases off Alabama's coast last year. The greatest protests are coming from At- lantic coast states, where the oil industry is particularly anxious to begin exploration due to geologic surveys indicating the presence - of oil fields there. Similar surveys indicated an especially promising formation off Destin, Fla., before leases were sold there in December, but so far the promise has not been . fulfilled by any sub- stantial oil finds. .

        "ocr_text": "Phone Rate Hike Hearing « Delay Arguments Slated By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer A Montgomery circuit judge will hear arguments Tuesday on whether the Puolic Service Commission must postpone until late December the hearing started Monday on South Central Bell's $60 niillion rate in- crease request, A month-long delay could throw the final PSC decision to the new administration that takes office Jan. 0, Oral arguments set for 9 am. before Judge Richard Emmet will concern a petition by Maurice Bishop, an opponent of the rate increase representing Gov, George Wallace, who is asking Emmet to force the PSC post: ponement, Bishop filed the petition Monday afternoon, after the commissioners refused his request for a delay, which Bishop said is necessary because the PSC does not have jurisdiction over the case at this time, The original telephone company request for a $29.3 million rate increase was denied by the PSC last year, but this fall was remanded, or sent back, to the PSC by Emmet on a company appeal. Emmet said the commissioners had failed to grant South Central Bell adequate revenue, and pursuant to the judge’s directive, the PSC reopened the hearing Monday to reconsider the case and to receive updated information on the company’s economic situation, Changing economics have caused the utility to Update its rate request from the original $29.3 million to about $60 million, Bishop, however, contends the PSC cannot yet begin its new hearing, because he has asked Judge Emmet to reconsider his remand order, The court on Monday set a Dec. 19 hearing on the request to reconsider the remand, thus Bishop holds the matter still is under the jurisdiction of the court, not of the PSC. Although the commissioners initially turned down Bishop's request for the delay, they later learned of the Dec. 19 hearing date and contacted Emmet for clari- fication of the PSC’s position, At that time the judge said the PSC was not oe ed from hearing the case, but that if Bishop formally filed a motion asking for an order of prohibition, Emmet would hear arguments Tuesday; and make a ruling, Presently the PSC plans to resume at 11 a.m, Tuesda the hearing barely begun Monday, pending Enynet's decision on who has jurisdiction. On Monday the commission heard several salements of opposition from members of the general public who are not official opposing intervenors—including one from Jim Zeigler, the man who will replace Commis- Sioner C.C. “Jack” Owen when the new term of office begins in January, Zeigler charged the PSC is involved in “under the table political maneuvering,” because it has refused his request to delay consideration of several major rate in- Crease applications until he takes office. He further charged South Central Bell with using “pressure tactics” to win PSC action before he becomes a commission memberB—tactics such as withholding service to some areas of the state and “threatening” to move its proposed data center with ie jobs to another state if it fails to get higher rates, His charges were directly denied then by company spokesmen, and later in a prepared opening statement, by W.M. Booker, general counsel for the Bell Company who outlined why the increase is needed. * Booker, who recapped several written statements filed earlier by utility officials, sald essentially that in: flationary costs have made even the original §29.3 mil- lion request inadequate to provide telephone service, Citing statistics showing rising company costs, Book- er said the utility would be forced to take the following steps if it fails to earn adequate revenues: ~Defer service to shopping centers, apartment com: plexes, new subdivisions and residential areas through: out the state,, in urban as well as rural areas, Offer only two-party and four-party service to new business and residential customers, making no private lines available, Cut back up to 1,200 jobs, which would lengthen waiting periods for installation and repair service, plus would result in slow dial tone and busy cir- cuils—meaning customers sometimes would face de- lays in making calls, November 19, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": " Waterways Ordered Upgraded By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The U.S, Environmental Protection Agency has or- dered upgrading of all Alabama waterways, refusing to accept vague pollution regulations adopted by the Ala- bama Water Improvement Commission. Those greeting the announcement as a boon to clean water and others calling it impossible to implement agreed the EPA action means many municipalities and industries will be shelling out substantially greater sums for pollution control. What the federal agency did is overrule the AWIC’s minimum “fish and wildlife as a goal” classification for streams, replacing it with a “fish and wildlife” class, The EPA class sets out specific water quality criteria, such as permissible levels of temperature, oxygen con- tent and bacteria content, Under the federal regulation, industrial wastes and municipal sewage plant discharge must be treated so they don't degrade below the specified levels the streams where they are dumped, The aim is to make all waterways clean enough to sup- port fish and wildlife by 1977. The AWIC “fish and wildlife as a goal” classification, which the EPA found unacceptable, did not detail min- imum water quality criteria, but said wastes must be treated by “the best practicable” methods, The EPA decision was a victory for Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley’s environmental division, which had fought the “goal” classification since the AWIC created it last year and placed about 70 segments of various Alabama waterways in the class, “We feel the decision is going to mean an awful lot to the pollution control program in Alabama,” said Asst. Atty. Gen. Henry Caddell, division chief. “I think it will greatly increase our legal position in cleaning up these, the dirtiest streams in the state,” he said. “It gives us a real weapon.” Caddell also noted his office has filed a suit seeking to make available $44 million of impounded federal pollu- tion control funds, which, if successful, will make the money available to municipalities facing the more stri- ngent requirements. James Warr, AWIC chief administrative officer, said the commission will face a dilemma over what to do about industries or municipalities that cannot afford the necessary waste treatment or are technologically ) unable to meet the water criteria. The EPA, he said, can grant variances or exceptions in cases where it is “impossible” to meet standards, but state law doesn’t give the AWIC that authority, Warr s,aid some affected polluters can be expected to file suit against the EPA, seeking relief. “In all probability what we will see is nothing being done while all the legal avenues are being exhausted,” he predicted. Wan said 46 municipalities have sewage treatment facilities on waterways previously classified ‘fish and Wildlife as a goal,” and they must improve or replace treatment plants so the streams will meet the new classification. Warr did add that some towns and Industries already have received federal or state permits under the old classification which are good for five years, but Caddell Said his office likely will ask the EPA to review and amend those permits. The state agency adopted the “goal” classification last fall, and in the spring issued a clarification that it was not the same as a straight “‘fish and wildlife” class, November 26, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Unemployed Tax Waived By Wallace By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama workers won't have to pay the employe compensation tax again in 1975, despite a near doubling of unemployment claims payments made by the state recently. Gov. George (. Wallace has waived the paycheck de- ductions for the fourth consecutive year, although em: ployers could be required to ante up more if Alabama unemployment climbs substantially next year. And the rate of insured unemployment—which mea- sures unemployed persons drawing compensation—has been rising steadily every few weeks recently, accord- ing to Tom. Ventress, director of the State Department of Industrial Relations, That rate now stands at about 3.5 per cent, and Ven- tress said it would have to rise to about 6 per cent before workers would be required to pay into the Unemploy- ment Compensation Trust Fund. That is the fund that pays unemployment claims. The rising number of eligibles, attributable in part to layoffs at plants across the state and the slack in con- struction, has drawn about $1.2 million from the fund so far this month, compared to about $650,000 in the same month last year, Precisely current figures for the fund are not avail: able, but a Wallace spokesman said that as of Oct. 1, about the time the governor decided to waive the em: ploye tax, it held $125.2 million. The legal minimum for the fund, a function of the most drawn from it in one year over the past ten years, is $102.2 million. If the fund sinks to close to that minimum, the state by law must demand that employers pay more into it or employes begin contributing through the employe com- pensation tax, a payroll deduction, Normally that deduction is one-half of one per cent of the worker's salary, For the past three years employes have been spared paying the tax, due mostly to the low rate of insured unemployment, Ventress said the rate has been rising about one-tenth of one per cent each month, and noted that unusual in- creases quickly make a dent in the trust fund. With a steady unemployment rate and steady employ- er payments into the fund, its level remains fairly stat: ic, When unemployment starts rising, however, com- pensation claims remove more money than is paid into the fund, which begins dropping, amen ae - mate up the difference, ei- November 27, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff - Writer By profession they range from disc jockey to pediatri- cian, include a majority of business and professional men, an unusually large number of educators, and possibly fewer attorneys than ever before. They are the new Alabama state legislators, who bring not only a new set of faces to the. Capitol’s second floor, but also a variety of back- grounds not seen in past ses- The lawyers won't find themselves under- represented by any means, but they will find themselves surrounded by fewer profes- sional cohorts, standing in the midst of a nationwide trend toward political parti- cipation by non-traditional participants. While the popular route of law degree leading to elected office hasn't been aban- doned, it is less well-traveled as teachers, small business- men and technical workers in various fields decide it’s time to try their hands at running the government that’s been running them. Lawyers also may have been discouraged this last campaign season by the eth- Capitol Faces Diversity in New Crop of Legislators ics law which demands they reveal categories of clients and prohibits certain busi- ness dealings important to many attorneys’ practices. In the Alabama Senate lawyers still will hold barely a majority of the seats—18 out of 35—Dbut only seven or those lawyer-legislators will be new additions to the legis- lative chambers. The other 11 either were in- cumbents, moved across the hall from the House of Rep- resentatives or served pre- viously, In the Alabama House, just 22 of 105 members will be lawyers, eight of them in- cumbents. The House, how- ever, usually has had a broader spectrum of repre- sentation than the Senate. - And while rural farming interests earlier lost legisla- tive dominance to city-dwel- lers in this increasingly ur- banized state, the farmers held their own in this year’s elections. There will be at least four senators who make their liv- ings through agriculture or closely related businesses, and five full-time farmers in the House. At least another five House members farm while holding other occupa- tions, such as teaching. Then there are the teach- ers. Educators of varying stripe gained the biggest bloc of legislative seats this year, electing a total of 20 to the two houses. In the Senate Gerald Wayne Waldrop, a teacher at Gadsden State Junior Col- lege, will hold the fort alone, although several other sena- tors are closely tied to educa- tion interests through boards of trustees and through cul- ling ever more powerful teacher support. The House is another sto- ry, where 18 legislators will be found putting bread on their tables by virtue of pay- checks from educational in- stitutions and the public school system. For example, State Rep. Brindley, Joe Ford and Hugh Boles hold non-teaching jobs at different state junior col- leges. Rep. Paul Weeks is a pub- lic school superintendent, Reps. James Sasser, R. No- lan Williams and Jimmy Holley are principals, and the lone woman legislator, Marilyn Quarles, is a teach- er from Pell City. There also is an assort- ment of coaches, counselors: and private college employ- es. Sen. T.D. ‘‘Ted’’ Little, educator number 20, did offi- cially give up his job as busi- ness law teacher at Auburn University in favor of pri- vate law practice when he won the Senate nomination, reportedly to avoid any pos- sible conflict of interest. The 20 compare with six educator-legislators in the last session. The remaining lawmakers come from a variety of back- grounds—merchants, bank- ers, salesmen and owners of retail stores, to name a few. Seven House members have listed their occupations as real estate salesmen or developers, although that doesn’t fully reflect those in- volved in the land business. A number of others are large land-holders who daoble in development, or «re stockholders in devel- o)ment companies. The Monsanto Corp. has sent three engineers or tech- nicians to the legislature from north Alabama, who will be joined by several pro- fessional brethren from oth- er companies. A smattering of planners and consultants, plus four la- boring men involved in union activities, round out the leg- islative directory. Rep. Kerry Rich of Gad- sden, by the way, is the young disc jockey, and Dr. Dewey White is the pediatri- cian from Birmingham. December 1, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "As Consumer Complaints Grow, Revamping of PSC May Be Eyed By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer As utilities make more frequent pleas to the Alabama Public Service Commission for more hefty rate increases, there's more and more talk about revamping the commission. Legislators beleaguered by constituents with complaints about rising bills for virtually every utility service are expected to take a serious look at the PSC make-up and function- ing. An effort was made in 1972 to scrutinize the commission and analyze how it works, but recommendations made in a report to the leg- islature for the most part were ignored. But that was before the recent spate ot ap- plications for higher rates, which isn’t likely to stop this year or next, according to in- dications from utility officials. The heat is on now, and the new legislature that convenes next year almost certainly will be forced to address the matter. Some consumer-minded lawmakers and utility watchers, however, are concerned about possible legislation that would be a wolf in sheep's clothing—bills purporting to strengthen the PSC and its ability to more closely regulate utilities, which actually would strengthen the utilities’ hand in rate- making. Some changes, such as increasing the size and salaries of PSC staff members, undoubt- edly would enhance the commission's capac- ity to delve into complicated utility finances to learn just how much is earned and how wisely it’s spent. Other possible alterations fall into a grayer area of opinion, with no one able to say with certainty what their effect would be. The major question in that latter category is how to select the ccmmissioners. PSC President Kenneth Hammond openly charges that commissioners now can't serve more than two terms without taking utility money to help finance their election cam- paigns. Consumers cry about utility rates, he says, but aren’t willing to financially aid in the elec- tion of impartial commissioners. Hammond suggests that raising the com- missioners’ salaries would attract good people, keep them in the job, and help dim: nate the temptation to accept utility support. The two associate commissioners currently earn $18,000 annually, and the president gets $18,500, but all will be receiving raises of a couple thousand dollars as of January. Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, who also has publicly expressed the desire to alter the PSC, agrees there usually has been little interest stirred in PSC campaigns, but suggests the answer is appointed, rather than popularly-elected commissioners. Hammond thinks that would open the door to further politicizing the commission. Both have suggested the possibility of elec- ting PSC members from congressional dis- tricts instead of statewide, which would in- crease the size of the commission, decrease the campaign area geographically, and make each commissioner answerable to a more lim- ited constituency, which could keep closer tabs on his or her actions. Hammond has been preparing his own legis- lative package of proposals, and Beasley says he thinks a new study committee likely will be formed early next year to whip up a batch. The committee probably would work from the existing report, which recommends, among other things, an upgraded staff, ap- pointed commissioners, the use of outside con- sultants retained by the PSC to testify at rate hearings, and an appeal route directly to the Alabama Supreme Court, bypassing the Montgomery Circuit Court.

        "ocr_text": "PSC Rate Hearings Technical Affairs By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The State Public Service Commission resumes hearings Tuesday on Alabama Power Company's request’ for a massive rate hike, and once again will bare to public view the glaring inadeguacies in the state’s utility regulatory system. Not much of the public, however, will be viewing or even aware of the proced- ings, not until the commissioners make their final decision, which almost cer- tainly will be an increase of some size. That will draw the public’s attention, and likely the collective wrath of con- sumers who will see the digits on their power bills move up a notch or two, and then will begin to ask why. When the cross-examination portion of the Alabama Power hearing began in October, a handful of citizens did get up to make their pitch against higher rates (hardly addressing the matter of wheth- er the utility needs the money, but say- Ing only they can’t afford to pay it), By the second and third days of the hearing all those interested citizens had disappeared, leaving only the PSC and its staff, the utility officials, the opposing intervenors, and a couple reporters, The lack of interest in an activity that ultimately will have so great an effect on so many people was surprising, if not disturbing, to. newcomers to the utility regulatory game. After a few days of the hearing, when cross-examiners finally got down® to the nitty-gritty of what goes into a rate base Analysis and why, it became clear that it didn’t’ “matter much whether average Joe or Jane was there to watch, because many of the questions and answers sounded like they were spoken in ancient Greek. The sensationalistic, easy to under- stand stuff about how much the company spends on advertising or country club dues fell by the wayside, as company of- ficials were quizzed on things like de- ferring tax credits or adjustments to the allowance for funds used during con- struction, And that is what the rate game is all about, ’ At that point what became even more disconcerting than the lack of citizen in- terest was the absence of many probing questions by the commissioners them- selves or their staff, While the Power Company paraded its expert witnesses to the stand to explain why its accounting must be accepted as showing the need for more revenue, the PSC didn’t bring in one witness to give an Objective assessment of Alabama Pow: et’s books and practices. The PSC didn’t have one staff member testify as to his or her scrutiny of the util- ity's request. The main opponent, Birmingham at: torney Maurice Bishop, who represents Gov. George Wallace at most such rate hearings, has been the lone serious questioner of utility executives, = PSC President Kenneth Hammona has raised some interesting points, byt those mostly are geared to embarrass- ing the company or showing political connections that don't matter a legal Whit when it comes to rate schedules, So that just about boils down to one man and the resources of his law firm, Versus a major industry that taps not only its specialized personnel in Ala- bama to make its case, but has access to other specialists throughout its parent Company's four-state empire, as well as the most knowledgable witnesses across the nation that money can buy, Which seems to be the main PSC prob, lem—money, Money to hire more staff people to beef Up its utility investigating ire money tO pay outside experts who have spent a lifetime studying the complex way ma- Jor utilities work—who could say wheth- er Alabama Power and other utilities here are run the most economic way pos. sible, could say whether the figures presented have been juggled to make the companies look piesarii when they actually have plenty of fat to live off for a while. The commission plans to ask the Ala- bama Legislature next year for author: ization to spend more of the revenue it collects in utility fees for exactly that purpose, It wouldn't mean more money from the general fund, but the surplus reve- nue from fees that the PSC now turns back to the state each year, What likely will be the key to whether the commissioners get that author- ization. is sufficient public sentiment being brought to bear on the lawmak- ers—Sufficient to counter any back stage protests that could be lodged by utility representatives, December 10, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "House Rookies Tighten Ranks By MARCIA KUNSTEL. Advertiser Staff Writer Freshman members of the Alabama House of Repre- sentatives banded together Thursday to assure their in- experienced voices won’t be stifled by the incumbent leadership during upcoming legislative sessions. Calling the 70 per cent membership turnover a “‘mandate for change’’ from the electorate, the new law- makers began laying the groundwork for that change at the legislative orientation session. . About 50 of the 74 freshmen crowded into the Ways and Means Committee room _ for an informal meeting and emerged with the consensus that they must organize if they expect to influence how the lower chamber is run. They scheduled a meeting of all freshmen for Jan. 13, one day before the organiza- tion session where rules will be adopted and the speaker and speaker pro tempore elected. An ad hoc committee from the group met again later in the day to discuss more spe- cific goals and begin plan- ning for the January meet- ing. Rep. Larry Morris of Alex- ander City, acting chairman of both sessions, later told news reporters that many freshmen feel the ex- perienced legislators al- ready are plotting the course of the next session without consulting the new mem- bers. That is a main reason for Irganizing, as well as con- cern over the poor image the legislature has among the general public. Both concerns were evi- denced in a statement of pur- pose adopted by the planning committee, which states the group’s intent is ‘‘to acquire a thorough understanding of processes and procedures of the House of Representa- tives and to assure ex- pediency and equity in pas- sage of legislation.’’ Some legislators spoke of possibly electing a freshman as speaker pro tem, and some suggested major rules changes such as having all committee chairmen elected by the membership rather than appointed by the speak- er. The prevailing attitude, however, favored a more moderate approach geared ‘to assuring freshman repre- sentation on the major com- mittees and to preventing the traditional steamroller- ing of legislation by the House leadership. Morris and others empha- sized the new lawmakers have no intention of wresting total control of the House from the experienced mem- bers, nor do they wish to alienate the governor, the executive branch or the in- ‘cumbents. . Most expressed the belief that Rep. Joe McCorquodale jof JacKson will be elected ele islators equitable treatment. | ‘“‘I feel Joe and the other in- cumbents will be fair to us,’’ ‘said Rep. J. Thomas ‘‘Tom- my’’ Sandusky of Mobile, adding that they will have little choice since the fresh- men hold 70 per cent of the ‘vote. Doubts also surfaced about whether the freshmen could stick together with block votes, or would be ‘‘di- vided and. conquered’’ as the freshmen have been in the past. Recognizing their limita- tions due to lack of ex- perience and knowledge, the committee created a sub- group to study current rules and present proposed changes at the freshmen meeting just before the or- ganization session. They also plan to ask can- didates for speaker pro tem and hopefuls for committee chairmanships to meet with them briefly for a question- ing period at the Jan. 13 ses- sion. They apparently hope to win a concensus at that meeting on what rules to adopt and on the election of House. leaders. December 13, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Decision by Commission Possible On Telephone Rate Hike Request By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Public Serv- ice Commission could rule Tuesday on South Central Bell’s request for a $60 mil- lion rate increase. The case is listed as a dis- cussion item on Tuesday’s PSC agenda, but the com- mission members said Mon- day they were uncertain whether the question would come up for a vote. Associate Commissioner Juanita McDaniel said the PSC staff is to present calcu- Jations on what affect vari- ous rate changes would have on the telephone company. Mrs. McDaniel said she had formed no definite opin- ion on what amount of a rate increase, if any, the utility deserves, and Associate Commissioner C. C. ‘‘Jack’’ Owen would not comment except to say the case will be discussed. PSC President Kenneth Hammond indicated only that he thinks the $60 million request may be a bit high, questioning why the com- pany now says it needs double the amount originally denied by the PSC just 16 months ago. The commissioners turned down South Central Bell’s request for a $29.3 million rate increase in August, 1973, but the utility appealed the decision to Montgomery Circuit Court. This fall Judge Richard Emmet returned the case to the PSC, saying the commis- sion had failed to award the company a fair rate of re- turn. He instructed the commis- sioners not only to reconsi- der, but to take into account increased costs experienced by the utility since the case was initiated early in 1973. In a hearing last month company officials said soar- ing costs have inflated their revenue needs to a total of $60 million a year. The telephone company | has been collecting rates_ equalling its original request | since it appealed the first PSC decision and posted a bond to cover the full amount should the final decision be negative. A main topic during the hearing was the utility’s pro- posed $50 million data center in Birmingham, which com- pany officials said will not be built in this state if a suf- ficient rate increase isn’t forthcoming. Jim Zeigler, commission- er-elect who takes office on the PSC on Jan. 20, in a news release Monday predicted the commission members will ‘grant huge = increas- es’’ to South Central Bell, Alabama Power and a num- ber of smaller utilities this week. He said the actions would be taken in an effort to pre- vent him from calling for their reconsideration after he takes office. The PSC can reconsider any increase within 30 - days of the time it is granted, so Zeigler would be unable to move for reconsideration of any rate changes awarded before Dec. 23. “What we ’re seeing is a railroad job by the utilities,’” Zeigler said. ‘‘They are al pushing to get their increas es through at the elevent company case would cided Tuesday, and Ala- bama Power’s request for a $64 million increase would be ruled on by Friday. Commissioner McDaniel said the PSC has asked par- ties in the Alabama Power case to submit briefs by Jan. 5, although the commission could rule before that date. December 17, 1974 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Wyatt Says Fee System End Strongly Supported ‘ej cans sien By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer State Rep. Cecil Wyatt of Ramer said Thursday a ma- jority of the county’s legisla- tive delegation will support a bill to end the fee system in Montgomery County. Wyatt said he ‘‘and a ma- jority of the delegation are committed to removing our county officials from the fee and percentage system and placing them on an annual salary.” The freshman legislator, who is co-chairman of the de- legation in the House of Rep- resentatives, said he will in- troduce the bill in the regular legislative session that be- gins in May. It is uncertain exactly how much money the clerk of Montgomery Circuit Court, the county tax assessor and the tax collector earn each year under the practice of re- taining a portion of fees col- lected for various services, rather than receiving a straight salary. Advertiser-Journal Editor and Publisher Harold E. Martin reported last month that circuit clerk Pauline. Eubanks received gross rev- enue greater than $60,000, and a net personal income of about $40,000 over one year. Montgomery is Alabama’s only county with a major city that still has major officials on the fee system. Wyatt said he has dis- cussed the change with some of the local officials in- volved, all of whom ex- pressed a willingness to co- operate with the legislators. The Ramer teacher said the delegation likely will meet with the county offi- cials before the session and ask them to help write the new law. A major problem, he said, ‘will be deciding what sala ries to set for the officials. ‘We want to keep it in line with the thinking of the tax- Paying public, but make it large enough to attract the best qualified people to these positions,’’ Wyatt said. The officials involved ‘‘handle a considerable amount of our money, and we want the best people we very can get to serve our needs,’ he said. The change would involve more than simply switching to straight salaries. Now the circuit clerk must pay the salaries of most as- ' 3istants from her court reve- nue, and the clerical workers receive no fringe benefits un- der the arrangement. Wyatt said even if the county picks up these ex- penses by placing the work- ers on the merit system and awarding them benefits such as hospital insurance and re- tirement benefits, the local government still would end 4p operating the office in the dlack. The tax collector, Bill Lyerly, and tax assessor, Marvin Driver, currently re- _ceive a ‘‘small salary’’ from the county, Wyatt said, and a percentage of the city taxes they administer. The new law would give them a larger salary from the county, and a percentage of the city taxes collected by them would be paid the coun- ty to help finance operation of their offices. The fees now retained by the officials would go directly to the county trea- sury under the new law. Wyatt said other county of- ficials may be on a partial fee system, and they, too, would be affected by the switch. Since state law prohibits changing an official's salary in mid-term, the legislation would not take effect until the start of new terms of of- fice. Wyatt said Montgomery County has ‘‘outgrown the old system,\"’ initiated when such jobs were part-time po- port them. Wyatt said he has not polled all members of the lo- cal delegation on the propos- al, but that a majority were contacted, and all supported the change. January 3 , 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Newest Legislators Want Responsibility With Political Power By MARCIA KUNSTEL , Advertiser Staff Writer The freshman revolution in the Alabama House of Representatives seems evolving into more of a minor skirmish than a pitched battle. - And it seems directed more to polishing the tarnished Image of the legislature than to grabbing power from the hands of those expected and expecting to wield it When the neophyte lawmakers first began to gather their collective Wits at an impromptu caucus last month, the prevailing tone was one of agressive indignation: Indigation over past injustices done to inexperienced first-timers like themselves; indignation over tales of past performances that demeaned the offices they now hold; indignation that they had not been consulted yet os how their branch of state government should be un. Coupled with the indignation was the fear that the freshmen, even though they represent some 70 per cent of the House membership, would not get the opportunity to eliminate those things that caused their displeasure With the legislative process. Some thought an overhaul of the rules would be neces- sary, while others spoke of a palace revolt to spread the ’ power, Talk of having the speaker elected by secret ballot or of stripping his authority to appoint committee chair- men did quickly subside, however, as more knowledgable newcomers explained that such proposals would re- quire a change in the State Constitution or Code. As a small committee of the freshmen organizers pre- ‘pared last week for a Sunday meeting on rules revi- sions, they appeared fairly satisfied with the old rules—which had been changed at the start of the 1971 term—and concerned with minor changes rather than a massive rewriting. There was some talk of altering the size of the most important committees so each senatorial district would he represented, and of devising a way to require com- mittee chairmen to bring up bills, some of which have been known never to surface once locked in the grasp of a hostile chairman. The time since that first caucus apparently was spent in some careful scrutiny of the rules, which were found not so objectionable after all. There is still some talk of attempting to elect a fresh- man to the job of speaker pro tem, but whether the new lawmakers are quite that organized is highly question- able. Many are committed to announced candidates, and others sincerely doubt whether a freshman knows the Topes well enough to handle the job. A freshman in that post would be somewhat of an un- usual situation, though not unheard of. The disenchanted freshmen may even be closer to their goals than they realize, a feat accomplished by vis- dbly flexing their muscle in organizing. They can hardly Be ignored by simple virtue of their numbers, which is their distinct advantage over similar groups of freshmen that have attempted to organize in the past. State Rep. Joe McCorquodale of Jackson, the man likely to be selected speaker of the House, is an astute man who even the freshmen believe will be a fair man. McCorquodale could not leave out the newcomers when making committee assignments, and even a meaningful stacking of the more powerful committees ~ would take some fancy footwork. More important, it would be considered an act of bad faith by probably a \" majority of the 70 per cent. It has been made clear to McCorquodale and other in- cumbents that the freshmen take an active interest and hold a deep concern in what the House accomplishes in the coming sessions, that they want a share of the re- sponsibility, not just the power. That likely has done more for their cause than any al- teration of the power structure or revision of the rules January 5, 1975 \f"

The FCC's decision—the first refusal to renew an educational station’s license and only the third denial of any renewal—stipulated the AETC could apply for new li- -censes, but would not re- ceive preferential consid- eration. * Dod also said he would not ‘close the door on an ap- peal,’’ which could be filed in federal court. After attorneys study the ruling, he said, the commis- sion will consider both the economics and legal advis- ability of appealing. i‘ Dod said he was encour- aged that the federal agency found the AETC had not practiced racial dis- criminati@n in hiring, and that it noted discriminatory programming had been cor- rected since complaints of both were filed against the commission back in 1970. While the FCC said it wjJl accept license applications from any persons or group up until April 1, Dod ex- pressed optimism that the AETC would hold an edge over other applicants. He said the network ap- proach is the ‘‘most econom- ically feasible way of oper- ating’ and provides ‘‘great- er diversification and access to resource persons and ma- terial'’ than would be pos- sible if each station were held by a separate licensee. The FCC's initial decision to deny the renewals was made public in September, but no one has announced an interest in taking over the Stations since that time. The FCC said the commis- sion may continue operating the network until permanent licenses are awarded, and Gov. George Wallace said the state would continue op- erations as permitted. Wallace, who appoints AETC members, declined further comment. Sen. James B. Allen, D- Ala... described the decision as ‘‘a Slap in the face’ which ‘‘demonstrates the arro- gance with which non-elect- ed federal bureaucrats con- tinue to treat the good-faith efforts of our people to com- ply with dictatorial edicts.”’ According to: Associated Press reports from Washing- ton, the decision came on a 4-2 vote, with FCC Chairman Richard E. Wiley not partici- pating. In a joint dissent, Commis- sioners Robert E. Lee and Charlotte T. Reid called the decision ‘ta new chapter in the history of the Federal Communications Commis- sion, one which we do not be- lieve to be either reasonable or in the public interest. A chapter which represents to us at least, an attempt to punish, in the harshest way possible, under our rules.”’ The prevailing FCC opin- ion, according to wire re- ports, said: ‘‘The serious under- representation of blacks both on the air and at the pro- duction and planning levels, together with the overt ac- tions of the licensee in reject- ing most of the black-ori- ented programming avail- able to it, constitutes per- suasive evidence that ra- cially discriminatory pol- icles permeated AETC’s programming practices.”’ The decision was the result of complaints filed in 1970 by the Rev. Eugene Farrell, a Catholic priest, student Linda Edwards and Steven Suitts, director of the Civil Liberties Union of Alabama. Suitts is the only com- plainant still a resident of Alabama, according to Dod. Their petition claimed the Alabama network had _ hired virtually no blacks and had declined to broadcast _ tele- vision programs developed for adult blacks in the period between 1967 and 1970. That was the period under question when the renewal first came up in 1970. The FCC did renew the li- cense that year, but in 1972 rescinded its order and called hearings. The final hearing last September was followed a day later by the initial denial. When news of the decision became public, however, the FCC claimed it was a tenta- tive vote which would not be made final until after further consideration. Whether the stations would have to remain educa- tional, rather than com- mercial, remained in ques- tion Wednesday. Dod said that certain sta- tions are set aside by the FCC for educational broad- casting only, but suggested an applicant could ask for conversion to commercial: Each station is operated under a separate license, and an applicant need not ap- ply fdr federal authorization to run all nine stations in question. The FCC could award li- censes to nine different ap- plicants, if that. situation ar- ises. The stations involved are WAIQ in Montgomery, WBIQ in Birmingham, WCIQ at Cheaha State Park, WDIQ in Dozier, WEIQ in Mobile, WFIQ in Florence, WGIQ in Louisville, WHIQ in Huntsville and WIIQ in Demopolis.

        "ocr_text": " Legislator Asks Reversal By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Ethics Commission heard several requests Thursday to reverse earlier rulings, including a decision that legislators cannot represent indigent Clients for a fee paid by the state. Commissioners took the request under advisement, as they did another plea that part-time, assistant dis- trict . attorneys not ; fall under juriBsdiction of the eth- ies law. State Sen. Finis St. John of Cullman asked the com: mission to reconsider its advisory opinion that legisla- tor-lawyers may not represent indigent defendants for a fee, even if appointed to a case by a local circuit judge. St. John said he had been “relieved” to hear the deci- sion, but when he informed his local judge, was tald he'd still have to take a turn as temporary public defender. He just wouldn't get paid. The ruling was based on a section of the law saying a legislator cannot provide professional services for a fee to the state or a local government in his district. In arguing for a reversal, St. John said that when ap- pointed to represent an indigent, ‘‘I'm not providing professional service to the state, but to the defendant.\" The defendant's interests, he said, are totally con- trary to the interests of the state that's prosecuting him, and if the lawyer were providing service to both, that would be a conflict of interest, Asst. Atty, Gen, Bill Stephens generally agreed with St. John's contention, and commission Executive Direc: tor Mel Cooper was directed to further study the ques- tion. The plea that assistant district attorneys not be bound by the ethics law came from Dist, Atty. Tom Sorrells of Dothan, He argued that assistants, especially part-time ones, shovldn’t be considered public officials because they don’t exercise administrative powers. The law defines an official as one who exercises both discretionary and administrative power. Sorrells’ problem is that his assistants, if considered officials under the law, would be prohibited from repre- senting local governments. He said Henry County, in his circuit, has only six at- torneys, His assistants have represented some local boards or agencies for years, and, due to the shortage, it would be difficult to replace them. “There are always potential conflicts of interest,” Sorrell’ admitted, but said he trusted his assistants to %. reeuse themselves in such cases.

        "ocr_text": "PSC Grants Power Co. $54 Million Rate Increase By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Public Service Commission granted a $54 million rate increase to Ala- bama Power Co, Monday, raising the current average electric: bill 97 cents a month. The unanimous PSC action, coupled with an order last month revising the utility's fuel cost pass-on system to fatten its till another $8 mil- lion a year, means Alabama Power will re- ceive only $2 million less than the $64 million requested in the original rate filing last June. Of the $2 million chopped off the request, about half was disallowed for advertising costs deemed “not essential’’ by the commis- sioners, Whether the utility or opposing intervenors will appeal the action remained unknown Monday. Alabama Power spokesmen refused com- ment, and attorney Maurice Bishop, an bppos- ing intervenor on behalf of Gov. George Wal- lace, was out of town and could not be reached, Steve Suitts, director of the Civil Liberties Union of Alabama and also an intervenor, said the group will hold a press conference Wednesday dealing with, among other things, the PSC decision. The commission's order will only raise the current average electric bill by 97 cents a month because the utility has been collecting a temporary increase of $26 million a year since September. Residential users will feel the impact of this decision somewhat more than industrial, since the rate schedules to be drawn up by Ala- bama Power will reflect the increase in an across-the-board manner. When the $26 million emergency increase was granted last fall, the PSC ordered indus- trial customers assessed a higher percentage increase than residential customers. That difference will be erased in the new schedules, with residential users bearing a little larger share of the load than before, The main reason the commission settled ‘on a $54 million increase was to give Alabama Power earnings necessary to issue more bonds for generating plant construction. Earnings must be two times greater than outstanding bonds, and without the increase the utility had less than 1.5 times coverage. PSC Attorney Carl Evans said it would be “disastrous to go to the bond market that low,’ and Associate Commissioner C.C: “Jack\"’ Owen said Alabama Power would have to stop construction projects already in progress without the additional revenue, PSC President Kenneth Hammond said he had hoped to keep the increase down to about $42 million, but the PSC staff calculated that would give the: company only 1.7 times cov- erage by September. Under the increase granted, Alabama Pow- er will have 2.2 times coverage by September, _and be able to issue $78 million in bonds at a 10 “per cent interest rate. If interest rates stand at 12 per cent by then, bonds totalling $65 million could be issued. i ' A major consideration was giving the utility enough revenue to complete two units of the Farley Nuclear Plant under construction in Houston County. The company is expected to spend $198 mil- lion on the two units during 1975, with the first unit to be in service by May, 1976, and the sec- ond by February, 1977. In a news release, apparently being polish- ed during the one and a half hour delay be- tween the scheduled and actual meeting time, the commission noted its action will bring an additional $2 million to state education and mental health programs through the 4 per cent utility, tax. , ql In defense of the PSC decision the release also stated that Alabama must have adequate electric and gas supplies to attract new in- dustry, and specifically cifed the compariy's need for sufficient bond coverage in a plea that intervenors not appeal.

        "ocr_text": "IWew Legislators Decide Against Rules Changes By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The legislative reform movement initiated by freshman members of the Alabama House apparently was stopped dead in its tracks Monday night—or at least was slowed to a crawl. State Rep. Joe McCorquodale of Jackson, expected to be elected House speaker at Tuesday's legis- lative organization § session, threw up the roadblock that freshmen gathered for their own, unofficial organization were reluctant to move aside. Some 60 new members in attendance—of the total 74 freshman—opted. not to con- sider proposals for rules changes after McCorquodale told them he would appoint an official House committee Tuesday to study possible revisions for presentation at the next legislative session—whether special or regular. Rep. James Sasser of Ozark made the motion to dispense with the proposed revisions drawn up by an ad hoc freshman committee Jan. 5, a motion that carried by a 36-29 vote. | 7 An effort by Montgomery Rep. Alvin Holmes to table Sasser's motion failed, when 28 voted to table, 35 against. Many freshmen said after e meeting they thought McCorquodale planned to delay adoption of any rules on Tuesday to await the ex- pected committee report. ’ Rep. Hugh Merrill of An- niston, expected to be ap- pointed Ways and Means Committee chairman by McCorquodale, said, how- ever, that rules would be adopted Tuesday and possi- bly changed at a later date if the proposed committee does recommend revisions. That means the freshmen will have no organized _ sup- “Nort for specific rules when ‘the matter comes up Tues- jay, which was a major rea- son for calling the Monday night meeting. The idea of the night gath-. ering was to present a united front for change, made up of as many of the 74 new members as possible. Although there will be an opportunity to later revise any rules adopted during this week's organization ses- sion, rules revision has been difficult to achieve once into the term of office. McCorquodale’s com- mittee proposal apparently caught most if not all the freshmen by rise, including those who met with the Jack- son lawmaker last week to explain their proposed revi- sions—so he wouldn't be sur- prised. Since the freshmen dis- -pensed with rules consid-. eration, their comparatively short meeting was con- sumed with speeches by various incumbents ex- pected to be appointed chair- men of the three most im- portant = comrittes, by candidates for speaker pro tem, and by McCorquodale. Anniston Rep. Ray Bur- gess, also a candidate for speaker, was at the Capitol, but was not asked to speak. . McCorquodale, Merrill,R Cullman Rep. Tom Drake, expected Rules Committee chairman, and Demopolis Rep. Rick Manley, expected Judiciary Committee chair- man, all pledged they would | be fair to all House members. and give their legislation. open committee hearings. Most also called for unity and harmony and a working legislature. ; Speaker pro tem candi- dates included Reps. Bobby Tom Crowe of Jasper, Rob- ert Hill of’ Florence, and Marilyn Quarles of Spring- ville, the only woman legis- lator. Black House members held a-short caucus prior to the meeting, and were reas- sembling afterward. They reportedly will propose to McCorquodale a black legis- lator to be a committee chairman. McCorquodale, however, has told reporters he already has decided on.a black chair- man. . °. January 14, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Joimt Group Wilt Study State Utilities By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama. Legislature exercised a seldom-used prerogative Wednesday, creating a joint committee with authority to subpoena and punish for contempt. It will study utilities. The committee of four House and four Senate mem- bers is to study “all facets and ramifications concerning the regulation of public utilities in this state.” The group is charged with reporting its findings to both houses by the tenth legislative day of the regular session that begins in May, a report likely to include rec- ommendations for new utility regulatory laws. Although the House leadership attempted to strik: the subpoena and contempt-citing powers from the resolu- tion that originated in the Senate, the House member- ship overwhelmingly refused to comply. -Demopolis Rep. Richard Manley, who has assumed the role of an administration floor leader in the lower chamber, asked for the striking amendment, which was tabled on a voice vote. Anniston Rep. Ray Burgess, one of several who ob- jected to the deletion, said that without such powers the resolution creating the committee ‘isn’t worth the pa- per it’s written on.” The resolution authored by Sen, E.C. “Crum” Foshee of Red Level cited utility rates increasing ‘‘at an as- tronomical rate” and ‘a loud and incessant demand on the part of the public” for the legislature to investigate the regulatory ‘situation as reasons for establishing the committee. ; - The lower: chamber at least delayed creation of anoth- er committee with similar strong powers, which would study the present method of governing state univer- sities, This Senate-originated resolution from the con- -troversy over state universities failing to adhere te rec- ommendations of the Alabama Commission on Higher “Education, (ACHE) which is a purely advisory body with no power to enforce its recommendations.

Chris McNair opposed Manley, calling the present ACHE a “toothless tiger,” and say- ing the vast amounts of state money spent on higher educa- tion mandate a complete study, Rep. Pete Turnham of Auburn, chairman of the House Education Committee, also urged a vote against Man ley, saying the legislators ‘need all the power we can get when we decide on an issue this important,” Although Manley's motion to stike the objectionable section failed, the House was unable to muster the four- fifths majority needed to suspend the rules and pass the resolution immediately. The vote was 75 to 19, All resolutions must be considered by the Rules Com: mittee before action by the full membership, unless the rules are suspended to waive committee consideration. Rules Committee Chairman Tom Drake of Cullman said his committee likely will take up this and other res- olutions sent to it next week There was no controversy in the Senate over granting subpoena powers to the two new committees. The legislature also created joint interim committees to study agriculture problems and the criminal justice system. A Senate-passed resolution to establish another com- mittee to study the problem of lack of space in the Capi- tol Building and Complex was sent to the Rules Com- mitlee in the House, a move prompted by the leadership with no objection.

        "ocr_text": " Zeigler Details Rate Hike Cut By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Public Service Commis- sioner Jim Zeigler said Fri- day he hopes to ask for ‘‘complete revocation’’ of Alabama Power Company’s $54 million rate increase next week. — In his third request for a special PSC meeting to re- consider the rate increase granted Jan. 14, Zeigler de- tailed where adjustments can be made in the rate order to knock millions off the in- crease. Zeigler, sworn in as com- missioner this week, .said he is close to justifying ‘‘com- plete revocation’’ of -. the in- ‘missioner C.C. crease, but in any event is ‘‘optimistic about getting some adjustments, some re- lief.”’ , The request for a meeting on reconsideration was made to PSC President Ken- neth Hammond, who said, with the backing of Associ- ate Commissioner Juanita McDaniel, that he wanted details of Zeigler’s proposal before calling the special meeting. Zeigler first provided only a vague outline of his basis for reconsideration, which was unacceptable to the oth- er two commissioners. Hammond, Mrs. McDaniel and ‘former Com- **Jack’’ Owen, who Zeigler replaced, voted for the $54 million in- crease. Alabama Power had ‘ requested $64 million. On Friday Zeigler sub- mitted the more detailed plan, changing his original ‘request for a Monday meet- ing to ask for -a session on Thursday. Hammond was in Wash- ington for a meeting with federal energy officials, and had not yet seen the new request. \\ If the president does not call a special meeting to take up Zeigler’s reconsideration proposal,’ the new commis- sioner said he will present it at the Feb. 3 regular monthly meeting. In his justification for re- consideration, Zeigler said the PSC failed to take into ac- count $29.4 million of ex- pectéd Alabama Power rev- enue, including money to be accrued through a three- month fuel cost surcharge and through a change in the fuel cost pass-on system. If that revenue were con- sidered, he said, the com- pany would need only a $25 million rate increase to have earnings sufficient to issue - more bonds to finance con- struction projects. That $25 million could be whittle down even further, Zeigler said, by several oth- er adjustments in PSC calcu- . lations. The utility should not be permitted to defer income’ tax credits, which has the ef- fect of reducing Alabama Power’s income on paper, he Said. This argument was ad- vanced by an opposing in- tervenor’ . in the rate case, Gov. George Wallace’s at- torney Maurice Bishop. Zeigler also supported an- other of Bishop’s contentions which was turned ‘down by the. PSC—that income should be considered from new cus- tomers in the year following the test year from which fig- ures were derived. _ The test year was May 1973 to June 1974 and Zeigler said inclusion .of expected reve- nue from new customers in the following year would showB additional revenue of ‘$10 million, cutting the need for a rate increase by that amount. He also held Alabama Power. should not be per- mitted to include in its rate; base expenditures for chari- table contributions, for ad- vertising, for public rela- tions, and for peripheral businesses of selling steam heat and electric appliances. These expenses should be borne by stockholders, he said, not by customers. If they were, the rates could be reduced another. $7 million, _Zeigler said. January 25, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "By MARCIA a2Oe Advertiser Staff Writer Hopes for a speedy special legislative session dwindled Monday from the start, asp state lawmakers refused to limit business to the gover- inor’s proposed interest rate bill and some senators talked of a two-week recess. In the House of Represen- tatives the Ways and Means Committee scheduled a 10 a.m. hearing Tuesday on Gov. George C. Wallace’s proposal to raise the current 6 per cent maximum interest paid by banks on state depos- ts. As outlined in the bill, the interest rate would be tied to the going rate of 9l-day U.S. Treasury notes, which last week stood at 6.4 per cent. Gov. Wallace, in a written message to the legisla- ture, reiterated his hope that this session would be limited to the minimum five days necessary to enact a law and would include no other busi- ness to ‘‘distract’’ the law- makers. The distractions that ap- peared Monday, however, were numerous. One that didn’t surface, but is expected soon, is a sub- stitute bill supported by bankers which would do es- sentially what Wallace wants, but also would change the usury law to raise the maximum 8 per cent in- terest banks now may BEE Reps. charge on loans. That, bankers say, would give them money to make up for the additional amount paid to the state on its depos- its under Wallace’s plan. Rep. Pete Turnham of Au- burn, who said he was not acting on behalf of the bank- ers, did introduce a separate bill which would amend the usury law by raising simple interest from 8 per cent to 10 per cent, and add-on interest from 6 per cent to 8 per cent. Sen. Walter Givhan of Saf- ford introduced an_ identical bill in the upper chamber. To gain passage either of those bills would require two-thirds voting support, Hill and Rick Manley Confer With Sen. \"Stewart since this is a special session and the usury change was not included in the gover- nor’s call. If the usury change were adopted in a substitute for the governor’s bill, only a simple majority would be needed. Rep. Larry Morris of Alex- ander City also offered a re- lated bill, which would re- move real estate loans from jurisdiction of the usury law and place them under the Mini-code. That would have the effect of changing the maximum interest rate on mortgages from 8 per cent simple to 8 per cent add-on. That would be an average 11.76 per cent January 28, 1975 > \f Rep. Mierrill Hands Bill to Reading Clerk Dick Wh annual rate. It would do the same thing as the proposed usury law change, but only cover real estate loans. Morris and others say that change at least would give shot in the arm to the ailing home building industry, by freeing money for con- ventional mortgages. Also in the wind Monday was a possible two-week re- cess on the Senate side of the Rotunda. Although a number of sen- ators said they would not support such a motion, the rationale behind it report- edly is allowing a new, joint interim committee on. finan- cial stability to delve into the entire money situation. That committee, created during last week's organiza- tional session, would hold hearings on the whole spect- rum of financial affairs and report back to the legislature with recommendations. It apparently would con- sider both sides of the ques- tion—how much banks should pay on state deposits and how much they should be permitted to charge for loans. While the Wallace admin- istration has not been recep- tive to the usury law plan or the delay for further study, the original administration bill was changed before being introduced by Annis- ton Rep. Hugh Merrill Mon- day. The original called for the finance director, an ap- pointee of the governor, to determine how much money the state has available for deposit. The bill introduced with the signatures of 64 House members left that authority in the hands of the state trea- surer, an elected official. The administration also could veer from its present course to support, or least not protest, another bill being drawn by an ad hoc group of lawmakers. Spearheaded by Sen. Don Stewart of Anniston and Rep. Robert Hill of Florence, the effort is to offer a substi- tute for the administration bill in committee. It was un- certain Monday whether the move would be made in the House or the Senate. That bill would create a Money Management Board to determine how much state revenue is not needed for im- mediate operating expenses and is available for deposit. It also would authorize the state treasurer. subject to review and approval of the board, to take bids on the de- posit of funds No bids under the average four-week price of U.S Treasury notes would be accepted. Thus the state would re- ceive at least as much in- Advertiser Photo by Mark Ch tacker terest as it would under the administration bill, and probably would get substan- tially more than the pre- dicted $5 million over a four- year period. Sitting on the board would be the treasurer, finance di- rector, revenue commission- er, chairman of the Senate Finance and Taxation Com- mittee and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Another indication the go- ing will be slow in this spe- cial session came in com- ments by Russellville Sen. Joe Fine, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who said he will not call a hearing on the adminis- tration bill until it is passed by the House and sent to the upper chamber. A House-initiated effort for a joint hearing failed. January 28, 1975 (Continued) \f"

        "ocr_text": "House Marks Time Waiting on Senate By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama House of Representatives passed a few minor ills and resolutions Thursday, whiling away time in anticipation of Senate action on the governor's interest ill, That action is expected Friday, and House members must be avallable should the upper chamber in any way amend the measure almed at increasing the amount of Alabama banks pay on state government de- posits The House will have to concur in that event, or work out differences in a conference committee, before the bill can become law, On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee engaged in what likely was an exercise-in futility by ap- proving bill to give state employes a $477 a year, across acrossthe-board pay raise, Most legislators believe this special session will end Friday, meaning time is not sufficient to enact the mea- sure, The action, especially if approved by the House mem: bership Friday, would at least be an indication the. lower chamber favors the idea of a flat dollar amount salary inerease, rather than a percentage hike in pay. The raise would cost the state an additional §12.5 mil lion a year, and, a8 expressed by committee members, wi ge pear cil el te rer pd ployes, Under the percentage plan, the higher the salary, the greater the increase, On the House floor later in the day, the membership refused to adopt a resolution by Montgomery Rep, Alvin Holmes commending U.S. Sen, John Sparkman, D-Ala,, for his stand against substantially increased foreign aid to South Vietnam and Cambodia, With a large number of lawmakers not voting, the House failed to take immediate action on the resolution, by a vote of 2060, which automatically sent the measure to the Rules Committee for deliberation, Rep, Larry Morris of Alexander City questioned whether the Alabama legislature should become in- volved in such a complex problem on the national level, when the state has so many problems of its own, Holmes noted, however, that Gov, George Wallace repeatedly has spoken out against increased foreigr aid, and added that Sparkman, chairman of the U.S, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, probably would appreciate support from his home state's legislature, The House did pass another of Rep. Holmes’ resolu- tions, urging the Alabama congressional delegation to “seek speedier and more efficient mail service for this state,” A resolution by Birmingham Rep, Robert Gafford also won approval. It asks the State Pardon and Parole Board to furnish statistical information on inmate popu- lation to the legislature by the May regular session, The legislature is asking, among other information, the number of inmates in each institution, bow many prisoners each was built to hold, how many have been paroled in each of the last six years, and how many pris- oners are held in local jails awaiting space in state pris- ons, One other resolution adopted before adjournment, by Demopolis Rep, Richard Manley, urges the joint in» terim committee on economic stability to study the home loan situation in Alabama, That question figures in the recent push for raising loan interest rates, a change Gov, Wallace has opposed until further study is made, January 31, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "PRws Cl. States EProwexz- Qiao. RFeate =tudy, By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Public Serv- ice Commission has launched ‘‘a full scale, in- depth study’’ of Alabama Power Company’s rate Structure, aimed at easing the financial strain on low and moderate income cus- tomers. PSC President Kenneth Hammond announced the study that likely will take several months and will be correlated with similar stud- ies undertaken in other states. An ultimate goal of the probe is ‘‘to aid those fami- lies in Alabama that are the hardest hit by the in- flationary trend of recent .months—the low income ‘families and low-middle in- ‘come families,’ Hammond said. A PSC news release said the study will concentrate on “‘peak-load pricing in an ef-. fort to increase conservation of energy and therefore help to conserve the natural re- sources.”’ That generally means the PSC staff conducting the study will consider setting certain rates for lower kilo- watt usage, and higher rates for greater use of electricity. Essentially, persons would be financially penal- ‘ized for consuming large amounts of electricity, and would be encouraged to con- serve energy. The break would go to those without an abundance of electric appliances, to those with smaller homes to - heat and air condition, or to those cutting back on usage. The rate per kilowatt would not be increased un- der this theory until the cus- tomer reached a certain lev- el of consumption. Hammond also said Thursday the PSC has in- stituted a new policy to keep closer tabs on the fuel costs of Alabama Power. . Under a new fuel cost pass- on system begun Jan. 1, Ala- bama Power estimates the amount of fuel it will need to purchase in a month, and passes on the expected cost to customers in billings for the month the coal will be burned. The utility, according to Hammond, will be required to submit more com- prehensive monthly fuel re- ports than in the past, and will be subject to periodic bookkeeping checks by the PSC staff. The PSC has been criti- cized by some for failing to outline exactly how it will as- sure Alabama Power does not purchase more fuel than actually needed, or that it does not buy coal at higher than prevailing rates. Hammond especially has issued concern over Ala- bama Power’s coal purchas- ing policies, questioning whether the utility pays ‘more than necessary in buy- ing from a company whose president is a business asso- ciate of Alabama Power President Joseph Farley. In other PSC activity Thursday, Associate Com- missioner Jim Zeigler con- tinued his efforts to win re- consideration of Alabama Power’s $54 million rate in- crease, granted earlier this month. The commission refused to reconsider Wednesday, cit- ing as one reason an opinion from PSC Attorney Carl Evans that the commission has no authority to modify its order as proposed by Zeig- ler. Zeigler requested an opin- ion from Atty. Gen. Bill Bax- ley, asking for advice on whether the PSC can legally modify the order. Regardless of what Baxley replies, the other two PSC members have shown them- selves not favorable to re- consideration, sticking to their original rate order. Zeigler would need ap- proval from at least one oth- er commissioner to win re- consideration and a sub- sequent change in the order. January 31, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Media, Military Face Off to Discuss Roles Newsmen Argue Concept Of Adversary Reporting By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Air War College students and newsmen from national and local publications ex- plored the adversary nature of media-military relations Monday, at times becoming adversaries in the process. The panel discussion of **‘Media Responsibility’’ and subsequent questioning of the panelists were part of the. two-day Media-Military. Dialoge—’75, the first sym-: posium on the news business. offered at the Air War Col- lege of the Air University at. Maxwell Air Force Base. After three panelists and; moderator Peter Arnett, Pu- litzer Prize-winning corre-: spondent for Associated. Press, gave their views of the Fourth Estate’s duties,: audience questions centered) on whether the media’s ad- versary role has exceeded practical bounds. Reed J. Irvine of Accuracy in Media Inc., noting that elected officials ultimately are responsible for the con- sequences of their actions, asked whether reporters ever bear that burden, or even consider repercussions of their stories. Arnett contended that the press ‘‘tends to police it- self,’’ and Henry Luce III, vice president of corporate planning for Time said such self-policing comes through competition and diversity. “If a story is not being told in one place,’’ Luce said, ‘“*generally speaking, it will be told in another.” Another inquirer ex- pressed concern that any ad- versary role by the press would distort the news and prevent an airing of the gov- ernment’s' case. Panelists Luce and Ad- vertiser-Journal Managing Editor Ben Davis both cited the difference between the reporter as adversary and the reporter as antagonist, saying the latter has no place at their publications. And Arnett replied that only a small percentage of news writers fit the descrip- tion of adversary, assuring the government’s story does get told. On the same general topic, Lt. Gen. Daniel James Jr., former assistant defense secretary for public affairs and also a panelist, said the military man’s chief com- ' plaint is lack of balance. The picture of the military painted by the media has been mostly negative, James said, with little em- phasis on positive military programs. In opening comments, Ar- nett called the press ‘‘the link between the public and the government,’” helping he people k their minds—like they did about Vietnam and Watergate. He said expected sources of conflict between the mili- tary and media in coming months include the Middle East, especially regarding increasing U.S. involvement there, and the Central In- telligence Agency, now un- der investigation for pos- sible illegal activities. “It seems this is the year the spooks (spies) will get theirs,” Arnett said, which likely will result in the mili- tary becoming ‘‘furious’’ over sensitive disclosures. — Davis’ opening statement concerned three main re- sponsibilities of the media, which he cited as _ responsi- bilities to inform the reader, to treat the subjects of news stories fairly and to do -the best job possible as profes- sionals. - In expanding on duties of the press, Luce said they include giving full coverage of govern- ment activities, offering a complete picture of the living environment, provi ure to: the world of fies aad telling the truth. Gen. James, who has had to straddle the fence be- tween disseminating infor- mation and guarding it in the sake of national security, said he ‘‘leaned heavily to the importance of a strong, free press if we are to remain a strong, free society.’’ February 4, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "State Revenue Flow Grim By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer State Budget Officer James V. ‘‘Jake’’ Jordan made his expected grim pre- dictions of general fund rev- enues for the next biennium Tuesday, saying only four major new expenditures will consume all additional tax dollars in the fund. Those expenditures, if ap- proved when the legislature adopts a new biennial budget this summer, would prohibit expansion of existing pro- grams or initiation of other new services, Jordan told a legislative committee. Jordan, noted for con- servative budget estimates, said general fugd revenues for the next biennium should total $332.9 million. That means the legislature will have $14.5 million more to spend in each of the next two fiscal years than was budgeted for the current year. The general fund supports most state services except education, mental health and highways, which are fi- nanced from separate funds. Members of the legisla- ture’s Joint Interim Fiscal Study Committee, charged with exploring the state’s fi- nancial situation, also learned that several propos- als already favored by many lawmakers would spend more than the additional $14.5 million a year Jordan said will be available. These include a 5 per cent pay raise for state employes, debt service on a $45 million bond issue for state docks improvements and a $15 mil- lion bond issue for a new leg- islative building, and imple- menting provisions of the ju- dicial article to the State Constitution, which includes raising judicial salaries. Although the projected in- crease in tax revenues is comparable to the increase expected in the current bien- nium, higher costs for exist- ing programs and demands for new services would wipe out the extra tax dollars. Also, the lawmakers must contend with federal cut- backs in programs adminis- tered by the state, which means the state's financial share must increase if serv- ices are to remain even at the status quo in some areas. This especially is expected to affect health programs. Before the legislature even deals with the next biennial budget, it must re- solve a financial crisis in the Medicaid program. Jordan repeated earlier warnings that Medicaid will close shop in June without a $7.6 million supplemental appropriation to fund serv- ices the remainder of tiis fis- cal year, which ends Sept. 30. In explaining projected revenues from some major taxes that make up the gen- eral fund, Jordan said these are the most stable ones col- lected by the state, affected little by inflation or reces- sion. For example, general fund revenues for this fiscal year are expected to be 6.3 per cent higher than last year, should increase another 6.8 per cent in fiscal 1975-76, and an additional 5.5 per cent in fiscal 1976-77, according to James R. Raiford, Jordan’s assistant. If the taxes followed the general inflationary trend, as sales and income taxes do, the increases would be considerably higher. Jordan predicted no un- usual increase in any gener- al fund revenues, except for a $5 million jump in interest paid by banks on state depos- its. That is due mostly to rais- ing the amounts deposited, although a change in the in- terest law adopted in last week’s special legislative session could add more mon- ey under the right economic conditions. Jordan said those condi- tions aren’t expected to ma- terialize. \\ On Wednesday the fiscal’ study committee begins hearings in which some state departments will present budget proposals, outline special financial problems, and justify their needs. The Medicaid program and State Mental Health De- partment will make presen- tations Wednesday. February 5, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Fnoncal Study Committee Holds Capitol Spotlight By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staif Writer One of the most heart-rending shows in town has been playing this week at the State Capitol and should be held over throughout most of February. The title will change mid-stream, but’ the perform: ance should remain essentially the same, Produced and directed by the people's representa- tives, it’s called the Joint Interim Fiscal Study Com- mittee hearings, After next week it will be billed as hearings of the Joint Interim Committee on Finance and Taxation, Most of the players will be same for both versions, though the cast will be expanded some later. Holding featured roles are most all state department heads, with supportive action supplied at times by their subordinates, While the state legislators sitting on the {wo committees were expected to have starring spots, many have limited themselves to only cameo appear- ances, much to the chagrin of some cohorts who had hoped all the committeemen would accept meaty parts. But that's show biz. Although the acting shines in spots, the plot hardly al- ters from scene to scene. The script does vary, however, in carrying out the over-all theme, which actually presents a microcosmic view of nationwide, even world- wide, suffering. ‘On the other hand, it also can be perceived as a micro- cosm of the individual family experience, The theme itself is an old one with a few new (wists, re- volving around that timeless villain—money, and the lack thereof. The department heads mentioned earlier are the symbolic victims, making plaintive appeals for rescue to their potential saviours on the committees. -. They are symbolic victims, for they represent the poor, the sick, the mentally diseased, prisoners of all sorls—and other taxpayers, For liberation they have turned to the stalwart souls holding the moneybags, who, unfortunately, have had little experience in the art of liberating and who seem, from their performances to date, to have little detailed Knowledge of the villain and its relationship to the vic- tims, Here the plot becomes a bit sticky. The heroes suspect that some symbolic victims are overstating their cases, are, in fact, in collusion with the villain, or at least are exacerbating its capacity to do ill ‘ The victims, in return, hold serious doubts that the heroes are as helpless to supply aid and relief as they say. Tn all fairness, it must be inserted here that previous productions of similar shows have resulted in suspi- cions on both sides being borne out later. The current show differs some from those earlier pro- ductions, mainly due to outside complications working in behalf of the villain. These include inflation and re- cession, which have brought grief to both the victims and the heroes, Alas, what may be a fatal flaw in the heroes is a char- acteristic which was displayed in the past, but may have an even more deleterious effect on some victims in this presentation. That is the failure, likely the inability, to dig deeply enough into the various appeals of the victims to deter- mine which ones are in serious need and which are pad- ding their tales, It is the inability to learn where inefficiencies exist, where programs are failing to provide the services in- tended, arid how, in short, to demand accountability. That last word was supposed to be the key to the whole Show this go-round, but as yet it has not made the ex- pected appearance. But the production has not been played out till the end, and the final resolution won't be known until the delayed last act this summer. Tune in then, when the heroes make it known how they will deal with the villain, and which victims will be aided to what extent. vo No innovative climax nor any total rescue is ex- pected. Some victims may be lost, And the heroes will mourn, February 9, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Dam Break Empties Bouldin Lake Accident Idles APC Generators By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer About 4 per cent of Alabama Power's generating ca- pacity was washed away Monday in a rush of water careening through a gaping hole in the Walter Bouldin Dam near Wetumpka. The deluge that emptied Bouldin reservoir through the as yet unexplained break in the dam had slowed to a steady stream by Monday night, and no river flooding was expected. Area residents were plucking fish from the muddy re- servoir bottom, but also had to contend with beached and damaged boats and no drinking water in some sec- tions. Alabama Power officials, too, had more than fish on their minds, as they contemplated the $10-§20 million price tag on repairing the dam and generating plant that will be incapacitated for about a year. With a 225,000 kilowatt capacity, the plant is the utili- ty's top hydroelectric generator, and, based on figures from a recent company report, it represents about 4.1 per cent of total capacity. Richard Peacock, company director of advertising and publicity, said there shouldn't be any electricity shortage in the immediate future, but summertime could bring a different story. He said the company will begin looking for supple- mentary power supplies immediately, and with no new or expanded plants expected on-stream soon, that likely means purchasing electricity from neighboring-state utilities. “We could be short this summer,” said Public Service Commissioner Juanita McDaniel, who visited the dam site Monday afternoon, “Conservation is going to be more important as the days go by,” she said, Mrs, McDaniel, who toured the wreckage with utility Senior Vice President Alan R. Barton, said officials there estimated repairs could cost as much as $20 mil: lion, but noted there had been no detailed assessment of damage to generating equipment, Much of it had been submerged afler the earthen por: tion of the dam burst about 1:30 a.m. Monday, causing no personal injury since the lone guard on duty barely escaped upon discovering water seeping into the plant, Peacock, who estimated repairs would cost ‘‘in ex- cess of $10 million” and take about a year te complete, said the first construction will be a cofferdam, or tem: porary dam, It should be built in the next three weeks on a canal connecting the northeast portion of the Bouldin facility with Jordan Lake and dam, he said, The Coosa River flows into Lake Jordan, and its wa- ters flow through the canal into the man-made Bouldin lake to run the Bouldin generator, Jordan Dam was opened to lower the level of Lake Jordan some 12 feet, to prevent more water from flow: ing through the canal and into the broken Bouldin Dam, which is connected by a second canal to the Coosa River below Wetumpka, The Lake Jordan level will be raised again, Peacock said, once the temporary dam is built Although the rush of water into the Coosa River, Which runs into the Alabama River north of Montgom: ery, had slowed by evening, it was expected to raise the Alabama River to $1 feet here Monday night, just four feet below flood level. A spokesman for the U.S, Weather Service at Dan- nelly Field said the 40 hight was not expected to seriously swell the river fur- ther, Weiss and Logan Martin Dams, upstream from the Jordan and Bouldin facilities, were holding water at near flood storage capacity earlier Monday to prevent a dangerous influx of water here, But as the situation eased, those dam levels were allowed to “move down: ward.\" Peacock said. Both Peacock and Mrs, McDaniel said there had been no word Monday evening as to what caused the seven and a half year old Bouldin Dam to split, but there apparently was no suspicion of foul play, Exactly who will be responsible for damage to private properly remained unanswered Monday, LP. Patterson, division captain of the U.S, Coast Guard Auxiliary, said boats in Lake Jordan were being damaged as the water level dropped, and warned that vessels left “high and dry” would be in danger when the level eventually eases up to normal again, Peacock had little comment when questioned, other than to say he hadn't heard of definite damages, Jordan area residents also were affected, according lo Mrs. McDaniel, by cutting off of their water supply, which she said is not expected to be running again for several days. Alabama Power Company President Joseph Farley called on Gov, George C. Wallace in mid-afternoon to apprise him of the situation, Farley and Power Co, attorneys Schuyler Baker and Warren Goodwyn conferred with the governor for al- most an hour, Farley told the governor (hat despite the power loss, Alabama can continue its industry search and that the loss should not impair industrial production in the state February 11, 1975 > \fThe Montgomery Advertiser ‘Mudflat Estates’ Owners of lakefront property found themselves fronting not-so-pretty mudflats as a result of the break in the Walter Bouldin Dam near Wetumpka. —Advertiser Photo Private piers that once stretched out like fingers into the water now only point to dwindling puddles.

        "ocr_text": "‘About $17 Million’ Tab Put on Repair of Bouldin By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The cost of repairing Boul- din Dam was fixed at ‘‘about $17 million’ Wednesday, but disaster insurance ‘will cov- er a substantial part of the loss,’' an Alabama Power Co. official said. Alan R. Barton, company senior vice president, said it hadn't been determined ex- actly how much of the con- struction cost would be paid from insurance, partly be- cause the exact cost was still unknown. If insurance does pay a hefty portion of the bill, that should make an immediate request for an electric rate increase less likely. Initial construction of a temporary dam had begun Tuesday, the day after the earthen dike portion of the Bouldin Dam near We- tumpka split to leave a 400-foot gap. That still unexplained break drained the small lake crete dam and earthen dike. at Bouldin and totally The utility is ‘conducting stopped generation of elec- an extensive investigation tricity at the utility's largest into the possible cause’’ of hydroelectric plant. Once the temporary dam is completed, which should take three weeks if weather permits, the level of Lake Jordan should be raised to normal again. Jt has been lowered about 12 feet. Lake Jordan fed water into the Bouldin lake through a canal, and was lowered to prevent an influx of water into the broken dam and from there into the Coosa River below Wetumpka, which is connected to Boul- din by a second man-made canal, After the temporary dam is raised, construction to re- pair Bouldin Dam can begin. Company spokesman Clint Claybrook said it was uncer- tain whether Bouldin would be rebuilt in the same man- ner it originally was con- structed in 1967, with the con- the dam break, Claybrook said, and the results of that scrutiny likely will deter- mine how the dam will be rebuilt. Officials from the Federal Power Commission, on the scene shortly after the mis- hap occured Monday, are “cooperating with the com- pany in the investigation,” he said, but are not con- ducting an independent in- quiry. Of Alabama Power's 13 dams at hydroelectric plants, Smith Dam on the Warrior River is the only ‘built entirely of dirt and rock fill. The rest are either total- ly concrete, or combined with an earthen dike like Bouldin, Claybrook said the FPC demands such facilities be inspected once every five years by a team of engineers from Alabama Power, from an independent consulting company, and from South- ern Services, the technical arm of the Southern Com- pany, the parent company of Alabama Power, The utility also conducts its own inspections every other year at each plant, he said, February 12, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "CSS UOI\"s Budyaet ra ees Claus ttairas By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Commission on Higher Education once again attempted to limit Troy State University’s ex- pansion Monday, adopting a policy to curtail funding at the school’s Montgomery and Ft. Rucker branches. The action came at the close of a day-long budgeting session, where officials of several state universities rose to protest ACHE staff recommendations on fund- ing. In light of the complaints, the commission did not ap- prove the $429.8 million budget, but directed the staff to confer with various uni- versity presidents and re- turn with modifications at a Thursday meeting. The ACHE does not have final word on the budgets, but makes recommenda- tions to the legislature, which frequently is swayed by university appeals for more funds than recom- mended. The universities re- quested a total of $549.7 mil- lion. The proposed budget would reduce Troy State’s request from a two-year to- tal of $4.3 million to $347,908 at the Maxwell Air Force Base branch in Montgem- ery, and from the requested $3.8 million to $267,813 at the Ft. Rucker branch. Indicating the totals would not be substantially altered in the final budget, the com- mission adopted two _ resolu- tions outlining justification for the low funding. These will be transmitted to the legislature with the ACHE budget proposal. One resolution outlines a policy for only limited state funding at university branches on military bases, since the federal govern- ment reimburses military personnel for tuition ‘‘that can be set high enough to make such programs self- supporting.”’ It further states the policy “is consistent with past ex- pressions of legislative in- tent,’’ since the lawmakers never funded such military branches until approving a $150,000. appropriation for Troy’s Maxwell and Ft. Rucker operations. The second, related reso- lution, said Troy’s Montgom- ery branch, located primar- ily at Maxwell AFB, should not be permitted-to become ‘‘a third publicly supported Civilian institution’’ in Mont- gomery, but should maintain the status of a military branch. The final show-down in the commission’s long battle against further Troy State expansion here should come in the legislative chambers this spring or summer, which the ACHE acknowl- edged by saying it will ‘‘sup- port full and completel whatever the legislature de- clares as the final expression of the public policy of this state. On hand to protest the move was an angry Dr. Freddie Wood, assistant to Troy State President Ralph Adams, who said it’s time **to clear the air once and for all’ about the school’s Mont- gomery branch. ' “It exists,’’ he said. ‘‘Max- well is not the whole branch, but a component.”’ The branch currently has 2,017 students, he said, and has awarded 468 degrees. ‘*‘The only reason Troy State at Montgomery is now at Maxwell is because it saves the taxpayers mon- ey,’’ Wood said. Under questioning he ad- mitted the Montgomery branch is not accredited to grant degrees, which are awarded through the main campus at Troy. Several other university officials complained about the funding formula used by. the commission staff, saying all schools can’t be plugged into all components of the formula and have their fi- nancial needs accurately as- sessed. In one case—for Alabama A&M budget— the ACHE did direct revisions since the staff proposed the school’s budget request be awarded, while the formula showed it should have more money than requested.

        "ocr_text": "ClCourt Rewerses Latham Verdic MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals over- turned Tuesday the con- viction of Ruby Lee Latham on grounds she was in- correctly charged in a $94,000 State Highway De- partment fraud case. Evidence and testimony presented in Miss Latham’s first Montgomery Circuit Court trial provided ‘‘ample substantial support for a finding by a jury that she participated in a scheme that defrauded the State of Alabama by a false repre- sentation as alleged in the first count of the in- dictment,’’ the appeals court said in a unanimous, opinion, But Miss Latham also was charged with larceny, and the court found that charge insupportable, thus reversed the conviction. Miss Latham, the secre- tary-treasurer of Machinery and Supplies, Inc., was found guilty ‘twice in the lower court on two of a total 23 in- dictments and was sen- tenced to two 10-year prison terms. Tuesday’s action came on appeal of the first con- viction. The second eonviction—on the same two charges as the first—has yet to be argued before the appeals court. -The charges, brought by 24-page Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley, re- volve around a scheme in which he alleges Machinery and Supplies, and Miss Lath- am as the Montgomery com- pany’s only remaining offi- cer, defrauded the state by failing to deliver machinery parts ordered and paid for by the Highway Department. The circuit court jury re- turned a general verdict of guilty on both counts in the indictment, not a verdict limited to just the false pre- tense charge. Conviction on the larceny charge was incorrect, the appellate court found, be- cause larceny must include a taking and carrying away of property. ‘However defendant may have enriched herself un- justly or illegally,’”’ the court said, ‘‘she did not do so by taking and carrying away . lawful currency and coinage of the United States of Amer- ica.”’ That was the charge in the indictment. Miss Latham never re- ceived currency from the state, but a state warrant, or check, which was deposited ‘-in her company's bank ac- count. While Miss Latham’s at- torney’s also contended the false pretense conviction was in error, the appeals judges said that action was supported by the evidence. Since the lower court jury returned a general verdict on both counts, however, the appeals court said it must overturn the conviction. Another ground for the ap- peal was that the circuit judge should not have allowed certain testimony relating to Robert O. Wilson, a suspended Highway De- partment supervisor also in- dicted in the scheme, but not tried with Miss Latham. The appeals court agreed the statement should not have been admitted in evi- dence. The court recognized it needn't respond to defense ‘contentions regarding the false pretense charge or the statement admitted into evi- dence, since the ruling on the larceny charge was suf- ficient to overturn the con- viction. But the jurists responded, they said, ‘‘in the interest of a final proper disposition of this case.’’ If the case is tried again or appealed to the Alabama Su- preme Court, the parties and their attorneys will have the ben in efit of responses to all questions raised. the appeal, the opinion said.

        "ocr_text": "FPC Opens Investigation of Bouldin Dam Rupture By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Federal Power Commission has begun a formal probe into why Alabama Power Company’s Walter Bouldin Dam ruptured Feb. 10, an investigation encom- passing the condition of all other ‘‘related” dams. The order for an independent investigation and for- mal hearing was issued late last week, at the same time representatives of the U.S. Justice Department were here digging into official records in connection with charges that the electric utility is a monopoly. The FPC staff was directed to conduct an exam: ination into what is termed the Bouldin dam “failure” and into “the potential for failure of any other related dams” built by Alabama Power, according to James Stout, chief of the FPC Division of License Projects in Washington, D.C. “It's a very unusual happening to have a dam fail- ure,” Stout said in a telephone interview. ‘I don't be- lieve the commission ever held a comparable hearing.” The FPC staff is to probe ‘the books, records, facil- ities and properties of the Alabama Power Co., its par- ents, affiliates or subsidiaries,” the order reads, The results will be presented at a hearing conducted by an administrative law judge at a time and place to be set later by the FPC secretary, Stout said. The investigation is “barely under way,” he said, and likely will take.several weeks to complete, Stout said engineers from the FPC’s Atlanta and Washington, D.C, offices were on the scene immediate- ly after Alabama Power's largest hydroelectric dam suddenly burst in the early morning hours Feb. 10 in an explosion of water, emptying the man-made Bouldin Jake into the Alabama River. They inspected the site and took photographs then, and are checking the condition of other Alabama Power facilities, pursuant to the FPC order, he said. Most tests and studies, however, are being conducted by a “board of consultants” hired by Alabama Power, and the results will be scrutinized at the hearing. Stout said the utility was “‘required to hire’” the three- member board of “nationally known engineers,\" whose. names he did not know. A spokesman for Alabama Power, who also could not relate the engineers’ names or fees, said the utility re tained the board before the FPC order was issued Thursday, Both Stout and A. Harris Goldwasser, an FPC super visor in Atlanta, said the federal agency inspects all: such hydroelectric dams annually, and has no record of deficiencies at the Walter Bouldin Dam. Residents near the facility south of Wetumpka, how- ever, have stated water seepage through the earthen dike that “failed” has been observed since the facility was completed in 1967. Goldwasser said plans for the dam were approved by the FPC, and no variance from those plans has been noted by federal investigators ing n al inspections. - Reports on those inspections are not open to the pub- lic, he said, Clint Claybrook, Alabama Power spokesman, said the temporary dam has been completed at the site, and the level of Lake Jordan, connected to the Walter Boul- din facility by canal, will be raised back to the normal 252 feet as soon as tests determine the temporary dam is “sufficient,” Both the original dirt dike at Walter Bouldin and the new, temporary cofferdam were built by Harbert Con- struction Co. of Birmingham, Claybrook said, The company also leases coal mines from Alabama Power, mines the coal, then sells it back to the utility. The relation between the Harbert company and Ala- bama Power has been questioned periodically by Public Service Commission President Kenneth Hammond, Neither Goldwasser nor Stout from the FPC could say What punitive powers the agency would exercise if it found negligence caused the dam ‘‘failure.” The US. Justice Department probe of Alabama Pow- er revolves around access to transmission lines and to nuclear power plants by small electric systems which purchase wholesale power from the utility. * Charges that Alabama Power is an illegal monopoly were heard before the old Atomic Energy Commission in December. . ‘ Last week Justice Department representatives were here interviewing members and staff of the Public Serv- ice Commission, which regulates utilities here, They left with transcripts of proceedings involving the Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant near Dothan and Alan R. Barton Nuclear Plant proposed to be built near Clanton, ’ The PSC is about to open an investigation into Ala- bama Power's rates, construction program, financing practices and fuel purchases next week. Commissioners have indicated they will take an espe- cially close look at earlier approval of the Barton plant. February 25, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Baxley Opinion Asserts Attorney’s Hiring Illegal By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley issued an opinion Tuesday that a legislative interim committee cannot hire an attor- ney, resulting in Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley's former law partner being cut from the state payroll. The opinion came in responsé to an inquiry from Montgomery State Rep. Alvin Holmes, who said he wanted to know whether the hiring of an attorney by a joint interim committee studying utilities was legal. That committee is chaired by State Sen. E.C. “Crum’’ Foshee of Red Level, who recently hired Bill Robertson, Beasley's old law partner, as committee counsel. “IT would have done it if it was my own brother,” Holmes said of initiating the action, emphasizing his request for an opinion had nothing to do with the lieuten- ant governor. “It sets a dangerous precedent,”’ he said. Holmes said he immediately took the opinion to the state comptroller, who took Robertson from the payroll. Foshee, who has been close to Beasley in the Senate, issued a stinging response that he was “shocked” Bax- ley ‘‘would attempt to sabotage the only serious in- vestigation of the high utility rates by ruling that a legis- lative committee cannot employ an attorney.” Foshee said it has been “past practice” for such com- mittees to hire whatever personnel needed to perform . their duties, adding he will ask Gov. George Wallace to furnish the committee with the services of Maurice Bishop. Bishop has represented Wallace in numerous utility regulatory cases, opposing rate increases. If Bishop cannot work with the committee, Foshee said it will get a lawyer “if I personally have to employ one.” “T want to advise Mr. Baxley that his siding with the utilities against the people of Alabama will not work, he said, He charged that Baxley, ‘with all his hundreds of em- ployes,”” has not “‘lifted a finger to stop the outrageous rise in utility rates,” adding the attorney general ‘‘and his utility friends can take his opinion and they know what they can do with it.” The resolution setting up the committee, which held its first formal meeting last week, provides the secre- tary of the Senate and clerk of the House shall supply “such clerical assistance as may be necessary for the committee’s work.” In his opinion Baxley cited several cases defining clerical assistance ‘‘as aids in the execution of official authority such as writing letters, making entries of record, copying grants, and like service.” Employment of an attorney, he said, does not fall within clerical assistance. Robertson does not have experience as a utility attor- ney, Foshee has said. The committee has obtained sev- eral other persons from state universities and the Gov- ernor’s Office of Consumer Protection who do have backgrounds in.utility regulation. February 26, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "PSC Predicts 5-7 Rate Hikes By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Alabama Power Co. will need five to seven ‘‘massive rate increases’’ in coming years if the utility proceeds with its proposed nuclear plant in Chilton County, a legislative committee was told Thursday. The plant will cost at least $2.9 billion, and the con- sumers will have to pay for it, said Public Service Com- mission President Kenneth Hammond. Although the PSC already has approved construction, Hammond has indicated the commission will take a close look at that approval during investigative hearings be- ginning next week. The interim committee studying utilities and their regulation also got bad news from Associate Commission- er Juanita McDaniel, who said the PSC was told by offi- cials of Alabama Gas Corp. on Thursday that its fuel Ppass-on will increase sub- stantially next month. The company is allowed to pass to consumers—both residential and industri- al—any increases in natural gas costs. Mrs. McDaniel did sound a moderately bright note, however, projecting lower coal costs followed by de- creases in Alabama Power's similar fuel pass-on charges. The two commissioners were invited to tell the com- mittee any way the legisla- ture might aid the PSC in its regulatory duties, and to help explain how regulation works. Hammond predicted the five tn seven rate increases in discussing the lack of at- tention given to utility requests for certificates of convenience and necessity. Those certificates must be granted by the PSC before a utility such as Alabama Power can construct a new ‘plant. **One of the simple ways to stop rate increases,’’ Ham- mond said, ‘‘is to challenge the certificates.’’ While opponents generally appear at rate increase cases, they seldom, if ever, protest the granting of cer- tificates, Hammond said. Once the certificate is in hand and construction under way, the PSC cannot deny a utility the funds to complete work and operate the facil- ity. | Both Hammond and Mrs. McDaniel, who appeared for questioning separately, said the PSC needs more profes- sional staff to assess the ex-_ pert testimony supplied by utilities asking for. more_ money. State Rep. Douglas John- stone of Mobile suggested the state might create a new consumer advocate agency to represent the consumer viewpoint during PSC pro- ceedings, which the commis- sioners agreed should be considered. Hammond offered little - hope of easing utility rates, warning the legislators that utilities are so powerful and so complex that they cannot be effectively opposed. “‘I hope the warning will go out that what we're talking about is destruction of the free enterprise system,’’ said State Sen. T. Dudley Perry of Tuskegee, suggest- ing the nation may turn to socialization of utilities if changes aren’t made. The committee also asked both commissioners about a possible inverted rate struc- ture, in which those who use the least electricity pay less per kilowatt hour. Now greater consumers pay less, mainly because it costs less to serve them. Both commissioners ex- pressed some doubts over such a change, noting that in- dustry is attracted here now by low utility rates and that much of the burden could be shifted to the middle class. The committee is inviting Alabama Power President Joseph Farley to appear at a meeting next week. February 28, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Poor Ethics Judgment Ruled By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Two of the state’s most powerful officials used ‘“‘poor judgment’ in accept- ing a free airplane ride to New York, the State Ethics Commission ruled Friday, but they did not violate the ethics law. The ruling came on a com- plaint filed by Anniston State Rep. Ray Burgess against Finance Director James Solomon and Mental Health Commissioner Taylor Har- din, a top advisor to the gov- ernor. Burgess charged that ac- cepting the plane ride vio- lated a section of the ethics law prohibiting officials from taking anything of val- ue if the intent is to influence them or if it can be inferred they would be influenced by the gift. The commission said the trip had been authorized by the governor as state busi- ness, so the free ride actually was a gift to the state, not to the men. ‘ Their expenses would have been reimbursed from the state treasury. “The two men and their wives flew on a plane leased by Harry Brock, president of Central Bank of Birming- ham, who also went to New York, but.on a commercial flight. Agnes Baggett, then state treasurer, also flew there on a commercial airplane, and she, the other two officials and their wives, all stayed at the St. Regis Hotel there at the expense of First National City Bank of New York. The two banks were desig- nated paying agents in the sale of $30 million in bonds is- sued by the Alabama Public School and College Author- ity, of which Solomon is sec- retary. Solomon and Hardin re- paid the hotel, food and en- tertainment expenses, but the commission said Mrs. Baggett ‘‘provided no _ infor- mation to indicate that she has reimbursed the bank _ for her expenses.’’ Mrs. Baggett, now secre- ‘tary of state, did not violate the law because she came under a ‘‘grandfather clause’’ exempting officials from the law until their new term of office. _ The commission said it found no evidence to show that Hardin or Solomon, by virtue of their offices, could influence the sale of bonds or designation of banks as pay- ing agents. Mrs. Baggett was in a posi- tion more susceptible to in- fluence, the commissioners said, simce she could affect the amount of money banks make on state funds by de- ciding how long funds re- main on deposit in various banks. ‘“‘The officials showed poor judgment in accepting air transportation for them- selves and their wives,’’ the commission said, ‘‘however the high moral character and past performance of’ their official duties serve to persuade the members of the commission that in this in- stance the ethics act was not violated.’’ The commission noted it has leaned toward warnings rather than punishment in its first year of enforcing the ethics law, but warned that others should be aware of the heavy penalties violations carry. It recommended that the governor’s office decide in the future whether such trips should be accepted free, and whether they would benefit the taxpayers or the individ- uals. The commissioners also suggested that state officials on state business ‘‘refrain from excessive expenses for travel, hotel or motel accom- modations, which appears to be true in this case.’’.

        "ocr_text": "Consumer's Voice Ominously Silent On Top of Goat Hill By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer While consumers are popping up across the nation in government proceedings of every stripe, they remain an elusive quantity in Alabama. Absence of the consumer's voice, which becomes lou- der by the day in other locales, has been most apparent during legislative hearings the past few weeks. The lawmakers decided some months ago to tackle a few major problems, generally ones brought to their attention while campaigning and they created special study committees to find out what was going wrong and why. Some of these committees are generating serious ef- forts—meeting frequently, holding hearings, engaging consultants, and doing considerable research on their own. The chairmen have lined up experts in the various fields under study to outline the basics and to explain the nuances to committee members, many of whom have had little or no previous experience in the study areas. Some topics are essentially in-house concerns, like ’ salaries for state officials and employes. The average consumer isn't directly affected by such \"questions, although he’s interested since it’s his tax dol- lar paying the bill. There are other committees, however, digging into such juicy items as interest rates, utility regulation and milk pricing. Now those gems ought to whip up loads of consumer ‘sentiment . They ought to, but it’s been a well-kept secret in the legislative hearings if they have. The lawmakers obviously have heard from the home front from time to time on these issues, based on their comments during meetings and on the fact that these subjects have been selected for scrutiny. But during formal proceedings it's the regulated and regulator who stand up to be counted. Or other special interests which at times can be translated to read ves- ted interests. For example, committee investigating the dairy com- mission has hosted two day-long hearings where com- mission members, dairy farmers and milk processors have offered thelr view. — view, singular. e_ cons pared. It wasn’t that the committee members didn’t want to hear from more of the people who pay for the milk priced by the dairy commission. They simply couldn’t find any more. That one consumer, testifying on behalf of some three million folks who at least periodically chug a glass of . milk, was asked several times what group or organiza- tion she represents. No group, she said, because there isn’t one. The members were obviously concerned about how to beat the bushes and round up some consumers, but as of last week they still hadn’t figured it out. One thing they and others have tried is the Governor's Office of Consumer Protection and its head honcho, Mrs. Annie Laurie Gunter. The lawmakers were somewhat surprised, however, ~ to hear the state's consumer protection officer say she isn't exactly a consumer advocate. She is not, in fact, such an advocate, and she isn’t sup- posed to be. Her office was set up to handle specific com- plaints about consumers getting ripped off through shady business dealings, not to be the voice of the “‘little people’’ so often the topic of concern in legislative chambers. Moreover, Mrs. Gunter has said on several occasions that her aim isn’t only to protect the consumer, but to protect the honest businesman as well. And the silent voice of the consumer is noticed in places other than the legislature, The dairy commission under scrutiny is one. The woman, Mrs. Pat McDaniel, who testified before the committee was there by virtue of her earlier appear- ances at dairy commission hearings, Mrs. McDaniel was such a rarity that she made big news, thus came to the attention of the committee mem: bers. She told them she was one of the few, perhaps the only, non-industry persons ever to show up at a dairy hearing. , The committee was moderately surprised. Another legislative committee taken aback by lack of consumer representation before state regulatory agencies is the group studying utilities and the Public Service Commission, That committee has learned the utilities have mas- sive staffs and outside experts to present their cases to the PSC, while the public has had a couple lawyers ap- pointed by the governor as opponents, They are experts in their own right, but it’s like pitting a pocket calculator against an IBM computer. What the utility committee has discussed is creating a new consumer agency such as those in other states that do butt in on various hearings, regulatory proceedings and any other government decision-making processes. That could be a rough one to pull off, however, espe- cially in this year of the budget pinch. Whether it would be politically feasible here also is in question, consid- ering Alabama is the state whose junior senator has killed a similar proposal on the national level. Perhaps they'll set up a committee to study it. March 2, 1975 \f"

Although a committee o the Alabama House ap proved both bills related t unemployment syster changes on the second day c a special legislative sessio Tuesday, passage cam amidst numerous protests. The bills approved are th ~ ? ones for which Gov. Georg C. Wallace called this ses- sion, and would raise the maximum Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits from the current $75 to $90 weekly. The legislation also would increase the amounts paid into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, from which benefits are paid. The tax on employers would rise from 2.6 per cent to 3.6 per cent on the first $4,200 of employes’ salaries. And the tax on employes, which has not been paid for the past three years, would be reinstituted at the rate of one-half of 1 per cent on the first $4,200 of earnings. Late Tuesday afternoon, however, the administration reportedly was changing its ‘‘There’s a question in my mind whether somebody get- ting the maximum should be increased while somebody drawing less doesn’t get any- thing,’’ said State Rep. G.J. ‘‘Dutch’’ Higginbotham of Opelika. After learning that about 30,000 of the 100,000 persons now drawing UC benefits would be affected, State “Rep. Cecil Wyatt of Ramer DEWEY WHITE JR. “REP. package to also raise ben- efits for those receiving the least in unemployment pay- ments. Under the original propos- al, only those earning more than $150 a week at the time they became unemployed would have been affected by the benefits change. As that became apparent to members of the. House State Administration Com- mittee, there was much con- cern over not aiding those who need help the most—those at the lower @nd of the economic scale. _.» Emery Kimbrough of the State Industrial Relatigns Department said there likely would be a_ ‘‘complete over- haul’’ of the UC system pro- posed in the regular legisla- tive session this summer, in response to criticism over the current plan. also questioned the idea of taxing all workers, even the _ poor, to give more benefits to those who would be consid- ered ‘‘rich'' by some stan- dards. “Is this really a serious problem or is this a political bill designed to help the im- age of state?'’ Wyatt asked. He was assured the problem is serious. Vernon Rep. Allen McNees also stated it would be ‘‘pretty hard for me to go back and tell my people’’ only 10 per cent of the unem- ployed in his district will be helped, while all the em- ployed will be taxed. Further dissatisfaction with the bills and the special session in general was evi- denced in the House cham- ber later, during an abortive move to extend the session beyond the minimum five days needed to pass a bill. ep. Dewey White of Maduntain Brook first pro- posed that the House fidt méet Wednesday, but the measure was defeated by: ‘a vote of 59 to 38. Several House members complained they still had not been provided copies of the March 5, z «ci administration's UC bills, a problem. House leaders at- tributed to a broken copying machine, and the lawmak- ers unsuccessfully asked for more time to study the legis- lation. When the House recon- venes. Wednesday morning, there are expected to be some amendments offered regardless of what adminis- tration leaders propose. Sources did indicate, how- ever, that the governor’s spokesmen will propose higher payments to those at the bottom of the UC scale, and possibly to-increase the tax more than originally planned. 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "‘Another Special Session Set; Jobless Aid Bill Clears House Senate Receives Bond Issue Bill By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer The Alabama House passed the governor’s revised bills to raise unemployment compensation (UC) ben- le on taxes Wednesday, but not without a prolonged :§ e. The lower chamber also sent to the Senate bills au- thorizing a $45 million bond issue to improve the state docks system. Serious complaints, lodged on the first two days of the current special session, that the governor’s UC package failed to help those now getting the least were partially heeded by the administration. A small number of House members remained un- happy with the revision to expand better payments across the board, but their battle to further change the legislation was fruitless. The original bill only raised the maximum UC ben- efits from the current §75 to $90 a week. The administration amendment added an average 8 per cent increase to all steps in the UC scale. For example, most of those now receiving $15 weekly © payments would get §17 under the plan, while those at the $75 dollar level would receive $81. Another provision of the current UC law, however, would prevent those at the bottom of the scale from re- ceiving any more in total benefits than they now get. Their weekly payments would increase, but they would be eligible for the benefits for a shorter period of time. The package, at present unemployment rates, would increase by $22 million a year the amount paid from the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund. The second UC bill passed Wednesday would help replenish that loss by increasing the tax employers pay into the fund and by reinstituting the tax on employes, who have not felt the payroll deduction tax for three. Employers, who now hand over 2.7 per cent of the first, $4,200 of their employes salaries, would be taxed a max- imum 3.6 per cent. Employes would lose half of 1 per “cent of the first $4,200 of their earnings. The maximum any employe will be taxed is $21 a year. The taxes would take effect Oct. 1, but whether they would completely finance the increased benefits, or for how long, remains in question. Much depends on how the unemployment rate fluctuates. . Depsite the administration's capitulation in spread- ing the increased benefits, a handful of lawmakers still actively opposed the measure. Tuscaloosa Rep. Ed Robertson made numerous un- successful attempts to delay action till another day, saying the legislature needs more time ‘“‘to get the bugs out of this bill.” “Tt we pass this bill with this amendment,” he said, ‘I want you to go back home and explain to your policemen ... and city workers , . . and garbage men that they earn less than those drawing unemployment.” Lauderdale Rep. Robert Hill pointed out that those earning $7,000 or less at the time they became unem- ployed would not receive a greater total in benefits, due to a provision that the unemployed may not receive total payments higher than one-third of the previous annual salary. But more than two hours of debate, unusual for the House, ultimately resulted in both bills being passed by large majorities with only the administration's amend- ment, The docks bond issue had clearer sailing, hampered only by an unsuccessful attempt by Rep. Roger Killian of Fort Payne to add legislators to the issuing authority. The bill authorizing a constitutional amendment ref- erendum on the bond issue passed 98 to 0, as did the com- panion enabling legislation. A two-thirds vote is needed, since Gov. George C. Wal- lace did not place the bond issue in the call of the session. He did ask that it be considered in a message to the legis- ature, A $115 million bond issue for the same purpose passed the House in 1973, but was stalled in the Senate. March 6, 1975 \f"

Callahan of Mobile, R. Leigh Pegues of Marion, and Hugh Merrill of Annis- ton. It was Sen. Bank who of- fered the bill to eliminate most provisions of the ethics act, but later agreed to drop the effort in favor of this study committee after Sen. Waldrop launched a one- man _ filibuster.

Lawmakers have been highly critical of the way the Alabama Commission on Higher Education operates generally expressing feel- ings the commission should be strengthened or abo- lished.

        "ocr_text": "Wallace Delays Opening Or Srd Special Session By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Gov. George C. Wallace has agreed to delay the start of the third special session this year till next Tuesday, when he will present a package of six or seven bills deal- ing with utility regulation. The one-day postponement came after legislators re- quested the session not begin on Monday, as originally anounced, to give them at least an additional day to tend to business at home. The lawmakers have been at the Capitol for two ses- sions of five days each since January, plus for numerous interim committee meetings, A spokesman for Wallace said the governor has not determined the hour when the next session will begin, but that it likely will start in the evening, That also would give legislators almost another whole business day at home, and would not detract from the flow of legislative activity since little more than in- troduction , of bills can be accomplished on the first day ’ of a Session. If approved by Wallace this week, the package of util ty legislation could be made public prior to the start of the session, the spokesman said, adding there will be six or seven measures presented to the legislature for con: sideration, Wallace also is “considering” placing adoption of the education budget in the call of the session, a request made by the legislature last week, He could announce a decision on Thursday, when he addresses the annual convention of the Alabama Etu- cation Association in Birmingham, Late last week sources indicated the governor was strongly opposed to including education matters in this session, mainly because wrangling over the education budget could delay action on his utility legislation, Also, if the education question were postponed till lat er this spring or summer, budget experts would have a better idea of national economic trends as they effect state revenues available to fund education, Educators, however, want their budget approved as soon as possible, to give them maximum time to plan for the coming school year, One proposal making: the rounds is interrupting the regular session that begins in May for a special session on education, That happened in 1973, when the regular session was recessed the first day for a special one dealing ex- clusively with reapportionment, The education budget could be taken up in the coming special session even if Wallace refuses to place it in his call, but any bills notin the call need a two-thirds vote to win passage. The session starting Tuesday also likely will be in- lerrupted for a day by the YMCA Youth Legislature, which traditionally holds mock sessions in the cham bers, Plans have called for the young people to take over the legislative halls on Friday and Saturday, That would leave three days of legislative action next week, which is not sufficient time to pass a bill into law, Some lawmakers are hoping for a similarly limited schedule the following few weeks, to allow time for budget hearings and other committee work that is to be completed by the May regular session, The budget hearings resume Tuesday and include presentations from the attorney general, courts of crim- inal and civil appeals, departments of conservation and banking, and commissions on aging and physical fit: ness, On Wednesday morning those hearings continue, and an interim committee studying the ethics law also will hold a public hearing. That group is to recommend changes in the controversial law that has prompted half a dozen law suits and numerous protests from affected March 11, 1975 \f"

        "ocr_text": "Too Small Staff Is By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Disputing charges they are incompetent and biased toward utilities, Public Serv- ice Commission staff mem- bers said Thursday any in- ability to do the job stems from being understaffed. The directors of various PSC divisions made their- statements before a _ legisla- tive study committee, where PSC member Jim Zeigler . earlier leveled the charges against them. Most of the top staff mem- bers displayed a lukewarm attitude toward committee suggestions that a ‘‘super- administrator’’ might facil- itate PSC work, by serving as a buffer between the three commissioners and the staff. *‘Anybody knows it’s eas- ier to work for one boss than for three,’’ said PSC attor- ney-examiner Carl Evans. But Evans warned the staff shouldn’t be isolated from the commission and said the success of such an ‘administrator would hinge on the person selected for the job. Evans and others also de- nied allegations by Commis- sioner Zeigler that the staff has been uncooperative with him, has shown in- competence and has dis- played bias in favor of the utilities regulated by the PSC. Anyone making such accu- sations, Evans said, is ‘‘bad- Mefense ly misinformed or deliber- ately ae eee to mislead the people of this state.’’ Evans and James B. Wil- liams, director of the PSC utilities division, both said in response to questions that no commissioner has counter- manded an order issued to the staff by another commis- sioner. Williams emphasized his division especially is under- staffed. That particularly has been a problem in recent months, he said, since the commissioners have placed requests for various studies and research work in con- nection with a current in- vestigation of Alabama Pow- er Co. If staff members appear uncooperative, Williams said, ‘‘it’s because there aren’t enough hours in the day’’ to do all the work re- quested. The division chiefs also said that dealing with three commissioners, rather than just one administrator, is not an insurmountable problem, although regular, informal meetings between the com- mission and staff might im- prove conditions. Robert A. Jones, trans- portation rate supervisor, suggested public criticism of the PSC and its staff is so widespread because con- sumers are reminded of ris- ing costs-every month through their utility bills.

        "ocr_text": "Wallace to Open “Hrslaty”? Session By MARCIA KUNSTEL Advertiser Staff Writer Criticism that Gov. George C. Wallace's proposed utility tegislation would force a ‘‘no-growth” policy on Alabama and bankrupt utilities may be answered Tues- day, when the governor addresses a joint legislative session to urge passage of his bills, Wallace, whose message will be carried live on tele- vision throughout the state at 6:30 p.m., already told educators last week in Birmingham he is not anti-utili- ty, but hopes to reach a middle ground that will allow utilities sufficient revenue to survive, while giving con- sumers the same opportunity. His address comes shortly after the start of the third special legislative session since late January, a session called by Wallace specifically to tackle complex utility questions. A spokesman said Wallace spent much of Monday working on his talk to the lawmakers, but would reveal no specifics of the governor's message. Wallace’s mainstay in this session likely will be a spe- cial legislative committee that has been studying the rising utility rate problem for about two months and has generally endorsed the eight bills proposed by the gov- ernor for enactment this session. It was that committee which heard dire predictions late last week from Alabama Power Co. officials who said the proposed bills will ruin utilities if approved, They also said utility expansion will be so limited un- der this legislation that Alabama will become a ‘‘no- growth” state with no services for new industrial and residential growth. Several other bills dealing with utility regulation are expected to be introduced by individual legislators Tuesday, such as a measure to exempt low income fam- ilies from paying utility deposits when initiating serv- ice. A mass of unrelated legislation also is expected, rang- ing from local bills to one rewriting the 1973 ethics law. The special legislative committee working on ethics revision meets Tuesday to finalize its proposal, as does the utility study committee. Also prior to the session Tuesday, the Joint Interim Committee on Finance and Taxation will continue budg- et hearings, receiving presentations from the finance department, governor's office, and consumer protec- tion office. Of the governor's proposed legislation, the bill caus- ing most iliti Id_prohibit the automat- ic fuel cost pass-on system. Now utilities are permitted to charge consumers any additional costs they must pay for fuel, That includes coal to fire electric generating plants and the natural gas purchased for resale to Alabama customers, Utility officials say they would be allowed no imme- diate, additional revenue to cover fluctuating fuel costs, but would be required to win approval first from the Public Service Commission in regular rate proceed- ings. Those can last as long as six months. Under the proposed bill, fuel charges would be frozen as of the date of passage, although any reduced fuel costs would be passed to consumers, No higher fuel costs would be charged without PSC permission, The utilities object to most of the eight bills saying generally they would have a devastating effect on fi- naneing, scaring away potential investors and bond purchasers, Other bills in the governor's package would require utilities to refund any revenue collected under rates found excessive in a court appeal, would send appeals of PSC decisions directly to the Alabama Supreme Court instead of circuit court, and would prohibit small tele- phone companies from automatically passing to their customers any increased charges to them for service supplied by South Central Bell. Another major bill would change the statutory rate base to elimiriate the practice of including in the base es- timates of contruction costs for the coming year. The same bill would remove from the base any cost of land purchases, unless the utility already had approval to construct a new facility on that property. The governor's legislation also would establish a “People’s Utility Counsel’ to argue, on behalf of con- sumers and at state expense, in any PSC or court cases involving utility rates and services. Another measure would make a PSC decision rever- sible on appeal if the decision is found to be “arbitrary, capricious or inconsistent’ with earlier orders, Also, utilities would be required to notify all property- owners in an area where a new plant is planned prior to receiving PSC approval to build the plant.

Committee Chairman George McMillan of Birming- ham then asked committee members to draw up a list of qualified blacks in their districts who might be willing to serve, which will be transmitted to Wallace with a letter The committee studying criminal justice problems explaining their recommendation. McMillan and others agreed with Cooper that black administrators might be better able to understand the problems and to communicate with the majority of black prisoners, The terms of two board members have expired, and at least one reportedly has indicated he does not wish reap- pointment. ' The committee also turned its attention again to tem- porary measures for relieving overcrowding in state prisons, eliminating an earlier suggestion to expand and improve old road camps, Sen. Maston Mims of Uriah was directed to further ex- plore the possibility of selling timber on presently- owned prison land, and using the proceeds to build brick or concrete block lodging for minimum security prison- ers, The plan already has been proposed to the corrections department, with a committee request for comment on its feasibility, Committee members expressed some displeasure with the department's response, which McMillan said “didn’t tell me anything.” Preliminary estimates for constructing the concrete block quarters to house at least 400 inmates have ranged up to $5 million, Cooper voted against further study of the plan, saying this is “‘the ideal time to take some progressive steps to- ward work-release or other rehabilitation programs,” McMillan emphasized the committee will address these areas as its work continues, but said some imme- diate action must be taken to resolve the overcrowding problem that has resulted in prisoners sleeping on floors and in prison hallways, March 20, 1975 \f"
